      <P>The world economy in general is entering into a period of recession.  This creates considerable difficulties for us, but it is ridiculous to use words like catastrophic and phrases of that sort which in this context are meaningless.  The position is, as I have outlined from time to time, that the economic outlook is difficult but we intend to take the necessary measures to deal with the situation.  As I already said, there will be a full Adjournment Debate shortly and the House can avail of that occasion to deal with the situation in whatever way it wishes.</P>

      <Col N="1777" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 28a:</P>
    <P>In page 27, before section 23, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>23.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;farming&rdquo; has the same meaning as in Chapter II of Part I of the Finance Act, 1974;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;specific machinery or plant&rdquo; means machinery or plant in use or intended for use for the purposes of a trade of farming but not including fixed machinery and fixed plant designed to be used exclusively in a farm building and which is in use or is intended to be used in such a building;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;specified provisions&rdquo; means section 251 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967 and section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(2)  In determining what capital allowances fall to be made to a person for any chargeable period commencing on or after the 6th day of April, 1980, in taxing a trade of farming&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in a case where the aggregate of the capital allowances which would fall to be so made to the person for the chargeable period if the specified provisions did not apply or have effect for that chargeable period in relation to specified machinery or plant, or the expenditure on the provision thereof, amounts to or exceeds 30 per cent of the amount of the profits or gains from farming on which the person is chargeable to tax for that chargeable period, the said specified provisions shall not apply or have effect in the case of that person for that chargeable period in relation to specified machinery or plant, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case the amount or the aggregate amount of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any capital allowance or <Col N="1778" /> allowances given under any of the specified provisions, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  any amount or amounts by which any capital allowance or allowances may be increased under any of the specified provisions, shall be limited to the maximum amount which will secure that the aggregate of the capital allowances falling to be made to the person for the chargeable period in taxing the trade of farming shall not exceed 30 per cent of the profits or gains from farming on which the person is chargeable to tax for the chargeable period.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had concluded all I wanted to say for the moment.  There is only one other factor I would like to add in relation to the scheme of allowances.  Opposition Deputies queried a statement that was made by the Government last year.  I indicated to them what that statement involved.  I will recap at this point. It provided for a reduction of the capital allowances across a range of activities in the farming area, in the first instance on farm works and development, farm buildings and farm plant and machinery. That was the scheme as announced last year to be implemented this year.  In the event the modifications on that scheme culminating in what I have announced now in this amendment yesterday are very significant.  In my budget statement I indicated that I did not intend to proceed with the restrictions on capital allowances for farm buildings or for farm development works generally in the interests of promoting the development of agriculture to the maximum extent. Deputies will know now the remaining restriction relating to farm plant and machinery and, as a consequence of the discussions which I have had with leaders of farm organisations, I have decided also in respect of that remaining restriction to exclude from that farm plant and machinery which is fixed in farm buildings.  It might be, as I indicated, that freedom of manoeuvre in <Col N="1779" /> this area is limited by not just the attitude of farmers but the attitude of others towards farm taxation.  The House should be aware of that.</P>
      <P>I am trying to steer a middle course in the interests of equity between the various sectors and at the same time to respond to the development potential of farmers.  I think that what I have done here strikes that balance, and the revenue implications of this in a full year, as distinct from what would have been available to the revenue had the original package as announced been proceeded with this year, will be a reduction of something of the order of £2.5 million.  I mention this particularly to those Deputies&mdash;there were some and there is no point in personalising this too much either in respect of me or of Deputies on the other side&mdash;who chose to say that I show no sensitivity to the farm sector and that this Government are not concerned, although whether those Deputies believe that is another matter.  The discussions that we have had culminating in this amendment illustrate the understanding and agreement that we have reached with the farmers in what is a difficult time in which one has to balance and be seen to balance the revenue needs also, as between the various sectors.  I will, as I have indicated, be introducing another amendment later in respect of stock relief which will reduce the incidence of tax on crops by anything up to about £2.5 million per year.  That is the measure of the importance that I attach to agricultural development, and I hope it will be seen as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 27, before section 24, to insert the following section&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;24.&mdash;As respects expenditure incurred on or after the 6th day of April, 1980, section 22 (inserted by the Corporation Tax Act, 1976) of the Finance Act, 1974, is hereby amended <Col N="1783" /> by the substitution for subsection (2) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(2)  Where a person to whom this section applies incurs, for the purpose of a trade of farming land occupied by him, any capital expenditure on the construction of farmhouses, farm buildings, cottages, fences or other works, there shall be made to him during a writing-down period of ten years beginning with the chargeable period related to that expenditure, writing down allowances (in this section referred to as &ldquo;&lsquo;farm buildings allowances&rsquo;&rdquo;) in respect of that expenditure and such allowances shall be made in taxing the trade:</P>
    <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the farm buildings allowance to be granted for any chargeable period shall, subject to paragraph (b), be increased by such amount as is specified by the person to whom the allowance is to be made in making his claim for the allowance and, in relation to a case in which this proviso has had effect, any reference in the Tax Acts to a farm buildings allowance made under this section shall be construed as a reference to that allowance as increased under this proviso, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the maximum farm buildings allowance to be made for any chargeable period shall not exceed three-tenths of the capital expenditure to which the said farm buildings allowance relates.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to revise the capital allowance grant in respect of farm buildings. At present the available allowances comprise, first, an initial allowance of 20 per cent of expenditure and, second, and an annual allowance of 10 per cent of the expenditure. <Col N="1784" /> On that basis the cost of a farm building may be written off over a period of eight years, that is, 30 per cent for the first year plus 10 per cent per annum thereafter.  As a result of this proposed amendment, which again will be welcomed by the farm sector, persons engaged in farming will now be able to claim in any year, in addition to the basic allowance of 10 per cent, an additional amount up to a total of 30 per cent of the cost of a farm building.  In effect it means that the cost of a farm building may now be written off after four years or, at the farmer's discretion, over a period of up to ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a query about this amendment.  I notice that it refers to the construction of farmhouses, farm buildings, cottages, fences or other works.  My understanding is that under section 14 of the 1977 Finance Act the cost of fences could be written off as to 100 per cent in the first year.  Therefore it would appear that this section is not giving something but is restricting something, so far as fencing is concerned, if it will now be possible to write off only 40 per cent of the cost of fencing in the first year and the remainder at a rate of 10 per cent a year until the full 100 per cent is exhausted. I would have thought that this is not the Minister's intention.  Perhaps he could explain how this has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing provisions a farmer, if he wishes, can claim the initial allowance in the first year but he has to claim the full 20 per cent in addition to the basic 10 per cent. This could mean in fact the non-use of his personal allowance if the 30 per cent allowance reduced his farm profits sufficiently. Under the new provision he would be entitled to claim any amount specified by him over the 10 per cent basic allowance, subject to a maximum of 30 per cent, so that he will now be able to claim in any year a total of 15 per cent, 20 per cent, 25 per cent or 30 per cent, as it suits him, until the full cost is written off.  Therefore, in effect, it is giving greater flexibility to the farmer <Col N="1785" /> over a period as to how he would write off his costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking specifically about fencing and not about the general issue.  Perhaps I misunderstand it, but to the best of my knowledge free depreciation could be claimed for capital expenditure after 5 April 1977 under section 14 of the 1977 Act on fences, roadways, holding yards, drains or land reclamation. Now we have a situation where fences are being brought in under this section and, as I understand it, this is not giving full free depreciation but only allowing a claim of 40 per cent in the first year <i>in toto.</i>  That would appear therefore, in the case of fences specifically, to be a retreat from the previous more generous provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The original section concerns fences, roadways, holding yards, drains and land reclamation.  Roadways, holding yards, drains and land reclamation are not contained here in this at all. It is all about buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the 1977 Act, which is the one that Deputy has been referring to, still applies. There is no limitation here in respect of the application of the 1977 Act.  What is being done here is in relation to the initial allowances and the annual allowances which, apart from the provisions of the 1977 Act, could up to this time be written off over a period of eight years and now, as I have indicated, these can be written off after four years. But it does not affect the application of the section the Deputy refers to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding was that in the case of fences it was possible <Col N="1786" /> up to now to write off the cost in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said, however, that the material contained in the section was material the cost of which could hitherto only be written off over eight years but he is admitting in the case of fences alone that it was possible to write off the cost in one year.  So what is the point of giving a concession in relation to fences when the concession already provided is more generous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in respect of farm buildings.  The purpose of this one is to revise the capital allowances in respect of farm buildings.  I indicated what these allowances are and how they are applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a distinction between fences around buildings and fences around fields?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am told that the 1974 Act provides the structure of the allowances which are now being increased. The 1977 Act then allows, in relation to fences, the specification of whatever additional amount is required and we are retaining the structure of the 1974 Act.  But what we are doing here is to ensure that what the 1977 Act provides is being extended in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1977 Act gave free depreciation.  I am a bit at sea.  I am not an accountant and I am not involved in this, so perhaps I may be wasting time. But until we all understand exactly what we are talking about, it is better not to pass on.  My understanding of free depreciation is that one is entitled to claim the full amount of the expenditure in the first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the 1977 Act gave complete free depreciation in respect of fencing, roadways, holding yards, drains or land <Col N="1787" /> reclamation.  The Minister is now bringing in a new section which I understand changes the previous position which applied to farm buildings where one could write off their cost not over one year but over eight years and he is bringing that down now to five years.  What I am worried about is that by including fences in this section one is going to apply a more restrictive regime to fences than applied up to this under the 1977 Act where they were covered by free depreciation.  Obviously, the most recent piece of legislation is the one that is effective.  The 1980 Bill will supersede the 1977 Bill.  The point I am raising has been drawn to my attention by people who are more expert than I am in this area, people who are concerned with tax matters, particularly on behalf of the farming community.  These people were alarmed at the inclusion of the word &ldquo;fences&rdquo; here.  They did not understand it.  In these circumstances, the Minister should explain a little more what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this is in the 1974 provisions but if we turn to section 14 of the Finance Act 1977, we find the provision that the allowance to be granted for the chargeable period related to the expenditure or any subsequent chargeable period shall be increased by such amount as is specified by the person to whom the allowance is to be made. Therefore, the 1977 Act provides for an increase in the allowances specified in the 1974 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But for an indefinite increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is equivalent to free depreciation, to bringing the figure up to 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the 1974 Act makes reference to the basic, we must ensure in order to provide for these increases now, that fences are included <Col N="1788" /> also.  However, I may be able to explain this more satisfactorily on Report Stage and after I have had time to consider it in more detail, but I can assure the Deputy that there is no question of a reduction of the provision in respect of fencing in particular or of anything else, for that matter.  The amendment is solely to provide for a revision of the allowances in respect of farm buildings and I am informed that it is necessary to include in this the 1974 provisions.</P>

      <P>Although not understanding what the Minister has said and I am not sure that even he understands what he has said, I am prepared to accept his explanation as being sufficient to get us through this stage of the Bill.  However, I will be seeking to raise the matter on Report Stage but in the meantime I will be discussing it with the people who raised it with me in order to ascertain whether the Minister's explanation satisfies them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30.</P>
      <P>In page 27, before section 24, to insert the following section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;25.&mdash;(1)  Where, in computing profits from the trade of farming, a deduction allowed by virtue of section 12 of the Finance Act, 1976, has effect for the year 1980-81&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  section 31 (4) (a) of the Finance Act, 1975 (as applied by section 12 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1976) shall apply and have effect as if the reference to 20 per cent were a reference to 10 per cent, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the said section 12 shall have effect as if subsection (2) (c) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1979) had not been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where a deduction falls to be made under section 31A (2) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1976) of the <Col N="1789" /> Finance Act, 1975, in relation to the trade of farming, the said section 31A shall have effect as respects any accounting period which ends on or after the 6th day of April, 1979, as if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in subsection (4) (a) the reference to 20 per cent were a reference to 10 per cent, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  paragraph (iii) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1979) of the proviso to the said subsection (4) (a) had not been enacted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to stock reliefs. It is one of the easements designed to provide an incentive for farmers.  The decision to make this amendment was made following discussions and consultations with the farming community.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, stock relief is a temporary relief that is available to manufacturing and construction industries as well as to the agricultural industry.  It is subject to certain restrictions.  It applies to increases in stock values which exceed 20 per cent of the profits.  In the 1979 Finance Act provision was made for the continuation of the relief for another year but the amount of relief to be granted was restricted to 75 per cent of the amount which otherwise would have applied.</P>
    <P>Section 45 of this Bill provides for the continuation of the relief for a further year, subject to existing restrictions but because of what the Government recognise as being the special need to increase livestock numbers, we decided to modify these restrictions further so as to provide the necessary incentive in this regard.  Accordingly, stock relief, in so far as it relates to the trade of farming, will operate at the rate of 100 per cent instead of 75 per cent and will apply to increases in stock values which exceed 10 per cent of the profits instead of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this measure will be welcomed by farmers and that it will encourage them to increase livestock numbers.  I have given some indication already of the cost of adjustments generally in this area.  Deputies will appreciate <Col N="1790" /> that this is a delicate area.  The cost in this case would probably not exceed £500,000 in a full year but it is fair to say that depending on the extent to which farmers will increase their herds, the cost could be higher.  I am sure that the amendment will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this amendment but we regard it as an indication of a great contradiction between what the Government are doing here and what they did in a previous amendment. They are now attempting to treat farmers even better in this regard than industry is being treated.  In this connection when we reach section 48 in which there is provision for a restriction to 75 per cent in respect of the allowance available to industry, I shall be moving an amendment to increase the figure to 100 per cent.  I am not objecting to what the Government are doing here in relation to farmers.  The principle behind the amendment is correct but why did the same principle not apply in relation to the amendment on which we voted earlier today and which was ably defended last evening by Deputy Crinion, much against the interest of his peers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a contradiction in the attitude of the Government in respect of two instances relating to the one body of people.  I find this extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the amendment.  However, there are a couple of points I should like to raise in regard to it.  I understand that under this provision farmers will not have to pay any income tax on what is not an income, namely, on the increase in the value of their stocks, and that whatever tax will fall to be paid will be paid when stocks are sold.  Absence of such relief up to now has operated as a disencentive particularly to dairying.  This is because of there not being any intention on the part <Col N="1791" /> of dairy farmers to sell valuable stocks.  I understand that there is a problem in regard to this provision in that if one claims stock relief during two or three years and then sells the animals concerned, tax would have to be paid in one lot on the increased value to the extent that it would have been paid during two or three years if the stock relief had not been claimed.</P>
      <P>That would appear to be fair enough where the decision to claim stock relief and the subsequent decision to sell were voluntary decisions but a particular case arises in farming as a result of disease eradication where farmers might because of an outbreak of, say, brucellosis on the farm, be forced to sell their stock all at once, having claimed stock relief.  If, on top of being put out of business&mdash;which would be the case if they were dairymen&mdash;they had to pay a lot of back tax in the form of tax on stock value increases which they had not paid because of having claimed stock relief in good faith, feeling that they would never have had to sell out the herd, this would add to their problems at a time when they had acute problems because of having to sell out in the first place.  I am not sure that the Minister has met that case.</P>
      <P>Another point being made here is that in most cases, I am led to believe, there is a terminal date at the end of which the stock relief claimed cannot be clawed back.  In most countries the stock relief claimed cannot be clawed back after six years.  As I understand it, in this provision there is no such time limit on clawback for the Revenue Commissioners. Has the Minister received representations about having a terminal date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is particularly welcome to dairy farmers who are increasing in numbers, particularly young farmers.  It will be a good incentive to young dairy farmers building up their herds and to anyone building up stock numbers.  A few farmers, particularly in our county, still do summer grazing, buying cattle in before 31 March not having wintered them.  They <Col N="1792" /> get stock relief, as well, which is welcome.  We must get higher productivity and that usually means higher cattle numbers.  This section will help to encourage farmers to go ahead with confidence and increase their cattle numbers. This increase in stock is essential now, because we are obtaining only normal increases in price from Brussels and no longer can rely, as we did over the last six or seven years, on the green £. That day is over.  Increased production is the only way that farmers can improve their livelihood from the land.  It is that confidence which is rather difficult to build up that we must put back into farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in saying that I am glad that the Minister modified this section. In the Second Reading speech it was pointed out to the Minister that this scheme as regards stock relief could not be operated as it was presented to the Dáil in the budget speech.</P>
      <P>Under the notional system, people had a way of avoiding stock appreciation but now that this system has been removed, everyone will come into the stock appreciation tax situation.  This is not completely free appreciation.  You modified the situation, Minister, but did practically nothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the question of incentives.  I ask him to spell out clearly to this House what exactly the position is.  In a situation where a farmer with 20 cows at the beginning of <Col N="1793" /> the year 1980 decides at the end of that year, to build up his herd to 40 cows, the Revenue Commissioners will look for stock appreciation of approximately £10,000, or £500 per cow.  What will be the tax liability on that £10,000 of appreciation in value?</P>
      <P>I can foresee another difficulty.  Take an example of a person with a large herd of cows.  At the beginning of his tax year, his inventory shows ten to 15 cows and over a period of years he has built that herd up to, perhaps, 60 cows.  If it happens that he wishes to change his system of farming, has he built up a tax liability when he goes to sell those cows in the public market, the herd of 45, 50 or 60 cows he has built up?  Has he also built up a tax liability as far as stock relief is concerned?  These are important matters to which people want to know the answer.</P>
      <P>Will the same situation apply to a widow whose husband has built up his herd from, perhaps, ten to 70 cows? Something might happen the husband and the widow may be forced to sell the cows.  Has her husband built up a tax liability over that period of years as far as stock relief is concerned?  Those things should be spelled out clearly.  The Minister has modified the scheme, as he was forced to, because it could not be operated.  He had no option.  Thanks, Minister.</P>

      <P>It might be more a question for Deputy D'Arcy to consider whom he is reaching and whom he is persuading.  Perhaps he is persuading somebody.  Some people like to get things off their chests and that is the way things are going to be.</P>
      <P>I wish to make some general comments on some other aspects.  Where one makes a concession it is always open to anybody to say &ldquo;Ah, yes, you have made a concession here, but that is in contrast with the concession you did not make on some other matters.&rdquo; or &ldquo;you have made a concession, but how far exactly does this concession extend?  Can you tell us precisely how far it extends and why it does not extend further in your proposal?&rdquo;  These are positions that can be taken up on any concession made.  That is the position taken up now by Deputy Barry.  He says I have made a concession here but contrasts that with what I have not done in the other area.  I am treating agriculture in this instance at least as well as I am treating industry. He says it is the other way round as regards farm allowances, but that debate is over.</P>
      <P>With respect to the allowances, it is already on the record that the farm industry is not being treated in a disadvantaged way by comparison with industry generally&mdash;far from it.  In fact, the evidence is the other way around, but we cannot go back over that debate.</P>

    <P>It would be a help to recognise, and this will come up later on, that where one tries to introduce provisions which are appropriate to a particular sector&mdash;and this is a particular sector, as has been recognised by the Opposition&mdash;it surely cannot be criticised on the basis that it was not being treated the same as everthing else, whatever that might mean.  Everything else is not the same as farming.  That is the important thing.  If it were, if the manufacturing process was exactly the same as the farming process we would not have any distinctions at all.  But, of course, they are not the same and there is no point in suggesting they are.  Therefore, in each case one must introduce appropriate incentives, regulations, <Col N="1795" /> or whatever to match the potential in each area, allowing always for endeavouring to apply generally the same principles.  I am not sympathetic to the case that asks: &ldquo;Why do not you treat this, that and the other thing the same all along the line?&rdquo;  The short answer to that is that it is not possible to do so because they are not exactly the same.</P>
    <P>Having made those general comments perhaps I might reply now to a couple of precise points made, particularly by Deputy Bruton.  Here it may be evident that if one makes a precise point in relation to an important detail, as did Deputy Bruton in relation to disease eradication, I hope I can demonstrate that my ears are not closed because I have been having consultations in this area also.  This point has been made to me already.  In fact I intend to introduce an amendment on Report Stage providing that there will be no clawback of stock relief in cases where stock values have fallen as a result of disease. Deputy Bruton has properly argued this case.  In any event, it is one I recognise. When one examines the various exemptions I have been introducing here in relation to stock relief generally, in what I announced yesterday and again this morning, it is fairly evident that this is a very significant recognition not only of the potential of farming but also of cases where there are special problems, such as we now acknowledge in relation to the eradication of disease, and that I am taking account of them.  In my representative capacity as Deputy, and perhaps more importantly in my capacity as Minister, I have been made aware of this.  That is the reason I have been able to introduce these amendments and I shall, on Report Stage, introduce another to deal with the question of disease eradication.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy asked some precise questions when he was talking about increases in stock.  I think he mentioned a case of £10,000.  I should say that the increase in stock in such a case as a result of this amendment will not creat additional tax liability if the farmer decides <Col N="1796" /> to claim stock relief.  The disposal of the stock without effecting their replacement by the purchase of new livestock could result in profits liable to tax.  But the extent of the charge would depend on the amount received in comparison with the cost of the animals and on the extent to which stock relief has been claimed on the build-up of the herd.  The important thing is that the increase in the stocks here will not create any additional tax liability.  The disposal of stocks without their replacement by the purchase of new livestock could result in profits liable to tax, but even then that will be affected by the provision I have introduced this morning. That has existed in any event, but I have effected a very significant extension of the provision of stock relief.  I know, even in advance, because there have been consultations on this question, that this is in line with the request made to us by the farm leaders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in this.  When a farmer goes out of milk production because of the incidence of brucellosis he does not cease farming; immediately he goes out and buys bullocks and re-stocks his land.  In nine cases out of ten he will spend whatever money he has received for the cows and by way of grant from the Department in stocking his land.  He does not like having idle money and in that way there will be no build up&mdash;all of the money he has received for his cattle will be used for stocking the land.  However, he will lose in income because his income from milk production would have been higher than what he would receive for his cattle.  I have seen numerous cases of people who have had to go out of milk production because of brucellosis going immediately to the market place, the marts, and restocking their land with the money they have received for their cows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has been raised from time to time.  As Deputies will be aware, stock relief generally was introduced in 1975 as a temporary <Col N="1797" /> measure designed to meet the situation obtaining then when a number of manufacturing firms were experiencing liquidity problems.  Subsequently it was extended to farming.  I hope I do not over-simplify the issue when I say that what Deputy Bruton seems to be suggesting is that this temporary relief be converted into permanent relief after a certain number of years.  From time to time this proposal has been put forward by representatives of manufacturing industry. It has not been accepted.  It is fair to say also that the cut-off point in relation to livestock has been raised by the farm organisations.  I can say that discussions are proceeding on this matter between officials of my Department and the representatives of those organisations.</P>
      <P>Having said that, let me say quite openly that any relief of this nature, which defers the payment of tax, raises the question that it must be paid at some later date.  There is no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the trouble is that when the tax does come to be paid naturally people do not want to pay it at that point.  This raises the question of whether it is practical at any stage to introduce a provision providing for the deferment of tax.  I do not want to put words into Deputy Bruton's mouth because he is well capable of expressing his opinions, but one could maintain that what is being suggested here is that the stock relief provision ought not have been continued year after year because, as it continues, at some point later it raises the question of liability.  Consideration is being given to this problem to ascertain the best way of dealing with it.  There is no immediate, easy and final solution.  If one is dealing with deferment of tax, then, when it comes to be paid, the question of payment becomes the issue.  I am particularly anxious to maintain a balance between equity and the development needs of farmers, and these discussions are progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> I have indicated to the farm organisations that the unit of my Department concerned with economic planning are arranging to have regular consultations with the farm leaders informally, and formally, as the case may be.  It is fair to say that we can get hung up to a certain extent on the tax issues, so we have made considerable concessions here.  The real issues are the bigger ones of development programmes.  In all of these areas, and the one on which I am touching now, we will remain in regular consultation with them.  We shall not resolve all of the issues at any one time but the direction in which we are moving should be fairly clear from the concessions now being announced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to clear one point with the Minister.  I am not absolutely clear on the question of build-up of tax liabilities in a herd of cattle that can affect either a widow or a farmer who is diversifying his system of farming from milk to tillage when he sells his herd.  It seems that such a person could aggregate liability over a number of years.  Would the Minister elaborate on this important point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that the disposal of livestock without replacement by the purchase of new livestock, or a change to a new area of activity, could result in profits, which of course would be liable to tax.  The extent of the change would depend on the amount received by comparison with the amount spent.  Each case must be judged of its merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" /> In page 28, to delete lines 1 and 2 and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the individual does not have the use of that farm land and his wife&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  has the use of that farm land, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  is chargeable to tax under Case V of Schedule D on payments received in respect of the occupation of that farm land and those payments are not less than the payments which, having regard to values prevailing at the time, are not less than the payments which could have been obtained in respect of that land on the basis that negotiations for the payments had been at arm's length&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 24 as it appears in the Bill amends the provision in the 1974 Act under which farm land owned and occupied by the wife is deemed for tax purposes to be held by the farmer. Obviously section 24 of the Bill was intended to exclude a case where the wife owned and occupied the land.  However, it would bring in cases where the wife had let the land to a third party.  The amendment will ensure that land so let will not be added to the farmer's own farm land in judging whether he is over the threshold of the £40 valuation.  This applies only where there is a genuine case of letting by the wife.</P>
    <P>The other two amendments together make it clear that the deeming provisions in the 1974 Act operate for the purpose of the threshold only, for tax purposes. We want to ensure that joint ownership may not be used as a device unfairly to obtain marginal relief from income and resource taxes.  The section will now make the deeming provisions of the 1974 Act, section 17, conform with the Supreme Court decision on assessment of husbands and wives, because the section will exclude from the deeming provisions the two types of cases most likely to offend.  In each case the wife will be dealing with her own land to the exclusion of the husband.  It is important to <Col N="1800" /> retain the integrity of such provisions and to amend them only where appropriate and necessary.  The second and third amendments specify that the provisions in the section regarding joint ownership will be applied in deciding the threshold for income and resource taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want clarification on a number of points dealing with husband and wife liability in regard to the threshold for entering the tax system. First, what is the position where the husband and wife have separate titles to separate farms whose joint valuation is £70, each farm, with separate title, having a valuation of £35?  What is the situation when the husband is registered and rated for one of these farms and the wife for the other?</P>
      <P>Second, what is the situation, again in the case of a total valuation of £70, where the husband and wife are registered as joint owners of the total, as joint tenants without the survivorship principle?  Third, what is the situation where you have again a valuation of £70 and the husband and wife are registered jointly as tenants in common?  Fourth, taking again a total valuation of £70, what is the position where you have the husband as owner of one half of the farm and the other part is held in trust by the wife or the wife and the family?  What would be the position in relation to the tax threshold in all four cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate there could be a complete variation of arrangements in relation to any joint tenancy, tenancies in common, where each owner has an absolute right to half.  I am not making an adjudication now in regard to any particular case. This section has been drawn up on a generous and accommodating basis and the facts in each case remain to be determined. Anything I am saying now cannot be taken as a final decision in respect of any particular case.  Where the farms are separately owned and occupied, and that is for determination in each case, for the purposes of thresholds at £40, £70 or any other amount, they will be deemed to be separate.  This would apply to the <Col N="1801" /> two farms of £35 valuation each mentioned by the Deputy.  The intention may be quite clear but it may not always be proved by rateable valuation and there must be separate ownership and occupation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not mean living apart.  It means having independent ownership, use, occupation and direction of the farm.  That is what is intended. Otherwise it is not separate.</P>
      <P>In relation to joint ownership the position is that it is taken as being one unit, when one is talking about liability at the threshold of £40 or £70 for resource tax. For threshold purposes it will be judged as one unit but the distinction is that in respect of the liability for tax it will be halved between the two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are.  I am subject to correction on this because this is a legal matter, but there is a distinction between joint ownership and tenancy in common for this purpose.  As far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned&mdash;it has different consequences on death&mdash;at that point they are joint owners liable to be jointly assessed, but when it comes to assessing their actual liability it is divided by two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy rised a third point.  He asked about a farm where half is owned beneficially by the owner and the other half is held in trust for wife and family.  If the part held in trust is separately owned and occupied, paragraph (i) applies.  If the benefit of the trust can be applied, <Col N="1802" /> whether it is a matter of separate ownership or occupation or joint ownership or occupation, the test would have to be into which category the trust would fall  It is understandable that these questions were raised.  I tried to give a general guide but it must be remembered that the final determination will have to await the actual decision in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response, and this is my last question. In regard to separate titles, where there is a possibility of a husband and wife having a total valuation of over £40 but under £40 each, there is a requirement that the units be run independently to enable them to claim, because they are both below the threshold.  If the Department of Agriculture declined to allocate separate herd numbers and both units had to operate under the same herd number, would that affect the case?  This is a very practical point because normally the Department will not allow herd owners, such as husband and wife or parents and children, separate herd numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this tax is the final thumbing of the nose by the Fianna Fáil Party at the farmers.  They wooed, cajoled and courted them during the years when they were in Opposition and told them about the damage being done by their being brought into the tax net, by objecting on their behalf to the wealth tax and talking about the notional system.  They made extravagant promises during the 1977 election compaign about what they would do for farmers if returned to power.  Every year since they have taken the opportunity to go back on what farmers took to be the word of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I can cite many examples such as the dropping of the thresholds, the levy imposed last year, the abandonment yesterday in an earlier section of this Bill of the notional system, and now the imposition of this resource tax at a time when farmers are least able to bear such a tax.  They had a poor year in 1979 and incomes dropped <Col N="1804" /> by 10 per cent or 12 per cent.  A similar if not greater reduction is forecast for this year, yet under section 25 of this Bill those with valuations over £70 will have to pay £3.50 per £ valuation.  This tax must be paid whether a farmer can afford it or not, no matter how high his overdraft or the rate he is paying on borrowings.</P>
      <P>When this measure was first announced the farmers objected and arranged deputations to meet the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach.  They were given the soft answer by the Taoiseach that it was a temporary measure and that the Government did not envisage its continuation forever.  There are a number of amendments to this Bill from the Minister for Finance but none of them limits the application of this resource tax.  It is clearly stated in this section that it applies to the year 1980-81 and any subsequent year and there is no amendment to give statutory effect to the promise made by the Taoiseach that this was a temporary measure.  If the Minister assures us that it is meant to be temporary, I will ask him to put his words on paper and promise to introduce on Report Stage an amendment limiting it to 12 months.</P>
      <P>Although we will be opposing this section it is obvious that it will become law. This will be the case unless Deputy Crinion and his colleagues do what they would like to do, and what they have been advised by their neighbours and friends to do, and vote against this imposition. Of course, they will not do so and the result will be an imposition on the farmers, no matter how badly off they may be.  I have no faith in the connivers on the fifth floor of this building doing any more than grumbling.</P>

      <P>The injustice of this tax is clear to every farmer and every Deputy.  Some farmers may even have to borrow money in order to pay it.  When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition we heard much about the damage which would be done by a wealth tax, but they are now introducing a wealth tax which does not take account of ability to pay.  Despite the Taoiseach's soft words there is nothing to indicate that this is intended as a temporary measure.  We will be voting against its imposition.</P>

      <P>We will also vote against the imposition of this tax.  The Government's handling of this issue has been highly inconsistent.  They refuse to impose an equitable wealth tax while simultaneously they want to impose a resource tax on farmers at a time of unparalleled difficulty in that industry.  The principle is one which, in circumstances of fair handling of the entire taxation issue, we would support.  At a later stage we have put down an amendment asking for the imposition of a wealth tax and the Minister has made it clear that he will be opposing that amendment.  Fair handling of the whole tax issue is the only means by which community stability can be restored.  The imagination boggles at the way the Government mete out one kind of treatment to Irish business and an entirely different type of treatment to Irish farming.</P>
      <P>Another reason for our opposition to the introduction of this tax is that the valuation system is chaotic.  Unless there is reform in that area we cannot see the resource tax operating fairly.  There are many cases of adjoining farms having different valuations and it defies one to understand the different criteria adopted. Far from being fair the imposition of this tax would be the reverse, and it is to expose the Government's inconsistency in this matter that we are opposing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This resource tax is completely <Col N="1806" /> unfair because it is wrong to single out one section of the community and say they should have to pay a wealth tax.  I have argued that this tax is unconstitutional in that it is discriminatory and contrary to Article 40 of the Constitution, which says that all people should be treated equally under the law.  I cited in support of his argument the decision of the Chief Justice in the case of <i>de Burca versus the Attorney-General.</i>  It was found contrary to Article 40 of the Constitution that one section of property holders owning rated property were deemed liable to jury service but other property holders were not considered to be so liable.  This tax discriminates against a particular type of property and I believe it is unconstitutional. If an industry has a valuation in excess of £70 there is no provision for having to pay a resource tax.  The resource tax will be levied only in the case of a farm and this is most certainly a discriminatory provision under Article 40 which I believe will be overturned in the courts.</P>
      <P>I must confess to being very puzzled about the way in which this tax was introduced. The Minister said on budget day that a resource tax was being introduced and the suggestion was that it would be a tax which would continue indefinitely, but the following morning the Taoiseach of his own accord announced in this House that it was only a temporary measure.  I should like to know what transpired between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in those 24 hours or indeed before the tax was introduced. I understand the Taoiseach had discussions subsequently with farming organisations about this matter and the impression given was that the Taoiseach had nothing to do with it.  It was something that appeared on budget day and when he discovered that he rushed here the following morning to tell us the tax could not continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know; I was not at the discussions.  Certainly the impression was given by the Taoiseach that it had nothing to do with him.  It was somewhat of a Pontius Pilate act and when he discovered what was in the budget he had to say the following day that it was only a temporary measure. There is a lot of substance in what I am saying and, so far as the cohesive operations of the Government are concerned, it is a serious matter.  That a tax could be introduced as a permanent feature of our tax code and the following day the leader of the Government tells us to forget about it, that it is only a temporary measure, is not a matter that can be swept aside easily.  It is as though the Government do not know where they are going so far as the tax position is concerned.</P>
      <P>The resource tax is a misnomer.  The Government chose that term deliberately to try to pretend that the tax was similar to something suggested by the NESC in an earlier report.  The Government tried to give the impression that this is the same tax as that recommended by that esteemed body but it is radically different. The NESC recommended a tax that would apply but in the event that farmers increased their production subsequently they could get back the tax.  It was to be a means of encouraging increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no such provision for farmers to claim back their tax here if they show they have increased production and that omission makes this provision fundamentally different from anything recommended to the Government by the NESC or anybody else.  This resource tax is simply a revenue measure dreamed up to get the maximum amount of money in the simplest and quickest way from the farmers.  It is not because the Government believed the farmers were not paying their fair share but because the Government wanted to convince others that farmers were paying their share.  The Government knew that farmers <Col N="1808" /> on full accounts and paying rates were paying fair taxation.</P>
    <P>Anybody who does an analysis of the situation of a farmer with a valuation of £80 on full accounts knows that he is paying the same income tax as any other businessman but because there is a kind of prejudice in the population generally against the farming community, instead of doing what any self-respecting Government would do, namely, to point out the facts, the Government decided to impose a resource tax even though they knew farmers were paying their fair share.  It was simply a case of collapsing in the face of majority prejudice regardless of whether it was valid or not.  Indeed, the very words used by the Minister in the budget displayed what I would describe as a weak-kneed attitude. He did not say, &ldquo;I believe farmers are not paying their fair share of taxation&rdquo;. He said, &ldquo;there is a feeling that the farmers are not paying their share.&rdquo;  It was not something he would be prepared to endorse but as the feeling existed in the community the Minister was prepared to impose the tax on the spurious grounds that farmers were not paying their fair share.</P>
    <P>I have done a careful analysis with the assistance of reputable economists which shows that at any given level of income, taking into account rates, income tax and average acreage, a married farmer with two children is paying somewhat more tax than is a person in the PAYE sector on the same income.  The gap is largest in the case of the smallest of farmers who are in the tax net, namely, those with valuations between £40 and £60.  At no point does a farmer pay less on an equivalent income than a person in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>There is no case whatever for imposing a resource tax on the grounds that farmers are not being taxed enough and I think the Minister has conceded that.  If he thought that was the case he would have made provision for it in the budget. His case entirely rested on the fact that he believed there was feeling throughout the country that farmers were not paying their fair share.  It was simply a question <Col N="1809" /> of his conceding to outside prejudice without regard to the facts.  When the Taoiseach realised what had happened, the day following the budget he said it was only a temporary measure.  I am convinced the Taoiseach did not read the budget statement before it was issued or if he did he was rather inattentive and thinking of something else.  If he had known about it, obviously he would have ensured that the budget speech would make it clear that it was only temporary. It may have been that it was never the intention for the tax to be temporary but that when the Taoiseach heard about it he decided it would be temporary or else the Government forgot their intention to make the measure temporary and did not put it in the budget statement.</P>
    <P>One way or another it is all very mysterious.  Any Minister for Finance wants to put the best face on a budget and if he introduces a tax that is only temporary he will say so in the budget statement in order to get the minimum amount of flak.  All Ministers for Finance get flak on budget day no matter what they do and any Minister will try to put the best face on it.  If this was a temporary tax the Minister would have said so in the budget.  Presumably when the Taoiseach heard the speech on the following day he took fright and decided that this had better be a temporary tax. If the Government can change their minds in 24 hours on a matter of fundamental importance they can certainly change it again within a year.  There is nothing to stop the Government saying next year that they will renew this for another year and so on.  When income tax was introduced it was only introduced for one year and was renewed each year for about 100 years afterwards in the Finance Bill.  It is only recently that income tax has become a permanent tax in law.  Even if the Minister said that resource tax was temporary, it does not mean very much because there is nothing in the Bill, as Deputy Barry pointed out, to suggest that the resource tax is temporary and that is what is important.  If it is temporary the Minister should introduce an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> This year many farmers who will not be liable for income tax will have to pay resource tax.  Any tax which is not related to earnings is highly objectionable. I am against the principle of taxing any section of the community other than on the basis of what they earn.  I do not trust the Taoiseach when he says that this is only a temporary tax. The Taoiseach may intend it to be a temporary tax now but he may change his mind again in a year.</P>

      <P>I know that some of them are very hard to sell since the credit restrictions were imposed.  A lot of people outside agriculture have been the cause of increasing the price of farms.  If farmers were still under the Coalition Government they would be paying from eight to 12 times as much in taxes as they will be paying this year under the resource tax.  If it is seen that a reasonable share of tax is being paid by farmers this year it will be easy for the Minister to review the matter and withdraw it.  It was because of the people who were evading paying tax that it was necessary to introduce this tax.  The Taoiseach said it was a temporary <Col N="1815" /> measure.  It has to be reviewed like any tax and that is what will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The statements made by the previous speaker are as far-fetched as those he made yesterday concerning farm machinery.  Subsection (1) of this section states:</P>
      <P>This section applies to any person who at any time during a year of assessment (being the year 1980-81 or any subsequent year of assessment) occupies, or is deemed to occupy, farm land the rateable valuation of which amounts to £70 or more.</P>
      <P>Could anything be more permanent than that?  The guarantees given by the Fianna Fáil Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture are treated as a sick joke.  Their guarantees to the farming organisations and other people that this will only be a temporary measure will be treated as a sick joke.  Deputy Crinion should take note of that.</P>
      <P>We have heard it said very often that a strong agricultural industry is basic to the needs of the nation.  Any tax levied should reflect the ability of the people to pay.  In agriculture at the moment there is a predetermined tax of approximately £100 million.  This is made up of £63 million from rates, £7 million from resource tax, £10 million from levies, and approximately £33 million from income tax.  This means that two-thirds of the taxes paid by farmers are levies and there is no reflection whatever on the ability of the person to pay.  The resource tax introduced this year after the famous 2 per cent level last year has created great uncertainty and lack of confidence in the agricultural industry.  This is reflected very clearly in the sales of artificial manure, lime and feedstuffs.  The Minister has clearly indicators there which he can read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1979 there was a reduction in the actual income of farmers of 15 per cent. Figures have been bandied around about this, some people quoting one figure and others another.  I believe we can accept a <Col N="1816" /> figure of around 15 per cent.  Is there any section of the community who is less than two years have suffered a reduction in their real income of around one-third and at the same time are asked to pay £66 million in taxes which bear no relation to the actual income of these people? Is there any other section of the community who are levied in that way?</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill has a specially designed tax system for agriculture.  The 2 per cent levy did great damage to this industry and the resource tax will continue to carry on the Fianna Fáil policy in its true colours, deceiving the people. Deception is the correct word to use as far as the Fianna Fáil manifesto is concerned.</P>

      <P>I said that Fianna Fáil were coming out in their true colours and that, as far as the manifesto was concerned, it was a complete deception of the people.  The Minister has collective responsibility for those issues.  Has he any interest in the growth of agriculture? Will the Government continue to hamper the people engaged in agriculture by consistent attacks with specially designed taxes and specially designed conditions which will damage the confidence of the people in that industry? Last year we had the export of <Col N="1817" /> agricultural production amounting to £11,000 million and any increases, even by 1 per cent, will mean a further £11 million in exports of agricultural production. That is what it means to this country. The finances of the State are in difficulty. The Central Bank in their report claim that agriculture will increase by about 4 per cent.  I claim that it will not.</P>

      <P>It is proper to say that the introduction of the resource tax by this Government amounts to the delivery of a knockout blow to the farming community who are already reeling under a succession of body punches.  At present there is an unparalleled loss of confidence amongst the agricultural community in this country, and this has been contributed to in no small way by the policies of the present administration.  It is adding insult to injury that at this stage an additional burden should be placed on the groaning backs of that community.  A case could be made for seeking tax from the farming community if proof could be produced here that the farmers of this country were on a bonanza, that they were doing so well that they could afford to make the exceptional contribution to the economy and the running of the Exchequer, but the reverse is the situation.  Because of the policies of this Government, farmers <Col N="1818" /> have never been worse off.  They are now even talking in terms of their situation being as bad as it was during the economic war of the thirties.  This situation is not going to improve.  We have the Minister and his Government coming back from Brussels waving triumphantly a foreign package which is going to put a seal on farm incomes being reduced by at least 15 per cent in the current year because the increases they are getting of not more than 5 per cent will be offset by an increase in input of at least 20 per cent.  Therefore, we have this Government presiding over a further reduction of farm incomes in the current year and at the same time, without any thought of the inability of the farming community to pay, loading on another tax totally unrelated to their income. This tax is being applied only to the farming sector.  You can call a rose by any other name, but this is a selective wealth tax which is being applied to the agricultural sector only.  The big business, fat cat supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party are, as usual, being exempted. This is solely for the farmer, and whether he makes a shilling or loses an enormous amount, right through he will have to pay this extra tax which cannot be allowed in computing his income profits or losses for the purpose of the Tax Acts.  It is an additional burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the farmer&mdash;who is going to suffer a loss of income this year and who is suffering already from the various levies and increases in rates which in some cases have doubled his rates bill with quite small farmers paying twice the rates they were paying last year&mdash;is expected to pay this additional tax.  One could not select a more inappropriate time for the introduction of any such new type of tax as the Minister and his Government have done.  Because of the credit squeeze, farmers will not even be able to borrow the money to pay this tax and in many cases probably they will have to sell off stock, the seed corn as it were, to satisfy the rapacious demands of this Government.  This tax is totally uncalled for and in the context of the crocodile tears wept by the members of this Government in years gone by when <Col N="1819" /> it was suggested that very big farmers should have to make some contribution to income tax, it is really the wheel turned full circle.  It exposes the entire hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Even at this late stage I call on the Minister to repent of his sins and remove this resource tax entirely from the present Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This resource tax is another anti-farmer piece of legislation, another Fianna Fáil fraud perpetrated on the agricultural community.  It is unfair, it is unjust, it is iniquitous type of taxation and it is unconstitutional, just as the 2 per cent levy was last year.  Any tax that does not take into consideration the ability of the people to pay is unfair and unjust, and this tax does not do that. Also, a tax based on the poor law valuation is most unfair because the valuations are over 120 years old and we all know that a holding of 75 acres of land in one part of a county may be valued at nearly £100 and a holding of similar land in another part of the county can be valued at £50 or £60.  Therefore, it is most unfair and unjust also from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very annoying feature is that castles and mansions are de-rated while the farmers with no facilities who are now paying high taxes and rates and have not even roads to travel on, or the roads have potholes, have to pay this unfair tax.  The farmers are entitled to be annoyed at the double talk and the double thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to taxation and to taxing the farming community and the smear campaign that that party carried out so successfully against the National Coalition who had only income tax on farmers of over £75 PLV prior to the 1977 general election.  I am sorry that Deputy Crinion is not here.  Farmers were told by Deputy Keegan&mdash;as I heard from a deputation from the NFA in my own county&mdash;that they would not lower the threshold, that any other type of taxation would not be imposed on the farmers and if Fianna Fáil were returned to power farmer taxation would be reduced <Col N="1820" /> greatly.  That is what they told the farmers' deputation at that time.</P>
    <P>They claimed that we were anti-farmer, that we were out to tax the farmers out of existence, while Fianna Fáil were the farmers' friends.  As the previous speaker said, Fianna Fáil Deputies shed crocodile tears.  In Opposition they say one thing, and in Government they do the very opposite. Looking back over their history, they have been consistent in their inconsistency. It might be no harm if I quoted what Deputy Power, now Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, said as reported at column 1727 of the Official Report of 4 April 1974.  He was interested in the large farmers.  He said:</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the big farmer has been singled out in this exercise. We are told 9,000 people are involved. I look upon this as a socialistic onslaught on very rich people.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister to say about that statement made by a member of his own Party, a man who now sits in the Cabinet with him?  If it was a socialistic onslaught on very rich people then, we can now claim it is a socialistic onslaught on people who are very poor and whose incomes are being reduced by the Government.</P>
    <P>Others were interested then in the big farmers.  A former friend of the Minister's, Deputy Lynch, who was then leader of the Opposition said, as reported at column 1515 of the Official Report of 4 April 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the resource tax and its implications for large farmers. I want to say how interested the Government were in them when they were in Opposition and how they have lost that interest since they took office and are now trying to tax them out of existence. The then Leader of the Opposition said:</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has his toe in the door he will push it more and more.  Obviously, they anticipate and fear that the £100 norm of land valuation&mdash;according to a completely outdated criterion, incidentally, the Griffith valuation some 100 years old now&mdash;will be reduced according as the Minister feels it necessary and, of course, as the Revenue Commissioners advise.</P>
      <P>They were anxious about their welfare at that time.  What has happened since? They have not been so anxious since they took office.  They have done exactly what they accused us of trying to do but which we did not do.  We did not put the figure lower than £75 at that time.</P>
      <P>Another man wept crocodile tears, Deputy Crowley.  As reported at column 1639 of the same Volume he said:</P>
      <P>We now find ourselves in a country in which the backbone of our economy, the farmers, are beginning to be taxed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> I doubt that he thought farmers with poor law valuations as low as £40 would be taxed by a Fianna Fáil Government. As the previous speaker said, the farmers are being ground down by ever-increasing taxation, rates and the 2 per cent levy last year which has now gone, while their overheads are increasing by 20 or 25 per cent and their prices are falling.</P>
    <P>Professor Sheehy is not interested in one political party or another, and last night he said their farmers' incomes fell last year by 25 per cent and will fall this year by a further 25 per cent.  Those are the people this Government, perhaps at the behest of certain people in certain trade unions, are bringing in under the resource tax.  Unfortunately many farmers are becoming punch drunk.  They are losing initiative and confidence at a vital moment in our history.  The country is moving towards the edge of the precipice.</P>
    <P>Never in our history was it more important that farmers should have confidence and display initiative and make full use of their land.  They cannot plough back money into the land to increase production and to help us out of the crisis we are in today, because that money is being taken from them by the Government through this resource tax and other taxes.  We are facing national crisis.  How the farmers use their land is of paramount importance to each and every one of us.  There may be 150,000 employed before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This resource tax is a cruel tax and can have disastrous effects on the farming community who are already reeling under increasing taxation and falling prices.  It comes at a time when it was never more important for the farmers to have the confidence to display initiative and increase production, to export more to help to get the country out of the crisis that it is in today and to reduce our huge balance of payments.  The last election was fought on the basis that we were trying to tax the farmers out of existence.  We know that Deputy Mark Clinton improved the standard of living of the farmers; their income increased from £350 million to £900 million in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the performance of Fianna Fáil Ministers at that time and the promises they made to the farmers in relation to taxation.  The farmers were told that we were trying to tax them out <Col N="1825" /> of existence but that if there was a change of government things would be completely different.  They were not told at that time that the threshold for taxation purposes was to be reduced from £75 to £40.  They were not told that the 2 per cent levy was going to be introduced. They were not told that on top of that they would have to pay a resource tax. All this was done by a government that made so many misleading promises to the farmers at that time.  In the past farmers have been in the front line trenches in many wars here, national, social and economic.  All they want is fair play from any government.  They have pride, they wish to pay their fair share but they want a fair system that will not discriminate against them as this resource tax certainly does.  They have no wish to be beggars, to be carried on the backs of anyone; they are willing to make their contribution towards alleviating the burden which this nation has to carry.</P>
    <P>When well paid members of some unions want to indulge in farmer bashing they should also remember that the 70,000 self-employed people, like fat cats, many of them supporting this Government, are only paying a little over £60 million.  That works out at a little over £800 per individual.  Is that fair or just?  I do not think it is.  What we all want to see here is an equitable system of taxation. Indeed, when the present Taoiseach was in opposition he waxed eloquent about equity in taxation.  He said, and I quote from the Official Report of 5 April 1974, column 1787:</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil want an equitable tax system.  We want that equitable tax system as a basis for social justice.</P>
    <P>Where is the equity in this tax where certain sections of the people have to pay this taxation?  A farmer with a poor law valuation of £70 who has a wife and ten children would pay, on top of the other tax and rates he has to pay, £245 extra in resource tax, but a bachelor farmer with a valuation of £69.99 does not pay one penny extra.  Where is the equity there?  All forms of tax should be seen to be equitable to all sections of people.  We <Col N="1826" /> have heard so much in the past about cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  I certainly do not think that this is chershing all the children of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Crinion was speaking about the resource tax he denied that the Taoiseach changed his mind the day after introducing the tax.  The Minister spoke at length here and mentioned all these taxes.  He never mentioned that this resource tax was only a temporary form of taxation.  But the next day when the farmers' organisations made their voices heard he very quickly changed his mind and, let us remember, it was not the Minister for Finance who made this statement but the Taoiseach himself; he said it was only a temporary form of taxation. We are inclined to ask why.  Was it because the farmers' organisations spoke out so vehemently against this taxation, or is the Taoiseach keeping his options open?  The Minister may look at me in surprise, but their disastrous policy has led this nation to a crisis and we are at the edge of the precipice at the moment. His idea may be either to run away from it or have an election instead of staying on in power, knowing as he does that unless the Government change their policy things are going to go from bad to worse.  This is a selective form of taxation. Deputy Crinion also mentioned a man who appeared on a television programme and said that that man was not given time enough on that evening to explain what he owed the banks because if everything was taken into consideration he possibly should not have been paying income tax but that, in any event, the full story was not told.  So far as we on this side of the House are concerned, neither we nor Deputy Ryan when he was Minister agreed with tax evasion. We were one government that did more than any other government to catch up on the people who were avoiding paying their fair and just share of tax.  We closed as many loopholes as we could at that time.</P>
    <P>The country today is in a mess and it is of the Government's own making. They gave the impression that <Col N="1827" /> everything was up for grabs a few years ago.  The Government abolished wealth tax.  They abolished rates on castles and on millionaries' residences.  Even a person with, say, six houses let in this city is exempt from rates.  All of this has put the Government in a situation of having to get money from somewhere and they are taking this money from the large farmers in an effort to placate some other people. The dead hand of Fianna Fáil is descending again on our farmers.  We know that the Government are short of money but the situation is of their own making.  When we left office in 1977 there was a growth rate of 6½ per cent and inflation was of the order of 9 per cent.  Today the inflation rate is 18 per cent and we have a growth rate of perhaps half of one per cent.  The Government have borrowed and have squandered the people's money and they are now imposing this unfair and unjust tax on the farmers in order to get money to run the country.</P>
    <P>Our farmers are the backbone of the country.  The majority of them work very long hours every day of the week unlike some of those who are calling for farmer taxation and who work a five-day week for about five months of the year. The Minister should realise that if the farmers are prospering, the nation generally will prosper but that if the farmers are poor, all other sectors will be poor also.  If the farmers are ground down with taxation they will not be in a position to increase production.  Their confidence is being eroded by those who pretended a few years ago to be their friends.  They were fooled by this Government.  What is needed is the type of action that will restore confidence on the part of farmers.  They need a Minister for Agriculture and a Minister for Finance who will ensure that there is fairplay for the farming community.  If the farmers are allowed to prosper, their prosperity may be the means of getting us out of the crisis we are in now but they will not be in a position to prosper while the Government continue to impose further taxation on them.  If there is any further loss of confidence among <Col N="1828" /> this section of the community the country may well slip over the precipice on which it rests now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer first to the record of what was announced by me and by others so that we might clarify some points that have been raised in the course of this discussion.  It is important to do this in order to put this Committee Stage discussion in its proper context.  It has been said this morning by perhaps every spokesman from the Opposition who has contributed that when I referred to this in my budget statement I did not give any indication other than that the provision would be permanent and that the following day the Taoiseach said the intention was that the provision would last for only one year.  The implication in that is that the Taoiseach and I were at odds with each other on this point.  It might be helpful here to quote from the budget statement in this regard.  I quote from column 734 of the Official Report for 27 February 1980:</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the farming organisations in my consultations with them, the operation of this revised scheme now being introduced will be kept under review in the interest of equity and in the light of experience of its operations.</P>
      <P>That is far from being what the Deputies opposite are trying to present it as being. I said very clearly in that budget statement what I had said also to the leaders of the farm organisations in our consultations with them before the budget and I had very many useful consultations with them both before and since the budget.  It is reasonably clear, as I indicated to the leaders of the farming organisations before the budget, that if one is keeping a package under review, the review is conducted in the light of its operations.  By definition, review must be in the light of operation.</P>

      <P>Those Deputies opposite have the opportunity to come and go at their ease and pleasure and of making these sort of remarks after I have sat and listened to everything being said. When I am attempting to put the facts on the record I get a comment about income tax generally going back into history.</P>
      <P>What I said in my budget statement in regard to the point at issue was by way of confirmation of what I had said to the leaders of the farming organisations before the budget.  That remains the position. In the light of the recognition on the part of the Government of the importance of agriculture and of the role it plays in our economic development, we have had very useful consultations relating not only to the tax issue but to various other issues with representatives of the farmers.  These consultations will be continuing and I am sure they will be very useful.  Deputies opposite will be aware, though perhaps it is important to remind them, that the announcement in respect of this issue was made originally on 24 April 1979.  It was announced then very clearly and unequivocally that a new resource tax would be introduced with effect from 6 April 1980.  There were set out details of how this tax would apply and there was reference to the margin of reliefs, a point that I shall come to later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said in my budget statement was entirely different from what is being represented by the Opposition, but was the same as what was said after a subsequent meeting between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and myself with a delegation from the IFA-ICMSA coordinating group on 14 April.  In an agreed statement following that meeting it was said that the Government indicated that it was not their intention <Col N="1830" /> that the resource tax should be a permanent feature of the tax code and that the termination of that tax would be considered by the Government in the light of the amount of tax paid by farmers in relation to farm income generally in the current year.  That was confirming that the question was being kept under review and that remains the position.  Anyone who tries to put any other gloss on the situation by saying, for instance, that there is no specific provision in the Bill to the effect that the tax should be temporary, will fail in his attempt to misrepresent the position.</P>
      <P>In so far as it is not stated in the Bill to be a temporary measure, anyone who for a moment looks at the purpose of legislation and how it is drawn up, will recognise that the one thing which is required in drafting sections of a Bill is that they be precise and clear.  In an area which is obviously complex enough&mdash;namely the area of tax generally&mdash;it would be unforgiveable for a Minister for Finance to introduce new concepts which are proper, let me acknowledge, to political statements or commitments made in this House, outside it, after or during the course of consultations which do not or could not form any part of a Bill as drafted.  Those who would say that there should be some section in this Bill which says that the operation of this section will be temporary are ignoring the fact that is not the way legislation is drafted. There is no reason, purpose or precedent for stating that it will be a temporary operation.</P>

      <P>You state to those who are entitled to know&mdash;the public generally or, in this instance, the farming sector or a section of it&mdash;precisely what the Bill is and how it will operate.  This is stated clearly in the Bill.  Clearly though it is stated, some members of the Opposition apparently have not been able to grasp even the most obvious and clear aspects of what is being done here, <Col N="1831" /> if one is to judge from some remarks of Deputy L'Estrange and others that I will come to later.  That is, and remains, the position and it will be reviewed in the light of its operation.  A review presupposes an examination of the operation of a farm package or any other package which is being reviewed.  A review cannot start before the actual operation itself gets under way.  That is the reality of the position as the Government present it.</P>
      <P>I should mention here that, even as announced in the Bill which is in line with statements we made&mdash;and Deputy L'Estrange would appear to have missed this point&mdash;there is provision in the very next section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy saw it afterwards, apparently.  There is provision for the operation of marginal relief, so that when someone says a man with a valuation of £70 must pay seventy times £3.50, he is wrong.  He will pay one-tenth of seventy times £350&mdash;in other words, seven times £350.  If his valuation is £71 he will pay two-tenths and at valuation of £72, three-tenths and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Marginal operation, as the Deputy knows, operates between the figures of £70 and £79, not £81, but he can make that point when he comes to make his own speech.</P>
      <P>There is no point in implying that we are at the throats of the farmers.  I can understand that when one gets into a flight on the wings of oratory one forgets the reality on the ground.  That reality is here in this Bill, and marginal relief will operate very effectively in this area for those with valuations of between £70 and £79.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this discussion, it is reasonable enough that Deputies opposite would put this in the overall context <Col N="1832" /> of what they see as being crushing tax burdens on farmers, which is the case they presented this morning.  They make references to the other elements of the tax package.  There is no decision, much less determination, on the part of the Government to effect a predetermined yield from farm taxation.  I have stated that before, certainly in this House, but it is necessary that I should repeat, in the face of implications to the contrary by the Opposition, that that is not our intention.  Any Minister for Finance must make an estimate if he is to fulfil his functions and discharge his obligations in relation to revenue and expenditure, as every Deputy must know. In line with that obligation, I have estimated that the total yield from farm taxation&mdash;which, of course, includes, as Deputies know, rates, income tax and resource tax, will be of the order this year, of £86 million.  That is my estimate. It may amount to more or less, but that is what we estimate in the light of falling incomes last year.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that, even since the budget statement, because of very useful consultations which we had and because of the importance we attach to agriculture, I have made significant adjustments which, as I have stated already, are such that will reflect the Government's recognition of the importance of agriculture, while at the same time maintaining that very important balance which is essential if we are to have a united community, as distinct from a divided community, on this issue of taxation as between one sector and another.</P>
    <P>If one goes perhaps, a little too far one will get a reaction which will be in nobody's interest, the farmers' or nobody else's.  That is one of the reasons why I have, in the course of this Bill, taken what are recognised by the farm leaders we have met to be significant adjustments. It is important that they will be seen in detail for the significance which does attach to them.  I am talking about the exclusion from the restrictions on capital allowances of expenditure on land reclamation, drainage, fencing, <Col N="1833" /> farm buildings, all these developments on the farm, the fixed plant and machinery on the farm building which we dealt with this morning.</P>
    <P>An increase of up to 30 per cent per annum is the amount of farm buildings allowance that may be claimed on such expenditure which can be written off over a period of four years, instead of eight years as hitherto.  These are all real, positive developments, recognised to be such by the farming organisations.  That is, however, not the end of it.  In this Bill, we are also introducing provisions for the improvement of stock relief.  I have noted, in the course of this debate, that while one gets perhaps a quick welcome from the other side in relation to all these welcome adjustments, as soon as that is done, it is said to be not nearly enough, or is simply a measure of a grudging reaction on the part of the Government, or something like that, which is not the case at all.</P>
    <P>In relation to stock relief, we are increasing the rate of relief from 75 per cent to 100 per cent.  We are allowing the relief in respect of stock increases over 10 per cent of profits instead of 20 per cent of profits, thus increasing the amount qualifying for relief, and we are introducing special provisions to deal with problems when disease strikes livestock.  This has all been done as real, practical measures which demonstrate as clearly as I could, or any Government could, our recognition of these problems.</P>
    <P>We have also introduced simplified accounts.  Some Opposition members were saying that these poor creatures with £40 or £50 valuation would have to waste their money in engaging an accountant, and waste the talents of the accountant. That is not the case at all.  I am sorry to have to disullusion them, but the reality is that there is no such requirement to get an accountant to vouch for the farmer's financial situation.  We have, after consultations with the farm organisations, drawn up a simple form of accounts, not just for those with valuations between £40 and £50 coming into the tax net for the first time, but also for other small enterprise farmers above <Col N="1834" /> £50 valuation.  Certainly, that should diminish the notional&mdash;and I can use this word properly in that case&mdash;imaginary burden that the Opposition Deputies suggested yesterday that we were imposing on farmers the engagement of accountants in this area.</P>
    <P>I have also in this case distinguished between farmers and others when it comes to the date of payment of tax. Where traders and other professional persons are asked to pay their 1981 tax in one sum on 1 October farmers will pay only half of their 1981 tax on that date and the other half will be payable on 1 January.</P>
    <P>I am not wanting to make a great boast of any one of these areas but I am anxious to demonstrate that they prove very conclusively that the attempts made to present doom, gloom and lack of interest in the farming community, or what it represents in our economy, do not measure up to the facts.  It is fair to say&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;that in addition to those special reliefs which apply to farmers only, the actual income-splitting provision, on average, will apply to them more than others.  As anyone who knows much about the farming community will admit, if ever there is a case where the wife remains at home and is not in receipt of a separate, earned income, it is the wife of the farmer. Though the benefit is not for the farming community alone, it has been recognised by the farmers themselves&mdash;the Opposition do not want to recognise any significant adjustments here&mdash;it will mean for them a very significant concession, a significant recognition of the importance of that provision to the tax liability of the farming community.  For instance this would mean that most married farmers who have to pay tax will be paying at a 25 per cent rate and it is unlikely that there would be many who would be paying tax at a higher rate than the standard 35 per cent.  Even then it is important to recognise that any tax payable would be after credit has been allowed for the rates payable, a provision introduced in 1978.  There is also the easement in section <Col N="1835" /> 74 we shall be coming to in relation to the capital acquisitions tax, but I shall leave that until we come to it.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the major adjustments incorporated in this Bill in connection with our recognition of the importance of agriculture.  Therefore it would appear that the Opposition are on a line they want to pursue&mdash;but one on which I do not think anyone else will follow them&mdash;when they talk about the crushing burden of tax we are trying to impose on the farming community and that I in particular, as Minister for Finance, am determined, hell bent, to impose, when the record is quite the other way.</P>
    <P>Of course tax represents one area of Government action only.  It is one way in which the Government can demonstrate their interest in or commitment to any particular sector.  Perhaps much more important&mdash;as the farmers themselves recognise and have stated very clearly&mdash;is the level of financial commitment through the various agencies of the Government, in particular the Department of Agriculture, to farm development. This is something of which I am especially conscious.  In the course of our discussions with the farm leaders&mdash;something I very much welcome&mdash;we spent much more time discussing the programme for farm development and how it could be encouraged further to realise its great potential within our economy.  Those are the issues about which we spoke, although the Opposition would try to convey that we were hung up on one aspect of the farm package and went to battle on it.  In relation to certain aspects of the package, including the resource tax, we had detailed discussions, we reached agreement and understanding. But the main thrust of what we were about&mdash;which is their function as well as mine&mdash;was to create conditions for the effective economic development of agriculture, thereby creating conditions for the effective development of the economy because of the important role agriculture plays in that respect.</P>
    <P>Let me put some other facts on the <Col N="1836" /> record that have been referred to this morning as if this Government had no interest in or awareness of the farming sector beyond screwing them for whatever tax we could get from them. Here the old Latin maxim applies&mdash;<i>res ipsa loquitir</i>&mdash;the facts speak for themselves. Indeed the facts throw up some stark contrast between what speak for themselves now and what spoke for themselves when they had the opportunity of taking action in this area.  For instance, one would never guess that in 1976 the amount of money actually applied by the Government opposite for farm modernisation was £13.3 million. That compares with an estimated £33.8 million this year, over 2½ times what was made available then.  Yet we are told that in 1976&mdash;it was re-echoed on those benches quite a bit this morning&mdash;the economy was in a much healthier state than it is now, they would suggest, due to Fianna Fáil mismanagement.  One cannot have it both ways: if the economy was in a healthier state certainly their level of commitment to agriculture did not reflect the importance they attached to it.  If one looks at the programme for education research and advisory services, and inspection services, they increased in the same period from £19.3 million to £33.2 million.  Arterial drainage has increased from £2.9 million to £7.2 million.  It is important to recognise that all of these figures are net of any EEC recoupment of farmer contributions. The total estimated expenditure on agriculture this year&mdash;this is from the State alone, and there is another important element to which I shall refer here&mdash;is of the order of £184 million as distinct from the figures in the Coalition's last year in office of £156 million.</P>
    <P>All of these facts to which I am now referring do not accord with the case presented here by the Opposition in this area&mdash;their contention that we had no immediate concern for farm development or for the farming community generally.  Indeed they have suggested we have no concern beyond that of squeezing the last penny of tax out of them.  Despite the fact that somebody opposite suggested only a short while <Col N="1837" /> ago that the farm package agreed in Brussels is totally inadequate and, they would suggest, is a measure of the failure of the Government to get very much more, let me put some things on the record in that connection also.  It is less than a few months ago that one of the main concerns that prompted demonstrations throughout the country, one of which was held in my home town which the Leaders of both Opposition parties took time off to attend, was the super levy, which was the main concern at that time.  I am sure both Opposition Deputies present recall it very well.  It is not now the main concern because the Government dealt with the matter, and the Minister for Agriculture in particular, must be given full credit for the outcome.  He managed almost single-handed to change the attitude of his colleagues, not just of the Commission. He was at one time a man alone amongst eight others but he negotiated so that eventually that super levy which was the cause of all the demonstrations is not now being applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <P>So the most important element in this community knew where this Government stand.  Far from undermining the confidence so vital in them, we can demonstrate to them that <Col N="1838" /> there was also&mdash;as Deputies opposite must know&mdash;at that time the proposal to suspend the provisions for intervention beef during the summer months which would have had a drastic effect on the farming sector.  Once again, due almost entirely to the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture, that has been changed.  I do not know how many more examples one has to quote to demonstrate how we can and have been showing our interest in all of this area.  Although it is not for me to say, this is recognised by the farm organisations in difficult times for everybody, including the farmers.</P>
      <P>In addition to the prices package we talked about this year, remember there is also a special development programme for agriculture in the west which will cost over £300 million over 10 years.  This will include improvements of rural infrastructures, land improvement, investment aid for farm production and improved processing of agricultural products.  All those facts are ranged on the one side to prove the opposite to what the Opposition Deputies suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultations with representatives of farm organisations are but the beginning of continuing and, I hope, even more positive discussions leading to more positive conclusions in the future.  I told the representatives that, even though their main contacts in Government would be with the Minister for Agriculture, because of my responsibility for economic planning my officials will not only be available for but will actively participate in discussions with farm leaders.  This is a vitally important element as they see it, and as I see it.  It is much more important than isolating the one small section of a package of farm taxation which is under review.  It is important to demonstrate our confidence in the farming community and in the role they have to play in the economy.  The on-going discussions on issues of taxation are continuing and will continue during this year.  The importance of these consultations has been recognised and the proof is the outcome of these discussions some of which were demonstrated in the Bill today.  I may be the first <Col N="1839" /> Minister for Finance to come from a rural constituency but despite that and any family contacts I might have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  Mr. Gerard Sweetman was a rural Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the first rural Minister for Finance for some time. Anybody sitting in my seat at this moment, whatever his background, would have to recognise the special significance of agriculture to our economy.  One of our major problems is our balance of payments because of increasing oil prices, which unfortunately do not show any signs of decreasing&mdash;if anything, the trend will be the other way.  If there is one section of the economy which is better equipped than most to make a major contribution to correcting the balance of payments&mdash;and unfortunately there will not be any self-correcting mechanism&mdash;it is the agricultural sector. Any Minister for Finance, wherever he comes from, would have to recognise that fact and hopefully demonstrate it to the community in a way that they too will recognise, whether they are factory workers in Coolock, county council workers, businessmen or professional men, that this is the area which holds the key to overcoming the difficulties which surround us.</P>
      <P>There are two approaches one can take.  One can express confidence in the agricultural sector, demonstrate it to everybody, as I have been doing in this Bill and since I took on this responsibility. One can give them confidence and express one's trust in them, or one can do the other, as the Opposition have been attempting to do, that is, implying that the Government do not care and that the resource tax is proof of that. That may be an understandable political approach, I do not know, but it will not contribute anything to the restoration and maintenance of confidence in the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that last year was a very bad year for agriculture.  Quite a number of extensive farms, because of the operation <Col N="1840" /> of the notional system particularly, did not make any contribution to revenue over a period of four or five years.</P>

This morning a number of Fine Gael Deputies criticised us for introducing, in a different form, what they were against, namely, the wealth tax. They implied that our opposition to the wealth tax was unwarranted, unfounded and was not justified.  The Labour Party are opposed to the wealth tax because of their experience when in Government. They had a better opportunity of observing its effects than we had because we were in opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>Deputies are implying we were wrong to oppose the wealth tax but they are doing the same themselves now.  They say we are introducing another form of wealth tax, but we are not.  It is a very limited application of a resource tax and will apply only for a limited period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give some examples. Deputies say they oppose this &ldquo;in principle&rdquo;.  They did not necessarily object to the amount, which is not too surprising.  The farmer with a £70 valuation will pay £24.50 resource tax; the man with £71 will pay £49.70; and the man with an £80 valuation will pay £280.  I am not saying that this is nothing but I suggest it is not such even in this year as would drive any farmer underground. If it did so the viability of the unit would have been in question anyway.  The man with a valuation of £100 will have to pay £350 and the farmer with a sizeable holding having a valuation of £300 will have to pay a little more than £1,000.  Taking account of all the other adjustments which have been made since the budget, these people will be receiving a reduction similar to what they will now pay in resource tax.  It is overstating the case to say it is such a crushing burden that it will drive the farming sector into further depression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all concerned last year about the lack of understanding between the farming community and the trade unions. These two matters are vital to our economic development and to the extent that I could do so I was determined to try to bring about a better understanding between them so that we would not have continuing public hassle leading to lack of confidence generally.  My consultations and those of the Government have been based on a calm appraisal of what is involved.  It is a tribute to the leaders of the various groups that the acrimony has diminished and the Government have certainly made some contribution. It is recognised that we all need to act collectively in the face of problems <Col N="1842" /> which will continue to present themselves from outside.  I wish to pay tribute to the farm leaders whom I have met at regional and national level and the responsible attitude they have taken.  I am not expecting them to sing the Government song because that is not their role.</P>
    <P>I hope that the views I have expressed in reply to the points made and also in relation to agriculture generally will help to make a contribution to further understanding. If Deputies opposite wish to present a different picture, it is for them to do so but I do not think it will be supported by farming organisations.</P>

I cannot think of any more inequitable system of taxation than the resource tax.  It is measured by a yardstick which is in itself unjust and discriminatory as between taxpayers; I refer to the poor law valuation system.  It has been put on the record earlier that this system was introduced between 1850 and 1865.  By the time it was completed it was already out of date and it is admitted by all to be an unfair system of taxation, particularly as between the valuation in one county and another.  For example, County Monaghan is one of the most harshly treated counties, although it is one of the 12 western counties for the purposes of all assistance schemes.  Some parts of the county qualify for headage grants under the EEC scheme, yet valuations in County Monaghan are as high as in County Kildare.  A valuation of £70 in County Monaghan represents 100 statute acres and a similar valuation in County Kildare represents 95 statute acres.  It is almost unbelievable, but it is a fact; and this is the yardstick which will be used in assessing the amount of resource tax which farmers in these two counties will have to pay.  It cannot be justified.  Statistics show that there can be a difference in gross profit of as much <Col N="1843" /> as £13,000 on the same valuation as between one set of counties and another. This is the system by which the Minister intends to bring in more equity.</P>
      <P>I know of a case in County Monaghan where a farmer with a valuation of £81 was in receipt of a disabled person's allowance because of family circumstances and the condition of his health.  This allowance, which is payable subject to a very rigid means test, was paid to this man last winter but was cut off in the spring because he was able to keep body and soul together.  The Minister knows of this case and wrote a letter saying that hard cases make bad law and there was nothing he could do about it.  That man will now be asked to pay £280 in resource tax.  Can the Minister justify that?</P>
      <P>This is a year in which farmers are suffering a reduction in income of at least 10 per cent and this is the time the Minister chooses to impose a resource tax, regardless of ability to pay.  This section is completely contrary to the alleged objective announced in the Minister's budget speech to introduce greater equity into the taxation system.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Will not the Minister agree that a drop of 1,389 acres in 1977 to virtually nil in 1980 is a virtual close down? Further, will he not agree that it is throwing small farmers to the wolves because land that should be kept for them is being gobbled up by people who do not want it?</P>

      <P>The acquisition of land was intended for the relief of congestion and to help the small farmers to whom the Deputy has referred.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it should be established at any time that the abuse to which the Deputy refers is prevalent, or is likely to become prevalent, at race meetings in this country, the governing bodies administering horse-racing here, namely the Stewards of the Irish Turf Club and the Stewards of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, have adequate powers of control under their rules.  I do not, therefore, see the need for the introduction of new legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister of State would know enough about the subject to know that the Irish Jockey Club are inquiring into the question because of the evidence frequently on television of the abuse of the whip.  Does the Minister not agree that it gives scandal to young people to see frequently exhausted horses being mercilessly whipped for sport by adults at race meetings?

Is é an cuspóir atá leis an gceapachán sealadach lánaimsire ná níos mó ama a thabhairt don Chathaoirleach le heolas a fháil ar na fadhbanna casta ar fud na Gaeltachta agus ar na bealaí is fearr chun iad a réiteach: dá mhéad eolais a bheidh aige faoi na cúrsaí sin is ea is éifeachtaí a bheidh Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbun oibre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the circumstances of the case sent to me by the Deputy.  A patient in private or semi-private accommodation in a public hospital, as distinct from a separate private hospital or home, is entitled to maintenance at a charge broadly related to the difference between the costs of public and private care.  Currently the recommended charges range from £9 to £12 a day for private accommodation and £7.20 to £9 a day for semi-private accommodation.  I would expect that public voluntary hospitals would charge accordingly for such maintenance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked for a statement and I have pointed out what the fees are and have said that I would expect the public voluntary hospitals to charge accordingly for such maintenance. These charges are not statutory charges and the authorities in the hospital in question have been told that if these charges were reduced any loss in income would be compensated for by a corresponding increase in the allocation to the hospital.  The position has been made clear to the hospital in question.  It is proposed to send a copy of a reply to the question to the hospital to raise again with them the question of standardising the charges with particular reference to the implications of the creation of what is in effect a private hospital area within a public hospital.</P>

      <P>The guidelines are prepared by the chief executive officers of the health boards and they are obviously prepared in consultation with members of the staff of the Department. Nonetheless, it has been the practice to allow the chief executive officers to prepare the guidelines and this has been found to be quite satisfactory in general throughout the health board areas.  They take into consideration variations in the consumer price index.  If the Deputy has any changes he would like to propose I would be prepared to take them up with the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that that is the situation.  The allowance for a married couple from 1 January this year was £47 per week, the allowance per child is £5, the allowance for other dependants is £6.50 per dependant and allowances for outgoings on the house in excess of £5 per week are taken into consideration. Other allowances include reasonable expenses necessarily incurred in travelling to work.  Other circumstances may be taken into account by the chief executive officer in particular cases.  The chief executive officers are doing this job quite satisfactorily.</P>

Patients who fail to keep their appointments are contacted by letter, unless they have indicated that they do not wish to be so contacted, or, in the case of female patients, a social worker will make appropriate contact.</P>

      <P>My responsibility in respect of the St. James's Hospital project relates to the provision of the hospital and does not extend to the clinical science building or the dental hospital which will be part of the development.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that the deferment of some planning of the hospital project has affected architectural staffing levels I do not have details regarding the staffing position.  The deferment of planning of the hospital had arisen mainly because of difficulties regarding the acquisition of a site for a section of the development and in relation to planning objections to the location of the boilerhouse.  It is expected that these difficulties will be resolved shortly.  The present constraints on public expenditure had not a very significant effect on the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the emergency ambulance and infectious diseases services in Dublin to which I understand the Deputy's question relates.</P>
      <P>There is a 24-hour a day accident and emergency ambulance service in the city of Dublin provided by the Dublin Fire Brigade in conjunction with the acute general hospitals in the city.  In addition the Eastern Health Board provide a 24-hour cardiac ambulance service with specially equipped ambulances.</P>
      <P>Plans have been agreed between the Gardaí, the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service, the Eastern Health Board and my Department to cope with any major accidents that may occur in the Dublin area.  This major accident plan has been brought into use on a few occasions and has operated successfully. It is reviewed from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Dublin medical officer of health is responsible for the co-ordination of public health matters, including the control of infectious diseases in the Dublin area.  The medical officer and his staff have wide powers in relation to the prevention and control of infectious diseases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down a question about the arrangements in those circumstances, I will answer it. The Deputy may take it that the whole <Col N="1870" /> city of Dublin will be covered by the emergency service and the continuing day to day service.  Those services have been working very effectively and I expect they will continue to do so.  In the cardiac ambulance service, which has only been developed on an experimental basis in the last few years, there are now ten fully equipped ambulances in the city.  The services are very effective and with any further developments in hospitals that effectiveness will have to be maintained.</P>

These projects are being carried out by, or under the aegis of the Medical Research Council, the Medico-Social Research Board, the National Drugs Advisory Board, the health boards and a number of hospitals.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department have set up a system of birth notification which, when it is fully operational, will help to identify the factors which may be associated with death and handicap in infants.</P>
      <P>I should add that while there is some evidence that the incidence of certain congenital malformations is higher in Ireland than in a number of other countries, international comparisons are hampered by a lack of standard methods for classifying these defects.  The Medico-Social Research Board are participating in a co-ordinated EEC programme to establish agreed criteria and common standards for measuring the incidence of congenital malformations.  The registers which are being established using these criteria will allow comparisons between countries to be made with greater confidence than has been the case in the past.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, there was a <Col N="1886" /> full debate on a motion regarding social welfare payments during Private Members' Business on the 6th and 7th May 1980.  The position is that generally all social welfare payments are being issued with a minimum of delay where claims are correctly made and the claimant is qualified on his or her insurance record for payment.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of supplementary pension books to pensioners, as I indicated in reply to a question on 29 May 1980, the position is that all supplementary books which provide for the budget increases have been issued to post offices for collection by the 330,000 pensioners in the country.  As I explained in the reply to the question on 29 May 1980, it was not possible, because of the short interval between the date of this year's budget and the dates from which the increases in the pensions had effect, to have pension order books at the increased rates printed and issued to the pensioners before their existing books expired at the end of March 1980.</P>
    <P>Payments under the various social insurance and social assistance schemes are governed by statutory conditions. Persons who satisfy the relevant conditions are allowed payment at the appropriate rate and persons who do not satisfy the conditions are so informed and advised of the reasons why they are not qualified for payment.  There is no question of persons being refused or deprived of payment while their claims are being investigated.</P>

      <P>The legal advice available to my Department is that a divorce effected by a foreign court of a person domiciled within its jurisdiction is recognised as valid in this country.  On the death of the man who obtains such a divorce the woman could not be regarded as a widow for social welfare entitlement purposes as she would not be his legal wife at the date of his death.

      <P>The Deputy asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will explain the position in respect of social welfare entitlements in the case where an Irish citizen leaves home and subsequently divorces his wife without her knowledge or consent in a member state of the European Community and then marries another woman; and if the first wife qualifies for a widow's contributory pension on the husband's death based on the record of employment while he lived in the member state.  The current practice follows the legal advice which has been given and the test cases which have been taken over the years.  The position is as I stated.</P>

      <P>Surely on collective responsibility the Minister's Department would be obliged to act constitutionally? What is the position when a person leaves home, as is the case here, and the deserted wife's allowance is being paid to the innocent party in the Republic when the husband is abroad and then when he dies they discover, according to the advice that the Minister has, that the person is not legally a widow at all?  Should that person have been paid the deserted wife's allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is quite logical where the wife would have been deserted under our conditions here for social welfare purposes in the first instance and given the conditions and the time which would elapse.  For instance, the following conditions would apply in deciding whether the woman has been deserted.  If the husband had left her of his own volition, she must have been deserted for at least three months, her husband must have refused to maintain her, she must have made and must continue to make reasonable efforts to get him to maintain her, her husband must not have resumed living with her and she must not be cohabiting. Presuming these conditions apply&mdash;in the case mentioned by the Deputy presumably they would apply&mdash;then she would receive the deserted wife's allowance from the beginning and would, therefore, continue to receive such an allowance.</P>

He is not, however, qualified for payment of that benefit as he has not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited employment contributions in 1978, the contribution year governing his claim.  I understand that the person concerned was employed by another Government Department and that his employment <Col N="1893" /> was in an established capacity since 1973.

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he will set <Col N="1897" /> up a fish marketing board to avoid a recurrence of the recent situation whereby fishermen were forced to dump fish due to lack of buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing market outlets for our fish landings as secured by private enterprise with market promotion assistance from Bord Iascaigh Mhara are normally adequate to dispose of such landings.  In the circumstances I do not see the need to establish a fish marketing board as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under EEC regulations certain species of fish which do not reach a minimum price level are withdrawn from the market.  Fish so withdrawn cannot be sold for human consumption and must be disposed of for other purposes such as fishmeal, or dumped.  The quantity of landings may at times exceed demand in which event some limited dumping may be unavoidable.  This system assists in the stabilisation of prices and guarantees as far as possible a fair income to fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that BIM are doing enough to look for new markets abroad?  Even though the Minister states that there is minimum dumping, he must agree that, since January, the amount of fish being dumped is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that BIM are doing a good job and I am confident that they will secure new markets.  Some factual information may be helpful.  In the past three months the number of tons of fish withdrawn was 1,508.63 tons.  That was all paid for by EEC money.  One thousand, two hundred and fifteen tons found their way into fishmeal or animal feed and the amount dumped, which was paid for too, of course, was less than 300 tons.  One would want to be careful about hysterical figures plucked out of the air by people to bolster a case.  It may be irritating, but it is not as serious as they would like to make out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the payment to which the Minister refers, is it <Col N="1898" /> correct to say that the payment made was a very nominal amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The withdrawal price is lower than we would like but, when one considers that, of the amount of fish landed, something over 1 per cent and less than 2 per cent has to be dumped, it is not a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not unacceptable to fishermen who spend their time catching fish that it cannot be disposed of and, from the point of view of the hunger in the world, is it not a disgraceful spectacle to see food being dumped when people are starving?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that fish are bought at a certain agreed price, even though it is a low price, must be a source of some consolation to fishermen in so far as they are assured of a price.  The withdrawal price may be low, but they are happy in the knowledge that the fish they catch will be disposed of.  With regard to dumping of fish, I indicated to the House before that it could be given to charity.  I made inquiries in my Department as to whether there was a single request for fish from a charitable organisation since this was last raised in the Dáil and there was no such request.</P>

Could he tell us what markets BIM have abroad, or what they are doing to promote and market this fish that is making an extremely low price?  This is uneconomical for the fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the sum of money available to Cork County Council for the repair of all the piers in west Cork&mdash;and they are a very big number&mdash;is only £18,000?  From the point of view of reconstruction and improvement which is the responsibility of his Department, is the Minister aware that this question of a report being called for from the Board of Works is something that has been told to the fishermen there for the last number of years?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that maintenance works are the responsibility of the county council and that additional facilities are the responsibility of my Department.  Cork County Council were advised by this Department on 6 February 1979 of the need for maintenance works at Keelbeg and they were asked to attend to the matter.  There was a sea fishery officer's report and subsequent requests by local fishermen for improved and additional works.  As a result of this investigation the Office of Public Works are preparing a report and they will need to itemise the amounts that could be classed as additional and those which could be classed as maintenance works and the responsibility of the county council.  As soon as that is done the work will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he has any proposals for the use of surplus woodpulp; and if he has examined the economics of its use to produce energy in the form of electricity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind the present temporary surplus of pulpwood arising from an international recession in the panel board industry.</P>
      <P>Prior to the recession my Department were already engaged in a study with the Industrial Development Authority to consider the use of increasing supplies of pulpwood coming on stream from State forests and a number of industrial projects for the utilisation of the material are at present under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the utilisation of forest thinnings, which are the major source of pulpwood, for the production of energy has also been considered.  A <Col N="1906" /> number of Governmental agencies, including my own Department, are engaged in a demonstration project, supported in part by EEC funds, on the growing of biomass, including forest thinnings, for the production of energy.</P>
    <P>In addition my Department are in consultation with the Electricity Supply Board on the use of forest thinnings in their smaller generating stations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a capacity for about 300,000 cubic metres of forest thinnings each year and we have an outlet for about 100,000 tonnes.  A cubic metre is practically a tonne.  The remainder would appear to be surplus but there are projects being examined, some of them very actively, regarding the utilisation of this surplus.  In addition, firms from abroad are showing an interest in these products and some of these firms have come back for a third time in this regard.  We hope to interest them in the processing of the material.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Navan College Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Martha's College near Navan has been a home economics boarding college operated by an Order of nuns for a considerable number of years and has been providing very valuable education for successive generations of young girls in home economics, agriculture and associated subjects.  Indeed, there has been a continuous demand for places in the college over the years.</P>
      <P>Now the Order in question have announced that they do not intend to continue to operate the college and that, as far as they are concerned, it will be closed down at the end of the next academic year.  This announcement has caused very serious concern not only in County Meath but in other parts of North Leinster where families had become accustomed to having the possibility of sending their daughters to this college.  I believe that both the Departments of Agriculture and Education have an interest in having this type of education provided.  The closure of a school like this&mdash;which would mean the availability of far less places than hitherto for this very valuable type of education, would be a very serious blow to the county at large; something on which the Government, whoever they may be should take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to my Question No. 63 yesterday the Minister said, in a written reply, that he would not deal with the matter there and then because it came within the ambit of the newly set-up <Col N="1928" /> body, namely AnCOT, to which he intended in the near future to transfer whatever functions he had in relation to this type of agricultural education but that, as of now, there had been no transfer of function and that therefore this was something technically at least the responsibility of the Minister.  Before transferring the functions in the way intended the Minister should make it clear to AnCOT that he wants them to keep St. Martha's College open.  Unless the Minister makes that clear to them I am afraid that AnCOT, with all the other demands there will be on their limited finance, will not be able to do it.  Quite clearly the purchase of St. Martha's College by the State, which is what is involved, will be a substantial capital investment. I am not aware that AnCOT will have the money, from their own resources, to make that type of investment; indeed I am almost certain they will not have such resources.  Therefore it is inevitable that, one way or another&mdash;even if it is transferred to An-COT&mdash;the issue will come back to the Minister for decision because it is he only who will have sufficient money to enable AnCOT to purchase this college and to operate it in the manner in which it is being operated already.  Therefore, it is important that the Minister makes his position clear now, to say clearly that he wants this college kept open.  I am asking him to make such a statement in view of the proven need for such education.</P>
    <P>Indeed it is possible that the role of the college could be extended to include agricultural education in the broader sense.  We are all aware that approximately half only of all the farmers who commence farming in this country at present&mdash;approximately 1,500 people take up agriculture each year&mdash;have had previous education in agriculture before commencing the management of our most precious national resource, namely, land.  At a time when it is being recognised that agriculture can prosper only with an educated, skilled work force, the prospect of a college that has been providing education closely related to agriculture closing down is something no one can entertain with equanimity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> I repeat my request to the Minister for Agriculture to give a clear direction to AnCOT to consider very favourably the acquisition of this college or the making of whatever other arrangements that can be made to ensure it continues in operation as an educational institution providing home economics and other educational facilities appropriate to our major industry, namely, agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me make it clear that I appreciate fully and value the contribution made for some 44 years now by the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul to the education of girls in St. Martha's College.  From my point of view it is indeed a matter of great regret that the Order find themselves unable to continue providing training in rural home economics at St. Martha's after 1981.  Therefore, I understand the desire of the people in the area served by the college that it should not close down, that it should be acquired by my Department for use as an agricultural college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are two important factors which must be borne in mind. First, Deputy Bruton, and indeed other Deputies, will be aware that the EEC measures for western aid have now been successfully negotiated.  Amongst other <Col N="1930" /> benefits these include the provision of 200 additional places at agricultural colleges.  This should make a considerable contribution towards meeting the demand for places at agricultural colleges.  The very substantial EEC grant aid for this, 50 per cent, makes it important that this expanded programme proceed with all speed.  The second consideration is that it is intended in the very near future to transfer the functions of the Minister for Agriculture, relating to agricultural education, to AnCOT. Therefore the board of AnCOT will have full responsibility for determining the needs of agricultural education including the provision of additional college places.  I would not wish to pre-empt the board of AnCOT in deciding to acquire this property.  For these reasons it is not proposed to acquire this property at this stage.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I believe the Board of AnCOT will give the matter every consideration in the near future and I hope a solution acceptable to all concerned will be found to this situation, which I know is causing Deputy Bruton and the people of Meath great concern.</P>
