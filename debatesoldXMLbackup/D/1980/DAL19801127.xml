    <Title>Social Welfare (Modification of Contribution Conditions for Benefit) Regulations 1980: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Social Welfare (Modification of Contribution Conditions for Benefit) Regulations, 1980, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft, sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, before Dáil Éireann on the 13th day of November, 1980, under subsection (4) of section 14 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, be approved.</P>
      <P>The necessity for these regulations arises from the introduction as from 6 April 1979 of the new system of pay-related social insurance contributions.  The new system involves, <i>inter alia</i>, changes in the contribution and benefit years for social insurance purposes.  Hitherto the men's benefit year commenced on the first Monday in June each year and the women's benefit year on the first Monday in December.  The benefit year for both men and women will in future be the year commencing on the first Monday in the calendar year.  The first common benefit year for both men and women will therefore commence on 5 January 1981 and the governing contribution year will be the income tax year 1979-80, that is, the year commencing on 6 April 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing contribution conditions for disability benefit require claimants to have not less than 48 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year preceding the benefit year in which the claim is made, in order to qualify for payment at the full rates.  Reduced rates of benefit <Col N="1475" /> are payable if the claimant has less than 48 contributions but at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Claimants who have less than 26 such contributions in the governing contribution year are not entitled to payment in the new benefit year.</P>
    <P>The application of this contribution condition necessitates examination of all claims to disability benefit before the beginning of a new benefit year to ensure that the claimants continue to have title to benefit.  Hitherto, in accordance with this requirement, all men's claims have been examined in April and May before the beginning of the men's benefit year in June and women's claims in October and November before the beginning of the women's benefit year in December. The change to a common benefit year for both men and women would necessitate examination of all disability benefit claims in the months immediately preceding January each year.  Because of the large volume of work involved in this exercise it would be extremely difficult for my Department to cope with the examination of claims without the risk of delay in the payment of benefit in many cases.</P>
    <P>The regulations now before the House are designed to deal with this problem by modifying the contribution conditions for disability benefit.  In effect they provide that when a person claims disability benefit the benefit year for that claim will be the year from the date of commencement of the claim.  Consequently, the rate of disability benefit applicable at the start of the claim will continue to be the rate payable for one year unless the claimant ceases to claim or the right to benefit is exhausted.  The rate of benefit will not be affected, as it may be at present, when a new benefit year supervenes in the first twelve months of incapacity.  At the end of this period the claim will be examined on the basis of the person's contributions in the appropriate governing contribution year.  Thus the re-examination of claims will be spread over the calendar year and will not have to be undertaken in the pre-Christmas period each year as <Col N="1476" /> would otherwise have been the case but for these regulations.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention also that these regulations will necessitate a Committee Stage amendment in the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill which was introduced on 16 October.  The fact that an amendment to the Bill is arising at this early stage of its existence indicates the need for speedy enactment of that Bill; otherwise, the task of the Joint Standing Committee on Consolidation Bills would be made more difficult and onerous.</P>
    <P>Regulations modifying the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit were approved in 1956.  The proposed modification for disability benefit purposes is on similar lines and is intended to avoid possible delay in the payment of benefit at the commencement of each year.  In the circumstances I now ask the House to approve of the Social Welfare (Modification of Contribution Conditions for Benefit) Regulations, 1980, in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister now feels himself to be extremely familiar with all the intricacies and provisions that will be enacted as a result of this order being passed.  I thank him for his long and comprehensive statement which I am sure has made him fully aware of all the nuances of this change.  If it has, I doubt if it has made the ordinary applicant for disability benefit very much more aware of what effect the change may have on his circumstances.  I should be less than honest if I did not confess that I find extreme difficulty in interpreting the amending order and in finding much joy or consolation in the explanation which the Minister sought to give the House.  I hope he understands it better than I do having listened to him.  It is slightly complicated to say the least of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the basic effect of the order is to bring about a change in the benefit year, to standardise the two benefit years between males and females, have them start at the same time and to bring about a rationalisation between them and the tax year.  What I was concerned about and what is probably the only explanation that the applicant for disability benefit <Col N="1477" /> would look for is to know whether the effect of the order may be that if an applicant is to be paid at the standard rate in the first year of payments and have his situation reviewed on the expiry of that year there might be a situation in which an applicant might have been entitled to an increase in benefit some time during that year which he would not get until the end of the year when the review took place.  At present he might be entitled to receive that increase at an earlier stage during the year because of an earlier examination of his circumstances.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that the Minister was indicating that, if a new benefit year intervened before the first 12 months of payment to a qualified applicant had expired, the effect of that new benefit year would not be taken into account until such time as there had elapsed a full 12 months payment to the beneficiary.  Therefore, in the case of the beneficiary who was not commencing with a full amount of benefit or if his circumstances changed in relation to benefit which might be payable to him in respect of a dependant, his actual weekly payments would not be changed until the first 12 months' payments to him had expired, after which time his case would be reviewed.  It seemed that there would be a possibility in that that beneficiaries might not get the amount of increased benefit that they might hope to receive for some time after that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the last remarks made by the Minister, what he had to say is an entire vindication of the remarks I have made on two occasions in this House and also yesterday at the Joint Standing Committee on Consolidation Bills, that is, that there is no point in endeavouring to rush through a consolidating Social Welfare Bill especially when that Bill has been on the Order Paper for more than three years and when one finds that already the Minister has to tell the House that the effect of this order will be to necessitate an amendment on Committee Stage to one of the provisions of the social welfare consolidation measures which the Joint Committee began to examine only yesterday.</P>
    <P>We would be much more realistic in realising that after the consolidation Bill <Col N="1478" /> has been put through the legislative machine at an ordinary pace it may be likely, as in the case of this order, that amendments will be necessary and that these amendments will have to be incorporated into the consolidating measure as it goes through the legislative process. If that means amending the consolidating Bill in order to give effect to the 1981 budgetary provisions, we must so amend it.  There is no need for the Minister to get himself into a flap now in an effort to rush through the consolidation measure especially since the 1976 measure was on the Order Paper from the time of the general election until last month without there being any attempt made to process it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give a guarantee that the effect of this order will be to bring more order into the complex labyrinth of social welfare regulations but that it will not have the effect in any circumstances of lessening the amount of weekly payment to a beneficiary in the week in which he is entitled to that payment. With that caveat, I would agree to the passing of the regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks which are very relevant in regard to this regulation.  The Deputy's understanding of this very complicated technical regulation is correct.  At the introduction of the changeover there would be some small adjustments whereby some beneficiaries would benefit while others would lose, but on balance the net effect is estimated to be an overall gain of £150,000 per year to claimants.  That is at present rates and with the present number of beneficiaries.  It is inevitable that with the change in the scheme there will be some marginal effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount of money paid in disability benefit is approximately £98 million.  In terms of this amount the level of the adjustment is very small.  The Deputy was correct also that the change is likely to bring more order into the overall system.  The whole purpose of the exercise is to spread the benefit calculations so that they can be done efficiently instead of having them all coming <Col N="1479" /> together with the introduction of this new measure.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question also of the consolidation Bill and said that this measure will necessitate amendments on Committee Stage.  Good progress was made yesterday in relation to that Bill by the Joint Standing Committee.  However, if we have too many amendments the technical job becomes too complicated. We must have regard to the fact that the amendments would be interrelated not only with direct social welfare measures but with measures which may arise under other Bills such as the Mental Health Bill.  This is one of the factors which caused difficulty before.  The number of amendments which arose during a relatively short time were so great that the Bill slipped back into virtual oblivion and necessitated a major task in relation to updating it.</P>
    <P>Even in getting the Bill back to its present state we had to deal recently with some 250 amendments.  There was a total of 1,300 amendments to be taken in. Therefore, I consider it important that this Bill be pressed ahead with and I am very pleased with the progress made with it yesterday by the Committee.</P>
    <P>The measure before us is aimed at making payments more efficient and in helping in the massive administrative task involved.  The current number of claims in respect of disability benefit is 67,000. This represents a reduction.  The administrative task involved in processing this number of claims is very great and involves repeated administrative work. Therefore anything that will facilitate this task is very welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed that the measure will have a downward effect in some cases.  Can he tell us what group of people will be affected in this way and what will be the extent of the effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference in money terms between the upward and downward effects should represent a plus of £150,000 to the beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1480" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But what will it mean to the individual applicant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that about 5,000 people would be affected on foot of the changeover, that is, both upwards and downwards.  The total loss of benefit could vary for these limited periods from 60p to £2 per week in the case of men and single women and from 45p to £1 per week in the case of a married woman. This would be for a limited period on average of nine weeks and at the time of the changeover only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would those who incur losses in this way be able to recoup the amount involved afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, If they continued the benefit for the full year they would recover the amount lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So, there would not be any permanent loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss would be only during the changeover period but the total effect would represent a benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a benefit to others but not to those who were suffering the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If they continued to be claimants or became claimants again at the end of the period, there would be a benefit to them.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £26,266,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and <Col N="1481" /> for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>My Department's original Estimate for 1980 was for a net sum of £234.864 million. This Supplementary Estimate makes additional provision for £49.766 million under nine subheads but there will be increased appropriations-in-aid of £23.5 million.  This reduces the net amount now required to £26.266 million making a net total for the year of £261.130 million.</P>
    <P>An extra £22.458 million is needed under the subhead A.  Of this amount £21.34 million is to meet pay increases, including the cost in 1980 of the first phase of the second national understanding. Here I might say that the staff of my Department, like other employees in the community generally, benefit under the national rounds of pay increases.  They also secure other increases in pay or improvements in their conditions of employment where these are necessary to bring them into line with comparable groups of employees inside and outside the civil service.  I would like to emphasise that all these increases in pay and improvements in conditions have been granted under the agreed scheme for conciliation and arbitration for the civil service.</P>
    <P>The balance of £1.118 million required under subhead A is made up of higher social welfare employer's contributions, increased expenditure on overtime, and the staff costs of a second television licence campaign, partly offset by savings elsewhere in the subhead.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £520,000 under subhead B is needed mainly because of higher subsistence rates and more travelling by engineering staff arising from the accelerated telephone development programme.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C an extra £10.34 million is required.  Of this amount £9.3 million is for purchase of sites and provision of new telephone exchange buildings and extensions for the telephone service.  The balance of £1.04 million is to meet increased expenditure on rents and rates and higher costs of light, heat and power.</P>
    <P>Under subhead D an additional £200,000 is required to meet the higher <Col N="1482" /> cost of conveyance of mails by rail.</P>
    <P>An extra £460,000 is required under subhead E because of price increases in petrol and oil used by postal vehicles.</P>
    <P>A further £11.66 million is required under subhead F mainly because of increased expenditure on engineering stores and equipment.  The extra provision includes £300,000 for price increases in petrol and oil used by engineering vehicles.</P>
    <P>Under subhead G an additional sum of £1.068 million is required for repayments to the Exchequer because telephone capital investment in 1979 was higher than expected when the Estimate was being prepared.</P>
    <P>Under subhead H an additional £120,000 is required because of increased subscription payments to international bodies of which this administration is a member.</P>
    <P>The extra £2.94 million needed under subhead J is required to meet the higher cost of pensions and lump sums because of the second national understanding and other pay increases.</P>
    <P>Of the increase of £23.5 million under appropriations-in-aid, all but £100,000 represents the recoupment from telephone capital funds of higher expenditure on telephone development under subheads A, B, C and F.  In fact, expenditure on telephone development will amount to £123.4 million as against the provision of £100 million on which the original Estimate was based.</P>
    <P>That £23.4 million extra proposed for telephone development reflects the Government's commitment to providing a high quality telephone service in the shortest possible time.  Improvements in the telephone service cannot, of course, be brought about without paying the necessary cost.  For example, the revised provision for subhead A includes the cost of about 1,000 extra engineering staff recruited this year to enable, in particular, the local cabling systems to be strengthened and more telephones to be installed in the years ahead.  More overtime was worked also this year to allow of more connections being made than would otherwise have been possible while awaiting the recruitment and training <Col N="1483" /> of extra staff.  Similarly, in order to provide more telephone connections, more stores were needed and this has contributed to the increases under subhead F.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall that in earlier statements in the House I referred to the streamlining of procedures associated with the provision of buildings, including both the internal precedures in my Department and in the Office of Public Works and between both.  This streamlining is bearing fruit and more progress is being made with a number of buildings than it had been expected would be possible. This, in turn, will lead to improvements in service in the centres concerned earlier than would otherwise have been possible and this will, I am sure, be welcomed by Deputies generally.  The speeding up of course has had the effect that more work will have to be paid for this year than had been provided for in the original Estimate, and this additional expenditure is now included in the increased provision sought under subhead C.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it has been possible to make substantial progress with the ordering of new telephone exchanges, both trunk and local, and with development of the trunk network generally, and this too has affected the expected out-turn under subhead F.</P>
    <P>These three subheads &mdash; A covering pay, C which deals with accommodation and F which provides for engineering stores and equipment &mdash; account for most of the additional money now required. As the extra money is needed mainly for telephone development purposes, I propose to deal briefly with progress on telephone development.</P>
    <P>Before I do so, however, I would like to preface my comments by repeating what I have said in the House and elsewhere before, that there are no instant solutions that will provide a better telephone service overnight.  It is a long haul, involving as it does, providing some 500 new buildings, replacing or extending all existing trunk and local telephone exchanges, converting about 480 exchanges, or almost half the existing <Col N="1484" /> number, to automatic working, strengthening all existing trunk routes to carry at least double the existing volume of traffic, adding to the overhead or underground cabling to enable the number of subscribers to be doubled, increasing the rate of installation of new phones from 40,000 to well over 100,000 and recruiting and training a few thousand extra staff. It will involve doing as much work over a five-year period as in the previous 80 years.  This is a formidable task.</P>
    <P>It is important that Deputies and the public generally should appreciate what is involved.  I have never given the impression, and I do not want to do so now either, that there are instant solutions to our telephone problems.  There are not.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs Review Group when reporting last year gave their estimate of the time required to bring the standard of our telecommunications service in terms of quality and availability up to the level in other EEC countries as at least five years.  That is also my Department's estimate. It is unrealistic to expect that substantial improvements can be achieved nationally in a short time; it simply cannot be done.  There are no overnight solutions.  But it is a problem that is being tackled with vigour, as will be evident from this Supplementary Estimate.  This year I set a target of 60,000 new telephones or almost 50 per cent more than the highest in any previous year.  Next year, the target will be 80,000 or almost double the highest achieved previously. That, I submit, is progress &mdash; solid progress.</P>
    <P>Improvements will come progressively, too, in the quality of service.  Quite soon, a new stored programme trunk exchange will be opened here in Dublin and will be brought fully into service over the following six months or so.  This will provide substantial relief for the Dublin trunk exchanges which are severely congested and will enable many badly needed trunk circuits to be provided on the trunk routes to and from Dublin and cross-Channel over the next six months. But, again, I want to put it on record in case of any possible misunderstanding that the exchange to be opened shortly <Col N="1485" /> will not eliminate all the congestion in the Dublin trunk exchanges.  The additional exchanges that will do this are on order and will be in service by 1982.</P>
    <P>New trunk exchanges are in course of installation or on order for all key centres where they are needed.  These include further exchanges for Dublin as well as major new exchanges for Cork, Limerick, Galway, Athlone, Naas, Tralee, Sligo, Drogheda, Dundalk and at some 14 other centres.  These will begin to become available from about the middle of next year onwards and will obviously bring substantial improvements in those areas, as well as contributing to an overall improvement in the system nationally.</P>
    <P>Side-by-side with this, the trunk circuit system is being strengthened.  New microwave links will be ready for service shortly between Dublin and Sligo, and will be extended to Letterkenny in the first half of next year.  A new link is due to be opened shortly between here and Britain to coincide with the opening of the new trunk exchange in Dublin. Microwave radio link or co-axial cable schemes are in progress or are on order for such routes as Dublin-Navan-Mullingar, Cork-Waterford, Dublin-Cork, Cork-Middleton, Navan-Drogheda, Westport to Castlebar, Bantry to Cork, Tralee to Limerick and an east coast link serving Dublin, Wicklow.  Arklow, Enniscorthy, and Waterford.  Most of these should be in service next year.</P>
    <P>This year, 18 manual telephone exchanges serving over 2,500 subscribers were converted to automatic working, and automatic exchanges to replace about 290 of the remaining 450 exchanges are on order.  These will be installed over a period of about two years beginning next year.</P>
    <P>International subscribers dialling was extended to Sligo and Athlone this year and this facility is being incorporated in new trunk exchanges being ordered.</P>
    <P>The telex service is one that is most useful to business and industry and this is reflected in demand which over the last year or so had been running at a record level.  As a result there is a backlog of applicants waiting for telex service at present despite the fact that the installation <Col N="1486" /> rate is also running at a very high level.  But it is planned to virtually wipe out the waiting list during 1981, and I am confident that this can be done, for this increased exchange capacity is needed.  A new telex exchange is in course of installation in Dublin at present and will be ready for service in the first half of next year.  This will have a capacity to meet expected demand up to the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>While, as I said at the outset, there is no magic formula for providing instant, overnight solutions for the problems of the telephone service, it will, I hope, be evident from what I have said that the problems are being tackled with the utmost vigour.  And while improvements in many aspects of the service will necessarily take time, solid progress has already been made and the fact that more cannot be achieved more quickly is due to the sins of the past rather than any neglect of the present.</P>
    <P>So far as the postal service is concerned. I am glad to say that regular monitoring shows that for the past few months over 85 per cent of first class letters are now regularly delivered on the next day after posting.  This represents a considerable improvement and my Department will continue their efforts to improve the standards of the postal service still further.</P>

      <P>As the saying goes &ldquo;You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time&rdquo;.  This sums up the Minister's term of almost one year of office.  Despite his extravagant promises earlier this year at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, and repeatedly here in the House, the fact of the matter is that the telephone system has, if anything, deteriorated, especially in the past year and particularly during the past three-and-a-half years, during the term of office of this Government.</P>

    <P>What the public want and expect is to see a concrete, definite, visible improvement &mdash; an audible improvement, I suppose, is the word in this case.  Such has not been forthcoming and until such time <Col N="1487" /> as there is a practical solution and a viable improvement, we shall keep on saying &ldquo;Promises, promises, more promises&rdquo;. We want to know when we will get results.  We on this side of the House have repeatedly supported the Government when they have advocated improvements in the telecommunications services.  We lauded the findings of the review body set up to investigate the workings of the telephone communications system and postal system within the Post Office.  We would like some tangible evidence that the recommendations of this review body are being brought into force.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The incidence of telephone breakdowns is far too high, of the obtaining of wrong numbers when dialling is far too high, of not getting a reply at all is far too high, of crossed lines or interference is far too high.  The whole system has not improved, but disimproved, in particular over the past three-and-a-half years and more so, I should imagine, in the last year.</P>
    <P>The situation has come to such a pitch that many telephone subscribers are making less use of their phones, particularly in the Dublin area and perhaps in certain other parts of the country as well, because of the inadequate nature of the service, because of the faulty manner in which it is working.</P>
    <P>This idea of installing tens of thousands of telephones each year is a beautiful concept.  Unfortunately, the infrastructure within the exchange network in the Post Office is not sufficient to meet the demand of a huge number of new telephones. It is no good the Minister promising at the Ard-Fheis or in this House to install 50 per cent more telephones this year than last year &mdash; he gives today a figure of 60,000 &mdash; unless those telephones and the existing telephones work satisfactorily, and they are not working satisfactorily at the moment.  The problems of the infrastructure should be tackled immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister is obviously trying to produce statistics which will show him to have brought about a major achievement. We on this side of the House would prefer to see concrete evidence &mdash; we <Col N="1488" /> would much prefer a tangible achievement. We would like to see the telephone system working.  There is no point in installing 60,000 more phones in 1980 if they are not going to work satisfactorily and if the existing ones are going to work less satisfactorily, as has been the case heretofore.  The frustration of the consumer is enormous and is growing.  The Minister is irritating the public, rather than assuaging their fears, by his promises of a greater and better service.  The first hand evidence proves that the contrary is the case.  We would like to see more money going into the infrastructure, into the provision of larger and better exchanges, better equipment, before trying to overcrowd the present exchanges.  That is basically the reason why the service has virtually collapsed in many areas.  We are trying to pump so many new telephones into an inadequate trunk system and the problems are accentuating the whole time and increasing to such an extent that in areas there is an almost total breakdown in service.  The Minister should not be so egotistic but should be practical and not try to produce figures which will make him look like the whiz kid of the Government.  I wish he were.  I wish he could prove that by getting the results, but he is trying to prove it by producing figures and not getting results, which is what we on this side of the House object to.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question here last week, despite the extravagant promises and despite the figures produced here before us today, it came to light that at the moment there are 94,000 applicants for telephone installations waiting to have their requests met.  When the Ceann Comhairle was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he was probably the most modest Minister in this House.  He did not promise 60,000 telephones in a year. He did not make such extravagant promises, but then he did not have such a long waiting list.</P>
    <P>Never before was there such a waiting list.  Of that 94,000 on the waiting list 26,000 have been waiting for two or more years.  I obtained that information from a reply to a parliamentary question.  That is an enormous number of people to be <Col N="1489" /> waiting for two or more years.  The Minister should not be boasting unduly or raising people's hopes when the situation is that serious.  Statistics are easy to read off.  The figure of 94,000 is just another statistic but it represents a huge waiting list, and when one considers that 26,000 of those people have been waiting for two or more years it is difficult to understand how the Minister can pretend that everything in the garden is rosy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I am exaggerating a little.  I will not say that the Minister said everything in the garden is rosy but he would like us to believe that.  He qualified all his statements by saying that there was no overnight solution to the problem.  Of course there is not but the Minister would like us to think there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no over night solution when one considers that some 26,000 people have been waiting for two or more years.  Basically, the problem is in the infrastructure of the Post Office.  I should like to see that problem tackled in the first instance.  We have been told in reply to questions that huge areas of the country suffer from breakdowns.  When it rains in Blanchardstown, Clonsilla, Leixlip the whole system in County Dublin goes wallop.  We would like to see a basic improvement.  What is happening at present is that thousands of telephones are being installed but they are not being connected.  People are paying installation fees in advance but the telephone instrument which is put in is left for months without being connected.  The Department are collecting the installation fee and the Minister is collecting the statistical kudos as well as the egotistical kudos but the telephones are not connected. When replying the Minister should tell us how many of the new telephones have been connected and are working.  I suspect that the percentage is alarming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my information from within the Post Office there is still a tremendous lack of the basic commodities needed for <Col N="1490" /> our telephone system.  Repeatedly I have been told by officials in the engineering section that they do not have enough telephone cable, the basic necessity for transmitting a signal or a voice from one centre to another.  They do not have the necessary stores, as they are called, and they do not have sufficient trained personnel to carry out the installations.  A lot of the chaos is due to that type of underfinancing.  There is little use in the Minister telling us that it was due to four-and-a-half years of neglect by the National Coalition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Partly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister some definite reasons why the system is chaotic and why we need infrastructure. Up to now we have not had a proper infrastructure because of the lack of money which successive Fianna Fáil Governments failed to pump into the Post Office network.  The allocation of capital expenditure for the telephone service went as follows up to 1970: 1960-61, £2 million; 1961-62. £2,400,000; 1962-63, £3,500,000; 1963-64, £4,500,000; 1964-65, £6 million; 1965-66, £6,500,000; 1966-67, £5,500,000; 1967-68, £5,800,000; 1968-69, £6,400,000; 1969-70, £7,500,000.</P>
      <P>Those figures are ridiculous in the context of a national telephone system and Fianna Fáil were in power in those years. In 1969-70, a mere ten years ago, the capital allocation was £7,500,000 and in 1970-71 it was £9 million while in 1971-72 it had increased to £11 million.  At this stage the Fianna Fáil Government were beginning to see the light of day and the capital allocation in 1972-73 for the telephone service went up to £17 million.  We first saw the light of day as far as the telephone system was concerned in 1973-74 and I do not think it was a coincidence that that was the advent of the National Coalition to office.  In that financial year £24 million was spent on the telephone system.  That is a multiple of what was spent by a number of Fianna Fáil Governments in the preceding 12 years, not just a 33 per cent or 50 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1974, when the financial year of <Col N="1491" /> April to April was changed &mdash; there was only nine months in that financial year &mdash; the National Coalition invested £24 million and in 1975 they invested £45 million.  In 1976 they invested £50 million while in 1977 they invested £54,500,000. We are all a bit fed up on this side of the House at being told by the Minister, and his Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, that the problems are as a result of neglect and under-investment by the National Coalition.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The National Coalition was the first Government to make a decent and realistic attempt to tackle the problem and the figures I have quoted prove that point.  We have heard such great play of this enormous phased investment, over five years amounting to £650 million by the Government.  In fact, the investment, taken at the 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 prices, is much the same as in those years.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy occurred in the preceding 12 years of Fianna Fail Governments when as little as £2 million was invested annually in the telephone system. I should like to see credit given where credit is due.  Credit should be given for the fact that in 1973-74 the first practical step to improve the chaotic telephone system was taken.  There is no use in the Minister in the House or at a Fianna Fail Ard Fheis craw-thumping about what he is going to do to revitalise, renew or improve the system.  He is merely continuing a trend which started in 1973 and he should not forget that.  I wish the Minister well.  I do not wish to be unduly critical but I have a duty to set the record straight.  We are all browned-off with hearing Deputy Killilea making incorrect statements in relation to investment in the telephone service.</P>
    <P>The present system is highly inadequate. As spokesman for my party on Transport and Telecommunications I am deluged with letters of complaints from people all over the country about the poor quality of the telephone service, the length of time they have been waiting for a connection, the impersonal response they get to their complaints and the fact that their claims about wrong accounts <Col N="1492" /> are not, in their opinion, properly adjudicated upon.  Obviously there is a serious lack in the Department in this respect.</P>
    <P>It may be due to understaffing but, to my mind, the complaints are due to a lack of personal contact.  This is not the first time I have made that type of statement in the House, and, despite the Minister's repeated promises to rectify the position, we have not seen any improvements in that regard.  I see no positive evidence that there has been an improvement. I should like the Minister in his reply to comment on the dissatisfaction which is being expressed by the public, and I should like him to tell us what he is doing about it.</P>
    <P>The basic reason is quite obvious.  The system is inadequate.  Some things can be improved without spending vast sums of money or without spending any extra money at all.  It is an attitude of mind.  A shake-up is long overdue and probably the people in the Minister's Department would be the first to agree with that.  They would be delighted to be allowed to have closer communication with the public.  It is extraordinary that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are the worst Department in the whole civil service system when it comes to communicating with the public.  That is deplorable and it should be improved.</P>
    <P>I will refer to that again shortly.  I was referring to the number of complaints I get from private individuals who have been waiting for four or five years for the installation of a telephone, private individuals who are frustrated by the inadequate manner in which their telephones work and by the number of times they get a wrong number or some other such problem.  Existing customers surely should be given a preference in improvement work, but that does not seem to be the case.  It is a by-word in industry that in any service the existing customer should get priority when the service provided is inadequate.  That used to be the case in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but it seems it is not the case any longer.  If you are looking for the transfer of a telephone to a new address the priority seems to have slipped.  That is bad enough, but when the exchanges are <Col N="1493" /> overloaded to such an extent that the service to the existing customer becomes inferior that must be a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us repeatedly that things are improving.  I suggest that he should read the letters in the <i>Irish Independent, The Irish Press, The Irish Times</i> or <i>The Cork Examiner</i>.  He should also have a look at the special notice columns in those newspapers.  Recently they have indicated that the service has deteriorated. This is not myself as the Fine Gael spokesman slating the Minister, but the public in general.  Today there is an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which tells the Minister that the time for promises is over and we should have some action.</P>
    <P>We have the diabolical situation that industry is suffering gravely as a result of inadequate telephone and telex services. To illustrate that point I made a note of the complaints in the special notice columns on the back page of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Each notice I refer to was a case where the company were apologising to their customers and to the public in general because of the fact that their telephone or telex system was no longer working and that they could not be contacted. On 14 October Skyway Couriers Ltd. made such an apology.  On 18 October a company known as the General Accident Company made a similar apology. On 20 October the Allied Irish Banks apologised to their customers because their telephone system had gone wallop.  The well-known auctioneers, Keane Mahony Smith, apologised to the general public for the same reason.  On 22 October the Allied Irish Banks Ltd., Foster Place, Dublin 2, apologised because of the fact that they no longer had a telephone system.  The Abbey Group Ltd. made a similar apology.  The Texas Instrument Company made a similar apology.  It was not that these companies had not paid their bills.  The system was not working.  They had not been cut off for any other reason.  Texaco Ireland Ltd. also apologised to the public.</P>
    <P>As always with complaints, these represent just the tip of the iceberg.  We are told that nine-tenths of an iceberg is under the sea.  If four companies saw fit to apologise to the public on the same <Col N="1494" /> day for the non-existence of their telephone service there must be 36 or 40 companies who did not have a telephone service but who did not think it worth their while to apologise or felt that the position was so hopeless that there was no point in apologising.  There never was such a list of complaints in a national newspaper until recent months.  There might have been one such notice in a year.  This is indicative of the collapse of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Go out and make the existing system work before you try to prove that you are the greatest, in the words of a well-known former heavyweight boxing champion.  Get the damn thing to work and forget about your glowing statistics and the boast that Albert is the greatest and he is the man who can deliver.  &ldquo;That is no good to the telephone subscriber.  We want a system that is seen to work.  All credit is due to the previous Minister, the present Ceann Comhairle.  He did not do any ranting or raving at Ard Fheiseanna.  He did not do any shouting or bawling.  He did his work and continued the good work done during the years of the National Coalition and things were going fine.  What irritates the public is that the Minister keeps telling them things were never so good. There is a touch of Harold Macmillan about him in that respect.  Things were never so bad.  If the Minister told the people the truth more often&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I always do.  The Deputy should speak the truth now and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and made fewer false claims, they would be more receptive and more tolerant about the deficiencies in the system.  We all recognise that there are deficiencies.  The Minister should stop trying to produce statistics to prove that the system is a lot better than it is and that it will improve faster.  This Government have been in power for three-and-a-half years and despite their promises in that time we have not had any improvement. We have had a deterioration.  In the four-and-a-half years from 1973 to 1977 things improved greatly.  In reply to a Dáil question put down by Deputy B. <Col N="1495" /> Desmond on 23 October 1979 in relation to the workings of the telephone system we were told that the number of telephone connections for the four years starting on 1 July 1969 to 30 June 1973 was 95,000.  From 1 July 1973 to 30 June 1977 there were 142,000 telephone installations, a more than 50 per cent improvement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same period the number of trunk circuits increased from 5,800 to 9,400, a 66 per cent increase. The mileage of trunk circuits increased from 270,000 miles to 413,000 miles.  The number of new telex lines increased from 1,086 to 1,839, a 70 per cent increase. The number of data transmission terminals increased from 42 to 392, almost a ten-fold increase.  The number of new telephone exchange buildings increased from 103 to 189 and the number of new postal buildings increased from 15 to 22. Those statistics prove that the first major leap in improving the telephone system occurred during 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relations between the public &mdash; the subscribers &mdash; and the Department are something about which the Minister promised to do something, but nothing has occurred.  When people engage in a financial transaction they go to the local bank and speak directly to the manager, the assistant manager or the cashier.  If somebody wants to deal with the ACC most provincial towns have an office that a person can go to, and a person can go to any local ESB office to discuss an account.  All national institutions have a front office where one can discuss one's <Col N="1496" /> problems, all except the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If one has a problem with the Department one is sent around in circles if one is lucky enough in the first instance to get through to inquiries.  There is no personal contact and that situation should be improved.  I am only asking the Minister for what all the other State, semi-State and private commercial firms are providing, an opportunity for the subscriber to meet somebody to discuss his complaint.  It is like a secret society at the moment. Where does one meet an official who will give a satisfactory explanation in relation to a query about the doubling of an account, for instance?  The time has come when the Post Office besides selling stamps, postal orders and sundry items will have to provide an on-the-spot inquiry service.  The public will not bite them.  They may bark as they do at all of us from time to time, possibly because we do not produce the goods.  People should be given a reasonable opportunity to express their complaints and have them discussed and to have finality reached.</P>
    <P>I have had to ask a number of Dáil questions about trivial matters affecting telephone accounts.  That is a waste of time, it is infuriating for the subscriber and it ends up that nobody is satisfied.  I have yet to see a satisfactory conclusion coming when people are dealing through correspondence.  It is not the way to do business.  When will the Minister redress that situation?  The Minister told us during the debate on the original Posts and Telegraphs Estimate that he would do something, but nothing has happened. The reply by Deputy Killilea to a supplementary question which arose as a result of a Dáil question on 24 April 1980 told us that in the quarter referred to in the question 72,000 queries about accounts had been raised by members of the public with his Department.  That is an astounding figure and it proves the gravity of the situation.  These queries were obviously dealt with in an impersonal manner.  That is not good enough.  Deputy Killilea also said that 15,000 of those complaints referred to disputed metered call charges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> How can we have a satisfactory service when we have that many disputed accounts in the one quarter?  Will the Minister explain the system whereby disputes or queries are dealt with?  There is not an adequate system to deal with them.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs will not provide an adequate service until they can give the public a reasonable opportunity to discuss their grievances.  It is impossible to do business with an anonymous person over the telephone. We all know from experience that it is far better to approach a Department and meet the people involved so that when we later discuss problems with them over the telephone we will realise that they are not monsters, and that they are human.  The Department should operate a system whereby the people we are dealing with can be met not by just Dáil Deputies or Senators but by the general public.  What we need is personal contact.</P>
    <P>The Department of Telecommunications is by far the worst Department when it comes to communicating with the public and with its own customers, that is, subscribers.  There is a huge breakdown in communications and, while we appreciate the commitment by the Government to spend £650 million over five years, there are other things which are more important than money and the main one is a proper attitude of mind.  It will not cost anything but a restructuring of the existing service.  It will satisfy the customer to a great degree and also those in the Department.  I pity telephone operators because of the unfair abuse and hardship they endure.  I put it down to the impersonal attitude adopted within the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as head of the Department, is the person to change the existing structures and I am sure employees in the Department, in particular telephone operators and those dealing with the public's complaints, would be grateful if the restructuring I am talking about were brought into operation.  Meeting people face to face one may get the occasional burst or insult but it is the best way to deal with problems.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister made reference <Col N="1498" /> to the recruitment of new staff into the Post Office.  It has been brought to my notice that there is a potential corrupt practice being brought into operation. I am not a man to make allegations lightly.  The source of my information is in a Department of Posts and Telegraphs staff magazine known as <i>The Relay</i>.  I am sure the Minister has seen it.</P>

      <P>September-October 1980. The contents of an article on page 20 must give rise to grave public concern.  It reinforces stories that we have heard and have been told about methods of recruitment within the Departments.  The article I refer to is headed &ldquo;General Secretary's Report&rdquo; and the subheading is &ldquo;Recruitment of Trainee Installers&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
      <P>The executive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I presume the executive of the Post Office Engineering Union, because this magazine is the official organ of the Irish Post Office Engineering Union&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>became aware that the Department were recruiting trainee installers from the last competition in an irregular way &mdash; i.e. they were not calling them in the order of merit as decided by the Interview Board.  The effect of this was that Number 27 on the list could be called before Number 1, and I am sure most people will be able to guess why this was happening.</P>
      <P>The obvious insinuation in that comment is political corruption.  I should like the Minister to reassure the Members of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Besides saying that there has been an exchange of correspondence on the matter the general secretary's report says that branch secretaries should furnish details of all recruitment of trainee installers in their branch area as soon as possible so that the operation of the agreement can be monitored.  They have insisted that people be given preference according to the order in which they appear after being selected by the interview board.  Obviously the intercession of the union has straightened matters out.  The first paragraph certainly would lead one to believe that things were not above board, to put it politely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that recruitment of a technical person such as a trainee installer, which surely is a post where people are selected because of their aptitude, would be done strictly on a basis of merit and of the applicant's aptitude for the job.  I share the concern of the Post Office Engineering Union on that matter that things were not being done as ethically as in the past.  I would like to ask the Minister what steps are being taken to improve the influx of qualified engineers from Irish universities and third level institutions of technology into the Post Office service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had repeated complaints from <Col N="1503" /> people in high authority that the number of qualified people is decreasing rather than increasing.  It is obvious that we need an increased influx of highly qualified people, but this has not been the case. We have a complaint from the National Board for Science and Technology that, to quote from Dr. Lalor, a director of that board.  &ldquo;There is very little co-operation between the Post Office, industry and the universities&rdquo; and he suggests that this should change.  If the telephone system is to improve, surely the acquisition of highly trained and skilled people is imperative.</P>
    <P>The statement by Dr. Lalor is disturbing. I am told also that in recent years there has been a tendency for the number of people from the universities and these third level institutions going into the Post Office to decrease because the financial attractions of private industries are so much greater.  I would like the Minister to let us know what plans he has to improve the salary structure and, as a result, the ratio of recruitment. Obviously there is no point in getting hundreds of millions of pounds worth of equipment unless you have the trained personnel at all levels.  We accept that the bulk of the trained personnel will come from within the Post Office itself up through the ranks to the engineering section. However, we need different levels of trained personnel and it is accepted that trained university graduates in electrical or mechanical engineering or whatever degrees or diplomas are necessary are needed, or at least a strong element of those are needed.  The Minister might tell us what plans he has to improve the present rate of recruitment from the highly qualified sector of the community.</P>
    <P>That is as much as I have to say on the matter.  I reiterate my opening statement that we have heard it all before from the Minister regarding promises of a better telephone system and an increased number of installations.  We have not seen any tangible results of his promises.  We want to see results.  There is no point in having telephones dangling without being connected up to the local exchange.  We want to see a telephone system that works.  We <Col N="1504" /> do not necessarily want to see a telephone system that is expanded out of all proportion and which only becomes more chaotic as time passes.  That, unfortunately, is the situation that pertains at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, the original Estimate was £235 million and we are told now that the Department need another £26.25 million.  By any standard that is a really heavy increase. It is an increase of £50 million when one disregards the amount set down for appropriations-in-aid.  In any case, it could be regarded as a hefty increase notwithstanding the fact that there is provision in the Supplementary Estimate for salaries and wages.  The Minister in his speech did not give us a breakdown nor is there a breakdown in the estimate except to say how much the national understanding will cost the Department this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, there is too large an error in estimation, save for the commitments that have been made.  This Estimate shows a requirement of £50 million over and above the original Estimate and that amounts to a quarter of the original Estimate.  The Minister cannot excuse himself on the grounds that when the Estimates were being prepared he did not hold the portfolio.  He was appointed Minister in December of last year, 1979, and I believe that at that stage the Estimates had been fixed and agreed upon by the Cabinet in either November or December.  The Deputy was Minister for three months before the budget was introduced.  It appears to me &mdash; possibly because he was not experienced enough, and I do not blame him for that &mdash; that he could have looked for much more money than was allocated to him in the Estimates agreed in the Cabinet in November or December of last year.  In the meantime it appeared to the public that he was on top of his job.  The impression was given at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, and we all remember his speech. I forget whether I saw him on television or listened to him on radio, but he gave a very good theatrical performance.  I do not blame him for that because that is <Col N="1505" /> what is required at an annual conference or Ard-Fheis.  However, he more or less ran away with himself, egged on by his Minister of State, who wanted him to up the ante all the time.</P>
    <P>We heard in a very dramatic speech a promise of 60,000 new phones a year.  I do not know what base year the Minister had, but he has not achieved that goal in the last nine or ten months.  We are to get 80,000 telephones the following year, followed by 100,000 telephones and then 120,000 telephones.  The Minister more or less retracted in his speech this morning when he said that this cannot be done overnight.  Of course, we would all agree that this is the case and we must also realise that the demand for telephones is increasing from year to year.  At one time only certain kinds of people had telephones, such as those involved in business, but now many more people need a telephone for social and semi-business purposes.  The provision of telephones will be a particular problem not only for the present Minister but to Ministers in the years to come.  Egged on by his Minister of State, the Minister was enthusiastic in his efforts to give the impression to me and others who watched the proceedings of the Ard Fheis that every person would get a telephone and if people did not want one he would force a telephone on them.  He is now very far away from those promises.  If the number of telephone installations is as far off the mark as his estimates, people will recognise that this is another Fianna Fáil promise which has gone wrong.</P>
    <P>It has often been said that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is the only Department of State which is equivalent to a business concern.  That being so, this Supplementary Estimate could be regarded as very sloppy indeed.  We are told that an increase of £22.5 million is needed for overtime payments and for the second TV licence campaign.  I should like to have a more detailed breakdown of the figures and in respect of the amount for overtime I should like to know whether this is to cover overtime working in the postal services.  The Minister expressed satisfaction with the postal <Col N="1506" /> services, but I do not think the House and members of his own party would entirely agree with him.  There is evidence of a gradual decline in the standards of the postal services and the main complaint is irregularity in deliveries.  I do not know how big a problem this is for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It cannot be the fault of the postmen themselves but rather of the system.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister would reiterate what he said regarding his satisfaction with the standard of postal services.</P>
    <P>Will the extra money being provided for overtime working mean an increase in the speed of telephone installations? Deputy Deasy has outlined in great detail the delays which are occurring.  The situation is still very unsatisfactory.  Apart from the matter of installations, the Minister should consider the whole question of defects in the present system.  It is almost impossible to contact the switchboard when one requires it and I find it extremely difficult to make a trunk call to my constituency.  When one dials a number one hears screeches and whistles and one is very lucky if one is eventually able to make contact.  Our telephone system is considered a joke by business people and visitors to this country, but it is not a joke for those people who have to use the telephones.  It is easier to contact London and various other cities in Britain than to make a simple call within this city or to some other part of the country.</P>
    <P>There is also provision for the free telephone rental service.  The promise in the manifesto to provide a scheme of free telephone for certain people was welcome, but we believed at that time that the promise would not be completely fulfilled for those qualifying for free television rental.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme is confined to people over the age of 66 who receive an allowance for living alone.  This is the connection with the Department of Social Welfare.  I would point out to the Minister that very few people have had telephones installed under this scheme. There was no mention of it in the Minister's speech, although I appreciate that he may have mentioned it in his speech on the main Estimate.  People who qualify under this scheme are very disappointed that as yet no move has been made to instal a telephone.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us how many applications have been received for this scheme during the past three years, the number approved and the number of telephones installed.</P>
      <P>There is also provision for the second TV licence campaign.  I believe this is necessary.  Those people who criticise the recent increase in the cost of TV licences are justified to the extent that the Department have failed to collect a very substantial sum of money which is owing for TV licences.  Quite rightly those who do not pay for their licences have been called &ldquo;spongers&rdquo;, but it is unfortunate that good citizens must now pay an increased fee because of this.  I would ask the Minister to tell the House what type of personnel these inspectors are.  Are they recruited from the Department?  Are they permanent employees of the Department or have they been recruited in a temporary capacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing I would like to mention in respect of that TV licence campaign.  A report about it appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> the night before last. It described an incident where an official of the Department &mdash; and I am sure it was an official of the Department &mdash; called to the house of an elderly couple after dark.  They were reluctant to open the door, as many people are, because of the level of crime and vandalism, thinking that it might be somebody who was going to demand money from them.  The officials of the Department should use <Col N="1508" /> greater discretion.  If they are trying to find out whether or not people have a television licence they should do so during normal business hours, particularly where old people are concerned because many of them are terrified when they hear a knock on the door.  I would therefore ask the Minister to ensure that these spot checks would be carried out in daylight as far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>The Minister and Deputy Killilea have got over-enthusiastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is infectious when one has anything to do with Deputy Killilea. There is provision for an increase of expenditure for An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom.  There was a very interesting report published a year or 18 months ago by a review body but since then there has not been any progress. There is a sum of money in respect of the work they have to do and the expenses they have but, in respect of this review group, will the Minister tell us what the next step is.  What are they doing?  Will there have to be legislation and if so when will it be introduced in Dáil Éireann? This idea of a separate board for the postal services and the telephone service has been acclaimed by many people.  We are told it will be the solution to all our problems in relation to posts and telephones. But we will only have to wait and see whether or not this is true.  There was in that report a statement to the effect that there has been a consultation or consultations with the trade unions.  But there will have to be very many more consultations with the trade unions because they are very concerned as to what their status will be if the new proposal to establish a bord Poist and a bord Telecom is adopted.  Perhaps the Minister will give us his views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all remember the last postal strike in the first half of 1979.  It would be agreed that it was a disastrous dispute and the type of dispute that this country cannot afford to have ever again.  For that reason I would like the Minister, in this discussion, to tell us whether or not there will be worker participation.  It is of vital importance if we are to avoid trouble or <Col N="1509" /> any sort of industrial dispute within the postal and telephone service.  As the Minister is aware there was a Bill brought through this House by the former Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary, and it has been successful particularly for many of the semi-State industries.  I would suggest to the Minister that the establishment of these two boards will not be a success unless there is worker participation as there is in many of the semi-State bodies at present.  Worker participation will ensure that at all times the view of the workers and of the trade unions will be presented to the board and that we will not have a situation where two sides will be facing one another in a long drawn-out battle to the detriment not alone of the participants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making a meal of it and I think the Minister takes my point. There is provision for sites and buildings in an amount of £10 million.  I wonder has the buying of sites and buildings been done, as was suggested in the review report, in preparation for an improvement in particular in the telephone service? It is well that the Minister should give us some sort of breakdown with regard to the purchase price paid for the land.  Perhaps he would let me know and let the House know.  Recently the Department of Posts and Telegraphs purchased a site, owned by Pearse's of Wexford, at Distillery Road.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me what was the purchase price.  I cannot understand why, in respect of the item for sites and buildings, there was an under-estimation of £10 million. The purchase of these sites and buildings must have been foreseen this time last year.  To come along a year afterwards and look for £10 million would make one believe that the preparation of the Estimates has been very sloppy.  That £10 million could have been provided for and should have been provided for in the original Estimate.  For some unknown <Col N="1510" /> reason it was not.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that as well.</P>
      <P>In relation to engineering stores and equipment £11.5 million is required.  That again shows an under-estimation by one-sixth. Why the Department could not have estimated what was required for engineering stores and for equipment this time last year I cannot imagine.  An under-estimation of one-sixth is pretty big indeed.  We are told that in respect of the £11.5 million it is to provide for petrol and oil increases but that would certainly not be the amount for that despite the fact that they have gone up steeply.  I cannot remember whether the Minister referred to it in his original speech, but perhaps he will tell us where the bulk of that is to go.</P>
      <P>Everybody appreciates that the telephone system must be fully automated. The Minister has said that this will be done and that there will be only approximately 250 exchanges left that would not be automated in another year or so.  But we trust that every telephone system in every district will be fully automated and that we will get away from the old-fashioned system of communication that we have in so many places at present.  The telephone service must be regarded as an essential service.  To some extent it should be regarded, where necessary, as a social service.   The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is the one more like a business outfit than any other Department of State.  I would appeal to the Minister that public telephones be provided for in local authority housing areas. In particular, when a housing scheme is being built by the local authority, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should move in to see that a public telephone kiosk is installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever there is a request from a local body for a telephone kiosk the department reply is that it is not considered to be economic.  Possibly it is not economic in money terms but consideration should be given to terms of human life.  There are vast housing estates and smaller estates in the provincial towns many of which have no public telephone kiosks.  I urge the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, <Col N="1511" /> to ensure that when a new housing scheme is being built provision be made for a telephone kiosk and that the notion of an installation of a kiosk in an existing housing scheme not being economically viable be disregarded.  In the present situation in Dublin, where crime appears to be rampant, the victims very often have to travel long distances to get to a telephone and contact the Garda.  The same applies in the case of fire.  In many Dublin estates I am told that even where it has been agreed to instal a kiosk there is delay of from three to five years.  There is a similar waiting period in the case of private applications.</P>
    <P>As far as my party are concerned the Minister will have our full support in any measures to improve the telephone system and the postal services.  It is a formidable task.  I think it would be agreed by the House that too little attention was paid to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over many years.  Ministers in that Department found it very difficult to get their colleagues in the Cabinet to agree to advance adequate finance to ensure that we would have proper telephone and postal services comparable to those in any country in the western world. Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Our telephone system is a joke, particularly with foreigners. We have lost industry due to poor communications.  It is a big consideration for somebody who seeks to set up an industry here when they are not impressed by our telephone system. Unless we can improve our communications systems we shall suffer as regards attracting foreign industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister smiled when I referred to his Ard-Fheis speech &mdash; at least he has a sense of humour.  I suppose that speech was made in the euphoria of his new office which was only three or four months old but I would suggest to him not to make promises that he cannot fulfil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the success story to date of the telecommunications system since 1977.  His predecessor inherited a Department that was in a shambles <Col N="1512" /> and the present Minister is to be complimented on his efforts to make our telecommunications systems the most modern in the world.  I congratulate the Government on providing him with the necessary money to do the job.  A sum of £650 million is to be spent over a five year period at present day prices.  By the time it is spent the figure will have reached about £800 million.</P>
      <P>This will not happen overnight but it will take a number of years.  In some areas the situation has been transformed and the systems are up to date and phones are supplied on demand.  We must be realistic, however, and I think the Minister is being realistic in saying that it will take three, four or five years before the entire country will be up to the highest standard.  Deputy Deasy suggested that enough money was being spent on infrastructure. That is exactly what is being done; the money is being spent on infrastructure. The direction and leadership being given by the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, and by the Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, has brought new life into the Department.  Cutting of red tape and getting through the bureaucracy has meant a speeding up in the whole Department as regards acquisition of sites for exchanges and the building of exchanges. Some 500 are being built at present and a further 480 are being converted.  These exchanges are being fitted with the most modern equipment of the digital type and in order to facilitate the work of these large exchanges and speed up cabling microwave links are being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Department are using the most modern methods for which I commend them.  This also gives the staff the necessary task of building up our telecommunications system.  I have spoken to many of the workforce engaged in installation and repair services and they are very pleased at the transformation that has taken place. They are especially glad about the increased availability of engineering stores and equipment.  I am glad that the Minister has included another £11.6 million under that heading.  That was one of the difficulties that caused frustration in the past among staff who wanted to see <Col N="1513" /> the job done.  It has now been rectified. The staff are anxious to get on with the job and provide the best and most modern system possible.</P>
    <P>Some of the major faults about which Deputy Deasy spoke were due to old cabling which, because of the design at the time it was laid, put the whole system out of action if it became waterlogged. That situation has been rectified with new cabling and pressurisation of existing cabling, and the problem will not recur. Leadership is being given by the present Minister and targets are being set, as must be done in any business.  The Minister's targets are not pie in the sky but targets that can be achieved.  I have confidence that this year his target of up to 50,000 telephones will be met.  The people on the ground are responding to those targets and for them reaching those targets will be an achievement.  Where extra workers are necessary they are being recruited.  I am glad to find that an extra 1,000 have come into the engineering side of Posts and Telegraphs this year.  This is a welcome development to ensure that the job will be done and done in time.</P>
    <P>In many areas telephones are now available on demand.  In some areas in Dublin in which installations are taking place, Post Office people are knocking on doors and asking people if they want phones.  Deputy Deasy spoke of the great backlog but this situation is being remedied. I understand that within six months people in County Waterford, for instance, will be able to avail of a telephone service on demand.  In regard to my own area of Carrigaline, I was very pleased to hear from the Minister this week that of the 320 people who are awaiting connections, 300 will be facilitated within six months.  This is a very happy situation in a town that is fast expanding.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that in areas in which new exchanges are being made available, promotion such as that which takes place in Dublin, would be continued and that all the spare capacity be put into production with the least possible delay.  In urban areas the Department might consider providing a caravan to be used as a promotion unit and at which potential <Col N="1514" /> subscribers could inspect the various types of telephone instruments that are available and discuss the range of services. In this way people would be encouraged, at the time of information, to arrange for necessary extensions and so on.  During my maiden speech here in 1977 I suggested that in rural areas which involve some miles of line for, perhaps, one or two subscribers, every house in the area should be canvassed with a view to installing the maximum number of connections instead of having to impose a heavy initial charge on the one or two people who had applied for service.  This should be much more economic than the present situation whereby five miles of cable may have to be provided for one or two subscribers.  With the modern equipment that is available eight or 10 people could be accommodated from a line that up to now accommodated one or two. We should make every effort possible to provide telephone service for people in rural areas so that they may keep in touch with their families and friends who are living away from home.  Farmers, too, need a telephone service for business purposes.</P>
    <P>Much money is being spent in the development of our telecommunications systems.  I take this opportunity of complimenting the Minister on his Make-It-In-Ireland campaign which is proving very successful.  The Department are now using simple every-day items in the course of their work that up to now had to be imported.  Even some highly sophisticated pieces of equipment that had to be imported in the past are now being made here.  A small enterprise in Carrigaline have proved very successful and are supplying the Department with manhole covers which also had to be imported in the past.  Industries such as these are responding to the encouragement on the part of the Government and are filling gaps in the home market.  Undoubtedly people from the developing countries will be coming here to see our modern digital communications system.  This system is likely to be the most modern in the world and in this regard it may be a blessing in disguise that we arrived late in terms of the development of our telecommunications <Col N="1515" /> system since we will be able to avail now of the best and the most modern available.</P>
    <P>Regarding the television licence fee campaign, I would suggest a system of ascertaining details of those who do not have television sets rather than the other way round.  I say this because there is a set in almost every home today.  It is very unfair to those who pay their licences to have to bear this increased cost because others are evading the fee.  However, the campaign is proving effective and the advertising that is taking place in this regard is a major factor in this success.</P>
    <P>On the question of television reception, there remain a number of so-called black spot areas throughout the country. These may be the areas that are given a low place in terms of RTE's priority. Perhaps the solution to the problem could be found in the provision of local, inexpensive, low-power transmitters or boosters.  I suggest also that local communities be helped in this regard by way of grant aid and by way of technical back up from RTE.  That might speed up the whole operation.  I understand that this type of system works well in other countries. I should like to raise the question of medium-wave radio reception in the Cork area.</P>

      <P>The increased demand for telex services is a reflection of the advances in technology and of the need in industry for better communications. Those people who are awaiting the provision of telex services should be glad to hear that most of the backlog in this regard will be cleared during 1981.</P>
      <P>So far as the postal service is concerned, ours is an excellent service by international standards.  The records show that more than 85 per cent of first-class mail is received on the day after it is posted.  That is a very good service.  I hope the postal service will deliver all the Christmas mail in time and ensure a happy Christmas for many people.  I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on the excellent job they are doing in their Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of all the congratulations expressed by the previous speaker to the Minister and the Minister of State one would think they were men with real power in the Government.  It rather reminds me of the Ayatollah &mdash; if one does not bow one's head to them one will not get the best service from them. At any rate, it appears that both the Minister and the Minister of State intend to wield their power to the fullest extent.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the campaign of the Minister and the Department in getting people to buy television licences. However, I object totally to the proposed increase in the licence fee especially as I come from an area where we get only RTE 1 and RTE 2.  When one compares the situation in other parts of the country where people have a choice of four stations, one sees that we get a poor service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I shall deal with our telephone system which seems to be continually out of order.  I have frequently put down parliamentary questions on the telephone system in the <Col N="1517" /> western area.  The dialling system is particularly bad &mdash; one is in a kind of limbo and one cannot get the connection one wishes.  In the 093 area &mdash; the Tuam area &mdash; it is impossible to dial any number.  On many occasions I have got five or six wrong numbers when I attempted to dial a local number.  Many times I have just left down the telephone after trying in vain to dial a number.  The Galway City area &mdash; the 091 area &mdash; is almost as bad.</P>
      <P>We hear from the Minister &mdash; and in my area from the Minister of State &mdash; about what they are doing to provide a service.  They start off by saying that they inherited the system.  We know it was bad but they have made it worse.  The main lines have not been improved, yet they have added many more telephone numbers and the result is even more overcrowding. The old subscribers are not getting as good a service as they had before and the new subscribers are totally disgusted with the type of service they are getting.  The Minister and his Minister of State think they are giving a present to people by giving them a telephone, particularly those who have applied some time ago.  However, this week I raised in this House the case of a person who applied for a telephone in 1974.  There have been three Ministers in the meantime but to date he has not been given a telephone.  I raised this matter in a parliamentary question and perhaps officials of the Department would check on the details with a view to providing a service for this applicant.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Reynolds was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs it was not his intention to attack his immediate predecessor, now the Ceann Comhairle, but to attack a previous Minister, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien.  At a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis Deputy Reynolds told the gathering that he would meet targets.  People should not fool themselves.  Pounding the desk or voicing opinions about leadership will not provide a telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 18 February 1980 reported the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis at which Deputy Reynolds spoke and they referred to opinions expressed regarding the bad telephone service.  On 23 September 1980 there was a leading <Col N="1518" /> article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> under the heading &ldquo;No Phones&rdquo;.  It stated:</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Mark Killilea, tells us all that &ldquo;in five years time we hope to be in a position to provide telephones on demand&rdquo; he does nothing more than to make tens of thousands of people moan in despair.  Bread today, jam tomorrow &mdash; is the present experience of large areas of Dublin City.  These are mostly new areas where the arrival of houses seems to have caught the Department of Posts and Telegraphs by surprise and where the people who move into them have to wait for years before they hear the ringing of a phone bell in their rooms.</P>
    <P>By what gigantic lack of planning did such a situation develop?  It cannot all be put down to lack of funds &mdash; after all the Department gets a huge allowance from the Government every year. So why are we so woefully behind in the provision of phones?  The answers are as various as the spokesmen.</P>
    <P>The present Minister cannot be blamed, of course, for a decade of slippage during which the number of individuals and firms waiting for phones actually went up, not down.  But he should refrain from telling us what we will have in five years time and explain to some of the more frustrated would-be telephone renters why they are not getting the service now.</P>
    <P>The business community, also, has had a bad time at the hands of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. How on earth can the Government expect firms to move to localities where securing a line out of the area is difficult? How many investors were put off when they discovered that the phone service was non-existent?</P>
    <P>The article goes on to say that it is no wonder people here talk about the system that operates in the United States, where you make application for a telephone and get it tomorrow.  No words of mine could express more clearly or plainly what the problem is.  The Minister should investigate the possibility of making available <Col N="1519" /> telephone kiosks in rural areas.  We have come to the stage where farmers who cannot afford a private telephone, or who, if they applied, would have to wait a long time, are at risk in an emergency situation.  Telephone kiosks should be erected in rural areas to serve 20 to 30 houses.  The cost would not be totally unbearable and the Department would service a lot of people and take off a lot of the pressure which is exerted on them by waiting applicants.  On occasion, when we have raised this question in the House, the Department have come up with the idea that one should get one's local authority to provide the finance for erecting the unit and give a guarantee that it would be financially viable, or something to that effect.  The previous Government were at the same racket, which is a handy way of dodging the issue, but this goes no way towards satisfying people at a local level.  I urge on the Minister to provide telephone kiosks in rural areas, particularly where there is no applicant for a private telephone.  This may go some way towards solving that problem.</P>
    <P>The telephone and telex system in large areas of the west is so bad that the Minister must not fully realise it, but the Minister of State does.  He knows that the telephone system in the area in which we both live is the worst in the world.  I had occasion recently to report my phone out of order, a thing which I could do every day of the week if I wanted to.  The official in the repair section of the Department in Galway admitted that they could do nothing about it, because the system was totally overloaded.  It is no good saying that it will come some time.  We know that it will come sometime, but the people in these areas at the moment are in great difficulty.  Something should be done and is not being done.  I am expressing an opinion on their behalf and trying to impress upon the Minister the necessity of providing these areas with the service which they do have to have at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of complaints about the telephone accounts system, although this has been denied here recently by the <Col N="1520" /> Minister.  The number of complaints about accounts is totally out of proportion to the number of consumers serviced by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. What people possibly do not know is that when they get a wrong number that call is recorded against them. People generally, as consumers, want to know the calls for which they are being charged.  I put a Parliamentary Question on this subject recently and I do not know whether these questions get the ear of this Minister or of this Department.  I want to know what I am being charged for and so does everyone else, rather than being presented with a codal system.  The Minister has stated that for a small sum &mdash; and I do not know what this sum would be &mdash; the numbers could be provided. Would it not be just as easy to provide the numbers at the start, as to have the codal system?  It would be a great lot easier, because when you ask for a number it is recorded and then it is transferred to a codal system and for an additional payment if you want to know the number the number is transferred back to the consumer. Everyone wants to know what numbers he has dialled.  If the Department included this information in the accounts, they would save themselves a lot of trouble.</P>
    <P>I conclude by wishing the Minister luck in the field to which he has been appointed but ask him sincerely to take a note of what I have said, particularly about the telephone and telex system of the western region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate which has just been introduced by the Minister has given an opportunity to this House to either, as the second last speaker did, compliment the Department and the Minister, or to voice a grievance. It is true to say that no Department or Government have caused more annoyance down the years to a greater number of people than the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  This goes for the present Minister and for the previous Minister. One listens to ministerial announcements and, indeed, to the contributions of some Fianna Fáil Deputies, which, may I say, are few because if there is something to <Col N="1521" /> be faced and trouble is brewing, they seem to run away.  That seems to be the norm of the party on the opposite side.</P>
      <P>I should have imagined that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who represent the same constituencies as we represent would have been as anxious as we are to voice their opinions and to bring to this House the annoyance of a great number of people with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  No amount of glossing over by the Minister or his Ministers of State will change that situation.  Indeed, it has been highlighted in the leading article of the newspaper quoted by the previous speaker, Deputy Donnellan, that nobody is being fooled by these ministerial announcements.  Particularly in relation to telephones, people know the service they are getting or not getting.  If I remember correctly about 12 months ago a Supplementary Estimate was introduced. I contributed to the debate on that occasion and I believe that, without going to the trouble of looking it up, I could repeat almost word for word what I said on that occasion because the situation has not changed.</P>
      <P>No statement by the Minister at dinners or elsewhere will change my mind. It is the people I represent who give me my information in relation to the service they get from the Department.  The situation is as bad today in my constituency as it was 12 months ago.  The Minister is getting a great press &mdash; he is following in the footsteps of the Taoiseach &mdash; and I do not blame him but my complaint is that through that great press he is able to fool some people into thinking that they will get a better service than they got from his predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that new telephones are being installed.  Why not?  We are looking for progress but in spite of all the progress the Minister claims he is making it is still easier for me to telephone my home from London, Paris, Strasbourg or Berlin than it is for me to telephone from this House and other parts of the country.  I can walk into a public telephone booth in Paris, dial my home number and get through quicker than I can get through from this House and other parts of the city.  The <Col N="1522" /> difficulty is not because my number is engaged but because it is not possible to get a line.  I have seldom failed to get a line to my home from a European city but I have often failed after three or four attempts to get through to my home from Leinster House.</P>
    <P>I accept that telephone receiving instruments are being installed in many homes but it would be interesting to hear the number of new connections that are made.  Another problem will arise when those new telephones are connected.  I can recall that when a big number of new subscribers were connected in Tallaght the existing subscribers had great difficulty in getting a line.  It is for that reason that existing subscribers will not welcome the news that a further 4,000 new phones have been installed.  They are fearful of the day when those new phones are switched on because of past experiences. There must be a reason for this defect in the system.  Telephones are being installed in spite of the fact that there are not sufficient lines at the local exchange to take them.  That is not progress.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Cogan state that telephones were available almost on demand.  I was not aware of that situation but I am aware that people have to wait years for a connection.  Deputy Cogan told the House that officials of the Department were knocking on doors asking people if they were ready to receive the telephone.  It is possible that they are knocking on the doors of people who applied for a telephone up to six years ago.  In my constituency many telephone instruments are being installed but have not been connected.  I am suspicious that the Minister is running hard for a deadline to keep a promise he made at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis that a certain number of telephones would be installed by Christmas.  Apparently, he is classifying the installation of the instrument as being equivalent to providing a service to the people.  People in my constituency have commented that the Department were decorating their houses with receivers but there was little hope of getting a line.</P>
    <P>Installing the telephone instrument is one way of collecting extra finance <Col N="1523" /> because those who get a receiver must pay a certain amount of money on its installation.  However, that is not a guarantee that a telephone line will be provided. Not so many years ago a line was given to the person who received a telephone instrument within a matter of days.  Those who have had a receiver installed recently do not have any guarantee that they will have a service by Christmas.  Based on the past record of the Department they may have to wait up to two years.  It appears that the officials, the linesmen and technicians installing the telephones, including those working in Deputy Cogan's area, are being asked to work every day, including Saturdays and Sundays, in a race to fulfil the Minister's promise to the Ard-Fheis of having a certain number installed before Christmas.  That will not make anybody happy.  The installation of the telephone instrument is only providing the children with something to play with.</P>
    <P>The Minister should investigate that complaint immediately and tell us when replying the reason why it takes so long to carry out connections, and why he is taking money from people who are under the false impression that they are now being connected to the telephone system when all they are getting is the decoration of a receiver in their hall, or wherever they care to place it.  That may seem to be a niggling complaint to some, but it is quite serious if, for the sake of bringing in revenue, a Government Department are now installing a decoration in people's homes.  I would ask the Minister to have this matter investigated.  He may not have the answer with him today, but he might let me know what it is.</P>
    <P>Complaints about the lack of telephones are not the only complaints I am getting about the service provided by the Department.  It would appear that they overlooked the fact that we were building a new town in County Dublin.  They are not the only Department who overlooked or ignored the fact that we would need extra services of one kind or another. Ten years ago Tallaght was a village of about 3,000 people.  At that time we had a post office.  It is no longer used by the <Col N="1524" /> Department, and they have been moving around from one room to another.  That post office was far bigger than the post office now serving 60,000 people.</P>
    <P>Could the last Fianna Fáil speaker tell me if that is the progress he talked about? I do not think it is progress.  I should like the Minister to take my remarks as a protest at the lack of consideration by his Department for this fast developing area. Will he find time to see what he can do to make some improvement?  I have seen the post office in Tallaght on children's allowances day.  It might be no harm if the Minister were to visit the Tallaght post office.  I would not advise him to delay there, but he could pass it on the first Tuesday of the month when children's allowances are being paid, and he could check it out that I am giving him the facts.  We have a much smaller post office serving 60,000 people in Tallaght today than we had ten years ago serving 3,000 people.</P>
    <P>I asked this Minister, his predecessor and the previous Minister to provide an emergency telephone service for new housing estates in County Dublin.  His predecessor gave me an undertaking that he would consider providing at least one telephone kiosk in the large new housing estates in south and west County Dublin. I am quite sure his predecessor, who is now the Ceann Comhairle, was serious when he said he would give consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>Many new housing estates have been built since then and it is still the same old story.  People apply for a telephone when they purchase their house and they have to wait until private telephones are being installed before a public telephone arrives.  The Minister will say this is a matter of cost, and that if he runs one line to an estate he might as well run 100 lines.  We have had instances in County Dublin where a great deal of fire damage was done and people's homes were burned.  Much of that damage could have been prevented if a telephone had been at hand.  Apart from the length of time it takes for a fire tender to get to these new housing estates, it also takes time to alert the fire brigade to the fact that they are needed.  We had one very serious incident <Col N="1525" /> which I put on the record of the House and I will not repeat it.  We had another not quite as serious since then.</P>
    <P>It is a serious matter that housing estates are being provided in County Dublin without these essential services. There was a time when a telephone was not considered essential, but it is essential today.  Perhaps that is dealing with it on a parochial basis.  I could talk for an hour about the inconvenience caused by the lack of a telephone service.  In my records I have the names of people who were unable to set up in business because they could not get a telephone, and people who could not transfer their business to a better or more convenient premises because they could not have their telephone transferred.  Very often the transfer was to be made to another place within a mile in one of the built-up areas. That is deplorable.</P>
    <P>People were prepared to expand their business and give further employment, but the lack of a telephone prevents them.  I know many instances of people who wanted to move their business to improve it and to give more employment. They could not do so because the Department for which the Minister is responsible could not give them a telephone service. That is hard to imagine in 1980, when jobs are so precious, and when it is so important to get people off the unemployment register.  The Minister's Department can take some of the blame for the high rate of unemployment.  That may be hitting the Minister fairly hard, but if he checks out what I have said he will realise that it is correct.  He may not like to think that he shoulders the responsibility for so many people being on the unemployment list.  I say it with regret because that is my experience.</P>
    <P>Last year I appealed to the Minister to consider reducing the price of the stamp for Christmas cards.  The Minister should seriously consider it this year because due to high costs people are getting out of the habit that has been prevalent here for centuries of sending Christmas greetings to their friends.  The cost this year will be even higher as it costs 35p to buy a Christmas card and a Christmas card worth sending cannot be had for under 20p. <Col N="1526" /> That is not the Minister's responsibility. I understand that it has something to do with the exchange rate between sterling and the punt.  The Minister could encourage the sending of cards by reducing the cost of postage.  It would be a nice gesture that probably would not mean a reduction in the Department's income because people would probably send more cards.</P>

Evasion is a form of protest &mdash; I have to bring services into it whether the Chair likes it or not &mdash; at the services people are getting.  Only this morning some people were interviewed on the radio and they indicated that if they got a better television service they would have no hesitation in paying the licence fee.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to leave it there because I have already shot down every other Deputy who spoke on the thing.  We cannot go into television or RTE.  There is nothing in the Estimate, only money to continue the campaign to make people pay up for their licences.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is important. If the Minister were to reduce the cost of television licences instead of increasing it practically everybody would pay it. Something in the region of £3 million to £4 million has been lost to the Department simply because licences are not being paid.  It might not be easy for the Minister to make strides in improving the programmes or the services but he would have a strong say in reducing the cost of television licences.  It is generally felt that <Col N="1527" /> if one pays the licence fee one is subsidising his next door neighbour.  That is not a healthy situation and the whole problem stems from the fact that people feel that they are not getting value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm to look at where the problem stems from.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan talked about progress in the Department but there has not been progress in relation to the re-location of the sub post office at Firhouse.  Twenty years ago the Department would not have put a post office where it has just been put and we had far less traffic then. The Minister and the Department in having this sub post office moved from its original location are forcing their employees to break the law because to collect or to deliver to that post office the vans must stop at a continuous white line only ten or 20 yards from a major junction where there are traffic lights.  If I parked there I would be summonsed but they park there all the time and they are adding to the hold up of traffic on the Firhouse road.  The Department say that they had no alternative, that the sub post master had resigned and that they had searched the shopping centre for an alternative location.  The Department were not serious about looking for a location in the shopping centre.  One area there is available and the people who are running the centre are having difficulty in opening some kind of business.  It is small enough to be considered by the Minister and large enough to give the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who wishes to use the post office now would have to travel a mile from the shopping centre, even if they only wanted a stamp.  Effectively the Minister have reduced post office services to the people of Tallaght by moving the sub post office to its present location.  I am sure the record of the post office will show a reduction in the number of people using it because of the move.  When the <Col N="1528" /> post office was opened two or three years ago the residents of the housing estates on the Old Bawn Road welcomed it.  It meant that they did not have to go to the overcrowded post office in Tallaght. They crossed the river down to Firhouse.</P>
    <P>That facility has been denied to them now and if they come to shop at the Firhouse shopping centre they will not travel a mile for it.  Also the footpath is little more than two feet wide and if a person with a pram who has used the post office happens to be coming back and another person with a pram is coming to use it one pram must go out on that very busy narrow road.  I voiced my protest about this as I have received upwards of 100 letters from people there not to speak of the numbers of people from Tallaght who wrote to me about the moving of the post office.  Would the Minister take what steps he can to have it relocated in a more convenient position back in the shopping centre at Firhouse?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing that strikes me is how quiet everyone is when we are talking about a Supplementary Estimate for practically £50 million.  As far as most Ministers in Fianna Fáil are concerned, their full Estimate does not even approach the figure we are speaking about here for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of this year the Minister got £234 million for his Department and now he is looking for another £50 million.  It just goes to show the type of spiralling costs the country is facing.  I hope the press and the media generally will not be so silent when it comes to speaking this evening about this massive Supplementary Estimate.  To give a breakdown, £22½ million is for pay increases, £22½ million is for pay increases, £9½ million for the costs of developing different sites, £1¼ million for the cost of delivering mail by rail, £¾ million for petrol with regard to maintenance vans and postal deliveries and £3 million for pensions &mdash; 20 per cent of an increase since the beginning of 1980.  Everyone should be concerned at the way inflation is ruining the country <Col N="1529" /> especially with an Estimate as massive as this one.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the telex service.  In the county I come from, which is far removed from Dublin, the telex service is an urgent priority.  We have been very disappointed over the last year with this.  Industrialists who applied for this service are waiting in some cases for three years.  The delay in other cases is one or two years.  The Minister has given a commitment that by the end of 1981 there should be ample telex services throughout the country and I hope his wishes are fulfilled.  We cannot emphasise how important these facilities are to industries at present.</P>
    <P>As regards the telephone radio service which goes under the heading of CB radios, I understand the Minister intends to bring in legislation to deal with this system.  I welcome that and hope he will keep in mind the interests involved.  A lot of these people are giving a good service at present.  I recently came across cases where there were car accidents and it was only because we had this service that ambulances and fire brigades were brought out very promptly.  What the Minister is probably worried about, as are other people, is that it should be given a four watt system on AM.  If my information is wrong the Minister can correct me when he is replying but rumour has it he is asking them to change to FM rather than AM.  I am not an expert but the advice I have been given was given to me by an expert who maintains that if they could be left on AM it does not interfere with ambulance services or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the Deputy to deal with it but this requires legislation and he cannot deal with legislation on an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I would like the Minister to see that there is a four-watt system introduced on AM and also on SSB and not bring in the wrong kind of legislation which rumour has it he intends to bring in.  Perhaps the Minister could mention that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies, and the Minister as well, I am very concerned at the number <Col N="1530" /> of representations we are getting as regards telephone installations.  Today I got 17 replies, very nice letters, stating that they are being looked into.  As far as proposed telephone subscribers are concerned, they are not interested in it being looked into, any more than I am, but in getting the connection.  In such cases phones have been installed but one could be waiting weeks before getting a connection. Perhaps the Minister would check on this.  There is no point in putting in phones unless they can be connected immediately.  It is causing &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; on top of &ldquo;aggro&rdquo;.  This time last year there was the excuse that the Pope's visit took up all the cables and so we could not have any new lines.  The Pope paid his visit and has departed.  We are another year further on and are still waiting for a lot of these urgent lines.  They are particularly needed in the ribbon developments around our towns.  Money does not seem to be available to extend these lines to such developments.</P>
    <P>The greatest number of complaints I get as a Deputy at present come from people waiting for telephone connections. I know that the Minister states he is increasing them from 40,000 to 60,000 by the end of 1980.  Are all these new connections going to the cities and is rural Ireland being left last on the list?  Old age pensioners are entitled to free phones and rightly so.  If they are living alone it is only right that they should be able to contact relatives or a doctor.  Many of them have applied for phone connections and they have to wait and wait.  Whether it is money that is not available or lines I do not know.  I had a case where there are no manual telephones available in Donegal.  These people should be given priority.  There is no point telling them there is a free phone scheme when we cannot give them a phone.</P>
    <P>Touring around the country I have come across the horrible sight of big black poles in the heart of scenic areas.  When the Minister is driving around he should look out for them and not allow them to interfere with scenic beauty.  I was in County Clare recently and was horrified to see hundreds of these big black monuments against society erected in the <Col N="1531" /> heart of the Burren country.  There should be some way the lines could be kept underground when they interfere with scenic views.  If any of us want to extend any kind of building in the slightest way we must apply to the local authority for permission to do so.  Yet the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has authority to sanction these monstrosities of poles in areas where they should not be.  It is very serious.  They should not be erected.  When the Minister is replying I would appreciate if he would mention this and write to me with regard to the Burren country and tell me why the Department have erected these poles.  I have seen this also in Donegal but not as markedly as when I was driving down in the Burren.  I was horrified that we talk about looking after scenic views and the tourist industry and yet these things have been there for generations.</P>
    <P>To return to Donegal, we have three main problems there.  Firstly, even a county as large as Donegal and as far away from Dublin still is not fully automatic. I have had questions down to different Ministers from time to time and I do not think that the Minister even now can tell us when the county of Donegal will be completely automatic.  I hope it is not a matter of the cities, particularly on the east coast, getting priority while places like the west and the north of Donegal are low on the priority list and it will take four, five or maybe ten years before a great part of those areas are automatic.  The Minister can say that a new telephone exchange has been opened in Letterkenny and another in Donegal, but the one good thing about the last by-election is that it showed a lot of the Ministers the problem we have in a vast county like Donegal particularly with communications.  At least it brought home to the Minister how neglected we have been in County Donegal for generations. I would like a commitment from the Minister that within the shortest time possible &mdash; and I am a realist say two or three years &mdash; Donegal will be completely automated.  We would be happy with that because not only have we trouble with the manual service but we have trouble <Col N="1532" /> also with the night service and a lot of the phones are on party lines whereby up to five people could share a night line or party line, and that is completely unsatisfactory. The only answer to that is that faraway areas that need night service most should be given priority.</P>
    <P>Regarding automatic phones, recently when I was abroad I saw a very good system whereby at the top of the automatic phones there was a sliding slot. Maybe the Minister has seen this on his travels abroad.  You place the money in the sliding slot and as you speak the money drops in automatically.  When we are buying new equipment we should, like any other business concern, be looking for new ideas for our post and telegraph services.  The system in other countries is very efficient compared to that in Ireland.  The system we have at present is not the most efficient, and if you put 10p or 20p into the slot and the operator cuts you off you put in another 20p.  A more automatic system would probably be much cheaper in the long run.</P>
    <P>Another matter that always strikes me when I am abroad is how easy it is to contact home from abroad.  No matter where you are abroad it is possible to contact home in about three minutes, yet in the House of Parliament here, Dáil Éireann, Kildare Street, if you want to phone west Cork, Clare or Donegal, it often takes half an hour to get a reply with the present system.  I am not blaming the girls who answer the telephones.  I do not know under what kind of pressures they are working.  I blame the system. Something is wrong when you dial 10 and then have to wait half an hour for somebody to answer and maybe another half an hour to get your call through and perhaps after that hour the girl will tell you that the lines are engaged.  Nothing is more frustrating than to get that type of service.</P>
    <P>In the country particularly there is lack of telephone kiosks, especially in the new ribbon development areas.  I understand what the Minister is trying to do.  He is trying to erect only telephones which are going to pay, particularly in rural Ireland. Here there are two things he must look at.  Firstly, a telephone kiosk should be <Col N="1533" /> erected where we have this ribbon development spreading out from the different towns and villages.  People should not have to cycle or maybe walk five, six and seven miles to get to a telephone kiosk in the heart of the country.  Nobody should have to walk such distance to get to a telephone kiosk.  It is not good enough for the Minister to write to the different councils asking them to underwrite the loss incurred by these rural telephones. We give a social service in the free telephone service for the old.  Surely country people who have to walk four, five and six miles to get a telephone service should get some consideration.  Recently in Glencolmbkille, County Donegal, the post office closed, and the telephone lines went as far as the post office.  Even to this date the Department have not erected a telephone box outside the original post office where the lines and so forth are available.  People in that area had to walk seven miles to get to a telephone.  When the Ministers were in Donegal it is a pity that the State cars were not taken from them for a few days so that they would have had to walk six or seven miles to the nearest telephone box to make an urgent telephone call for a doctor, a vet or an ambulance.  Again I ask the Minister to consider this type of thing.  He is from the country and he knows what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be interested to hear me criticise the way the Department are sending out the telephone bills.  We talk about saving money, and there is money to be saved as far as telephone bills are concerned.  It is coming to the stage that I am afraid for my life when the next telephone bill will come.  I received the last one about six months ago.  A far more up-to-date system of sending out telephone bills should be introduced.  The present system is not efficient.  The Department are behind time with the bills and the longer the bills are delayed the larger they become and the more revenue goes out.  The Minister should see if he cannot have a far more up-to-date system for sending out bills immediately at the end of the two-month period or whatever the case may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> As I said at the start of my speech, we must all be shocked to think of a Minister bringing a Supplementary Estimate of £50 million or a 20 per cent increase for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I will be the first to admit that we need a good telephone service, but the cost is spiralling and spiralling and I am very concerned at an Estimate of that size being brought before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the Estimate.  As Deputy White pointed out it is a very substantial Estimate, a lot of it due to inflation which is something that will have to be tackled. While the Minister has collective responsibility for inflation, I do not intend to nail him on this point.  In my dealings with him he has been most courteous and efficient.  He has a very difficult task.  We should not concentrate on comparisons between the performance of one Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> another.  The performances of all of us have not been very great and as a result we are lagging behind all European countries in our telephone service.  I will not apportion blame between the present Minister and his predecessors, the present Ceann Comhairle and Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien.  It is a pity that a greater proportion of the money available could not be allocated to bring our telephone service into line with that of our competitors, and I know this is what the Minister wishes.</P>
      <P>Everybody who is in business knows that a good telephone service is vital. Unfortunately, we still have a situation where many small businesses must operate without a telephone because, we are told, of heavy pressure of line work.  It is not as if the businessman is looking for a grant or a hand-out; he will have to pay for a telephone.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy's comments about the recruitment of young people to the Department are not without foundation. The Minister must consider the political implications of the placing of these people. There is some unrest about this matter and I should be interested to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of temporary mobile <Col N="1535" /> exchanges would help to improve the telephone situation.  Initially some of the Japanese exchanges did not work very well and as a result there is some nervousness about them.  However, I have talked to people abroad and they tell me that over the past 12 months these mobile exchanges have been vastly improved. Where there is a developing situation, as in parts of Cork, the demand is massive and the only solution is the provision of mobile exchanges.  We need not have any fears about them.  Of course, there are problems relating to line work but many of the present problems lie in the exchange.</P>
    <P>Industrialists and businessmen talk very freely about the poor quality of our telex and telephone systems.  Picking up a telephone in this House is like listening to the Tower of Babel and one might as well be on CB Radio as far as privacy is concerned.  I am consistently careful about what I say on the telephone and certainly would not engage in a confidential conversation.  When trying to make a telephone call at home it is not uncommon inadvertently to overhear someone making a date with his girl friend or discussing some personal matter.  Obviously there are some technical problems.  On a damp morning it is sometimes impossible to get a line from my house.  I have complained several times about this matter without reaching a satisfactory conclusion. On occasion I have been unable to contact Dublin by telephone for half a day.</P>
    <P>As the Fine Gael spokesman on tourism I meet many people involved in the tourist industry and they are still talking about the damage caused by the postal dispute.  They also have great difficulties in communicating with agencies abroad. It is easy enough to phone Ireland from Athens or Strasbourg but not the other way around.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion from time to time on the subject of telephone kiosks and the damage caused by vandals. I suggested long ago that in housing estates such as Elsinore Heights in Midleton a telephone kiosk similar to that provided by the Automobile Association <Col N="1536" /> should be provided and every resident given a key.  The kiosk would be locked and would be for the use of local residents only.  They would respect it and treat it as part of their own property.  I have yet to open an AA kiosk and find it out of action or vandalised.  If I achieve nothing else today, perhaps I could persuade the Minister to consider this suggestion. There is no point in asking any county council to bear the responsibility for telephone kiosks.  Cork County Council have not enough money to build houses and look after the roads.  The Department must shoulder the responsibility, and they will get plenty of money from the kiosks if they do not have to be repaired.</P>
    <P>Regarding the postal service, I would agree that there has been an improvement in deliveries.  However, in some mysterious way letters are disappearing all the time and I would like to get to the root of this.  Documents that have been posted from Dublin have never arrived at their destination.  I will give one example that can be followed up.  It is so vital because a man lost a vast quantity of money as a result.  An Ordnance Survey map that was posted to a man in September never arrived.  I would like if that one example could be taken up by the Minister. I will give him the name.  That is what I mean by inefficiency somewhere along the line because this must be a fairly substantial envelope.  But where on earth is it?</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make involves complimenting the Minister.  I have quite a lot of dealings here and, along with other Deputies, I make representations to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, in regard to telephones. We get replies which are sometimes good and leave the constituent happy.  But I had an experience recently where a constituent went to the Cork office and was told that because of political representations the file was now in Dublin, almost indicating that if political representations had not been made the matter would have been attended to.  This is very serious, and it has happened more than once. Let me make it clear that as long as I am elected I have a right to make political <Col N="1537" /> representations and get a reply.  I am not going to be put off by this sort of behaviour. When I rang the Minister in connection with a local industry which had got that sort of treatment that industry got a telephone the following day.  I was very pleased about that.  If ever we get back into government that would be my idea of how political representations will be met; they will be dealt with efficiently and the staffs in Cork and Dublin and everywhere else should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>In relation to CB radio, I am very much in favour of it.  There will be a certain amount of tidying up needed.  I would like to see well in advance what the Minister has in mind.  This is an area where we should get together.  It is a pity that in this House, unlike the European Parliament, everything has to be decided on one side of the House and everybody on this side cuts it to pieces.  It is a pity in non-controversial areas we cannot get together and have the joint help and advice of all parties.  We are all interested in seeing that if we have a licensed CB radio it is a good one and will not cause trouble for other people.  I will not go any further than that.  That is the only point I want to make.</P>
    <P>In regard to old people and free telephones I am inclined to agree with a previous speaker who said that we are inclined to neglect this area where new installations are concerned.  I would humbly ask the Minister to put these people on a priority list, especially where their application can be accompanied by a letter from their doctor, where they are living alone or far away from their families. Because of these difficult times, with robberies and violence and so on, a telephone is often the only link that these people have with the outside world.  Very often, albeit sometimes of their own choice, they are living in remote areas. Giving them telephones would involve expensive cabling but they should be on a priority list.  I am convinced that they are being put on the long finger.  They are not getting their turn when it comes to getting a telephone even when they are prepared to pay for the installation, and I gather the Department can recoup fully from the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="1538" /> the cost of telephone calls so there should be no loss to the Department.  I hope therefore that these people will get better treatment in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably has one of the most difficult Departments in relation to getting things done.  The installation of one telephone means quite a lot of organisation and a lot of manual work.  Quite frankly I would not be as worried as Deputy White about the intrusion of poles on the landscape.  Perhaps in places like the Burren we should avoid it, but if we are to get out of the doldrums and to compete, telephones are essential.  Quite recently I was in touch with the Minister in relation to the owner of a small garage who was told that because he had not enough employees he did not qualify for priority.  I do not know what the number is, but he will never have that number of employees if he does not get a telephone.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has the courage in this day and age to set up a business here should be given every encouragement.  I am talking about local industries and small industries, because when it comes to bigger industries and industrial estates they can get telephones as quickly as anywhere else in the world.  But the person who decides to do something in his local village is definitely not being looked after.  I have made representations in connection with garages which have opened up in some of the small towns and nothing has been done about them.  If we are serious about industry, if we are serious about helping these courageous people, we should provide them with telephones. They should even be given priority above telephone transfers because they are giving a service and employment and are essential to the community.</P>
    <P>On that point I appeal especially on behalf of the farming community.  We hear and see and read every day of the week about saving energy.  In agriculture the greatest waste of time and energy, apart from the farmers' own energy, is in driving back and forth from town to make telephone calls.  It is a pity, especially where the line work already exists, that we cannot give these people the service they so badly need.  This is particularly relevant where there are large dairy herds <Col N="1539" /> and the AI man has to be called in all hours of the day and often a person has to go to town three or four times a day. A telephone is an essential part of such a person's business and could be a big factor in cost cutting.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned this high Estimate.  A substantial part of this money will be spent on wages.  I am not in favour of borrowing because I think we have borrowed ourselves into big trouble, but if we are to get out of these troubles we may have to borrow further. If there is a shortage of money in this area, that money should be found somewhere.</P>
    <P>The EEC pay a lot of lip service to helping countries which are endeavouring to fight back.  I am convinced that the majority of our people do not want handouts. While deprived area funds will always be essential.  I believe what we want is an opportunity to compete.  A big factor in making us competitive is having a telephone system equal to that enjoyed in Europe.  If Government put sufficient pressure on the EEC, I am sure further money would be made available for this purpose.  As I said, no matter where a businessman lives, the bulk of the goods he produces will end up on the European market place.  Therefore a telephone is essential.</P>
    <P>I want to summarise some of the points I have made.  I mentioned telephone kiosks, telephones for industry and said the Minister should cut out the clause which says an industrialist must have a certain number employed before he is put on the priority list.  Our priority list is very good and covers doctors, clergymen and so on.  Recently a clergyman in our area had a telephone installed overnight. That is excellent, but this emergency service should also be provided for very small industries.  At the moment these industries are not grant-aided; they are not getting anything from anybody and the least we could do for these industies is give them telephones.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for tourism I said that prerequisite for an on-going successful tourist industry is a highly efficient international telephone and telex link.  The <Col N="1540" /> people in that business tell me we do not have this link.  I suggested that telephone kiosks in small estates should be kept under lock and key and every resident in the estate should be furnished with a key. That would cut out a lot of vandalism.</P>
    <P>I am not going into our performance versus Fianna Fáil's performance because our spokesman dealt with that. Somebody said yesterday on the agriculture debate that there seemed to be no light at the end of the tunnel.  If communications are right, the Minister's side is right and when the light appears at the end of the tunnel, it will not be hindered further by a lack of funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore) Séan Moore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Hegarty, I think the Minister has one of the more difficult ministries.  He is under constant pressure for the improvement of the telephone service, among other matters, and the appetite for telephones seems to be insatiable.  It is very hard for him to please everyone, but he and his Minister of State have shown a refreshing approach to these problems and we can record that they are making very good progress.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Minister told us 60,000 telephones would be installed by the end of this year and a further 80,000 next year.  I call that real progress.  If we were to examine why there is such a demand for telephones, we could point out that as we become a more affluent society, more people can afford telephones. There are three or four categories into which telephone applicants are put.  High on the priority list are old people who feel that a telephone is an extra means of security.  In these days when we have increasing crime and intimidation of old people, the telephone can be a great source of comfort and security. Old and elderly people should be given the highest priority for the installation of telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the business community a telephone can mean further employment.  Public representatives receive requests from business firms in our areas asking if we can do anything to have further phones installed.  Naturally where the installation <Col N="1541" /> of such a telephone would create more employment, that firm is given priority. Then, there is the person who wants a telephone for his or her own convenience. In some cases a telephone may be regarded as a status symbol.  However the vast majority of reasons for seeking telephones are very worthy.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department are making commendable efforts to satisfy the great demand and have taken another step by their agreement with an outside company to repair and manufacture the apparatus needed for expansion.  In doing so we will also expand the field of employment in the manufacture of telephones which are needed to improve the service.</P>
    <P>Apart from satisfying a social need the Minister is also ensuring the creation of more jobs, which are so badly needed.  I appreciate that previous Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs had problems, but there has never been such a demand for telephones as there is at present.  The fact that technology has been greatly expanded and perfected means that in the very near future we will not have the old wired telephones with ugly poles along the roadway.</P>
    <P>Wires should be laid underground. Americans ensure that a new town is not a &ldquo;Wireville&rdquo;, meaning that wires will be laid underground.  The Department have done this in some new housing estates. Gas and electricity cables are also laid underground.  We must pursue this policy so that we can give the best possible service and at the same time provide an aesthetic quality.  We accept the telephone pole on the country road, but we should dispense with it.  Members mentioned this morning that there were ugly poles being erected in the Burren area in County Clare.  Perhaps it would be very difficult to lay underground cables in that area because of rock formation, but I am sure that engineers of the Department know more about that than I do.  I feel that engineers are just as concerned with the aesthetic problems as we are.  We should give them our full backing in any plan to ensure our skylines are not marred by numerous telephone poles which are needed to carry the service throughout the country.  Thomas Edison <Col N="1542" /> and Alexander Graham Bell did not know what they were starting.  The telephone is an essential service.  But it will be some considerable time, despite strenuous efforts being made by the Department, before all demands are met, if ever.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the provision of more public telephone kiosks, especially in new housing estates.  Even if residents had not got private telephones they would be sure of one which worked in the centre of the estate.  With public telephones we have to deal with people who perhaps are of a rather weak mentality, people who destroy telephone kiosks.  It is sad to see a telephone kiosk wrecked when one realises that it could be the means of saving a life.  It is a terrible thing, when trying to make an emergency call, to find that some vandal has destroyed the phone.  Perhaps it is just thoughtlessness.  We appeal to all young people to be vigilant and to ensure that their local telephone kiosk is maintained and not damaged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty suggested giving each resident a key to the kiosk.  It is an original suggestion but I do not know if it is practical.  I know one area in Dublin city&mdash;I will not identify it&mdash;where a public telephone kiosk was installed and the local representatives encouraged the people to keep an eye on it.  That kiosk has never been vandalised.  Community spirit is needed for the preservation of public telephone kiosks.  When every person who requires a telephone is supplied with one we will not need so many public kiosks.  No doubt technology will expand and improve so much in the next decade that we will see a revolution in the telephone service.  The old dialling system will probably vanish and will be replaced by the digital apparatus which is in use in some offices at present.  We have to pay for the service, which is very costly, but I do not think people cavil at the cost of providing a basic and essential service.</P>
    <P>It is comforting to know that the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department are so committed to the advancement of the service.  Sixty thousand new telephones were installed this year and it is hoped to install 80,000 <Col N="1543" /> telephones next year.  For a small population they are big figures.  The Minister has brought the wind of change into his Department.  The public will back him very strongly.  I feel ineffectual when an old person tells me he or she has applied for a telephone.  The Department are doing their best but that old person must wait for many agonising years before a telephone is installed.  To some of us the telephone may be a status symbol, but to old people it is his or her line of communication to the local Garda station or to relatives so that in an emergency he or she may be able to contact them.  Therefore, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare should back a drive to ensure that old people are given telephones in the shortest possible time.  We should expand further the policy of subsidising the old person's telephone account.</P>
    <P>We are not complacent because, as every Deputy knows, representations for telephones are increasing daily.  I would give top priority to elderly people.  Apart from the fact that an old person's genuine need is being satisfied in giving a security line, we are also helping to curb the activities of some gangsters in our midst who prey on old people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether any arrangements are at present under way to provide for the regulated dumping of toxic waste; whether he is aware of the serious pollution which has occurred because of mercury seepage; and if he will indicate whether any proposals towards centralised locations in different regions for the dumping of toxic waste are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to reply to Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated in reply to similar questions, I am aware of the problems that exist at the present time with regard to the disposal of industrial waste.</P>
      <P>Under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979, which came into operation on 1 April last, local authorities are responsible for the planning, organisation, authorisation and supervision of waste operations in their areas and for the preparation of waste disposal plans.  The regulations provide local authorities with adequate powers to monitor the disposal of all types of waste arising within their areas and most of them have now commenced such monitoring operations, but I am not aware that any private sites for the disposal of toxic wastes have so far been licensed under the Regulations.</P>
      <P>It is important, however, to understand that the primary responsibility for the safe disposal of industrial and toxic waste rests with the producer, and that the regulations provide for prosecution and the imposition of substantial penalties if waste is disposed of so as to endanger health or harm the environment.</P>
      <P>If the producer of toxic waste cannot incinerate it or treat it so that it can safely be disposed of on land or at sea, he must send it abroad to a place where there are facilities to deal with it.  Precise figures or information are not available on ultimate disposal but I understand that a considerable tonnage is exported to the UK, of which possibly 50 per cent is made up of solvent wastes which may be incinerated or recycled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> Estimates of the different types of waste vary considerably.  There is no complete or accurate inventory of toxic wastes being produced in this country. This is hardly surprising because the problem is a relatively new one and there was no statutory obligation to furnish information to anyone.  This position has been changed.  The coming into operation of the new regulations gives local authorities supervisory and controlling powers.</P>
    <P>There are still problems of definition and quantification.  There are degrees of toxicity, and the quantities of liquid wastes can vary enormously with the amount of water they contain.  The milder toxic wastes can often be disposed of on suitable landfill sites in association with domestic refuse, and local authorities have been requested by my Department to facilitate industry in this regard, where this can safely be done, especially where leachate can be drained into a sewerage system.</P>
    <P>The best option for liquid organic or inorganic wastes containing metals is probably disposal at sea in approved locations.  Such dumping will be subject to control by the Department of Transport, which will have licensing powers under the Dumping at Sea Bill and will be advised by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>If we accept that the bulk of our toxic wastes can be disposed of by landfill, dumping at sea, and some measure of exports for recycling, incineration, and so on, this would leave a relatively small quantity comprising liquid toxic wastes which cannot be treated, those which can be treated and dewatered resulting in a solid cake or sludge, and some other solids. In all, this might amount to 5,000 tons per annum.  The options for disposal are:</P>
    <P>(a) a &ldquo;tight&rdquo; site with no leachate escaping;</P>
    <P>(b) a site where the leachate is controlled, monitored and treated, as necessary; and</P>
    <P>(c) a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; mine in which the waste <Col N="1546" /> can be disposed of by acceptable methods as a solid package.</P>
    <P>These options are being investigated by a team comprising experts from the IIRS, the Geological Survey Office and my Department.  They are seeking a site which would warrant investigation in depth.  I expect to receive a report in the near future.  However, if Deputies wish to make any suggestions, I would be glad to hear of any promising locations which might warrant examination.  If we cannot find a practical and economic solution of this kind, we will have to consider much more expensive options.</P>
    <P>As regards non-toxic industrial wastes, Deputies might like to know that apart from the arrangements for disposal on local authority tips, special arrangements have been made by Dublin Corporation for acceptance at Ringsend of certain liquid wastes and sludges which can be processed through the treatment works, and in Cork arrangements are being negotiated for disposal at sea.</P>
    <P>Finally, I assume that the reference to mercury seepage in Deputy O'Leary's question relates to a recent press report that traces of mercury were found in Mallow town dump.  I have been informed by Cork County Council that 24 empty drums which may have contained traces of mercury were safely disposed of recently on the dump and that there is no evidence of seepage from the dump or of mercury pollution in the nearby river.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I heard the Minister say that there is not any licensed dump in the country for the disposal of toxic waste?  Is that not a scandalous situation? Will he tell us the immediate proposals he has to set up licensed dumps in this near-emergency situation?  I should like him to be somewhat more explicit in explaining how an estimated 20,000 tons of toxic waste are disposed of annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct when he says I had said there are not any dumps.  I said there are not any private sites for disposal of toxic waste licensed so far under the regulations.  As far as being explicit is concerned, <Col N="1547" /> I thought that four pages of a reply was being fairly explicit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying that 20,000 tons of toxic waste is being disposed of annually?  We are due an explanation of how that amount of waste is being disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone into the whole question in great detail.  The next question relates to the provision of a toxic waste dump in the Dublin area, which has to be provided.  I realise there is a problem but I am tackling it.  I mentioned the three options for disposal: a &ldquo;tight&rdquo; site without any leachate escaping; a site where the leachate is controlled, monitored and treated as necessary; and a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; mine in which the waste can be disposed of by acceptable methods as a solid package.  I said that these options are being investigated by a team of experts from IIRS, the Geological Survey Office of my Department.  I expect a report from them in the very near future, when I can take further action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of all the dumping of toxic waste being done throughout the country?  To what extent does he think the Department have monitored the dumping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem has arisen in recent years because of the rapid industrialisation here.  Until recently this was not a difficulty.  We are now monitoring the situation under the EEC waste regulations of 1979.  Most local authorities are monitoring the situation.  It is only now that we are coming to grips with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree, having said it is a problem of only recent creation, that the body which have been directly involved in part in its creation are the IDA &mdash; that it is a by-product of industrialisation?  Therefore, has the Minister received representations from the IDA on the provision of a toxic waste dump to meet the requirements to which he referred?  Can he say when the last representations from the IDA were <Col N="1548" /> received by his Department and whether the IDA have indicated that the lack of provision of a safe dump is prohibiting further industrialisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been continuous contact between my Department and the IDA on this matter.  The provision of a dump in the Dublin region by Dublin County Council will meet the needs of the IDA in this region. Obviously it is a matter of concern that we should provide toxic waste dumps and I am working very actively on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not recently imported companies purchasing sites and disposing of toxic waste on the sites without any permission until they are caught by local residents, when they have to desist after an unholy row?  Will the Minister consider introducing legislation to have a licensing system for firms who are disposing of toxic waste in this way?  The need is to monitor such dumping rather than the present system under which apparently anyone can dump toxic waste anywhere &mdash; they can just go out and despoil the countryside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the EEC regulations for local authorities to license private sites, but my information is that they have not done so.  Because of recent controversy, two of the private companies involved in disposal of toxic waste on illegal sites have now stopped their operations.  This brings even greater urgency to the need to have action taken at Government and local authority level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the widespread public opposition to the proposed siting of a dump for toxic waste at the tiphead at Dunsink, County Dublin, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1549" />
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware from press and radio reports that the West Finglas Tenants' Association have formed an action committee to oppose a recent decision of Dublin County Council to provide limited facilities at Dunsink tiphead for reception of restricted quantities and qualities of industrial, including toxic, waste.</P>
      <P>It appears to me from these reports that the association are unaware of the restricted nature of the decision and are under the impression that the tip will be used for indiscriminate dumping of all kinds of hazardous substances.  This is a completely erroneous view.  The council are a responsible body with a long history of care for public health in their area through the services they provide.  No councillor would wish to be associated with any project which would be likely to create a hazard to public health.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that the council were very much alive to the critical position in which many industries were placed a short time ago.  Two major waste contractors decided to cease disposal operations on certain unauthorised dumps. This could have led to factory closures and to illicit dumping of industrial wastes around the country.  By helping to solve the problem the county council are safeguarding both jobs and public health in their area.  I must point out that there is no statutory obligation on local authorities to accept industrial waste for disposal, but it is difficult to see how the problem can be dealt with in a satisfactory and economical way without their assistance.  Accordingly, I wish to commend Dublin County Council on their public-spirited approach and rapid response to a difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accepting industrial waste at Dunsink the council will be operating on a selective basis.  No waste will be accepted without prior investigation and certification by the IIRS.  It will still be open to the council to refuse any waste if they have any reservations.  They are arranging to take their own samples and will have the necessary specialist staff and facilities to exercise proper control. Leachate from this site is already drained into the sewerage system and will, of <Col N="1550" /> course, be monitored.  Underground water in the vicinity of the site is being monitored already and this will be continued to ensure that there is no deterioration.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt in any detail with the special advantage of the site or the precautions being taken because I assume that the county council will provide this information to anybody concerned. There has been some complaint that they did not send a representative to the meeting of the West Finglas Tenants' Association, but I understand that the assistant county manager feels that he should place the matter before the west county committee of the county council before entering into any discussions.  The committee's next meeting will be on 4 December 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know if at any stage before this decision was finally taken the residents in the area were directly approached by the representatives of the county council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the experience we have had in Cork in relation to the Ovens dispute surely the Minister agrees that the first thing which should be required, since he referred to it as a Dublin regional site, is to elicit the possible reaction of the residents.  Surely, in view of the question being down here, his brief should have that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that, since the decision is in the functional area of Dublin County Council and that it will be made by them, a deputation of tenants going to see the landlord, Dublin Corporation, will hardly ease the problem since Dublin Corporation <Col N="1551" /> have no functional activity in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also said that I assume the county council will decide at the west county meeting about the matter. It is a decision for them if they will meet a deputation from the West Finglas tenants.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>) asked the Minister for the Environment if he proposes to indemnify local authorities against loss of revenue which they will incur in implementing the Government's directive to forego or postpone collection of rates due by farmers who have difficulties in meeting their rates liability; and if he will give an estimate of the amount involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will qualify the second paragraph of his recent circular to county councils regarding the payment of rates by farmers who are in financial difficulties; and if the Government intend to meet the shortfall in county councils' finances because of the inability of farmers in temporary financial difficulties to pay the rates demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.  Following the meeting on 12 September which the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture <Col N="1552" /> had with leaders of the farming organisations who made representations about the difficulties of farmers, particularly those in the £40 to £60 valuation category, in paying the second moiety of rates, a circular letter issued to county councils requesting that they adopt an understanding attitude towards individual farmers who clearly have temporary difficulties in meeting their rates liability in current circumstances.  The request was reinforced in a further circular which issued on 4 November, and which notified local authorities of the remission of the second moiety of rates for those in the £40-£60 valuation category.</P>
      <P>Rate collectors have various powers of recovering rates and it is normal practice for them to issue reminders in the form of the six-day notices, which are prescribed by statute, to persons in arrears. The fact that individual farmers may have received such reminders should not have inhibited them in any way from contacting their rate collector with a view to having their cases looked at in a fair and sympathetic manner in the light of their current circumstances.  The cost of the remission for the £40-£60 category will be recouped to the local authorities by the Exchequer within the current year.  While the payment of other rates on land may be slower as a result of the request to local authorities not to press farmers who are in difficulties it is too early at this stage to know whether there will be a permanent loss of revenue, and if so how much.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I presume the Minister appreciates that as as result of the rates being abandoned local authorities will be short of money, that they will have to incur substantial bank interest in regard to overdrafts and that they will also have to pay rate collectors a commissiom on rates which will not be collected.  Does the Minister appreciate that the overall effect will be that those under-financed local authorities will run heavily into debt and will also be short of finance to carry on the services?  Does he propose to indemnify them in regard to interest and all the <Col N="1553" /> other matters I have mentioned which will be involved in this decision?</P>

I appreciate foregoing the second moiety of the rates, but is the Minister aware that, if he and his Government had taken my advice and heeded my warnings when the Bill which doubles the rates was going through the House, it would not be necessary for him to do that?  Is he further aware that after foregoing half the moiety of rates to the farmers this year they will still be paying a much larger amount than they paid last year as a direct result of the Minister's action in abolishing the agricultural relief grant?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the results of this circular is that local authorities have had to lay off road workers almost immediately?  Lest the Minister doubt that, is he aware that according to the local government staff negotiation board approximately 300 road workers who were on regular pensionable service have been laid off and that no casuals are being taken on in most local authority areas?  Can the Minister now notify the local authorities that they will be recouped if they spend money on retaining those people or on re-employing them?  Will the money be given back to them when the Minister is giving this Christmas box?</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to question No. 7 which refers to the second circular sent by the Minister to local authorities on November 4 and I wish to address myself particularly to the second part of that question &mdash; what does the Minister intend to do regarding the rates which should have been paid by farmers who now find themselves in financial difficulties? The Minister has not made clear to local authorities whether he is going to remit that shortfall in income to the local authorities or not.  I understand the provision he has made for non-payment of the second moiety by farmers with valuations between £40 and £60 but I do not understand if the Minister is making provision for the shortfall due to the fact that some farmers will not be able to pay their rate bills in the current year.  Would the Minister explain that position because the local authorities themselves do not understand this.  They tell me they have got no direction.</P>

Payment of other rates on land may so slower, as I said at the end of my original reply, as a result of the request to local authorities not to press farmers who are in difficulties.  It is too early at this stage to know whether this will be a permanent loss of revenue and, if so, how much.  If it is, it will be picked up by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The Housing Act, 1969, was continued in force for two years ending on 31 December 1981, with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. In November 1979 local authorities were asked by my Department to conduct an analysis of the cases they had dealt with under the Act and based on their findings to furnish their views on the effectiveness of the Act and on the case for retention of the existing controls or for the imposition of alternative controls.

      <P>I am aware of the needs of the roads in County Dublin and I intend to ensure that the maximum assistance will continue to be made available towards their maintenance and improvement within the resources available to me.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Minister aware that Cavan County Council have put a number of men on a three-day week and that the result of this is that a man with, say, three children, whose take-home pay on fulltime work was £61 is now receiving a total of £74 per week, made up of his wages from the council and benefit from the Department of Social Welfare?  Is the Minister aware also that when the Minister for Finance was requested by another county to make the money available from the social welfare side to the Department of the Environment so that the men could be kept on and the roads put into some sort of reasonable order, his reply was to the effect that there was no money to buy tar or to buy stones or shovels?  Is this not a crazy economic situation and will the Minister do something about it?</P>

      <P>Allocations to local authorities to finance the carrying out of infrastructural services are based on the programmes and proposals formulated by local authorities rather than on the size of the authority. In the allocations to Waterford Corporation a separate sum is not, therefore, identified as relating to any extension of the borough boundary.

      <P>I am aware that some cars are used on the roads in a defective condition.  It is of course a matter of concern that any vehicle having dangerous defects should be so used.  At present, and in common with other EEC member states, arrangements are being made here for the introduction of a harmonised system of compulsory roadworthiness testing for certain categories of vehicles, such as large public service and commercial vehicles, taxis, ambulances.  In accordance with an EEC directive this scheme will be operational not later than 1 January 1983.  When the arrangements have been completed I will have a public announcement made.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to have compulsory testing extended to private cars as soon as may be practical, but at this stage priority is being given to arrangements for the testing of the classes of vehicles covered by the EEC directive.  In the meantime regulations are in force under the Road Traffic Acts providing that every vehicle used in a public place should be so maintained and used that no danger is likely to be caused to any person. It is in everyone's interest that these requirements be observed.</P>

      <P>The question of priority is a matter for Cavan County Council to decide.  It would not be in order for me to ask the council to give any scheme a higher priority.  If the situation is as bad as stated by the Deputy, I am sure the county council are aware of it.  However, I will make the inquiries as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

There is full co-ordination of Ireland's approach to the issue to which the Deputy refers.</P>

In line with the Government's undertaking to give effect, as far as lies in their power, to the recommendations of the Whiddy Tribunal, I am considering what further measures may be necessary in relation to the maritime jurisdiction of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of problems caused by the movement of juggernaut traffic through built-up areas of the city of Dublin: if he has any proposals to introduce road by-laws whereby certain streets and roads would be restricted to such heavy trucks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that problems may be caused by the operation of heavy vehicles on certain roads in Dublin and elsewhere.  The Road Traffic Acts provide for the control and regulation of the movement of any class of vehicle in pursuance of by-laws made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, in consultation with the local authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> The prohibition of heavy vehicles on a particular road implies that a suitable alternative route must be available for diverted vehicles.  The Transport Consultative Commission, in their recent report to the Minister for Transport, considered the question of designing special routes for commercial vehicles but concluded that the existing road network did not offer adequate alternative routes through or around the city.  This is a matter with which it is envisaged that the Dublin Transportation Authority, when established, will be specifically concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, as it appears that it will be a very long time before anything can be done about providing the type of roads about which the Minister is talking, it would be a good idea if some effort was made by the Garda authorities or by the Minister's own Department by appointing a special type of warden to try to keep the traffic flowing and not allow what is happening in this city so often, even outside peak hours, where heavy vehicles drive into narrow streets and just block the whole street for hours?  Surely something can be done about that, without spending millions on new roads?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean that if I go out now and get into a traffic jam, I should leave my car there and come back and report to the Minister's Department? The areas where this congestion is happening are very well known to the Department and the least they might do <Col N="1576" /> is make an effort to try to get some type of force which they know will clear those daily traffic jams.</P>

      <P>The cost of constructing a suitable replacement bridge at Fiddown was estimated at £800,000 at 1979 prices. CIE have agreed to contribute 25 per cent of the total cost subject to a maximum of £250,000.  As the bridge will not form part of a national route, a full cost grant is not applicable, but Waterford and Kilkenny County Councils were notified of the availability of a special grant of 75 per cent of the net cost to them.  The councils have agreed to meet the balance of the cost in the proportion of 40 per cent by Waterford County Council and 60 per cent by Kilkenny County Council.</P>

      <P>As indicated to the Deputy in reply to a question put down by him on 5 December 1979, Waterford Corporation were informed on 12 June 1979 that a public local inquiry would be held into their application for a bridge order for a new high level bridge when the corporation had clarified the position in regard to the acquisition of necessary lands for the bridge and its approach roads.  At the same time, it was intimated that the replacement of Redmond Bridge would afford the corporation an opportunity to review the implications of the high level bridge proposal, particularly in regard to environmental and financial aspects and present and future traffic needs, and that information of this nature <Col N="1584" /> would need to be available for presentation at an inquiry into the corporation's application for a bridge order.  It is a matter for Waterford Corporation to compile the necessary information for submission to my Department.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the financing of a scheme for a high level bridge and necessary approach roads will not arise until the scheme is further developed.</P>

      <P>I am advised that a voluntary group of business people in Tramore, County Waterford collected contributions to pay Waterford County Council to carry out the weekend sweeping of streets in Tramore during the tourist season this year.  I understand that Waterford County Council decided that work at overtime and weekend rates should be curtailed this year.  The sweeping of streets during weekends in the holiday season was suspended, therefore, in Tramore and in other resorts in County Waterford this year.  The allocation of the funds which they have available to them from revenue sources is entirely a matter for the county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore) Séan Moore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Questions I was referring to the damage done to public telephone kiosks by vandals, a reprehensible act which must be prevented. I was asking for public co-operation in the prevention of such vandalism and appealing to our people to take an interest in this matter.  I appealed to those who do such damage to take into consideration the tragedy that may arise if a person seeking a doctor or help urgently finds that the local public telephone is broken.  Until we are in a position to give telephone on demand we must continue <Col N="1616" /> to increase the number of public kiosks to serve our people.  The Department made great strides in recent years by the introduction of vandal proof kiosks.  It is strange that in modern life throughout the world there are mindless people vandalising such objects as telephone kiosks thereby depriving people of a necessary service in the event of an emergency.  The vandals should cease this senseless and criminal practice.  Local residents should become more vigilant and report to the Garda any damage done to kiosks.  I understand that the problem is declining.</P>
      <P>Next year, the year of the disabled, the trade unions should join with the Department to ensure that every effort is made to provide telephones for the disabled and those old people who live alone.  An effort should be made also to improve the postal delivery service to such people. During the postal dispute I saw many people queueing outside Government offices to collect their pensions.  Most of those people suffered grievously from exposure in the bad weather as they queued for many weary hours to draw their pension.  Next year we should join together to help such people.  Already the State has helped such people by giving pensioners who live alone priority in the installation of telephones and also exempting them from rent.  The telephone is a great line of security for old people because they can contact the Garda, relatives or a doctor.  We would be showing our concern for such people if we co-operated with other European countries in helping the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that our postal service is improving and this was indicated this morning by the Minister who produced impressive figures.  It may be possible next year to expand the existing schemes of benefit for the disabled.  The free TV licence scheme for pensioners is also a good one.  With regard to the campaign to collect TV licence fees I should like to say that I dislike the word &ldquo;spongers&rdquo;. People may say that if the programme content was better they would be more inclined to pay the licence fee but I do not accept that.  Owners of television sets must accept that as we have two channels there is an onus on them to pay their <Col N="1617" /> licence fee.  If the RTE authority lose £6 million in revenue because of the failure of some people to pay their licence fee then consideration must be given to other ways of collecting the fee.  The scheme whereby people can save towards the cost of the licence fee by purchasing stamps weekly is a good one.  Those who visit the cinema are aware of how expensive that form of entertainment is and the TV licence fee is equivalent to the cost of a few visits to a city cinema.  Of course, there are people who do not have the money to pay the fee.  It is those who deliberately set out to avoid paying the fee that should be pursued.  The existing system of collection should be examined carefully because RTE should not be expected to try to carry on without that £6 million. The Department should embark on another campaign to encourage people to save towards the cost of the licence fee by purchasing the appropriate stamps periodically.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is a very complex organisation and, as our society becomes more complex, it will assume a bigger part in our lives.  The Government's decision to create new bodies to look after the various facets of the Post Office services is to be welcomed.  Other countries have done this, and they have improved the services.  For many years we did not expand.  We looked to the State to do everything.  It did some great things too.  There was a time some years ago when the Post Office made a profit. Books can be balanced by various means. While I am not very keen to see a profit being made, the new measures taken will ensure that the Department are more efficient.  All of us can do our job better if we try a bit harder, and it is no reflection on the Department to say things could be improved.</P>
    <P>They provide one very small but essential service.  I see a man going around the city cleaning the kiosks.  He seems to like his job very much, and he does a good job.  He sets a headline for some thoughtless people who destroy telephone directories and damage kiosks.  I cannot offer any suggestion to the Minister as to how we can keep our telephone kiosks in better order.  This is a matter for the public. <Col N="1618" /> We cannot have a garda standing outside each kiosk.  We must rely on the good sense of the people to ensure that public property is not damaged.  The telephone kiosk provides an essential service.  On the Continent kiosks are very well maintained. I never saw one vandalised.  In a nearby country they have the same problem with vandals as we have.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the original Estimate for the Department for 1980 was a net sum of £234,864,000.  It is not long since the national budget hardly reached that figure.  Inflation has increased costs.  The Department's budget has gone up because they are providing more and better services.  We are all very jealous of the Department because they play such a vital part in our whole system.  Members of the Opposition may criticise Government outlay and call for a cut in public spending but, behind it all, they would not disagree with the fact that taxation is necessary if we are to provide a proper service.</P>
    <P>In future so much money will not come from taxation, but from payment for services provided by the Post Office. There are many ways in which the Post Office could expand their services on a commercial basis.  This would also create employment.  The Minister said that 1,000 technical people or trainees were taken on in the Post Office.  It is very comforting to know that.  We are building up a very fine industry in communications and in the computer line, thanks to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, the IDA, CTT and other bodies under the Government's supervision. The technical branches of the Post Office play an essential part.</P>
    <P>We must be very jealous of industrial relations in the Department.  The Minister, the Minister of State and the trade unions realise that.  We must have cooperation between all the bodies in the Post Office because the least hitch causes suffering to people, as we have seen in the past.  The Government are taxing us to pay for a service and we have to ensure that a very good service is given for the money spent.  Since the days of Rowland Hill and Edison communications have been an essential service.  They are <Col N="1619" /> becoming more sophisticated and costly. I do not think people will cavil at the cost if they are getting a good service.  People are realistic.  With their publicity the Post Office are taking people into their confidence and showing them what is being done.  The public will give them all the backing they need in order to ensure that the service continues to improve.</P>
    <P>Questions may be asked whether the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be a State Department at all, but the State must be involved in such an important facet of our lives as communications. The national Parliament is a forum for criticism, for suggestions and for praise.  In a healthy democracy we must have a free press and a free judiciary. We must also have a very sophisticated system of communications.  All this costs money and people may cavil at being taxed.  I know of no other way of doing it at the moment until the Minister and the Department set up the new bodies within the Department.  They can then come up with all the answers.  I would like the Minister to press on and give these new bodies a bit of a push.  I know they are not fully established yet, but I should like to hear their plans for improvements.</P>
    <P>It is most heartening to read of many of the things the Minister is doing.  He and the Minister of State have adopted a refreshing approach to many of the problems in the Department.  No doubt their predecessors also contributed something to the present position.  They laid a certain base for this.  We must realise that we are somewhat behind our European and UK counterparts in communications. In most cases it is easier to make a telephone call abroad.  We must, therefore, have regard to the high standard of world telecommunications and improve ours.</P>
    <P>We are confident that the Government and the Department are handling this problem well.  We know that there could be further improvements and that improvements will occur before the end of the financial year.  In the full Estimate early next year I hope more money will be provided and that a new scheme to give top priority to aged people living <Col N="1620" /> alone will be implemented so they will at least have the basic requirement of a telephone.  Unfortunately the incidence of crime against old people is increasing. The mark of any civilisation is how it treats its old people.  We hope to ensure that old and handicapped people will be able to have a telephone.  The Minister assures me that it will not cost an awful lot of money to do this.  I am sure all parties will back any measure such as this.</P>
    <P>We will provide 60,000 telephones this year and 80,000 next year.  We should try to increase that figure.  The goodwill of the Minister and the Department and the expertise is there to do that.</P>
    <P>Next year the Department will mark the Year of the Disabled by drawing up a charter backed by the Government, the trade unions and all concerned.  We will make a great break-through in providing certain things for the disabled, one of which will be a telephone in each house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay a very deserved tribute to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and to his Minister of State for their tremendous work in preparing this very important communications department for the future.  The investment and development programme of £650 million over five years indicated the priority that this Government and the Minister give to ensuring that the communications infrastructure will be developed at a fast rate in order that the maximum and potential employment and other facilities will be provided.  It also indicates that this is a Government who have grasped the nettle as far as telecommunications are concerned. There is and has been for a long time an obvious need to revamp and expand the development of these services. Many of us are familiar with the long delays in the provision of telephones and the fact that industrial development and the encouragement of overseas investment have been frustrated by the lack of adequate communications services. Therefore, this fairly dramatic effort is welcomed by all sides of the House. There is a formidable task here.  Five hundred new buildings are to be provided, 480 exchanges to be converted and <Col N="1621" /> there has to be a strengthening of existing trunk routes.  This makes it clear that no matter how much money is provided this is a long haul and it requires not just the commitment of the Government and the Ministers concerned but a very determined effort by all administrative technical and other people involved in that Department from the top down.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note some of the changes of attitude that have taken place in the last 12 months so far as some of the personnel in the Department are concerned. I can recall television programmes a little over a year ago almost laughing at the idea of a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs setting a target of 60,000 telephone installations in 1980. This Minister was the first Minister to set such a target and he set a high one.  The Minister also set a target for future years. Some individuals in the Department felt that this was impossible but when the year was half way through it began to filter through that a great effort was being made by all concerned.  A Minister or a Minister of State could not have reached the target no matter how determined they were on their own and I pay tribute to the people in the Department.  The efforts of the Ministers were matched in the technical and administrative areas of the Department in trying to reach that target.  I am confident that target will be reached and that in the next few years it will be doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some places people will not feel that progress as quickly as they would like. Service cannot be provided overnight. The provision of a single telephone for a person can involve linking up to trunk network local exchanges.  The physical work involved means that the best efforts of all concerned will not ensure that there will not be fairly long delays in many cases.  However, the nettle has been grasped and, please God, in the fairly near future the resolve to improve our communications generally and develop the infrastructure for our industrial development will be something about which the Minister and his Minister of State can be proud and satisfied because of their input into ensuring that the <Col N="1622" /> eighties will be the years of tremendous movement in telecommunications.</P>
    <P>In relation to job creation, as far as this Department are concerned they are one of the largest employers. Since this Government returned to power there has been an increase of over 1,000 posts in the technical grades, with slightly in excess of 200 new technicians and a couple of hundred extra jobs in Posts and Telegraphs.  In the course of the present expansion programme the Minister signed a contract for the provision of digital telephone exchanges and arising from this a further 1,000 new jobs will be created in a new industry to be located in this country, CIP Alcatel.  Linking up to this development it is tremendous to see an Irish company in Athlone, LM Ericsson Ltd., getting part of this contract. Arising from that a 12,000 square foot bay is nearing completion and there will be 30 extra engineering jobs.  In the development of modern technology which forms part and parcel of the provision of these services it is vital that Irish-owned firms be given every possible opportunity to become involved and get part or all of the contracts.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very wise to put on exhibitions in Dublin, Limerick, Letterkenny and Longford where imported telecom equipment, valued at about £7½ million, was shown.  It encouraged local home-based industry and new industry to explore every means possible to see if they could produce this equipment at home.  The IDA and any other agency involved should encourage Irish industry by way of investment and so on to maximise the potential involvement they can have in present and future development.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of employment opportunities involved as far as the Department are concerned.  With the amount of work that lies ahead there would be a lot of jobs in the private sector which should be given here at home and not in France, Japan or other countries that have moved ahead of us in this field, in which, with extra help, we could well compete.  We should be given every encouragement to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that development in <Col N="1623" /> the telecommunications area puts more pressure on the postal service.  The computer area and electronic media can replace the typed or written word.  The Minister has responded to this change by setting up a special section in the Department to examine the postal area.  The question of express delivery service is being examined.  I am sure it will be possible in the not-too-distant future to have inter-city, inter-county and international express services where for an extra charge a person can be guaranteed delivery after a specific time and date.  This will be of vital importance for business.</P>
    <P>As regards the banking service and bank giro, there are well-trained personnel who are well equipped to develop this into a wider range of services which would compensate for losses in existing services which development can help make obsolete.  The Department should take a lead and expand services such as the provision of special stamps to facilitate people paying ESB or other bills. Another area which has been established since the Minister took office is the planning unit in the Department.  It is not too early in the context of the number of people employed and role the Department have to play in the provision of services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting into the administrative area of the Department.  We are only dealing with the Supplementary Estimate and all these matters could be raised appropriately on the general Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I strayed.  I was merely endeavouring to stress the importance of having a section in the Department which would continually assess the needs and which would be in a position to advise the Minister on the type of plan and progress that would be required for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important aspect of the development as far as I am concerned has been the degree to which those in the Department have applied themselves to the new targets set by the Minister.  It is to be welcomed that many people in the engineering <Col N="1624" /> and technical end and other areas of that Department now see themselves in the driving seat because of the provision of infrastructure, which is the key to a lot of this development throughout the length and breadth of the country.  In many ways they see themselves for the first time as a most effective link in the chain of development and they play a very strong role here.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister consider devolving as much authority as possible to regional and outlying areas in the country.  All of us from time to time have considered that there was &mdash; and there is no doubt that there is &mdash; local ability, capacity and initiative frustrated by the extent to which power is centred in the major areas.  It is vitally important in a development programme of this size that as much authority as possible is given to the regions and local areas to encourage the people there and maximise the part that all of those people in the technical areas throughout this Department can play.  I ask the Minister very specially to consider the ways and means of ensuring this.  It should not always be necessary for somebody in the west, midlands or south of this country to have to make direct contact with Dublin offices when alternative facilities closer to the home and to where the problems are could be better utilised and give a speedier reaction and considerably less bureaucratic build up.</P>
    <P>In this context, up to now, because the best telecom facilities were in the major centres, many outlying areas in the country did not benefit and were unable to attract the kind of development that would be possible if these better facilities were available in those areas.  Every £ spent by this house for speeding up the provision of fully equipped networks around the country is well spent and ensures that many people in the west, midlands and south ultimately will have opportunities of jobs nearer to their homes.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say.  I re-emphasise the way being travelled by this Department to encourage everybody concerned, including the staff at all levels, to go on doing a very good job.  I pay tribute to <Col N="1625" /> the Minister, his Minister of State and his staff for the part they have played in ensuring that the people of this country have the opportunity of the best and a first-rate telecommunication service for which I believe they are prepared to pay and to wait in cases where it is not possible technically to have it quickly.  As long as the Department and the Minister are making the best effort possible the Irish people will be satisfied that the reins of responsibility are in the right hands and that the contribution being made by this Government in this vital area is the greatest ever made in the history of this State.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to say a few words in praise of that effort and to exhort all concerned to keep up the good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  First I want to thank the Members of this House on both sides who in honesty see the efforts that our Department are making under most difficult circumstances to bring a very fine telecommunications programme into line.  This is my opportunity to express appreciation to the staff of the Department from top to bottom, right through the administrative and technical, for the tremendous efforts they have made this year to meet the stringent programme we have laid out for them.  It is encouraging to see that their goal is being achieved, and their goal is our goal.  The previous speaker, Deputy Smith, and the speaker before him, Deputy Moore, reflected my opinion.  I listened for a few moments to the contribution from Deputy Hegarty and even he acknowledged that no effort was being spared to achieve this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the things said here today by speakers from the Fine Gael party and by Deputy Corish of the Labour Party left me a little in awe because the Minister's priority and mine at this time is to give employment, good employment, particularly <Col N="1626" /> in the technical skills.  It is to ensure first and foremost that the number of staff needed to achieve those targets will be provided if at all possible.  Next years target is a very tight, big target which will take the total ability of all the staff of the Department, particularly the technicians. When employment of a technical nature is given to people it is important that they have clean and comfortable working conditions.  Our building programme is geared towards this end and engineering headquarters are under construction throughout the country in order to provide suitable places of work for these technicians.  Some of them have been working in conditions which are far from adequate.  It was Government policy to embark on this very costly programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy made certain allegations about trainee installers with which the Minister will deal in more detail than time allows me.  We were faced last July with a shortage of staff.  There were 2,500 applicants for positions as trainee installers and 1,200 passed the first test.  Two other tests had to be carried out, one by the Garda and one by the doctor.  However, in July sufficient numbers had not qualified in all three tests and it was not possible to take them in order.  Taking into account that all 1,200 people would be taken on to the best of our ability throughout the year, I made the decision that anyone who had passed all three tests should be given immediate employment because staff were urgently needed in the Department.  We took on 671 people and employment has been offered to another 240.  The number waiting to be called is 289.  It amazes me that Deputy Deasy would come into this House and make such allegations about certain points in the system of calling individuals for employment.  He should know the facts.  I should be surprised if Deputy J. Burke from Roscommon fell into the same trap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give employment to 1,200 trainee installers within 14 <Col N="1627" /> months.  We faced a situation where all three tests had not been passed by all the applicants and we employed those who were available, in the knowledge that the remainder would be employed when the results of the tests became known.  We have carried out this plan and only 289 applicants are waiting to be offered employment.  Deputy Deasy might have been referring to the time of the Coalition Government in 1975 when an embargo was put on the employment of any extra trainee installers, leaving us with a shortage last July.  The Minister will explain the situation to Deputy Deasy.  His allegations were ridiculous.</P>

      <P>We must acknowledge that male and female telephonists have been working under great difficulty.  They have had a very tough summer because they were asked to work in very bad conditions. However, these conditions will be improved in the coming year.  I thank them for their endurance and patience at a very crucial time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan alleged that I had gone into hiding and he was concerned about bad services in County Galway.  It amazes me that he and other speakers opposite have changed from talking about the absence of telephones to talking about bad services.  Deputy Donnellan often asks question in this House and I have told him the facts.  I was not in hiding; I was about the very important business of the Department.  I regretted that I could not be here but this House was in the very safe hands of the Minister <Col N="1628" /> who was able to deal with any Deputy making wild allegations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan said that nothing is happening in County Galway.  I do not wish to be parochial but in the face of this allegation I am entitled to put forward a defence.  A new automatic exchange was opened this year in the Aran Islands, the first island exchange in the country.  We are spending £1.1 million in Clifden on a new telephone exchange and engineering headquarters.  In Galway city we are spending £8.2 million on a new exchange and district headquarters.  We are about to lay the foundation stone of a new exchange costing over £1 million in Athenry. In Ardrahan we are switching to an automatic exchange at Christmas.  A new automatic exchange is being installed in Kinvara and work is about to begin.  A new exchange costing £1.1 million has been completed in Tuam and a new engineering headquarters is about to be started.  In Ballinasloe work on a new engineering headquarters is in progress. As well as that, we were lucky enough to be able to give a contract to Northern Telecom in Galway city of approximately £1.1 million for equipment to be used in the telephone installation programme. On the computer side we have given a contract worth approximately the same sum to Digital Limited in Galway city. These are the facts about what this Government are doing for Galway.</P>

      <P>I have given some of the facts and can, if necessary, give them village by village.  Deputy Burke was at the laying of the foundation stone of the telephone exchange in Castlerea.  I was courteous and kind and I invited the Deputy, and no nicer person could we invite. In a matter of weeks I will be inviting the Deputy to the laying of the foundation stone for the new area engineering headquarters in Castlerea and I am sure she will accept and come and be happy with the progress.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do that I have not the records for Roscommon, but I will get them.  Most of the county of Roscommon is under the engineering headquarters in Galway and our district engineer in Galway.  I have not got the figures because I did not know the Deputy was going to ask me, but if she asks me I will give them to her.</P>
      <P>That is just a resumé of some of the facts concerning County Galway and I will not hide behind those facts for Deputy Donnellan or any other Deputy in the House.</P>
      <P>There is another point which is very important and which Deputy Smith referred to.  That is the new aspect of our efforts to try to keep the balance of payments in proper perspective, particularly in our Department.  With the Irish Goods Council we arranged an exhibition of some of the imported products.  About £7.5 million worth out of the tens of millions of pounds worth that could be imported, and has to be imported at this time for this installation programme, was put on display.  We brought that exhibition to Dublin, to Limerick, to Letterkenny and to Longford.  We intend to show it to industrialists around the country so that we can make these industrialists, big and small, aware of the volume of input that they could have in this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are delighted with the success so far.  But we will never be satisfied with it until we can manufacture here all of the products which go into our installation programme.  This exhibition has been welcomed.  It will take a while for it to have any effect because people need time to examine it and do costings, but it is our intention to ensure that whatever can be kept at home for the Irish workers will be kept at home in this development programme. We look forward to taking this exhibition to the remaining districts as soon as possible.  It is our intention to see this through to its conclusion.  All things <Col N="1630" /> being equal we will give contracts to existing industries, and indeed to industries starting out, in order to keep Irish workers here.  We will show this range of products to any industrialist who wants to see it if Deputies will encourage the industrialists in their districts to do so.  I say this because we would like to see the resulting increase on the barometer of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore mentioned the question of stamps and the postal service.  We are encouraged by the improvement in this. The latest figure I have is that we are dealing with over one million postal units per day.  The service has returned to a reasonably good level.  Our aim is to improve it and we have, as Deputy Smith said, set up a section in the Department to find out where we can effect further improvements in that service.</P>
    <P>There is another branch of the service which, though it is mentioned here in the Estimate, few people know about.  That is the philatelic section.  This section in the Department is growing.  We intend to try to interest the school children of the country in philately nationally and internationally. Apart from the financial return to the Department that would be a very good development from the point of view of the improvement of the intellect of the child.  Our sales in philately are improving substantially and a very sound foundation to the Department's philatelic section is being laid.  The issue of our commemorative stamp is being recognised throughout the world as a sound and logical programme from the philetelist's point of view.  If we can interest the children of the country in philately we will be doing a twofold job in that we be educating them and giving them an interest that will be with them for their lives.  As and from now we will be focussing attention on this.</P>
    <P>Another point mentioned by Deputy Moore was in relation to stamps for television licences so that people who may not be able to pay the whole amount at one time could save during the year for their television licence.  Let me empasise that people who may find it difficult to pay this sum of money at once will find such a system in operation at any post <Col N="1631" /> office and this will help solve the problem of the payment of television licence fees. When the cost of a television licence is broken down it works out at about 12p per day.  For this, two TV channels and three radio wavelengths are available. That is not bad value.  It is just that the manner in which the fee is collected makes it seem an astronomical sum.  I recognise the point made by Deputy Moore.  I am sure now that he is aware the licence fee can be paid by way of a savings stamp programme, the difficulty will be overcome.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to thank any of the Members of the House who have complimented us.  We are not the ones to be complimented but rather the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who have worked tremendously hard.  It is important that their work has been brought to fruition in many fields.  Agreements have been concluded in all areas of the labour relations field, the most recent being in the stores branch of the Department where a new agreement was overwhelmingly accepted.  I want to thank the negotiators for the way they turned their attention to this important matter.  We look forward to a progressive 1981.  We have a very enthusiastic programme laid out which will take the energies and ability of every individual in the Department to bring to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>So many issues were raised here today by so many Deputies that it would be impossible for me to deal with them in the very compresensive manner I would like.  Many unsubstantiated allegations were made and many reflections cast not alone on me but on my Minister of State and on the entire staff of my Department.  I do not intend to pass over them glibly and that is why I am saying at the outset that I intend to give a comprehensive answer to every issue raised in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>And I intend to take <Col N="1632" /> every minute of it.  May I take this opportunity of thanking all the Deputies who contributed to this debate and to say it is obviously a reflection of the interest Deputies and the general public have in seeing the progress that is, and has to be, made as an absolute necessity in the development of telecommunications.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy, the Fine Gael spokesman, came in here today and started off, as glib as usual, without any back-up evidence or researched information, and tried to throw up unsubstantiated allegations and statements and cast a reflection on what has been achieved this year and during the past three years of Fianna Fáil Government.  He said he wanted tangible evidence of what had been achieved and then he tried to put the record straight about the previous Government in office.  He chose selective statistics, but anyone can do that.  I could pull statistics of the air but I am not interested in giving one side of the argument or in running away from the type of evidence that has been produced here.  I deal in facts, not fairy tales.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy said you cannot fool all the people all the time; you may succeed in fooling some of the people some of the time.  Let me put it on the record in answer to Deputy Deasy, that I never attempted to fool all the people all the time or any of the people any of the time, because I have been around long enough to know that the Irish people have enough intelligence and will not be fooled.  If he attempts to fool them with the type of statements he made here today, he is only fooling himself.  I thought that at this stage in opposition he would have learned his lesson, that he would have learned it recently in Donegal. To come here today and say nothing has been done, nothing has been achieved, and that there is no evidence that anything was achieved, is absolute rubbish and nonsense and he knows it as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that for the first half of this year Deputy Deasy and the Labour Party spokesman referred to what they called my euphoric address to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  I am quite happy to go back to that statement and <Col N="1633" /> to stand over every statement made at that Ard-Fheis.  I will stand over them on any platform, defend them and produce facts and tangible evidence.  When did the facts emerge?  Last week in this House, when I was asked in a parliamentary question by Deputy Corish, what were the installations for the first three quarters of this year as against the same period last year.  Obviously Deputy Deasy had not read the answer nor had Deputy Corish.</P>

I intend to deal with the installation problem, the quality of service and the whole development programme.  Deputies are free to challenge any sentence or any part of a sentence they like, whenever they like. When the Opposition asked by way of parliamentary question for tangible evidence, I gave the figures and I will repeat them today.</P>

Let me now give the answer I gave in this House and which the Opposition do not know about, because if they did they would not have come in here today making <Col N="1634" /> stupid allegations that there was no tangible evidence of what has been achieved.  In the first quarter of 1979 the number of new telephones installed was 9,448; in April to June 1979, 3,508 and July to September 1979, 9,300.</P>

In the first quarter of 1979 the number of new telephones installed was 9,448; in April to June 1979, 3,508 and July to September 1979, 9,300.  In 1980, the year of fantasy as the Opposition call it, in the first quarter there were 13,304 installations; April to June 1980, 15,266; July to September 1980, 16,135.  The totals for the first three quarters of 1979 were 22,256 and for the same period in 1980 44,744.</P>

      <P>I know what is going on in County Roscommon and I shall be glad to tell the Deputy.  I was asked for tangible evidence.  Does the Deputy want any more tangible evidence than that?  It is very interesting to note the way Fine Gael looked at this problem throughout the year.  For the first seven months it was all fantasy, all promises but, as the year wore on and as the message filtered down the grapevine, and, as they made inquiries behind the scenes, they realised it was not fantasy.  Last February, I stood up in a euphoric, theatrical way at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis to make these predictions to set targets for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; targets that had never been set before, no Minister had stuck his neck out and said: &ldquo;That is what I am targeting for; I am prepared to stand over it&rdquo;.  After the Ard-Fheis, I said I would sit in the same chair 12 months later and answer for my actions.  I am quite prepared to do that.  Deputies have got the tangible evidence they asked for.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy said the sins of the past were all Fianna Fáil sins.  He went through the sixties and he quoted a small amount of money that was put into telecommunications by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  I accept the figure was not very big.  What he failed to relate it to and did not bother to find out &mdash; because it would not have suited him to find out &mdash; was that supply was meeting demand right through the sixties and early seventies. I admit that in late 1971 and 1972 demand increased and supply was not able to meet it.  He trotted out evidence about miles of trunk cable being installed in the term of the National Coalition Government as being the answer to everything.  It shows what little knowledge and appreciation he has of what makes up a national telephone network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> In contrast to that, Deputy Hegarty showed great appreciation of the magnitude of the problems and what needs to be done in every facet of the network. He went to the trouble of finding out. During the term of the National Coalition Government demand exceeded supply by approximately 21,000.  Opposition Deputies have the audacity to ask why all the problems are not solved today.  Since I came into the public arena, I have never said that I can solve this problem overnight. I never ran away from it.  I always admitted what the size of the problem was, what action I was taking, how I was planning it, monitoring it, setting the targets and how I intended to achieve them. Opposition Deputies ignore all that because they do not want to find out what the nitty-gritty is about.  Their answer to the whole situation in the terms of the National Coalition Government is that there were miles of trunk cable.  They quoted figures in money terms.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Deasy is not here to be educated.  To develop a national network, and to improve the capacity to take the demands being made on it, both in installation and in quality of service, one starts with the acquisition of sites for building.  Then one sets about putting up the buildings and ordering the equipment. Then one sets about the trunk cabling, the local cabling and, when all that is done, it is knitted together and you are then in a position to put in more telephones or give a better quality service. They confused the issue by saying they put in so many miles of trunk cabling and so much money into it.  What was that going to answer?  The most important part of doing all that work is, first of all, to have the money and, secondly, to have the human resources to do it.</P>
    <P>What happened in relation to the human resources during the period of the National Coalition?  I did not bring this into the debate.  I opened very timidly with a nice, straightforward statement of what the money would be needed for, how it was being spent and produced tangible evidence to show that the Government not alone are committed but are going to keep pace with this development programme and will provide it in a difficult <Col N="1637" /> economic year, almost £50 million extra, although the Appropriation Account brings this down by £23.5 million. Nevertheless, that sort of money was going to be committed, if it could be spent it was spent.  The Government stood behind the expenditure and they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Let us take the other facet of what happened during the National Coalition term.  From 1975 onwards there was a ban on recruitment.  How could any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if he was looking at the facts and realising that he was seriously behind in meeting demands for telephones, expect to compete with that situation by banning recruitment from 1975?</P>
    <P>When people are taken into the service, they have to be trained.  Accommodation has to be provided for them and it is only when their training period is over that they are in a position to take their place in making a good contribution to the installation or the construction of the network.  When my predecessor, the present Ceann Comhairle, came into office, he had to start recruitment that should have been done three years earlier.</P>
    <P>The worst feature was that there was a ban in relation to special pay increases. One does not have to be Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to know that the troubles that beset the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was that ban on special pay and on recruitment.  Whatever morale existed within the Department was killed by not giving them the human resources to do the job and by not giving them pay which they richly deserved to do the job in one of the most vital sectors which was needed to develop the economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, because they were deprived of the opportunity within their own C &amp; A scheme to look for what was rightfully theirs and when the real heat came on it was pushed aside. The present Ceann Comhairle inherited a situation that was at boiling point and at frustration point, not alone in the postal service but in the engineering service as well.  Inevitably trouble broke out. You cannot deprive ordinary working people of what they genuinely feel they are entitled to and from airing their case at arbitration.  That is a recipe for trouble, and trouble erupted.  He inherited that situation, a ban on recruitment and a ban on special pay increases which had to be lifted.  He started recruitment in 1978. Then the problems of the industrial relations side broke out.  This is not the place to go back on the nitty-gritty of what happened.  I am not a man to look back but when I was challenged here today to look back I was prepared to turn the pages of history.  The pages of history in the telecommunications development in the eighties will be a different history, it will be a success story.  If you want tangible evidence you have it.  To come in here with a half-baked story about a few extra miles of trunk cables and a few million pounds and which ignores the buildings, the sites and the equipment is no answer to the problem.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Examination Fee Increases.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for having allowed me to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the savage increase in group and secondary and leaving certificate fee increases.  I want to bring to the attention of the House, and through the House to a wider public, the fact that the Minister for Education, appointed by this House, is operating basically in this examination scheme a <Col N="1639" /> taxation system for which he has no warrant from the House, one which is open to serious question on a number of counts.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me tell the House exactly what the scale of the increases is in terms of which I am aware.  The group certificate examination fee last year was £4.  This year it has been increased to £7. If my mathematics are correct that is a 75 per cent increase.  Last year the leaving certificate fee was £7.  This year it has been put up to £11, in my book a 60 per cent increase.  I do not know what the fee was for the intermediate certificate last year.  This year it is £10.  I doubt very much if the increase is less than 50 per cent to 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>This is not the whole story.  These examination fees &mdash; free education how are you &mdash; must be paid by a certain date or a further late fee becomes payable.  If fees are not paid by the end of this month an extra charge of £3 per child becomes payable from 1 December to 15 December, and if then for any reason the fee still has not been paid the late fee will be increased to £15.  I do not have in front of me the late fee charges for last year but I have no doubt that they also represented a savage increase.</P>
      <P>This is a tax on learning of which the Government and the Minister should be ashamed.  It is the worst kind of tax because to the best of my knowledge it is not related to ability to pay.  I should be interested to learn from the Minister what is his attitude and that of his Department to social welfare recipient families who have to pay examination fees in order that their children at the end of their school careers could have a certificate to show what they had done and how well they had done it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 150,000 children living in families on social assistance of one kind or another.  Not all of them are in school and not all of them who are in school will be in these examination classes, but I daresay a fair slice of them will be, and the Minister and the House should ask themselves seriously whether this has gone beyond the bounds.  On several occasions I have tried to bring the attention <Col N="1640" /> of the House to the secret forms of taxation operated by Government Departments and by the Department of Education in particular.  This situation makes a mockery of free education.</P>
    <P>I stress, incidentally, that I am not saying things cannot be done: I know that the staff in the Department of Education have been known to interpret flexibly the rules in relation to dates when hardship might have been occasioned.  The issue is not whether certain officials are kind hearted enough.  The issue is that the fees now announced by the Department have gone beyond a laughing matter.  I can give the Minister many cases.  I will give him only two.</P>
    <P>The first relates to a broken home where the mother, who has the children, is dependent on erratic payments from her husband for the children's education and welfare.  She is approaching the deadline for the leaving certificate with considerable dread because, though £11 may not be much to the Minister &mdash; I daresay I could find it myself &mdash; to this woman in her situation it is simply not possible.  Her child is going to a State school and out of the funds at its disposal that school cannot pay the entry fee for that child.  If the deadline of 15 December comes and goes, how likely do you think it is that this husband, who has refused to pay £11, who will refuse to pay £14 by 1 December, will cough up the £26 that will be required after 15 December to ensure that his child will have a chance to sit for the State examination?</P>
    <P>Another case I bring to the Minister's attention relates to a family in which one child is doing the leaving certificate and two children are doing the intermediate certificate.  Before the end of the month, effectively this week, £31 &mdash; the take home pay of the principal wage earner is not much more than £60 &mdash; must be paid. Where is that man expected to find in one week a sum equivalent to 50 per cent of his net weekly earnings?  I will now give a hypothetical case which will put this whole question in a realistic context.  It is not impossible that in a family there would be two children doing the leaving certificate or the intermediate certificate at the same time.  If for some reason <Col N="1641" /> unemployment, sickness, plain shortage of cash, the parents cannot find the entrance fees for the examinations, they will be landed after 15 December with late fees of the order of £50.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows better than most people that in the not too distant past £50 would buy a child's entire secondary education in a Christian Brothers' school in a provincial town in Ireland.  In some of the Christian Brothers' schools if you were hard up they would let you off &mdash; they would just skip a year or two.  How can the Minister in conscience stand over and justify this tax?  I have my suspicions as to the reason why it is being introduced without being brought before the House in any way except by me as a member of the Opposition.  The fact of the matter is that in this area, as in so many other areas, the Minister has been kept so short of money by the Government that he finds it wherever he can.  Everybody knows that within the past week the teachers have finalised an agreement on a salary offer.  Good luck to them.  They operate in an industrial arena and they have got this through industrial negotiations of a classic kind.  Will the parents of the country now be asked directly to make up part of the teachers' award without any reference to family circumstances, family income or ability to pay?</P>
    <P>In the 1980 Book of Estimates in the section dealing with secondary education we find subhead K for Appropriations-in Aid.  The first item there is for examination fees for students, £1 million in 1980. I presume that this £1 million which has been put in in relation to 1980 is based on the assumption that this increased scale of fees already applies.  I draw the attention of the House to the figure for 1979 of £620,000.  The inescapable logic of those figures is that in this area alone, one over which the Minister and the Government have absolute control, the price of education has risen by 66 per cent. There are plenty of different pleadings for price increases by the Government but this is an area in which they cannot evade responsibility.</P>
    <P>This is a savagely increased tax on learning, which will fall most heavily on larger families.  I do not believe the Minister <Col N="1642" /> can be in ignorance of the fact that larger families are more frequently to be found in the lower income groups.  It is a direct tax which will affect the lower income groups more heavily than the higher income groups.  It makes a farce of the Minister's and the Government's continued rhetoric about equality of opportunity in education.  If the Minister and the Government cannot get their money in any other way than this mean and underhand mechanism they should not be in the business at all.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this increase.  If he is to have an examination fee at all let him peg it at a level at which it will not cause any real hardship to many families.  Let him give a little more substance to the idea that education, at least up to leaving certificate level, is genuinely free for those who require it and are able to avail of it.  We all know that in many respects this freedom does not exist.  School uniforms, voluntary contributions, books and many other things add up to a large sum those days.  The fees are the smallest part of that type of expenditure.  We now have the reinforcement of another fee system, which is not operated by the schools but directly by the Department of Education, which is robbing Peter to pay Paul and is merely introducing by the back door a charge for education which everybody thought had been abolished a long time ago.  It is a function of the Members of this House to draw the attention of the public to what the Minister is doing.  I appeal to him, even at this late stage, to change his mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with much interest to Deputy Horgan. Bearing in mind that he is a member of the Opposition, his attack on the Minister for Education for raising the fees for the various certificate examinations is understandable. I do not like looking back. There is a certain virtue in it but it is not my nature to go back too far.  I am quite sure, in deference to the fickle utterances, the expressions of a situation where nothing has to be paid for, dearly loved by Deputy Horgan, he would not <Col N="1643" /> have dismissed from his mind that during the reign of the Government to which his party contributed there were similar percentage increases.</P>
      <P>My information is that in respect of the increases for 1976, percentagewise, they were higher than some of those now proposed. I hope Deputy Horgan, who was then in a greater position of influence, went on record as having castigated that Government for indulging in the savage increases he talks about now.  If he tells me that the record is there to show that then I will be much impressed by his sincerity.  If he tells me that there is no record of his having uttered feelings similar to those expressed now, I can only accept that he is doing no more than enjoying the facility given to a person in the Opposition to be as irresposible as he has been and as neglectful of the circumstances which gave rise to the imposition of fees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I gave an indication, unlike the Deputy, how the position might be remedied.  I suggest that if the Deputy does not wish to have them he must not want examinations.  I admit, as an educationalist, that I would like a situation, where we do not have any of the existing examinations.  Unfortunately, nobody has come up with an alternative and we accept that examinations are necessary.  If we accept that we must accept that the costs which go with them are necessary.  We accept, in respect of the teachers and examiners, that they have to be paid.  I am sure that Deputy Horgan was in the forefront when the teachers and examiners looked for increased fees in respect of the services they give in those examinations.  I am quite sure he knows that examiners and superintendents, who come in the main from the ranks of second level teachers, have been agitating in recent years for large increases in remuneration and have threatened that they would not act unless the rates were substantially increased.  I <Col N="1644" /> am sure the Deputy did not criticise the Minister for Education when in 1978 and last year he gave substancial increases to the teachers and examiners.  I think the Deputy was mute and that his silence then would have indicated his agreement with the fact that the Minister, having examined the situation, had agreed that the teachers, the examiners and superintendents who act in respect of all the examinations to which he has referred were entitled to increased fees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan does not interrupt to say that he objected: therefore he accepted.  He has accepted that there is need for examinations, for examiners and superintendents and he has not objected to the increases which the Minister gave in 1978 and 1979 to those people.  I noticed his phrase that if the Government cannot get the money in some other way than by increasing the fees they should not be in the business at all.  He did not give the slightest indication of what other ways they might collect the money.  I recollect that during last year and this year when people were marching the streets people who understandably were uncomfortable about and in disagreement with increases which had occurred in general taxation, Deputy Horgan's voice was not heard to say that those people were in wrong in withholding from the general pool, out of which he now wants money paid, certain moneys which normally went into it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Horgan suggests the imposition of the wealth tax will cover all the area of social endeavour and social concern which is his, I fear the community will benefit very little from it. The Deputy gave us examples of his inescapable logic, as he called it, when he said that in respect of 1979 he noted that there was a sum accruing to the Department from examinations of £620,000.  He suggested that, <i>ipso facto</i>, there was a great gain to the Department out of which he implied part of the increases given to the teachers could be paid.  If I tell the Deputy that in respect of 1979 the <Col N="1645" /> total cost to the Department of administering the examinations and paying the increased fees to teachers and examiners and increased allowances to superintendents cost the Department £2,436,000, I give him a perfect example of what he describes as his inescapable logic.  There we see a net loss to the Department bordering on £2 million.</P>
      <P>He gave us the amount of £1 million accruing to the Department in respect of 1980 and again his inescapable logic was that there was a net gain to the Department out of which the Minister could pay the increases he was giving in the general increase in salaries of teachers.  If I tell him the cost to the Department in respect of administering all those examinations in 1980 was £2,888,000 he has another example of his own inescapable logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to put this to the Deputy, whose commitment to a situation when nobody would have to pay for <Col N="1646" /> anything I would never question: is he serious in talking about free education? I have gone on the record in this House as saying that there is nothing free.  Talking about education generally being free is a fallacy: there is nothing free.  When we talk about making any aspect of it free to anybody there is an obligation on us to accept the responsibility of making somebody else pay the amount of money required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan made no reference to an alternative source of revenue.  He indulged rather in the normal socialist claptrap and gave utterance to superficial platitudes which admittedly have an ephemeral gain for the persons who utter them but which mean little to anybody who has the responsibility of administering any service in the country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that the process of planning review as set out in the Planning and Development Acts of 1963 and 1976 is taking a considerably longer time than was anticipated for the <Col N="1593" /> city of Dublin; if he is satisfied with the review process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I understand that Dublin Corporation completed the review of the Dublin City Development Plan 1971 on 20 October and adopted the Dublin City Development Plan 1980.  The delay in the review arose mainly from the obligation on the planning authority to give the necessary consideration to the many relevant objections and representations made by the public.</P>
      <P>The making or review of their development plan is a function reserved to the elected members of the planning authority. The provisions of section 19 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and section 20, as amended, are flexible and give a considerable degree of freedom to planning authorities in relation to the making and review of development plans.  A planning authority, if they wish, may make the plan in sections.  They could make a plan to deal with specific development objectives &mdash; for example, to deal with the more urgent matters of planning control or other purposes.  Alternatively they might make a plan for a particular district in advance of a plan covering the remainder of their area, I am satisfied with the provisions of the Planning Acts in relation to the review of development plans.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the inner city group and fund was transferred to the Minister for the Environment by the Government on 5 February 1980.  Following the transfer of the group it was decided that the group should be restructured by reducing the number of Departments represented on it and by including representation from Dublin Corporation. The following is the present membership of the group: Mr. B. Drury (Chairman), Department of the Environment; Mr. J.B. Tighe, Department of the Environment; Mr. S. Mac Loinnsigh, Department of Finance; Mr. J. Molloy, Department of Labour; Mr. J. Timbs, Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism; Mr. D. Flanagan, Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of the press report supplied by the Deputy refer to the country edition of a morning newspaper of 7 November but I have been unable to trace any reference in it to the matters mentioned in the question.  However, there were reports on these matters in an evening newspaper of 5 and 6 November and I am assuming that these are what the Deputy intended to refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am prepared on this occasion to deal with the particular criticisms mentioned <Col N="1599" /> in the reports in question, I would in general like to say that I do not think it right or reasonable to expect me to respond to criticisms that are voiced publicly in relation to Garda matters by unidentified members of the force.  I believe that it is not in the national interest or in the interests of the force itself that members' complaints about the internal workings of the Garda organisation should be expressed through the media instead of through the proper official channels.  I would ask Deputies to bear in mind that, by taking cognisance of representations and complaints made anonymously by members of the force, they are, apart from anything else, undermining the position of the staff associations that have been constituted in accordance with law to take up these matters.</P>
    <P>The particular criticisms mentioned in the Question related to radio equipment and transport.</P>
    <P>So far as radio equipment is concerned, it is recognised that the existing Garda radio system is in need of improvement and, as I have already indicated publicly, plans to provide the force with a completely new national radio/ communications service, as modern as any in Europe, are well advanced.  The new system is designed to improve Garda communications in all areas and installation of the system is expected to commence about the middle of next year. Plans are also well advanced for improving the servicing of communications equipment throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As regards Garda transport, I am informed by the Garda authorities that a van was allocated to Waterford city recently to supplement the transport already based there and that the transport requirements of the city and of the Waterford/Kilkenny Division generally are being kept under review.  I am furthermore assured by the Garda authorities that the allegation that only one patrol car in Waterford city is in working order is without foundation; that, in fact, all but one of the cars is good repair and that the one exception is due to be replaced next week.</P>

      <P>If what the Deputy has in mind is the abolition, without compensation for ground landlords, of the contractual obligation to pay ground rent, the answer to his Question is, as I have made clear on numerous occasions already, that the Government have no proposals for the introduction of such legislation.</P>

    <P>

    <P>The Government's commitment was to provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  That has been done.  In the first place, the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses has been made impossible by the provisions of the landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978.  In the second place, persons who are already liable to pay ground rents on residential property are enabled to abolish those ground rents by purchase, at virtually no cost to themselves apart from the purchase price, under the Land Registry purchase scheme that has been provided by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act, 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">

      <P>There are at present a number of provisions drawn up in agreement with the Garda associations, which facilitate the sale and purchase of houses by members <Col N="1605" /> of the Garda Síochána who are transferred. These schemes provide for recoupment of expenses such as stamp duty, auctioneers' or house agents' and solicitors' fees, incidental legal expenses and expenses connected with loans or mortgages.  There is provision also for the payment of certain travelling and subsistence expenses arising from the search for new accomodation, for the payment of removal expenses and for payment within certain limits of other incidential expenses, for example, those arising from the adaptation of household fittings to make them suitable for use in the new house.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice when the last review of conditions in Garda stations throughout the country took place; whether he is satisfied with conditions at present operating in such Garda stations; whether he has any proposals for improvements to such Garda stations; if he will outline by name. number and county the stations in need of attention; if he will give figures for the estimate of capital expenditure which he anticipates will be required in updating these conditions in these stations over the next five years; if he will give figures for capital expenditure in such stations in each of the last four years; if he is aware of the appallingly bad conditions prevailing in many stations at the present time in that they lack basic facilities; and if he will make a statement on these matters.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>In a situation where we are dealing with a total of 700 Garda stations, which range from newly-built stations where accommodation is very good to stations that need to be completely renovated or replaced, it is impossible to provide the type of detailed statistical answer that is sought by these Questions.  There can be few buildings of any type in the country &mdash; private or public &mdash; that could not be said to be in need of some sort of attention. Moreover, Garda superintendents throughout the country have authority to deal directly with the local Office of Public Works staff in order to have a wide variety of improvement and maintenance works carried out to stations within their districts, without any reference to their own headquarters or to my Department. Works of this nature are continually being dealt with and completed.</P>
      <P>The general position can be outlined as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> (1)  Garda stations are inspected annually to determine maintenance requirements and the necessary works are put in hand as soon as possible.  With 700 stations to be maintained, many of them in existence for well over 100 years, the problem of achieving a satisfactory level of maintenance in all cases is a formidable one.  A considerable number of station premises are held by the State under leases, the terms of which in many cases place an obligation on the lessor to maintain at least part of the structure. Certain maintenance work, e.g. painting, is of a recurring nature and is being carried out continually.  While every effort is made to maintain standards at an acceptable level it is not possible at any stage to be satisfied with the condition of every building.</P>
    <P>(2)  Expenditure on the maintenance of Garda stations over the last four years is as follows: 1976 &mdash; £615,236; 1977 &mdash; £727.047; 1978 &mdash; £994.021; 1979 &mdash; £1,207,308.</P>
    <P>(3)  Apart from maintenance works, major and minor improvements works are continually being carried out at Garda stations and new stations are being provided where necessary.  Priority is given to stations where needs for improvement are most pressing.  The total capital expenditure on these works in the four years 1976 to 1979 inclusive is £4,171,000.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the normal rules governing the publication of estimates for public expenditure, I am not in a position to disclose any estimate of what capital expenditure I might think appropriate over the next five years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the name, address and number of all adoption agencies and societies in the State; the official or other status of each such agency and society; the degree of accountability to his or other Departments or semi-State bodies of each such agency and society; the degree of public funding each such agency and society <Col N="1608" /> receives; the number of adoptions for each of the last ten years facilitated by such agencies and societies; whether there is any common criteria or code of standards operated by such agencies and societies; and whether any such criteria or code has the approval of his Department; and if he has any proposals for updating present legislation or regulations in these respects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 20 registered adoption societies, of which 15 are voluntary agencies and five are under the aegis of the health boards.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 36 of the Adoption Act, 1952, adoption societies must be registered with An Bord Uchtála. The board may cancel the registration of any society in accordance with the provisions of section 37 of that Act.</P>
      <P>The health board societies are accountable to and financed by the health boards. The financing of voluntary adoption societies is a matter for themselves.  Since 1974, however, grants have been paid annually by my Department to the voluntary societies, the main purpose being to enable them to employ more qualified social workers.  The grants are paid subject to the condition that the societies keep annual accounts which may be inspected by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The names and addresses of all the societies together with their status and the total grants paid to each of the voluntary societies is set out on the attached tabular statement.  Details of the number of adoption orders made and the societies concerned are set out in the Annual Reports of An Bord Uchtála which are available in the Library.</P>
      <P>Standards cannot be assured simply by regulation.  The board has guidelines in relation to the procedures to be followed by adoption societies and it has power to cancel the registration of any society if it is not satisfied that the society is competent to discharge the obligations imposed on it by the Act.</P>
      <P>Any proposal for changes in legislation in this or any other area will be announced by me at the proper time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance on how many occasions the mobile security ramps operating at the Kildare Street gate of Leinster House have been inoperative since their installation; the number of days of the longest breakdown; the reasons for such continuous mechanical failure; and if he intends to re-consider either the installation or maintenance contract in view of the present unsatisfactory nature of the operation of this security facility despite the best efforts of the Leinster House staff involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since its installation in 1974 the rising step barrier at the Kildare Street entrance to Leinster House has been inoperative on 22 occasions each of one day's duration for the purpose of periodical planned maintenance.  In addition there have been a small number of mechanical breakdowns the longest of which has been the current breakdown from 12 November to date.  A breakdown of nine days in June this year occurred because of the difficulty experienced by the contractor in obtaining spare parts.</P>
      <P>It is considered that the number of mechanical failures is not excessive.  Any piece of machinery will on occasion malfunction and in general repairs have been carried out within a 24-hour period.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works do not propose to review the installation contract at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners have a maintenance contract with the firm which installed the barrier under which quarterly overhauls are carried out and provision is made for prompt attention to faults.  The exceptional delay in remedying <Col N="1612" /> the most recent breakdown is attributable to an accounting difficulty between the contractor and the Commissioners. The difficulty has now been resolved and it is hoped that the necessary work to restore the barrier to full working order can be carried out rapidly.

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will consider the introduction of a special scheme, utilising special house loans or other means, to facilitate the purchase of homes by members of the Army in view of the discouraging conditions at present existing in this respect arising from the involuntary mobility of their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines for the early identification and the management of cases of child non-accidental injury, including neglect, to each health board for circulation to all personnel who come in contact with children in the course of their work.  Such personnel would include hospital staff, general medical practitioners, gardai, public health nurses, social workers and teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the guidelines is to provide guidance for such personnel on <Col N="1615" /> the identification, management and prevention of non-accidental injury to children by reference to a prepared checklist of indicators.  The guidelines also set out the procedures to be followed where there is justification for suspicion that a child may be the victim of abuse.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for monitoring and coordinating the management of cases rests with the director of each community care area to whom all notifications of cases or suspected cases are made.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to devise a foolproof system of this type but I am satisfied that the arrangement now in operation is the most realistic that can be devised.  I would assure the Deputy that it is under constant review.</P>
