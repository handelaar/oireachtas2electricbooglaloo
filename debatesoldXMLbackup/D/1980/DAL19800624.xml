      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate the purpose of his recent meeting with the chairmen of the semi-State bodies: and if he will outline the plans, if any his Government have to secure additional growth and employment in the commercial State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of my meetings with the chairmen and chief executives of the main State-sponsored bodies primarily concerned with economic and commercial development was to discuss:</P>
      <P>&mdash;matters arising from the recently published National Economic and Social Council Report, <i>Enterprise in the Public Sector;</i></P>
      <P>&mdash;the potential for development of enterprise in the public sector;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the contribution which State-sponsored bodies can make to economic development.</P>
      <P>It is intended to continue these discussions and to further explore how best the State-sponsored bodies can contribute to economic growth and the expansion of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the chairmen indicate to the Taoiseach that there was potential for job creation within their various organisations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer to that would be yes, though the Deputy will appreciate that I was not discussing with the chairmen and the chief executives the detailed operations of their companies.  That is a matter that each company would take up with whichever Minister was responsible.  I was talking to the chairmen and the chief executives more in global terms, about the economy as a whole, about what were the prospects, and what contribution the public sector could make, in the overall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach seek from them a commitment in respect of a common approach towards job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasised to them the importance of promoting economic development at all levels, particularly having regard to the necessity for job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they considered themselves inhibited by present conditions and by the criteria under which they are operating?  Did they indicate that this situation represented a major barrier for them in respect of job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My main purpose in meeting them was to explore exactly that, to try to discuss with them what matters might inhibit the public sector as a whole from making its full contribution to economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We were able to identify some areas that were responsible for, perhaps, preventing State companies <Col N="1501" /> from making their full potential contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach indicate to these people that he was prepared to take whatever measures might be necessary to remove these inhibiting factors from their operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook to examine carefully the various elements which we identified as inhibiting the contribution of the semi-State bodies to economic development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the co-ordination of the semi-State sector for industrial and economic development not equally the object of the &ldquo;Seán Lemass-type&rdquo; Industrial Development Consortium on which many of the semi-State bodies were represented?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My meeting with the chairmen and chief executives of the semi-State companies arose out of the publication of the NESC report, <i>Enterprise in the Public Sector.</i>  It was to discuss that report and its implications that I called these meetings and I propose to have further meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the over-all objective of the meeting, as it has been described to the House, indistinguishable from the over-all objective of the &ldquo;Seán Lemass-type&rdquo; Industrial Development Consortium on which most of these semi-State bodies were represented but which has since been wound up in despair?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the difference between that consortium, now in liquidation, and the present set of informal meetings which serve no purpose other than to provide a platform for publicity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree as to the necessity for there being as much incentive as possible for job creation so far as State and semi-State bodies are concerned?  Did he inform the chairmen of his intention not to honour the national understanding so far as they were concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice for many years that no member of the Government should engage in any activities whatsoever that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the answer just given is not an answer to the question asked, can I get a bit more clarity about this?  Is the House to take it that no member of the Government has held a directorship since his appointment? The answer given just now was about &ldquo;activities.&rdquo;  It is specifically directorships we want to know about. Can the House be assured that no member of the Government at any time since his appointment as a member of the Government has held a directorship?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald, Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Keating</b> asked the Minister for Justice the Vote from which it was proposed to pay the £100,000 reward offered in the efforts to apprehend those involved with the Mountbatten murders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what particular Vote such money would be paid from was not gone into when the decision was made.  The Government's concern at the time was to make people aware that a sum of £100,000 would be available, if necessary, to pay for information. However, since it is obviously open to the Deputies to ask if any decision as to the source of payment was made by anybody at any later date, I propose to deal with that point.</P>
      <P>First, however, in view of some apparently persisting misunderstandings concerning the offer, I should like to make a few points clear.  There was not at any time a reward fund of £100,000, or of any other sum, in existence for this purpose and suggestions that I refused to say what happened to a reward fund are totally misconceived.  No question of accountability arises from the making of an offer that money would be made available if the need arose.  Accountability arises in respect of, but only in respect of, voted moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> In the course of a reply given on my behalf of 21 May 1980, I explained to the Dáil that information of a certain kind could not be given without jeopardising the prospects of offering rewards in the future.  I did not say that it would not be given but that, if it were given, certain consequences would follow.  The reasons I gave were dismissed as &ldquo;tortured logic&rdquo; by an Opposition spokesman who suggested that I could deal with each case on its merits.  That, however, is precisely what I could not do.  I repeat the reasons briefly, because they can involve matters of life and death.  Disclosure that a reward was paid can be made directly or, with equal certainty, indirectly.  If I were to say in some cases that no reward was paid and, having established that pattern, if I were then in another case to refuse to make a statement, the change in the pattern of answering would itself confirm that reward money was paid in that case.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that disclosure that a reward was paid does not involve disclosure of the name of the recipient. In fact it would be quite likely to do so. More specifically, it would be likely to involve a high risk of disclosure, not to the public at large but&mdash;what is more to the point&mdash;to some organisation or group who would know that, if the Garda had got information at all, the source must have been such-and-such a person.  The consequences of that need no elaboration, and that is the reality that has to be taken into account and that cannot be brushed aside for a life could depend on it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I also am fully aware of the fact that, apart from the Secret Service Vote, moneys voted by this House are subject to accountability. Of course, the institutional arrangements for accountability are through the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee and not at Question Time, but I do not wish to take any stand on that.</P>
    <P>Accordingly if, despite what was said on the last occasion and today, it is the considered view of spokesmen for either of the opposite parties that I should say <Col N="1512" /> whether, pursuant to the offer made in this case, reward money, whether of £100,000 or any lesser sum, has been paid from any Vote apart from the Secret Service Vote&mdash;and it is obvious that the full sum of £100,000, whatever about some lesser sum, could not have been paid from the Secret Service Vote&mdash;then I am prepared to answer.</P>
    <P>However, I shall do so on the clear understanding that as far as I am concerned a situation will then have been created in which any future governmental or ministerial offer of a substantial reward would, in all honesty, have to be supplemented by a specific warning that, if the reward were paid, that fact would be likely to become known to the guilty party and his associates, and could lead to the source of the information being identifiable, at least to their own satisfaction, by the people responsible for the crime, and that anybody accepting the reward would have to take the risks involved. That, in my view, is as good as saying that we might as well abandon any idea of such an offer in the future.  I am sure the nation would survive such a situation, but offers of rewards have at times in the past apparently been beneficial.  I recognise that, in principle, there is a possibility of misuse of public funds if there is not public disclosure, and there is no easy answer.</P>
    <P>I am therefore in the hands of the parties opposite.  I do not wish to be unfair in this matter and it might be later alleged that Deputies were taken unawares and had not been given time to assess the implications properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

The second option is to ask me here and now for further information relating to any payment from a Vote other than the Secret Service Vote.  If I am so asked I shall regret it because of the consequences I have outlined but I shall feel obliged to answer.  The third option is to take time to consider the situation and, if they think it appropriate, to put the question later. While it would, of course, be a matter for the Ceann Comhairle to decide, I think that such a question would be admissible as a separate question that would not contravene the six months rule.</P>

      <P>Nobody is suggesting breaking that precedent.  The Minister suggests that there is a second option, that we ask him if the money has come from some other vote and that by so asking, and he replies, somebody's life could be put in danger.  That can have only one implication, that some money has been paid from another vote but that if we stay quiet the Minister will suppress this in an unconstitutional manner.</P>

Perhaps the third option is the one that should be considered at this stage by him, to wait until such time as he analyses what is in my reply and come back to me again on this.  I honestly believe the Deputy has misunderstood my reply.  In fairness to the Deputy I should like to state that I appreciate fully what is involved as much as the Deputy does.  I am not trying to wrong-foot the Deputy in any way.

An offer of up to £100,000 was made for information but a situation could arise whereby moneys less than £100,000 would be paid for information.  The full reward might not be paid.  We would be acting on the advice of the Garda Commissioner who would put a value on the information given.  It is possible that a situation could exist whereby moneys paid for information could be contained within the present Secret Service Vote.  I accept that there are serious difficulties.</P>

If only half of the reward was paid it would be necessary to increase the allocation to the Secret Service Vote and by virtue of that alone it would become known to organisations such as those referred to by the Minister that money had been paid out by way of reward.  The real logic of the Minister's position, as he outlined it, is that the Government were totally irresponsible in initially offering a reward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> The detailed deployment of Garda resources is a matter to be decided primarily by the Commissioner.  The Garda authorities have informed me that, having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services, they consider that the present Garda strength in Clonmel is resonably adequate. The police needs of the area will be kept under review and will be further considered according as the additional manpower being recruited becomes available for assignment to the various centres.</P>

I understand that there was a meeting of the Junior Chamber of Commerce in February and the incidence of crime was discussed and there were requests for increased Garda strength in Clonmel in 1977.  At present there are 34 members of the force there. I have no doubt but that the town is growing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to the recent remarks of a Circuit Court Judge and a District Court Judge (details supplied) regarding the high incidence of uninsured drivers; if so, if he has any plans to improve the present highly unsatisfactory situation, with particular reference to the protection of injured parties and victims of such drivers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of remarks said to have been made recently by two members of the <Col N="1525" /> Judiciary regarding uninsured drivers.  In one case the remarks referred to the large number of cases which were coming before the courts for uninsured driving and highlighted the seriousness of the offence.  In the other case the remarks referred to the difficulty in obtaining recompense which is faced by drivers whose cars are damaged in accidents involving uninsured drivers.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are very much aware of the problem of uninsured driving. They give this matter a great deal of attention, as is evidenced by the fact that in 1978 prosecutions were brought in respect of 38,681 offences relating to compulsory vehicle insurance and, in 1979, 41,735 such prosecutions were brought.  I should explain that, apart from the offence of driving without insurance, these figures include other offences such as failing to produce a certificate of insurance at a Garda Station within the statutory period of ten days. Moreover I understand that a direction is being prepared for circulation to the force directing attention to the need for sustained enforcement of the law in relation to compulsory insurance.</P>
      <P>The victims of uninsured drivers may in certain circumstances obtain compensation in respect of personal injury under a scheme which is embodied in an agreement between the Minister for the Environment and the Motor Insurers' Bureau&mdash;a body to which the licensed motor insurers must belong&mdash;or under an arrangement operated by the bureau outside this agreement.  The bureau does not pay compensation in respect of damage to vehicles in such cases.  Any modification of the scheme or any proposals for alternative arrangements would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment rather than for me.</P>

      <P>I could not tell the Deputy truthfully whether or not there has been an increase or a decrease in checkpoints.  I have not got that information. But I can say that the Garda report which I have here mentions that special attention is directed to the problem of uninsured driving during vehicle checks which are held once weekly in Garda subdistricts.  In addition a special inspection of all vehicles for motor tax, insurance and driving licence was carried out on a nationwide basis during the week commencing 25 February 1980 and that an inspection is being prepared for circulation to the force directing attention to the need for sustained enforcement of the law in relation to compulsory insurance.  Statistics of offences in which proceedings were taken in respect of compulsory vehicle insurance are as follows: 1975, 30,000; 1976, 32,000; 1977, 36,000; 1978, 38,000; 1979, 41,000.

      <P>The European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children was signed by me, subject to ratification, on behalf of the State at the Conference of European Ministers of Justice which took place in Luxembourg on 20-21 May 1980.  The convention, in fact, has 30 articles, most of them with two or three paragraphs, and I am unable to agree that it would be a function of mine to outline, in reply to a parliamentary question, the provisions of such a document, prepared and published under the auspices of the Council of Europe, unless perhaps I were asking the Dáil to take some action on it which, in fact, I am not at this stage.  The formal position is that copies are obtainable from the Directorate of Legal Affairs of the Council of Europe but I am prepared, informally, to let Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Keating have a copy from my own stock if they contact my office.  Alternatively, while it is not a document of a kind that is formally deposited in the Library, I assume that, if there is any demand for it, it is open to the Librarian to get copies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only amendment to this Bill tabled on Committee Stage.  The effect of the amendment would be to recognise the historic area of Fingal.  I explained in the House last week that when the Danes arrived in this country over 1,000 years ago the first place they visited was the coastline of North County Dublin.  They took the figurehead from their longship and carried it to a place of rising ground which has been known ever since as &ldquo;Man-o-war&rdquo; and that is the official name of the townland.  They claimed all the territory which could be seen from that place and established their emblem, the black raven of Fingal, which is well known to-day and commemorated in the name of the Black Raven Pipe Band established by Thomas Ashe and William Rooney, a former Member of this House whose son also served as a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of Fingal is an identifiable area running from Delvin bridge southwards and it is the ideal description for the constituency which has been unimaginatively named Dublin North by the electoral commission.  The Minister explained that one of his apprehensions in regard to this amendment was the fact that before the Battle of Clontarf, Brian Boru, a Clare man, had razed and burned as far north as Delvin bridge.  It was pointed out that the Minister should not allow county prejudices to obtain for a further 1,000 years in such a way that he, a Clare man, would try to victimise the area of Fingal and refuse to have the name enshrined in legislation.  I then suggested to the Minister that, in view of the fact that we have some quite noted personages living in the area of Fingal, he should call to see that gentleman who professes himself interested in culture, tradition, history and heritage, the Taoiseach, who lives in the rural area of Kinsealy, and ask him whether he would prefer to live in the constituency of Dublin North or the constituency of Dublin Fingal, since he and his family have long associations with the Fingal Harriers.  Last Sunday the Taoiseach's Minister of State and I participated in the opening of the festival of Fingallians, the oldest football club in North County <Col N="1708" /> Dublin.  The local newspaper is <i>The Fingal Independent.</i>  I suggested to the Minister, who is not unknown to have a wager from time to time, that I would bet him £1&mdash;the Chair pointed out that the Chamber was not the place to place bets and I assume the Chair would not take commission on the outcome&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will hold the bet, if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Chair is offering or taking odds.  I suggested to the Minister that, if he went to see the Taoiseach, he would be told to accept this amendment and that I would win my £1.  I also undertook that I would personally appeal to the Taoiseach, because I know that since taking up that office he is opening everything openable in Malahide and Kinsealy.  In that context I met him on Friday night and made a direct appeal to him.  He was gracious enough to say that he would consider it over the weekend. The House is now waiting to hear whether the Minister, following discussion with the Taoiseach, has reconsidered his position in relation to this amendment which proposes to enshrine in legislation the historic area of Fingal and to give that constituency the name by which its residents would better know it than the unimaginative name of Dublin North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why it should not be changed if that makes everyone happy.  Deputy Boland's point seems to be fairly reasonable.  Perhaps the Minister has not had an opportunity of talking to the Taoiseach but perhaps he will let us know what exactly happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that I mentioned Brian Boru has nothing to do with my acceptance of the amendment.  I merely raised this in the context of what Deputy Boland said about the Danish connection with that area.  I said on the last day that we had agreed to accept the commission's report entirely without amendment. <Col N="1709" /> I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment because there is a definite pattern going through the whole report with regard to the names of constituencies. The Dublin constitutencies are called Dublin South, Dublin South-East, Dublin North, Dublin West, Dublin South-West and so on.  The same applies to places like Cork and Galway.  I am not accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being very weak kneed here and is afraid to take his courage in his hands and amend the Bill.  I feel that the decision not to change the report was in the context of not amending portions of the constituencies for fear that this would have a roll-over effect on every other constituency. This amendment does not change in any way the context of the Bill.  It does not matter to me whether this constituency is called North Dublin or Fingal Harriers as this is only a technicality, but given its established name and the historic significance of the name, it seems to be only common sense to agree to Deputy Boland's request and meet the change here.  For some strange reason the Minister has frozen on the idea that he cannot make a change.</P>
      <P>If the Minister made a change here he would at least have ensured that a precedent of not changing any commission's report was not established.  The House should demonstrate its ability to change a commission's report.  After all, they are only recommendations.  The Government are afraid to make the change because it might throw some slight on the House or dishonour the members of the commission but that is utter non-sense. The members of these commissions are sensible people who do what they are appointed to do and then report their findings so that this House can make their decision.  The House is only looking but is afraid to make any decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has obviously been instructed not to make any changes and the reasons do not appear to be valid. That order has been handed down and <Col N="1710" /> the Minister is obeying it to the letter. That is regrettable and it will have repercussions. It does not seem to matter to the Government that we are copper-fastening the future.  When such reports come in again the precedent will be not to change them as it would not be in the best interests because these commissions have been set up and their reports are not to be changed.  We are setting a very bad precedent.  If the Minister made the simple change he would be doing something for posterity.  The Minister seems to be afraid to deviate because the Government totally accepted the commission's report.  In this case all the Minister is doing is turning this House into a rubber stamp.  That is despicable and it is not what this House is all about. This House will not be thanked in the future for handing away their powers as they do in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Minister's line of reasoning on this.  The Minister gave as his reason for not accepting this amendment the fact that the Dublin constituencies followed a pattern in which they were named Dublin North, Dublin South-East, Dublin South-West and so on.  This constituency should be named Dublin Fingal because it is different from the other Dublin constituencies. It is the one Dublin constituency which contains a large rural area, an area that has an historic tradition, an entity with a tradition of its own.  The constituency of Dublin North is much different from the constituency of Dublin South-East where we have Leeson Street and Baggot Street and so on.  The constituency of Dublin North comprises of places such as the townland of Chapelmidway, the Bowsie Road, the townland of Pass If You Can, the townland of the Man O'War, the townland of the Nags Head, the townland of Milverton, the townland of Skepubble, the townland of Quickapenny and the townland with the beautiful name of Newtown Oldtown, the areas of Rowlestown St. Margaret's, Naul and Garristown.  Surely one cannot put together a constituency comprising of those areas and say that it should be called <Col N="1711" /> Dublin North, because Baggot Street, Leeson Street and that area are called Dublin South-East.  It is an entirely different area, different in its character and make up and it does not want to be known as Dublin North.  It has been known as Fingal for a thousand years and it should be described as Fingal in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien makes a very valid point.  While the commission's recommendation is accepted unanimously by both sides of the House it should not be taken that if some future commission make an absolutely ridiculous suggestion it should be accepted just because no Government or minister has the courage to say that it is wrong, that all parties recognise that it is wrong and that they are prepared to amend the suggestion to improve the situation.  That is what happens in Great Britain and in other countries and there is no reason why we should fall over ourselves to rubber stamp something just so that nobody can point the finger and say, &ldquo;You are the fellows who tried to change the Commission's proposal&rdquo;.  What the Minister is doing by refusing this amendment is establishing a precedent where subsequent suggestions by any commission irrespective of their validity or workability, will be accepted because the Minister is hamstrung into putting them before the House without amendment even if all the Members of the House feel it will not work.  Nobody will have the courage to approach this in a practical sensible way.  Surely on this small amendment we would have established the precedent that the House were prepared to remind themselves and the nation that they are the legislators, that the Oireachtas enacts the legislation and that if the Oireachtas feels that some suggestion merits improvement then that improvement will be made when the Bill is being debated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final thing I wish to say to the Minister is that, if he is going to continue in his opposition to accepting this amendment, are we to take it that the Taoiseach and the other members of his <Col N="1712" /> party have agreed that Dublin North should not be called Dublin Fingal and that the Taoiseach, who lives in that area, and other members of his party are in agreement that they prefer to see the area of Fingal deprived of its name, denied its historic tradition and established as the unimaginative constituency of Dublin North?  Are we to take it that the Minister is speaking on behalf of all other members of his party in saying that they are opposed to Fingal being called Fingal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody over the years worried as to whether it was called Dublin-North, as it has been in the past. Nobody worried about changing it to Dublin Fingal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Even Dublin North County.  The Deputy mentioned that it was the only part of the county where you have a large rural area.  It is not. You have Dublin South and Dublin South-West each with large rural areas. There is nothing unusual or peculiar to Dublin North as regards being more rural than city constituencies any more than there is in the case of those two constituencies.  I am just following the pattern established by the commission in regard to the naming of the different constituencies.  Nobody in the past worried whether it was North County Dublin or Dublin Fingal.  The people concerned still continued to live and vote there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of that area do not wish to become part of Greater Dublin.  They do not wish to be taken into this great, amorphous block and be described as part of Dublin North or anything else.  They believe they live in the county, outside Dublin, that they live in Fingal.  The Minister and his colleagues are forcing the old traditions away from Fingal and forcing it into Dublin city, depriving it of its heritage and its separate identity.  I do not believe that the Minister or his colleagues will be <Col N="1713" /> thanked for doing that.  I make a final appeal to the Minister to consider this suggestion once again before the Report Stage.  The Minister pointed out on the last occasion that there was no urgency about this Bill and that we only had it before the House because the draftsman prepared it after the commission had made their submission.  Therefore there should be no problem in taking the Report Stage at a later date and allowing further consideration of my suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House today since I made most of the points I wished to make during my intervention on Thursday last. There is not any objection to the Bill, a relatively small Bill concerning merely a change of venue from Galway to Rossaveal, but I would like some information regarding the expenditure of moneys voted for harbour development works.  According to the Estimates the figure in this respect for this year is £3 million while for last year it was £1.75 million in respect of fishery centres and £20,033 in respect of grants for harbours. Was the £1.75 million expended last year and is there a likelihood that the £3 million will be expended this year?  The reason for asking this question is that during the time in which I was associated with the Department I learned that down through the years of successive Fianna Fáil Governments sizeable percentages of the moneys voted were not expended and consequently found their way back to Exchequer funds.  This resulted in a situation in which Fianna Fáil Deputies could go around the country quoting the amounts which were being spent on harbour development by giving the figures as indicated in the Book of Estimates.  The figures in the Book of Estimates should be based on fact and not on fiction.  The present Minister has not been in office long enough to have changed the practice I have described, but I hope he will be in a position to tell us what percentage of the moneys voted for harbour works were expended last year and what the percentage in this respect is likely to be this year.  Perhaps, too, he may be able to tell us the relative figure for 1977-78.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, when Fianna Fáil were trying to return to office, fisheries became an emotive subject.  We all know that without proper harbour facilities it is very difficult for fishermen to land catches and so on.  However, we do not hear anything now either from the Taoiseach or from those five Ministers who were so vocal between 1973 and 1977 regarding the 50-mile exclusive limit, who gave the impression that in the event of Fianna Fáil's return to power at the general election there would be a 50-mile exclusive limit and that only Irish fishermen would be allowed fish within such a limit.  But the silence now is all the more evidence of the gimmickry in which the Government party engaged in that period.  Now after three years of Fianna Fáil Government we find that <Col N="1717" /> small harbours, slips and piers which are much in need of development are being neglected.  This is certainly the situation in my constituency and all the evidence seems to indicate that it is typical of the situation in the country generally.  In these circumstances the Minister should ensure that moneys voted for harbour works should be expended in full.  I doubt if there is such under expenditure in other spheres.  Perhaps there is but Deputies simply do not notice.  It is a shame that as much as 66 per cent, or £2 out of every £3 voted for harbour development, goes back to the Exchequer. There is the problem, too, of trying to sell fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that the Minister will reply to the questions I have raised regarding the expenditure of the moneys voted.  I might refer in passing to the fact that both the last Minister and the present one are from inland <Col N="1718" /> areas, Roscommon and Kildare respectively. I am not reflecting on either of those people when I say that a Deputy from a maritime constituency would be more conversant with this very important industry.  Such a Deputy would have greater knowledge of the problems and the difficulties associated with the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would impress on the Minister the desirability of the smaller centres.  We have 101 of them in south-west Cork where possibly we have the longest mileage of coast in the country.  Kerry would have about the same mileage.  My point is that we must try to get markets for our fish.  In Castletownbere the fish is left on the pier unsold.  There is an obligation on the Minister and the Government to try to get markets for that fish.</P>
      <P>Another matter I should like the Minister to look into is the way skippers deal with their crews from the point of view of availability of documents for scrutiny.  I do not know if the Minister, from an inland constituency, would be conversant with that problem. Documentation should be available for each member of a crew, as well as for the skipper, containing figures about catches and the way the money for the sale of fish has been divided.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us a breakdown of these figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House.  I merely wish to repeat what Deputy Murphy has been saying.  I <Col N="1719" /> would not expect a Minister from an inland constituency, far removed from the seaboard, to have a feel for the fishing industry, to have a sensitivity for the affairs of the people who sail the fishing boats.  I come from a maritime county and I claim to have some knowledge of the problems of fishermen because I have opportunities to talk to them frequently. Last week I raised the question of the Minister's visit to County Donegal and I said that the harbour at Greencastle serves the biggest fishing community in Donegal outside Killybegs.  Donegal, of course, is a fisherman's county, and has been right back to the Famine, during which time generation has followed generation in the fishing tradition.  Many people who fish out of Donegal have no other way to earn a livelihood.  Fishing is part of their make-up.</P>
      <P>It is sad that Donegal County Council and the Department of Fisheries have failed or neglected or declined to apply to the EEC Regional Fund for money that would enable major harbour development to be commenced at Greencastle.  Such development is necessary if fishermen in that county are to be enabled to earn a livelihood.  Apart from Killybegs and Dunmore East, there are few other fishing ports as important as Greencastle.  It has the added dimension of being involved cross-Border, and for that reason alone it deserves particular attention.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister went on his trip to County Donegal he should have given advance notice of his advent to the fishermen.  What he did was to talk to a few people in a Malin hotel and sang a song known as &ldquo;The Four Green Fields&rdquo; to show how Irish and anti-Partitionist he is.  Instead, he should have met the fishermen in an orderly way and discussed their problems with them.  He lives in a constituency far removed from the sea, confined to Kildare, protected from the affairs and the problems of fishermen. He did not tune in to that industry until given responsibility for this Department. Outside agriculture, fishing is our second major industry.  The Minister shakes his head.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said tourism is more important than fisheries. So the Minister is more concerned about tourism, about tourists who come in here, than the men who have to stay here and fish dangerous waters to earn a living. That is an indication of the Minister's and the Government's concern about this industry.  He shows this abstraction with tourism, this notion that tourism is the second biggest industry.  I challenge that because I regard tourism as being after fishing.  Those engaged in the Foyle Fisheries, about which I spoke at length on Thursday, are unable to berth their boats in Greencastle.  There has been cross-Border trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would it not have been more in keeping with the office the Minister holds if he arranged to meet the fishermen or their representative bodies and discuss with them in an adult way the problems they have instead of politely telling them as an afterthought, having eaten their T-bone steak and prawn cocktail and having drunk wines of the best and having entertained the audience to a few songs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Minister goes back to Donegal would he ask to meet <Col N="1724" /> the fishermen, particularly those of Greencastle whose problem is a major one?  There are two parallel lines on the map, one going seawards from the Donegal coast at Inishowen Head and the other going seaward from the Derry coast.  The one off the Donegal coast separates the Foyle fishery commission from the Letterkenny fishery board.  The one off the Derry coast separates the Foyle fishery from the northern fishery board.  These are contentious, age-old issues which have never been properly resolved.  The Minister should at least listen to my plea.  He will not be there for very long but while he is would he listen to the plea I am making &mdash; listen to the fishermen of Greencastle, to the men who put their lives in danger, to the men who would explain the difficulty they have that while fishing drift net off the Donegal coast in the corridor that goes between those two lines the tide sweeps them over the lines and they find themselves fishing waters they do not have licences for?  That is a major problem and one that demands the Minister's attention more than eating bloody T-bone steaks at a dance in Malin.  The next time I raise this, answer the charges I am making and do not be personal about it because it is no substitute for intelligence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absurd that we should get to a situation where there is only three minutes left on such an important issue.  I am interested in Rossaveal Harbour and have been for many years.  What proposals has the Minister for its development?  I am glad that he is moving from Galway to Rossaveal as the major fishing harbour.  It is infinitely better than it was and greatly improved as a result of work done over the last eight or ten years.  The outside harbour has been greatly extended but nearly two-thirds of it is still full of rocks.  If one is to take the transport facilities left behind in Galway, the roads, railways, marketing facilities, care of boats and all the facilities needed to run a modern <Col N="1725" /> fishing port, what is the Minister going to do about clearing out the rest of the harbour which, as he may or may not know, has marks on it keeping trawlers into a very narrow part of the harbour, about one-third of it?  If it is to be fully developed, surely the rest of the harbour will have to be deepened and the rocks taken out.</P>
      <P>Small fishermen use the inner harbour and that is in complete decay.  There is a notice at the harbour stating that it is dangerous for pedestrians and fishermen.  They cannot use it.  They have no access to the big harbour and are denied the facilities in the inner harbour. What are the Minister's proposals for a harbour board and what kind of harbour board does he propose to establish? Will it be one which is drawn from the county council with the various interests involved or will it be an <i>ad hoc</i> board established by the Minister arising from legislation?  What money, if any, is available and during what period of time will that money be spent?  What are the Minister's proposals for making a highly developed mechanised and properly administered harbour for the western seaboard out of Rossaveel harbour as an alternative to Galway?  It is a welcome development as employment is badly needed in that part of Connemara. More employment could be created as a result of the development of the harbour and, in addition, downstream industries could be established.  Proper fish processing industries, bottling and tinning rather than putting the fish into a barrel and sending it to France as is done predominantly at present, should be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>Between £4 million and £5 million will be spent on the development. That is based on the cost of the work at present being carried out at Howth.  The work on the local roads will be the responsibility of the local authority, as will the water and sewerage grants and a harbour advisory committee has been set up.  That committee is representative of all interests and consists of representatives of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, two officials from the Office of Public Works, one from the Department of Finance, Padraig O Durcáin ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, Representatives from Galway County Council, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Galway and Aran Fishermen's Co-op, Galway and Aran Fishermen's Association, duine amháin as Údarás na Gaeltachta agus fear ionaid más rud é nach féidir leis an lad sin teacht agus an Coiste Pobail Rossaveal freisin, P.

    <P>We met those people last week at their first inaugural meeting in Dublin &mdash; they propose to hold future meetings in Rossaveal. If any Member feels that any area or group have been left out I am sure we can arrange to have a representative <Col N="1727" /> co-opted on to the Rossaveal Harbour Development Advisory Committee. Deputy White raised a question about oil rigs but I do not think we should have representatives of oil rigs in a fishery harbour.  Galway, possibly, would be a more realistic place to deal with the question of oil rigs and the servicing of them.  We have sufficient money to deal with the development project. It was mentioned that we should deal with other matters and that we were not spending enough money on our harbours, but if one carried out a cost-benefit analysis one would realise that the expenditure is quite substantial in view of the landings.  We hope to improve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>

      <P>We need it to land the fish and get it away and the money will be available as required for the planned development of Rossaveal this year. Five other ports are listed also, and they are equally important but that is not the end of the road as far as small ports are concerned.  Other work will go ahead in those ports.  Dingle is being surveyed.  I visited Clare Island recently and Inisturk and I realise the work that is needed in those places.  Last week I was in Killybegs and I am aware that dredging is required there for bigger boats.  Work is going ahead in other areas as well as in the five designated ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy White that the hours of auction will have to be settled in the light of the needs of the fishermen but we must bear in mind the problems that occurred in places like Cornwall.  There was talk there of rigged prices and wrong weights.  In connection <Col N="1728" /> with the Bulgarian vessels I am aware that the fishermen welcomed them, as I did, because of the better prices. Anybody who sees boxes of herrings increased from £9 per box to £22 per box would be glad of such progress but we must think of the overall national interest and the question of safeguarding employment.  We must also consider improving onshore facilities for processing. There has been a lot of State aid investment in that area.  I should like to tell Deputy Murphy that at no stage was 66 per cent of the money allocated to the Fisheries Vote unexpended.  A total of £3 million has been allocated for 1980 and it is expected that all of that will be spent.  Last year £1,750,000 was allocated and £1,645,000 was spent.  In 1975 a total of £682,000 was allocated and spent.  In general it can be said that most years the money allocated is spent. One exception was in 1978 when £1,304,000 was allocated and only £696,000 was spent.  Members anxious to get clarification on any items should contact me and I will facilitate them.</P>

The Attorney General's office was consulted and I am advised that every attempt to commit an offence is an offence at common law &mdash; that is very clear &mdash; and that if one creates an offence in statute law it is automatically an offence to attempt to do whatever it is that constitutes the offence.  We looked up the matter further and I am also informed that it is covered in paragraph 4100 of the 38th edition of Archbold's <Col N="1730" /> Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, a generally accepted authority on these matters.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory limit of the amount of grants which may be made to Córas Tráchtála to enable that body to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish exports.</P>
      <P>The Export Promotion Act, 1959, under which Córas Tráchtála was established, fixed at £1 million the total amount of grants which may be made to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Subsequent amending Acts raised this limit.  The latest one, in 1977, increased it to £45 million and the present Bill proposes to raise it to £90 million.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1959, Córas Tráchtála has had a key role in our export growth.  In 1959 the total value of exports stood at £130 million.  By 1979 that value had reached £3,498 million.</P>
      <P>Many factors, of course, lie behind this remarkable record of expansion.  But there are few who would not especially acknowledge the vital function played by Córas Tráchtála's carefully conceived and progressively implemented programmes of export promotion over the years, programmes which have always been characterised by an alert responsiveness to the developing and changing needs of our exporters.  This increasing pace in the scope and volume of its export promotion activities, however, has necessarily reflected itself in increases in the board's rate of expenditure. Payments to the board by way of grant-in-aid up to 31 December 1979 amounted to £37,956,885, which leaves a balance of £7,043,115 unissued from the existing limit of £45 million.  This balance is now insufficient to meet the board's financial requirements up to the end of the present year in respect of which a sum of £7.98 million will be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> The present Bill is, therefore, designed to relieve the statutory constraint involved. Out of the sum of £90 million now being proposed, however, the actual grant-in-aid provision to be made in each financial year will, of course, continue to be included in the annual Vote for my Department, which will come before the Dáil in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the moneys provided annually to the board by way of grant-in-aid are expended on the provision by the board of a comprehensive package of export support aids and services.  These aids and services are of a wide-ranging nature and include advice and basic market information, specialist services in the fields of market research, incentive grants for individual exporters visiting overseas markets, and the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.  All of these aids and services are subjected by the board to constant review to ensure that each one is individually suited to the changing needs of exporters, that it appropriately complements the other aids and services at any given time and that it meets the essential requirement that the funds available to Córas Tráchtála are employed in the best possible fashion.</P>
    <P>During 1979 total exports rose to £3,498 million, which represents a value increase of 18.2 per cent over the previous year.  This was no mean achievement in a year which produced an even more difficult environment for export activity than had been anticipated. Credit for this performance is due mainly to manufacturing industry, particularly in the categories producing goods other than food, drink and tobacco. These increased by almost 24 per cent in value and by an estimated 15 per cent in volume &mdash; figures which place us, in comparable respects, ahead of most of our OECD partners.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, reassuring that exports overall continue to grow.  At the same time, it is clear that the growth rate must be significantly raised if we are to reach our basic economic targets.  To help maximise the gross value of exports is Córas Tráchtála's key objective.  Haviing <Col N="1733" /> regard to the great and growing importance of exports in the economy, the successful achievement of this aim would be vital at any time.  But it has never been more so than now, confronted as we are with the urgent need to close our balance of payments deficit as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>For its part Córas Tráchtála is confident that 1980 will feature another solid export performance.  Industry, though hampered somewhat by adverse world trade conditions, will continue in its dominant role and increases are also anticipated in agricultural exports and those of raw materials.</P>
    <P>The net result is likely to be a value increase in the year's total exports of about 20 per cent &mdash; and this in spite of a world recession involving a poorer performance by most of the major industrialised economies than last year.</P>
    <P>If this forecast proves correct &mdash; and I have every confidence that it will &mdash; the principal reasons are likely to be the growing strength of Irish industry in the international marketplace and the extra effort which, as our exporters have long recognised, is necessary in the face of challenging conditions.  Our exporting industry as a whole has never been better geared for success than it is today.  The last ten years have seen dramatic progress in the development of professional expertise and, while there may be individual exceptions, our manufacturers in general have never been better qualified in terms of expertise, support and morale to do the job required of them.</P>
    <P>In their export efforts these manufacturers can be assured that they will continue to be ably assisted by the full resources available to Córas Tráchtála. The organisation now has 22 overseas offices, in 19 countries and all five continents.  It is particularly alert to the requirements of Irish exporters to the EEC which, in the free trade situation, is, of course, our largest potential market.  Through its offices in the EEC member states, Córas Tráchtála maintains close touch with developments, and <Col N="1734" /> is well equipped to furnish exporters with expert advice and market intelligence in this vital area for our trade.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware already of the expansion and improvement in Córas Tráchtála's services for 1980 as set out in its Export Promotion Programme, 1980.  It will come as no surprise to anyone, however, to be told that the cost to Córas Tráchtála of maintaining existing services and providing new ones is subject to the same inflationary pressure as any other costs.  I am certain, nonetheless, that the House will share my view that, in the interests of the continued expansion of our exports, Córas Tráchtála must have adequate funds at its disposal to provide the services which are greatly valued by our exporters and on which the development of our exports depends so much.</P>
    <P>It is with confidence, therefore, that I recommend this Bill.  It will increase by an additional £45 million the statutory limit on the funds which may be allocated to Córas Tráchtála to enable that organisation to continue its vital export promotion and development activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As the Minister has said it is an enabling Bill which will allow CTT to expand their operations in aid of industry in this country and in helping them to export more as time goes on.  The original Act of 1959 provided a sum not exceeding £1 million in the form of grant-in-aid.  As the Minister has said, we have come a long way since that Act and are now talking in terms of £90 million.  This is a sign of the times on two fronts, firstly, on the major expansion in exports which industry have fought for and won on the international export market and, secondly, again as the Minister has said, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta are not immune to, or in any way isolated from, the ravages of high inflation.  These two factors are responsible for our discussing here, a sum of the order of £90 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Acts have been passed by this House since 1959 along the same lines as this one for the same purpose of increasing <Col N="1735" /> the muscle of CTT in their operations on behalf of our industry. This country ought to be thankful to this agency for the magnificent work they have undertaken in the past and are continuing to undertake and we are now looking at their development programme for the future.  They are an organisation without which, it can be safely said, this country would fare very badly at the moment.  It is imperative that, having manufactured goods, we are able to get markets for them and send them abroad. Looking back on debates on other Bills introduced along the same lines concerning the provision of moneys for CTT, one is struck by the expansion of the locations in which the CTT now operate. The Minister has stated the current figure at 22 centres abroad.  I notice that they started off with seven, then had nine, 15, 17 and now 22.</P>
    <P>The kind of expertise required of personnel involved in an operation of this kind is of a very high quality and must be, if they are to survive in this cauldron of international competition where other producing countries have their representative at work to persuade people to purchase their goods.  It is a tribute to the personnel attached to the CTT spread over five continents that they can fight and, indeed, succeed in getting their share of the cake when it comes down to the real, hard crunch of selling products. It is also a tribute to our industrial sector that they can produce goods of a quality which can be sold by CTT.  They realise that quality and standards are of the utmost importance in a world of increasing sophistication in the export market.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a figure for 1979 of a total export rise to £3,498 million. This represents, he says, a value increase of 18.2 per cent over the previous year.  I am quite aware of the present difficulties which confront industry this year to which the Minister has referred in his statement.  According to figures produced only in the last few weeks, while the value shows laudible increases, in many cases the volume, which tells the real story, does not look as favourable as the figures in value terms. <Col N="1736" /> The prediction for the current year, the Minister has said, is likely to be a value increase again of about 20 per cent over 1979.  We are aware that only last week inflation figures were released of 20.2 per cent for the year ending mid-May. Regrettably predictions state that this order of figure will persist for the rest of this year.  A 20 per cent value increase in exports in the current year would indicate a fairly static situation so far as volume is concerned.  I regret that this is so, despite the best efforts of industry to face up to the major challenges confronting them and despite the best efforts of the CTT to face up to their major problems on the international market because of what we now are told are energy problems which are worldwide. Looking at one set of figures I was given last week in this House in reply to a question in relation to clothing, hosiery and knitwear they tell their own story. There a dangerous trend is evident and, if we are to make inroads into unemployment numbers, that is a trend that must change.  Exports, as a percentage of imports, in clothing in 1973 were 142 per cent which meant that we were exporting much more than we were importing. For 1979 that ratio was 57 per cent.  That is a major shift and a downward trend in so far as our capacity to hold export markets is concerned. In hosiery and footwear there is much the same kind of picture, ranging from 105 per cent in 1973 &mdash; again this is exports expressed as a percentage of imports &mdash; to 62.2 per cent last year.</P>
    <P>Therefore on this Bill and the provision of extra moneys for Córas Tráchtála to promote our exports even more vigorously the message is they will find it more difficult and, consequently, must spend more on their promotional efforts to halt and reverse the trend I have mentioned.  Probably they are extreme cases in that clothing, hosiery and footwear are particularly vulnerable areas in a recessional situation. Nevertheless they tell a tale which unfortunately seems to be applicable right across the board at present.  The predictions of the Central Bank, bodies such as the Confederation of Irish Industry, the <Col N="1737" /> FUE, the Irish Exporters' Association and so on, are that percentage growth this year will be insignificant despite the best efforts of production and people like CTT to promote sales.</P>
    <P>The contraction of many industries at present, evident from short-time systematic working, is evidence of the difficulty now facing industry.  We are told the major portion of the blame is to be laid at the door of high interest rates whether paid on capital to effect capital improvements, capital investment or money utilised for stock.  The Government have consistently failed to give the kind of assistance for which those people specifically asked, which is some form of underwriting of the exchange risk in relation to foreign borrowings.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism said he was looking into this matter and that he would be announcing shortly some self-financing system.  That is three weeks ago now and nothing has been heard since.  I hope the Minister will come up with some form of assistance to help the efforts of industry and, in turn, those of CTT.  No matter how difficult the situation, no matter what the position is here we will get no sympathy abroad on world markets.  There we will have to compete on what would seem to be now unequal terms in so far as our EMS partners are concerned, when we can see inflation rates of from 7 per cent to 9 per cent in places like West Germany, Belgium and Holland, three countries that provide 50 per cent of total EEC production.  I presume that kind of inflation rate will carry a somewhat similar rate of wage agreement whereas we would be caught up in this inflation/wages spiral which will do nothing for us on the export market. Consequently the efforts of CTT will be made all the more difficult.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I recognise the difficulties confronting CTT in the international market competing, in many cases, on unequal terms because of our domestic situation.  They have overcome that problem in the past and I have no doubt that they will succeed in doing so <Col N="1738" /> this year and indeed throughout the eighties.  They are to be complimented on their work.  I am sure the extra finance being provided for them now will be put to good use as it always has been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his warm welcome of the Bill.  I agree with him wholeheartedly in his recognition of the magnificant work done by the personnel of Córas Tráchtála in the past.  I agree with him also that we can, as a nation, look to the future with confidence in regard to the efforts of CTT on behalf of industry and the nation generally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the expansion in the location of offices to 22 around the world and to the various other agency arrangements that CTT have throughout the world and the high level of expertise required.  Having led a number of trade missions for CTT in the last two years I know from experience that this high level of expertise obtains on the ground.  It is a pleasure to see it in a foreign land and to see the work CTT are doing.  Indeed it makes one very proud to see the work they are doing on behalf of our industry and the nation generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred also to the fact that without goods of a high quality and standard being available at reasonable prices CTT would be unable to sell or promote Irish products.  We are selling now in over 100 countries around the world.  Indeed, it is a tribute to the efforts of Irish industry over the last 20 years to improve their standards, specifications and quality that we hope this year to hit a target of £4,200 million in exports.  The Deputy referred to this target and said that, looking at the figures for the month of May, a certain element of doom might be predicted.  Might I say to him that to look at any one month's figures in a 12 month period is not really the way in which to gauge overall performance.  I might suggest to him that he look at the January to April period when total exports were valued at £1,289.1 million, which showed an increase of 28.2 per <Col N="1739" /> cent over the same period in 1979. Manufactured goods expanded by over 30 per cent and they constitute the largest category of exports amounting to almost 60 per cent of the total, as against 58 per cent in the January-April 1979 figures.  Metal products rose to 62 per cent, machinery to 45 per cent and chemicals to 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Deputy should look at the 12-month period rather than take one particular month.  A four-month period would be more indicative of the progress for this year.</P>

      <P>The meaning of the word &ldquo;redeem&rdquo; is quite clear in the context. Nevertheless we see no particular objection to such a definition being included. The major trading stamp company have moved away from a system of central redemption of stamps in their own offices to a situation where stamps can now be redeemed directly in the various retail outlets operating the franchise.  Certain suppliers of services now participate in the scheme such as dry cleaners and hairdressers.</P>

      <P>The provisions of this section shall not apply in any case where the trading stamps concerned were issued before this Act came into force.</P>
      <P>I understand this provision is quite normal in other Bills.  What is the purpose of its deletion in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>This section requires trading stamp companies to make available facilities for redemption of trading stamps for cash.  Subsection (3) was designed to enable companies to make any necessary administrative adjustments to cope with this new requirement. I understand, however, that the major stamp company in Ireland have for some time been offering the facility of redeeming stamps for cash so that the administrative problems to which I have referred are unlikely to arise to any significant extent.  In any event the continued existence of subsection (3) would, in my view, create unnecessary confusion for both the customer and the company since it would be very difficult to establish when the stamps were issued.  If the subsection is deleted the provision will be that a stamp holder will be able to exercise the cash option without question as to when the Act came into force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the deletion of subsection (3) an inducement to trading stamp companies to undertake a major promotional operation for their stamps because the restrictions would not apply restrospectively after the introduction of the Act?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> In page 5, before section 8 to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>8.&mdash;(1)  For the purposes of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, the publication by a company which is the promoter of a trading stamp scheme of a catalogue shall be regarded as an offer, and the tender within the prescribed period of validity of the appropriate number of stamps shall be regarded as an acceptance, in the same way as if the offer and the acceptance were for a monetary consideration.</P>
    <P>(2) The provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, and of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, shall apply in every case where the promoter of a trading stamp scheme offers goods or services in exchange for trading stamps.</P>
    <P>(3) Where a person other than a promoter of a trading stamp scheme offers goods or services in exchange for trading stamps, the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, and of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, shall apply in the same way as if that exchange were for a monetary consideration.</P>
    <P>This proposed amendment arises mainly for three reasons.  I explained earlier that, in the case of one stamp company at least, trading stamps can now be exchanged for services, rather than goods, and that it was necessary to adjust the Bill in the area which might be affected. Section 8 contains another instance where this arises.</P>
    <P>The section regards a trading stamp transaction as a sale of goods for the purpose of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893. Deputies will be aware, however, that the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, 1978, which I hope will be enacted shortly, implies certain terms into contracts for the supply of a service, as well as up-dating the law on the sale of goods.  To cover the situation where trading stamps can be redeemed for services, it is desirable to apply the provisions of the 1978 Bill to such transactions, <Col N="1745" /> so that a customer who obtains services in return for stamps will have the same sort of protection as if he were redeeming the stamps for goods.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned earlier that our major trading stamp company have now moved away from a system of central redemption of stamps for goods in their own offices, to a situation where stamps can now be redeemed directly in the various retail outlets operating the scheme.  Deputies will note that the effect of section 8, as it stands, is to apply the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, to a trading stamp transaction only where the promoter of the scheme publishes a catalogue of goods, and so on.  However, since the customer can now redeem the stamps issued by this company at any retail outlet taking part in the scheme, it would be desirable to extend the protection of the Sale of Goods Acts to that situation as well. Subsection (3) of the proposed amendment achieves this objective.</P>
    <P>Section 8, as drafted, only applied to trading stamp transactions the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act which provided for implied conditions and warranties. There are, however, many other aspects of the sale of goods legislation, which it would be appropriate to apply to trading stamps transactions in the same way as they apply to straight-forward sale situations.  I am thinking in particular here of the range of provisions in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill dealing with guarantees.  It is right, therefore, not to restrict the application of the Sale of Goods Act merely to provide for implied conditions and warranties as the section presently does, but to widen it so that the two pieces of legislation involved will apply to trading stamps transactions, where relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to catalogues being published within the prescribed period of validity of the appropriate number of stamps.  In a lot of instances specific dates are not set.  Is it compulsory in the catalogue to ensure that a specific date is set out?  These catalogues are frequently published with <Col N="1746" /> no specific dates.  A person would be unaware of the position in that case.  Will the Minister clarify whether it will be compulsory on a company to put a date in these catalogues?</P>
      <P>In relation to the sale of goods the Minister referred to goods which are valued at over a certain amount of money.  Is there a specific amount of money?  If a very small item is purchased which is valued at about £1 would it make any difference?  What is the position there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney:</NameTxt>

      <P>(d) state the date on which the catalogue shall cease to be valid, which date shall be not less than six months after the date specified in subsection (3) (b) of this section.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows the catalogue would have to be issued in accordance with the Minister's instructions and it cannot be issued without the permission of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the value of the stamp and stamps are now being offered for a cash transaction.  That is the whole change&mdash;stamps are worth so much in a cash transaction when redeemed.

The definition of a trading <Col N="1747" /> stamp has been given in section 1.  Looking at subsection (3) of the new section 8, I wonder if bodies such as the ESB and semi-State bodies that provide stamps for an easy payment system for a service rendered will be included as a result of any possible legal confusion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 9 to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>9&mdash;(1)  Every person who is the owner or occupier of, or other person having control of, any shop or other premises in which a trading stamp scheme is operated shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Where the promoter publishes a catalogue of goods or services offered in exchange for stamps, keep available for inspection on demand by customers a copy of the current catalogue relating to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> (b) display in a prominent position where it can be easily read by customers a notice stating in clear and legible characters&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) where the promoter publishes a catalogue of goods or services offered in exchange for stamps, that the catalogue is available for inspection by customers on demand,</P>
    <P>(ii) the number of stamps offered for every £1 worth of purchases in the shop or other premises, as the case may be, and</P>
    <P>(iii) the cash redemption value of the stamps.</P>
    <P>(2) Any person being the owner or occupier of, or other person having the control of, a shop or other premises in which a trading stamp scheme is operated who fails, without reasonable cause, to comply with the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As there were a number of amendments which I wished to make in this section I felt it would be best if the whole section were deleted and replaced by the version appearing in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Briefly the changes I propose are, first, in subsection (1) it seems somewhat infelicitous to be requiring a &ldquo;shop&rdquo; to display information.  Clearly, the onus should be on the owner or occupier of the shop and not on the shop itself, and this is the first change proposed.  Secondly, the amended version extends the duties imposed by the section to the owner or occupier of any premises where a trading stamp scheme is operated and not just to a premises that could be classified as a &ldquo;shop&rdquo;.  Examples of such other premises would be motor garages, dry cleaning establishments and so on.  Thirdly, the amendment also now provides for the situation in which stamps may be redeemed for services; and, finally, subsection (2) <Col N="1749" /> mitigates somewhat the offence being created for non-compliance with the section by providing that the owner or occupier will not be guilty of an offence if he can show &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; for not displaying the information required.</P>
    <P>I feel that it would be unfair to make a retailer liable for an offence in respect of something over which he might have no control.  For example, I know that many retailers, and indeed their customers also, were unable to obtain catalogues during last year's postal strike.  In a situation like that we would allow the retailer a reasonable defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that if a company were, say, trying to carry out a fraud, you would need to catch up with them and not allow them to take a sharp advantage.  I can think of many people who are relatively badly off who might in a financially tight situation let a shop or premises to a group.  I think it is somewhat unfair to sue the owner who might be a widow in such a case.  It seems strange that the Minister should go after the owner.  The Minister specifies here &ldquo;every person who is the owner or occupier of, or other person having control of any shop or other premises in which a trading stamp scheme is operated.&rdquo;  Further on, in subsection (2) it is stated: &ldquo;Any person being the owner or occupier ... shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50&rdquo;.  Why is the Minister making the owner responsible?  On one hand, you have perhaps a widow or other person letting a shop or premises, possibly living overhead and on the other a very big trading stamp firm.  The obligation should be on the Minister's Department to ensure that the trading stamp company would be the person responsible and make it mandatory on the company to have sufficient funds lodged with the Department or have ability to produce sufficient funds to satisfy the Department.  Those are the people the Minister should go after rather than the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> I appreciate that the wording is &ldquo;owner or occupier&rdquo; and the Minister may say that he will go after the occupier, the company.  It would be unfair to make the owner responsible when he may not be a well-off person while the trading stamp company may make the owner the scapegoat.</P>

      <P>I do not think that could happen.  It says here: &ldquo;owner or occupier of, or other person having control of&rdquo;.  I believe that covers the situation pretty well.  The occupier would be the person really responsible for the displaying of the notice.  That is what we want to achieve.  The notice has to be displayed and it is the occupier, the person carrying on the business, who must display the notice.  One must look at the other side of the coin.  We have many cases even in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and in consumer protection matters where when you try to look up people you find that they have fled.</P>

      <P>Where the owner is not the occupier is where the problem arises. The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; can be very important in certain circumstances.  For example, the occupier may have drawn up some tenancy agreement with the owner which places certain responsibility on the owner.  There are cases where the owner may be responsible for the activities of the occupier through some agreement between themselves.  From the point of view of this Bill there might be great difficulty in pinning responsibility on a specific person.  I can foresee some difficulty in the interpretation of this.</P>

I appreciate the reasons for including this in the amended version but in this section it says &ldquo;in which a trading stamp scheme is operated who fails to comply with the provision&rdquo;.  That was in the old subsection. In the new one we have &ldquo;who fails, without reasonable cause, to comply&rdquo;.  If the persons fails to comply, he or she is guilty of an offence.  If the Minister includes &ldquo;without reasonable cause&rdquo; and there are extenuating circumstances, discretion can be exercised.

      <P>Yes, but there is the same situation even in that instance. There are very well off people who may obtain property on a weekly or monthly tenancy basis.  They are in a much stronger position and are the people on whom the responsibility should rest for keeping the catalogue published up to date and keeping a copy available for inspection on demand by customers.  They are the people who display the notices.  I feel it is very unfair to make the owner of a shop liable.  The owner of the shop will find himself in court in relation to this.  He will have to defend himself and say that he knew nothing about this.  The Minister should make it tighter on the retailers and the companies as against some poor innocent person.</P>

Surely the onus is on that retailer, shopkeeper or whoever it may be to see that the catalogues are available and that all the <Col N="1753" /> regulations are complied with in relation to the premises over which they have control.

If in 1979 this legislation were on the Statute Book and I were in the trading stamp business in a retail outlet situation and because of postal difficulties I could not display whatever was necessary under the regulations is the Minister saying that if I was brought to court a judge would convict me if this &ldquo;without reasonable cause&rdquo; was not inserted in section 9 (3)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann approves the Food Aid Convention 1980&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The International Wheat Agreement, 1971, has two parts:</P>
      <P>(i) the Wheat Trade Convention for the regulation of the commercial wheat market; and</P>
      <P>(ii) the Food Aid Convention for the supply of food aid in the form of cereals to the developing world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, Ireland was obliged to accede to the Food Aid Convention because the original member states and the European Economic Community as such were parties to it.  We did so in June 1973.  In June 1974 and again in 1975, 1976, 1978 and 1979, the Government, with the approval of Dáil Eireann, agreed to extend the convention, which is now due to expire on 30 June 1981. The Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, was extended at the same times and it <Col N="1755" /> also is due to expire on 30 June 1981. The most recent extension was necessary as the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a new International Wheat Agreement had failed to reach any agreement on a replacement for the 1971 Wheat Agreement of which, as I indicated, both the Food Aid Convention, 1971, and the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, are constituent parts.</P>
    <P>In view however of the deteriorating world food situation it became obvious that the negotiation of a new Food Aid Convention, involving higher minimum levels of food aid, was urgently necessary. The text of a new convention, the Food Aid Convention, 1980, was agreed at a special session of the Food Aid Committee held in London from 3 to 6 March 1980.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Food Aid Convention, 1980, is to secure, through a joint effort by the international community, the achievement of the target set by the World Food Conference in 1974 of at least 10 million metric tonnes of food aid annually to developing countries in the form of wheat and other grains suitable for human consumption, as determined by the convention's provisions.</P>
    <P>The new convention was open for signature in Washington from 11 March to 30 April 1980 and was signed on behalf of Ireland, the other member states of the European Community and the Community itself on 30 April last.  It is scheduled to enter into force on 1 July 1980 provided that by that date the Government referred to in paragraph 3 of Article III of the convention have ratified it and provided that the 1979 Protocol for the fifth extension of the Wheat Trade Convention 1971 on a new Wheat Trade Convention replacing it is still in force.  The Protocol for the fifth extension of the Wheat Trade Convention 1971 is scheduled to remain in force until 30 June 1981.  By that date, it is possible that a new international wheat agreement may be negotiated into which the 1980 Food Aid Convention will be incorporated.  If not, the likely course of action is that the 1971 International <Col N="1756" /> Wheat Agreement incorporating the new Food Aid Convention will be extended for a further period.</P>
    <P>The essential difference between the 1971 and 1980 Food Aid Conventions is that the minimum annual contribution of the members are increased from a total of 4.226 million tonnes to 7.592 million tonnes.  The countries which are members of the revised convention are Argentina, Autralia, Austria, Canada, the European Economic Community and its member States, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States of America.  Any other country may accede to it under such conditions as the Food Aid Committee, established by the new convention, consider appropriate.  Under the new arrangements the Community and its member states have undertaken to supply a minimum of 1,650,000 tonnes of cereals in the form of wheat, coarse grains or derivative products suitable for human consumption, compared with the minimum of 1,278,000 tonnes which the Community was obliged to supply under the 1971 convention.  This contribution will be discharged, partly by the Community from its own resources and partly by the member states, nationally, in accordance with an agreed scale.</P>
    <P>Ireland's national contribution will be in the region of 4,100 tonnes and, as under previous conventions, the cost will be borne by the Vote for Agriculture. Ireland's national contribution will continue to be channelled through the World Food Programme.  I should point out that Ireland has fulfilled its obligations under the 1971 Food Aid Convention up to the present time.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that agreement has been reached on the higher levels of food aid provided for in the new convention.  Ireland has for long supported the idea of an increased minimum community contribution and has played a full part in bringing this about.  I particularly hope that more countries can be encouraged to join the convention so that the World Food Conference target of 10 million tonnes of food aid can be reached as soon as possible.  It is vital <Col N="1757" /> that until agricultural production in the Third World reaches a sufficiently high level, continuity of this food aid can be guaranteed and efforts strengthened to eradicate hunger and malnutrition.</P>
    <P>In the months leading up to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on development matters when the new international development strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade is to be adopted and when the new round of global negotiations on economic co-operation for development is to be launched, the role of food aid is to be considered in a broader context.  The recently published report of the Brandt Commission entitled <i>North-South: A Programme for Survival</i> recognised that while food aid has at times been the subject of some controversy&mdash;in the sense that food aid can in certain cases act as a disincentive to increased agricultural production&mdash;it will continue to be essential for the foreseeable future.  The report emphasised the role of food aid in increasing investment in agriculture, particularly in labour-intensive projects including irrigation works.  It recommended in this regard that food aid should be increased and linked to employment promotion and agricultural programmes and projects without weakening incentives to food production.</P>
    <P>While no one will consider that the new Food Aid Convention is the complete answer to the problems of the world's hungry and underprivileged, it is a step in the right direction and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this party, I welcome this convention and support its ratification by the House.  At the same time, when we are discussing the question of food aid, we must put the amounts being allocated into the broader perspective of the entire population of the world.  In this context there is problem that I have mentioned before but which bears repeating, that is, the fact that 50 million people die each year <Col N="1758" /> from hunger, disease and starvation while on the other side of the coin there is the situation of the expenditure each year on arms of £250,000 million.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the other aspect which I do not intend to labour here this evening.  It is that there is a shortfall in our foreign aid programme of £5 million. It is in that context that we have to consider the Food Aid Convention, and I readily accept that it is an improvement on the 1971 convention.  We now have a target of 10 million tonnes per annum.  It is proper to point out that our actual commitments only total three quarters of that amount, 7.592 tonnes, and the question arises whether the target of 10 million tonnes, which is significant, can be made up.</P>
      <P>That has to be looked at from two aspects, one, whether the signatory nations to this convention could do a little more and whether there should be many more nations supporting the convention. On occasion I have had to criticise our own Government and other Governments in the west for not putting a better foot forward in the matter of foreign aid. Here this evening it is significant that in the list read out by the Minister not a single nation in the Soviet bloc has been contributing to the Food Aid Convention. When one considers the protestations of those nations and their preaching of the brotherhood of man, one realises how very hollow they sound, becauses food aid involves aid at its most basic level.  There are problems about it to which I will refer later, but the main concern is that if a man is dying of hunger his first and most immediate need is food to sustain himself and his family.</P>
      <P>From that point of view we must highlight the fact that there are many nations who could afford to do so but who are not contributing in any way to this convention.  There is also the question of whether the nations of the West are doing enough, and one can sum it up by saying that this is a step in the right direction but that there are many more steps that must be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some problems in regard to <Col N="1759" /> food aid, like whether the giving of food aid directly is a disincentive to the recipient countries in the matter of improving their own agricultural production. More importantly there is the fact that food aid must be accompanied concurrently by programmes of helping to provide technology for those nations so that they can produce their own food, because in the long term that is the only solution.  Though I approve of the efforts to deal with the immediate problem by way of providing food, there must be a larger more sustained programme to help those countries with their agricultural production problems.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in regard to food aid.  As a small nation it does not affect us and nobody will suggest that we have anything other than altruistic motives in our foreign aid and food aid contributions, but there have been suggestions that some other countries may be using food aid as a way of encouraging recipient nations to become dependent on the donors.  That is an aspect of food aid which is unworthy.  The point has been made by a number of people.  I recall former US Senators McGovern and Humphreys referring to this aspect, and not with disapproval.  We should make it clear that food aid from this country will not have strings attached. We have a fundamental belief that where fellow human beings are on the verge of starvation we have a moral obligation, within the limits of our resources, to help in any way we can.  We are in a unique situation and we can give a lead in this regard, being neutral without any military commitments.  If we do a little more than we are expected to do that would provide moral leadership to others who are capable of providing far greater aid than we are.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of the convention which I should like the Minister to deal with when he is replying.  We do not contribute the food aid in kind &mdash; we contribute a cash sum equal to the 4,100 tonnes to which we are committed.  I should be interested to know the rate at which this is convertible into cash.  In 1971 the rate was 1.73 dollars per <Col N="1760" /> bushel.  I do not know if there has been a change in that rate.</P>
    <P>There is one general point I should like to make.  It is whether the developed nations in a broader way could tackle the problems of huge food surpluses in the developed world side by side with appalling starvation on the other side of the globe.  I appreciate there are difficulties in regard to storage and freezing facilities, but anybody who takes an interest in the problem must be appalled at reports of surpluses, wine lakes and butter mountains and so on, while there is a picture of abject hunger in so much of the world.  In the short time we have, we cannot discuss solutions to that, but as human beings are we discharging our duty if we permit this appalling situation to continue?  From time to time we export subsidised butter to the Soviet bloc, and naturally the question must arise as to whether some of it could not be sent to the starving nations rather than sending it to a nation which can well afford to pay in full for the requirements of their own people.  The same applies to other agricultural surpluses.</P>
    <P>In the time available I will not even begin to talk about possible solutions, but it is important that we raise the question and look at the problem in a broad way because it affects anybody who has any heart or any feelings for humanity. This new Food Aid Convention is an improvement on the last one.  It is a step in the right direction, but it is a long road and I hope we will be taking further steps in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support the adoption of this convention. The main comment I have to make is that, in view of the current critical food situation where literally, and the words cannot be understated, millions of human being are, as of now, starving because they do not have the absolute minimum level of human subsistence, the World Food Conference target of 10 million tonnes of food aid has not been deliberately and effectively reached at this stage.  There has undoubtedly been a growth in aid in this category since <Col N="1761" /> 1971.  But right through the seventies there was no improvement in the overall dimension of hunger and malnutrition.</P>
      <P>The aid being given has not matched the absolute need to eradicate basic hunger, starvation and malnutrition. There are hundreds of thousands of children affected by this.  It is true that under the convention the improvement has grown in terms of contributions from, as the Minister indicated, 4.2 million tonnes in 1971 to 7.6 million tonnes in 1980.  I would have thought there would have been a concerted effort to reach the target of 10 million tonnes of aid in 1980 rather than in the distant future of 1985.</P>
      <P>The publication of the Brandt report, which is readily available in paperback form and should be read by every Irishman, woman and adolescent, has brought home to everyone the extent to which with population growth the situation has deteriorated.  For that reason I urge the Minister to press forward within the Community for the reaching of the 10 million tonnes target as a matter of urgency.  That is the main point our party would make in agreeing with Ireland's national contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be interesting to hear from the Minister the cost to be borne on our own Agriculture Vote in 1980 and, in the context of our total budget or total Agricultural Vote, it would be interesting to know what proportion of the Vote is given in that direction.  I deplore the cutback in the current year's budget in overall world development aid given by our country.  No matter how bad or difficult our economic situation may be at home or how stringent the requirements may be on our budgetary Exchequer commitments, there should be no effort spared in contributing in this direction. Under this convention there is no cutback as such and we are honouring our commitment.  While that is welcome and while that was the policy of the last Government, we must place our contribution in respect of this convention in its overall perspective.  I welcome the adherence of the Government to the <Col N="1762" /> convention.  My party welcome it, but we want to continue to express our very grave concern at the deterioration in the overall world situation.</P>
    <P>All the publicity, diplomatic effort and expenditure of political time and money in preoccupations about, for example, the Olympic Games when literally every day hundreds of thousands of people are starving and dying in these parts of the world, when the major political preoccupation of the western powers centres around whether or not a couple of hundred athletes go from their country to run against one another in the picture of their health in the Olympic Games in 1980, calls into question the sense of political priority we should have.  With all the efforts, summits and discussions around the dinner tables of the capitals of the world and Foreign Ministers meeting and so on, one feels like screaming at them: &ldquo;Why not talk about food aid conventions and world aid conventions and devote your energies, talents and capacity for organisation and diplomatic initiative in the direction of aiding people who have not got enough food to walk never mind run&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We, in this House, can say to the Minister: &ldquo;You have our total support in assisting this convention and approving it for 1980&rdquo;.  We urge him to expand it and bring every pressure to bear on his colleagues in other parliaments in the Community to bring it up to the 10 million tonne level and beyond.  Only then can we say we are making a real contribution in any meaningful sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the constructive approach to this matter, particularly that of Deputies O'Keeffe and Desmond.  As I told Deputy Desmond last week I share his sentiments in relation to this matter.  The Brandt Commission report, <i>North-South;</i> A <i>Programme for Survival,</i> which has now been published in paper back form, is recommended as essential reading for any thinking person concerned about the future of life on our globe as a whole.  It is a fundamental and readable document <Col N="1763" /> which I recommend.  There is one tragic matter in regard to it, that it should appear in a year where the real damage being done to the developing world comes from the activities of certain Third World countries themselves.  The indiscriminate rises in oil prices which has been secured by OPEC countries has damaged their neighbours who do not have oil or energy resources.  It has damaged them to a greater extent than it has damaged the developed world.  It has also harmed the developed world to the extent that it has limited its capacity to help the Third World.</P>
      <P>By reason of the indiscriminate manner in which that was done and the lack of planning involved, real harm is being done to the deprived countries of the Third World, those without oil or any other form of basic resources.  That can be seen from two figures I shall quote. The overall rise in oil prices in the OECD countries this year was in the region of 120 per cent.  The withdrawal from the OECD countries into OPEC countries of moneys arising out of that reached 130 billion dollars.  Much of that money has not found its way back into the financial system and is not available for the building up of infrastructural employment, agricultural requirements and industrial development in the Third World.  Those countries are now starved of capital by reason of the inability of the world's financial system to cope with their capital and financial requirements. It is tragic that that should happen in the year of the publication of the Brandt Commission report that was primarily concerned with this problem of recycling funds into the Third World not just because it was the enlightened and right thing to do but also because, from the practical point of view, it was good from the developed world's point of view to build up markets where it could export its technology and sophisticated products while at the same time help to build up economies there that could consume and absorb what the developed world had to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That message in the Brandt report is essentially valid and one which stands <Col N="1764" /> for a generation ahead if we are to resolve the growing disparities between the north and south of the globe.  The countries that contribute to the Food Aid Convention and provided cereals in the last ten years under the International Wheat Agreement are all from the Western world.  The countries which are members of the revised convention are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, the European Economic Community and its member states, including Ireland, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States of America.  Those countries, the civilised countries of the western world, have a feeling in this regard.  As Deputy O'Keeffe stated, that list of countries does not include one from the Soviet bloc.</P>
    <P>We are glad to note that at present Iraq and Spain are contemplating joining the convention and the World Food Council are actively encouraging others to do so.  The convention is open for signature by every country and it is in that way that we can achieve the target of ten million tonnes which has not been achieved yet.  It is open to countries in any part of the world with cereals available to join the convention.  Existing members will match any contributions made by new members and increase their contributions in the years ahead. Ireland has been a member from the outset and we have made our contribution, in volume and percentage terms, as sought each year.  Our contribution this year will amount to 4,100 tonnes at the present market price for wheat.  Our minimum contribution has been increased, as sought, from .54 per cent to .56 per cent and this will be at a cost of £500,000 from the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  That contribution is in full accordance with the amount sought in volume and percentage terms.</P>
    <P>I agree that aid of this kind represents an interim approach to this problem.  As Deputy O'Keeffe stated, the real problem is to improve the technology of agricultural production.  The more positive work we are doing under various programmes of aid &mdash; the <Col N="1765" /> Agricultural Institute are playing a positive role in this respect &mdash; is in the area of exporting expertise temporarily, sending personnel, scientists and research people to make the appropriate soil tests and planning for agricultural reclamation.  It is in that area of exporting to the vast areas of Africa, South America and South-East Asia, the technology of food production which Western Europe and North America developed over the centuries, that the permanent solution lies.  The question of the aid which is necessary in the present year is essentially an approach which is interim but the long-term solution lies in the area of building up the capacity and the resources and the personnel in these developing countries to develop and expand a whole new approach towards full production, which we have taken for granted in western Europe and North America.  I have been in countries like Tanzania and one can see the enormous gap that exists between farming there and farming in western Europe and North America.</P>
    <P>It is in developing this expertise and scientific approach towards food production that the future lies.  In so far as mistakes have been made in some Third World countries, they are coming to a realisation there now that in some cases there has been an over-rapid approach towards quick industrialisation rather than an emphasis on food production. Food is going to become the great area of scarcity and the great problem facing mankind in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>Energy may dominate the problems facing man at present, and understandably so, but food is going to be the great problem in a few years' time.  Unless the Third World gets to grips with food production and the means, the methods, the capacity and the research and the personnel and science and everything associated with modern food production, they will be in continuing serious trouble. It is in that area that the future lies in regard to practical help to the developing world.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank <Col N="1766" /> the House for agreeing to this Food Aid Convention, which was a very necessary response by the countries concerned in the World Food Council, because we are facing a situation where the Wheat Trade Convention was due to expire on 30 June 1981 and unless this Food Aid Convention introduced now and ready to proceed to enable cereal distribution to take place there could have been a hiatus in the event of the Wheat Trade Convention itself not being replaced by a similar instrument.  On 30 June 1981 it is hoped that there will be an extension of the Wheat Trade Convention, but that requires further negotiation.  However, the point is that the provision of cereals is protected now by the introduction of this Food Aid Convention which can be subsumed into the International Wheat Agreement when it, hopefully, is negotiated next year on the expiration of the Wheat Trade Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the International Natural Rubber Agreement, 1979.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Dáil approval of the terms of this agreement is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution which stipulates that &ldquo;the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  An explanatory memorandum on this agreement has been prepared and circulated to Deputies.  This gives a detailed account of the provisions of the agreement and covers the question of the costs involved in Irish participation in it. I propose then to confine myself to making some general remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Natural Rubber Agreement, 1979, was concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at the United Nations <Col N="1767" /> Conference on Natural Rubber held in Geneva in October 1979.  It is open for signature at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1980 by the Governments invited to the United Nations Conference on Natural Rubber. Instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval must be deposited with the Secretary General of the United Nations not later than 30 September 1980.</P>
    <P>The Council of the European Economic Community, on 22 April 1980, decided that the agreement should be signed subject to its being concluded at a later date, on the basis of joint competence by the Community and the member states.</P>
    <P>Some 62 countries, including Ireland, representing 13 exporting countries and 49 importing countries, participated in the United Nations Conference on Rubber.</P>
    <P>The International Natural Rubber Agreement is the first commodity agreement to be concluded since UNCTAD established its Integrated Programme for Commodities in Nairobi in May 1976. As such, it is a significant development and will make an invaluable contribution to the on-going debate on economic relationships between the developed and the developing countries.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of this agreement are to achieve a balanced growth between the supply and demand for natural rubber, to stabilise conditions in the natural rubber trade through avoiding excessive price fluctuations, to ensure adequate supplies at reasonable prices equitable to both producers and consumers and to help stabilise the export earnings of the developing countries from natural rubber, a matter to which these countries quite naturally attach the utmost importance.  The agreement establishes the International Natural Rubber Organisation to administer its provisions and supervise its operation.  The organisation will function through the International Natural Rubber Council, its executive director and staff and such other bodies as are provided for in the agreement.  For the purpose of achieving <Col N="1768" /> the objectives of the agreement a buffer stock consisting of a total of 550,000 tonnes will be established.  The council of the organisation will appoint a buffer stock manager and he will offer to buy and sell natural rubber in a manner designed to keep its price within an agreed price range.</P>
    <P>The financing of the buffer stock will be met by direct Government contributions and/or by Government guarantees. The contributions will be shared equally between the exporting and importing members.  Within the importing group each member shall meet an apportionment of the cost based on its number of votes in the council and these shall be allocated relative to its share of net imports of natural rubber averaged over the preceding three years.  At this stage it is not possible to assess accurately Ireland's apportionment of these costs because of the variables involved, such as the number of countries likely to adhere to the agreement and the quantity of rubber which may be purchased by the buffer stock manager at various price levels.  However, based on a formula suggested for estimate purposes by the UNCTAD conference chairman and assuming a membership by Governments representing at least 80 per cent of total world net imports and net exports, the cost to Ireland would be approximately £330,000 &mdash; this would be a once only contribution.</P>
    <P>In addition members of the International Natural Rubber Organisation will be required to make an annual contribution to the administrative budget of the organisation and to undertake any travelling expenses which may arise in connection with attendance at its meetings.  Ireland's contribution to this budget, will also be in proportion to its number of votes in the council.  Again it is not possible at this stage to state accurately the amount of Ireland's contribution under this heading but based on our experience in other commodity organisations it is estimated that at current values it will be in the order of £1,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The agreement will help to stabilise <Col N="1769" /> raw material prices for an important segment of Irish industry.  The Irish rubber using industry provides employment for approximately 2,800 persons.  Ireland imported 7,821 tonnes of natural rubber valued at £5.1 million in 1979.  In the same year Ireland exported 27,000 tonnes of tyres and tubes valued £30.8 million.</P>
    <P>Membership of the International Natural Rubber Agreement, 1979, will afford Ireland the opportunity to demonstrate its readiness to support international measures to stabilise commodity prices and to reaffirm the importance which it attaches to eliminating the economic imbalance between developed and developing countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>This agreement has to be looked at from two angles.  The first is the commercial and economic aspect in the context of this country being an importing country.  The second is the effect of the agreement and the benefit it will bring to those developing countries for whom the export of rubber is a major part of their economy.  Certainly, in regard to the commercial aspect, it is clear that it is an advantage to us that such an agreement should be arranged because we have here in Ireland a substantial number of people depending for their employment on the processing of rubber.  From that point of view alone, in so far as this agreement ensures the stability of prices and supply, the agreement has to be given a welcome.  What is important from that aspect is that there are almost 3,000 Irish people employed in the rubber processing industry and our imports &mdash; at £5 million &mdash; are converted, with added value, into exports of £30 million.  In addition there would, I presume, be a home market aspect of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might have the figure.  It is not very important but would help to show the complete <Col N="1770" /> picture from the commercial point of view.</P>
      <P>The other aspect of the agreement is the question of its advantage to the developing countries involved in rubber export.  I presume that, of the 13 exporting nations, all or virtually all would be included in the Third World category. The Minister, in his reply, might perhaps give a little more information as to what would be the major benefit from their point of view.  Have there been slumps in the price of rubber in the past and have these had a major effect on the economies of these countries?  On the face of it the agreement must be of advantage to such countries in so far as it helps to stabilise their export earnings.</P>
      <P>I have a further question for the Minister in regard to the adequacy of the buffer stock.  Could the Minister inform the House of the relationship between the size of this stock and the total annual world exports of rubber?  Is it significant in that context or merely a tiny proportion? Will the international buffer stock proposed under the agreement be of sufficient size to provide the necessary buffer in the event of a slump in world prices?</P>
      <P>Generally, it appears that the agreement is a significant one.  It is the first negotiated between the exporting countries of a raw material which is an important matter for their economy and the importing countries.  I can only assume that, since the agreement was organised under the auspices of UNCTAD, a fair and reasonable arrangement was reached to ensure a balance, that there would be no question of prices going beyond all reason because of scarcity and, at the same time, that there would be a fair return to the developing world for which, as I say, the export of rubber may be an important factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the costings, it appears that the amounts involved are reasonable from the point of view of this country: an anticipated contribution of £1,000 per annum towards the administrative expenses and a total once-off contribution of approximately £? million towards the creation of the buffer <Col N="1771" /> stock.  As I read it, the initial payment in that regard will be very small, perhaps only £21,000, and the balance will be called up at a later stage when required. In general, on behalf of the Opposition I am happy to welcome this agreement and hope that it will be ratified by the necessary number of countries to enable it to come into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The significant thing about this agreement has been mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe, that it is the first commodity agreement to be concluded since UNCTAD established its integrated programme for commodities in Nairobi in 1976.  This is very important because one of the difficult matters regarding commodities causing tension as far as producers were concerned and as far as consumers, purchasers or processors were concerned over the years in many commodity areas have been very substantial fluctuations in price, caused by a number of factors which I shall not go into now.</P>
      <P>Here we have an agreement in which some 62 countries are participating, representing 13 exporting countries and 49 importing countries and proposing to bring a degree of organisation into the market of a very basic commodity.  I can assure the Deputy that there were very wide and wild fluctuations over the years.  It is part of the hazards of commodity trading generally, but particularly in rubber there has been a very long, unfortunate history of fluctuations in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the buffer stock size, I have not got the actual relationship asked for.  The Deputy asked the relationship between the actual stock size proposed, of 550,000 tonnes, which the United States regard as appropriate and the amount of the rubber trade.  The EEC estimate that 400,000 tonnes will be sufficient.  But this was increased to 550,000 because of representation from the United States, who felt that that would be a safer buffer stock amount.  I take it that, with the combined wisdom of the major purchasers in the world, <Col N="1772" /> Western Europe and North America, 550,000 tonnes will suffice.  However, if the Deputy wishes I shall get that information for him as it relates to the general volume of trade in rubber.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect is that all the exporting countries, except Singapore, are Third World countries in the developing world sense that we have been spending so much time on in the debate earlier and in other debates last week.  Here is a practical example of a link being forged between the developed world and the developing world because of mutuality of interest.</P>
    <P>Most of the consumer or purchasing countries and practically all the producing exporting countries are Third World developing countries.  To have that rational marriage of interests in the form of an agreement of this kind is obviously a satisfying, practical and constructive way forward.  It is what we would like to see in the oil and energy area.  This is a question which the European Community will be pursuing in the course of talks over the next six months with the various interests concerned, with a view to securing some peace in the Middle East.  Part of that arrangement would be, it is hoped, some form of commodity agreement of this type under which the whole sale and distribution of oil would be rationalised in a similar manner.  In that way, relations can best be cemented between the Third World and the developed world.</P>
    <P>It is not just enough to talk in terms of aid.  Aid is desirable as an interim measure to prime the pump, to get things moving but what is more fundamental is to export the technology and expertise that will enable these countries to produce their commodities best, whether they be food commodities, mineral commodities or basic commodities such as rubber and others which these developing countries do best.  It is in this whole area of basic raw materials, commodities, food and energy that the Third World has the resources.  It is a question of maximising production, to provide for proper balanced outlets that do not give rise to wild fluctuations.  There are many other commodity areas like cocoa, coffee, <Col N="1773" /> tea and so on to which the remarks I have just made equally apply.</P>
    <P>Trade can be just as important as aid. It is tremendously important to remember that the developed world does not apply principles of protectionism to the Third World but seeks to organise trade between them so that the trade is not of the kind of the colonial past, when it was trade of the exploiter on the exploited, but rather trade of mutual interest in which regular, stable production, supply and pricing arrangements can be worked out and negotiated on an overall, comprehensive basis.  It is particularly important in regard to rubber that we adopt this attitude because of the very wide fluctuations in rubber production in the past, when one of the consequences was that there was inadequacy of investment in rubber plantations, in experimentation, research and development in the type of tree, soil, production and so on.  There was not sufficient confidence in the production side of the industry to allow for that sort of investment.</P>
    <P>There is apparently enormous scope for research and investigation into improving the type of rubber production, the type of tree, giving proper attention to safeguarding trees, having proper applications to prevent diseases, the proper training of personnel, a proper plantation system, proper rotation.  All of the scientific application I mentioned earlier in regard to food production would apply in a similar way to rubber production and to all the other basic commodities I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The confidence involved in an agreement of this kind, involving the major purchasing countries with the major production countries, will lead to a guaranteed underpinning of the production of natural rubber.  Equally it will lead to investment in the sort of scientific back-up that should enable far greater and expanding production to take place.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Keeffe in particular for his contribution and to say that it was, as always, constructive.</P>

The expression &ldquo;Minister of the Government&rdquo; is defined in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1977 which provides for the appointments of Ministers of State.  It was found necessary to distinguish between the two types of Ministers by using the expressions &ldquo;Minister of the Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly's amendment provides that that paragraph shall not be construed <Col N="1776" /> as to prevent Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann from recommending for the appointment of ombudsman a person who at the time of such a recommendation is disqualified from holding that office by virtue of subsection (5) (a). The amendment goes on to provide that the President in such an event shall not appoint such person as Ombudsman until he is satisfied that the entitlement or entitlements mentioned in that paragraph has or have ceased.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to enable the Oireachtas to appoint a person who is a member of the Oireachtas, the European Assembly or of a local authority but it provides that the President shall not appoint that person on the recommendation of the Oireachtas until he has resigned from his seat in the Oireachtas, the European.

If a person who is a member of these Houses is recommended and elects to forego his parliamentary seat in order to take up the position of ombudsman it is reasonable that he should be allowed to do so.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 21, after &ldquo;statute&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(within the meaning of section 3 of the Interpretation Act, 1937)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from Deputy Kelly's criticism of the term &ldquo;statute&rdquo;. Deputy Kelly felt that it was too vague and I thank the Deputy for drawing our attention to the possibility of a certain ambiguity about the word.  My advice is that the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; in the wider sense could include the Constitution. The subsection therefore could be taken as including the very wide rights under the Constitution to take court action. This was never our intention and I propose this amendment in order to make the meaning of the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; absolutely clear.  The definition of statute in section 3 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, will now apply.  The definition is as follows:</P>
      <P>the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; includes (in addition to Acts of the Oireachtas) Acts of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann, Acts of the Parliament of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and Acts of a Parliament sitting in Ireland at any time before the coming into force of the Union with, Ireland Act, 1980;</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Kelly did not object so much to the Minister's power of veto if the reasons were to be stated fully.  This is the only feasible way of giving effect to the recommendation.  It is not envisaged that the Minister's power would be widely used.  It would hardly be in the interests of any Minister to abuse this power given the degree of adverse publicity that would result.  I have taken Deputy Kelly's point that in asking the ombudsman not to investigate or to <Col N="1779" /> cease to investigate the Minister concerned should be required to give his reasons.  I am proposing this amendment to underwrite the seriousness of this power and to ensure that it cannot be lightly used.  This amendment will require the Minister to state in full the reasons why he does not want a matter investigated.  Taken in conjunction with the amendments which I proposed on section 6 this means that if a Minister stops an investigation he must give his reasons in full and his statement will be available to the complainant and to the Members of the House.</P>

      <P>This is a point that caused some contention during the Committee Stage and resulted in some considerable debate.  I think there is agreement between us on our objective, that the Ombudsman should have power to elucidate any information of relevance from persons who attend before him for the purpose of a preliminary examination or investigation.  At the time I felt strongly that the section was adequately worded to enable the ombudsman to seek all relevant information from persons attending before him.  I said this more than once during that debate.  In the end I bowed to Deputy Kelly's knowledge and agreed to look into the matter further in case I was missing something.  I have since taken legal advice on the matter and I am assured that section 7 (1) (a) of the Bill as it stands contains nothing that would preclude the ombudsman from questioning persons who appear before him to elucidate their motives or opinions or any other relevant information.  I am also assured that this subsection gives all the necessary powers to the ombudsman which he would require in order to carry out his functions in this regard.  Therefore I regret to have to reject Deputy Kelly's amendment.</P>

      <P>The Ombudsman may, for the purposes of a preliminary examination, or an investigation, by him under this Act, require any person who, in the opinion of the Ombudsman, is in possession of information, or has a document or thing in his power or control, that is relevant to the examination or investigation to furnish that information, document or thing to the Ombudsman and, where appropriate, may require the person to attend before him for that purpose and the person shall comply with the requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly believes that that paragraph as drafted does not confer <Col N="1781" /> sufficient powers on the ombudsman to question the person before him fully and adequately.  Accordingly, Deputy Kelly proposes to add to that paragraph the words set out in the amendment.  Deputy Kelly in other words wants to give the ombudsman power to get behind the action that has been taken, to find out the motives for it and to make sure that the person being investigated, whoever he may be, acted in good faith.  I respectfully submit that the amendment can do much good by spelling out clearly and putting beyond doubt the power of the ombudsman to inquire into the matter in question and it certainly can do no harm.</P>

      <P>It has always been the intention of the Bill that the hearings should be in private.  Any attempt to introduce public hearings would in my view introduce an undesirable element of confrontation.  The ombudsman will require co-operation rather than confrontation. He will have a much better chance of getting co-operation from everyone if the hearings are in private. The introduction of public hearings would involve the ombudsman in a formal, judicial-type sitting.  The main aim of the Bill is to provide the man-in-the-street <Col N="1782" /> with an independent and easily reached mediator.  The keynotes of his office should be informality, speed and accessibility.  Public hearings would not assist him to meet those criteria but would rather prove a hindrance.  Most of the ombudsman's work will be done through meetings with Departments, Department officials, by examining files and writing to complainants rather than in formal sittings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly said he felt there was an echo of Article 34 (1) of the Constitution in the words &ldquo;otherwise than in public&rdquo;. Presumably, this is part of his reason for putting down this amendment.  If there is any echo, it is very faint indeed and my legal advice is that it is of no consequence to the wording of the Bill.  I seriously considered Deputy Kelly's amendment but I do not see that it would add anything to the Bill and in fact might prove a hindrance to its operation.  I am sorry that I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 8 (1) of the Bill is a short section which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>An investigation by the Ombudsman under this Act shall be conducted otherwise than in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is another way of saying that it shall be conducted in private.  The whole object of the Bill is to ensure that people will have their grievances fully investigated. There may be cases when it would be in the public interest that a grievance should be investigated in public and that not only would justice be done but be seen to be done.  That is the important thing.  If a matter concerning a great number of people were investigated in public I think it would have the effect of ensuring that the abuse being investigated would not recur.  Deputy Kelly's amendment does not seek to provide that every investigation be held in public.  It proposes to amend the subsection by deleting &ldquo;otherwise than in public&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;in private&rdquo;.  In other words, under Deputy Kelly's amendment the normal procedure would still be to hold the investigation in <Col N="1783" /> private unless in the opinion of the ombudsman it would be in the public interest that it should be conducted otherwise than in private in which case he could conduct it with such limited or general access for the public as he might consider appropriate to the public interest in a particular case.  Nothing could be more reasonable than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly visualises a case which is of wide concern to the public and affects a great number of people.  He wants to provide that the ombudsman should have the right and should be obliged to hold this investigation in public to such an extent that he thinks necessary and in the public interest.  The amendment then goes on to provide that the ombudsman shall conduct it in public to such an extent that he thinks fit in which case he may conduct it with such limited or general access for the public as he may consider appropriate to the public interest in the particular case.  The public interest goes through that amendment from beginning to end.  This Bill is all about the public interest.  I can see that if a case was once ventilated in public the ombudsman might never be troubled with the same type of case again and the public might benefit enormously.</P>

      <P>In page 10, between lines 42 and 43 to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) In an investigation by the Ombudsman under this Act any person who in the opinion of the Ombudsman has a sufficient interest may attend during all or any part of the investigation, in person or represented by counsel, solicitor or otherwise, and shall be entitled to put questions to any other person present at such investigation but only in relation to matters in which, in the opinion of the Ombudsman, he has a sufficient interest, <Col N="1784" /> and to the extent of that interest.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that in an investigation by the Commission any person who in his opinion has a sufficient interest may attend or may be represented by counsel, solicitor or otherwise and shall be entitled to put questions.  We are saying that once the ombudsman is satisfied that a person may attend the investigation that person may be able to put questions or be represented by counsel so that the person's particular case can be put in the best way possible and he may be able to question people attending the investigation. If we want to see justice being done we should ensure that people may attend and may put questions or may be legally represented and their legal representatives may put the questions to elicit the information which those people feel is necessary for their case.  The only way the person can do this is by being present at the investigation and being able to ask questions.  If this cannot be done the person involved may feel that his case was not given the kind of slant it should have been given.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly seems to be trying to cover two points in his suggested amendment.  Firstly, he seems to be trying to establish the right of a complainant to be legally or otherwise represented without the ombudsman having any deciding powers in the matter. Secondly, he seems to want to provide for the cross-examination of officials by the complainant or his representatives.</P>
      <P>Before replying to these points let me reiterate what the Bill at present allows. It allows the ombudsman to prescribe the procedures for investigations &mdash; section 8 (3) &mdash; so that if he wishes in a particular case to allow cross-examination he can do so if he considers this is necessary to establish the complainant's case. It also allows the ombudsman to decide if a person should be legally or otherwise represented during an investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I want to make, then, is <Col N="1785" /> that Deputy Kelly's amendment does not add at all to the powers of the ombudsman already contained in the Bill in relation to investigations.  If I follow Deputy Kelly's line of thought correctly, he is anxious that it would not be the ombudsman who would decide if a person should be represented in an investigation. He also argues that if he does so decide he would be open to challenge in the courts.</P>
    <P>My legal advice on Deputy Kelly's suggested amendment is that it does not improve matters.  The ombudsman would still have to decide who has sufficient interest in the matter under investigation and the extent of that interest and such decisions would be equally open to challenge in the courts.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that if Deputy Kelly's amendment were to be accepted it could lead to the appearance before the ombudsman of complainants or their representatives during most investigations. This would arise because in order to investigate in the first instance the ombudsman must establish that the person making the complaint has sufficient interest in the matter.  Under Deputy Kelly's amendment once the ombudsman had established this interest he would have no other say in whether the person was represented or not or whether he would put questions to officials. This would arise irrespective of whether the case was one that could be settled quite simply by the ombudsman through his examination of files, correspondence or whatever.</P>
    <P>If this were to be the case the whole system would become cumbersome and probably unworkable.  I'have been looking at Deputy Kelly's amendment as a whole with an open mind.  I am receptive to anything which will improve the Bill.  I can indeed see the basis on which he put forward this amendment.  I would, however, ask him, Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Fitzpatrick to consider the logical conclusion of what he is suggesting. We are trying to establish a system whereby the aggrieved citizen can have recourse to an appeal system <Col N="1786" /> which will, hopefully, bring him a speedy and satisfactory response if his complaint is justified.</P>
    <P>There are, to my mind, two fundamental prerequisites for the success of such a system.  First, it must be a system that operates, other than in exceptional cases, in an informal way, that is, without the necessity by and large for formal hearings.  Secondly, it must have the confidence and goodwill of the officers whose actions are being complained against.  I keep coming back to this point and, while I do not wish to labour it, I make no apologies for stressing it.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, satisfied that it is best to leave the decision on procedure and representation with the ombudsman himself.  If we cannot accept that he will take such decisions to best suit the circumstances of each case in accordance with the principles of constitutional and natural justice, then there is nothing we can write into the Bill which would make the system workable.  I, therefore, have to reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The whole basis of the ombudsman procedure is to give confidence to the citizen, to convince him that he has a right to go beyond the Department, the executive or beyond whoever else comes within the ambit of the Bill and whom he wants to complain against. Unless the citizen sees that the investigation is fair and open and that he has the opportunity to ask the questions he wants and, if he is not able to put those questions himself, that he is in a position to have a solicitor or barrister present to do that, he may not believe that he is getting a fair crack of the whip.  He will end by saying that this is like going to law with the devil and holding the court in hell.  He will not be satisfied with the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase, &ldquo;in the opinion of the ombudsman&rdquo; leaves the control with the ombudsman but if the amendment is not accepted an aggrieved person or a person with an interest must only be given an opportunity to comment on the <Col N="1787" /> action and if a complaint in relation to the action is made to the ombudsman the complainant will only be able to go in and make a statement whereas the acceptance of Deputy Kelly's amendment would enable that person to participate, that is, if the ombudsman is satisfied that the interest is sufficient to enable him to do so.  If the Minister wishes to simplify the matter further he could use the words, &ldquo;and shall put questions to the other person through the ombudsman.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not take part in the various stages of this Bill but I am aware that there is much criticism of the Bill throughout the country and that it is regarded by many as being a piece of machinery without teeth, a piece of machinery which can be negatived by Ministers or by others at various stages. If the person who is aggrieved or who is the complainant is to be excluded from taking any part in the investigations, either through a counsel or solicitor or through his own person or even to the extent that he is not going to be allowed suggest to the ombudsman questions which should be put to the person against whom a complaint has been made, there will be even less respect for this Bill and it will be regarded as a charade and a piece of window-dressing or make-believe.</P>

      <P>This amendment will allow the ombudsman very wide powers of delegation.  It arose on foot of a question raised by Deputies O'Brien and Kelly on Committee Stage.  The amendment will enable the ombudsman to delegate to his officers all his powers except the power to make reports, either annual or special, to the Oireachtas.  His officers will be able to issue statements, investigate complaints, notify complainants of the results of investigations and make recommendations to the Department and so on.  In short, the ombudsman will be able to delegate to his officers all the normal everyday work of the office. Apart from facilitating the everyday operation of the ombudsman's work these wide powers will have the added beneficial effect that if the ombudsman should be ill or should he be abroad or absent from his duties for any other <Col N="1789" /> reason, the office would be in a position to function satisfactorily until his return.

      <P>The only reason for excluding these bodies in the first instance was that the all-party committee recommended that they should be excluded. However, I have an open mind on the matter.  On Committee Stage I indicated that I would like these bodies to be included but there are certain problems involved. In these circumstances consultations would have to take place and these consultations would involve a matter of some months.  While I cannot accept the amendment I am giving a guarantee to the House that I will take the necessary steps, as provided for in section 4, to bring the bodies mentioned in the amendment within the remit of the ombudsman within a period of three months from the date of his appointment. The local authorities, the health boards and the other bodies concerned together with the representatives of their staffs, will be consulted fully in this regard.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The more I hear of this Bill, <Col N="1791" /> the more convinced I am of how right the general public are in regarding it as a piece of machinery without teeth.  Under the Bill as drafted the ombudsman is not to be permitted to investigate any complaint against the chief executive or any officer of the health board.  Neither is he to be permitted to investigate any complaint against the county manager, against any officer of a local authority, against any chief agricultural officer, against any officer of a committee of agriculture or against a chief executive officer or any officer of a vocational education committee.  Is not a Bill of this kind of very little use to the people in general who are being affected every day in the week by actions or decisions of a county manager and by the actions or decisions of any of these other officers referred to?  I am glad to learn that the Minister can include these bodies in the legislation by way of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 24, after &ldquo;Awards&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;,by a university in the State or by an equivalent degree awarding authority of international repute&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is simply to make clear the difference in approach by the Minister and this side of the House to the awarding of degrees.  The Bill as drafted means that the NCEA will be the only award-granting body.  I regard that as being wrong educationally.  It is potentially dangerous for the Limerick <Col N="1793" /> Institute, and it will also be applied to the Institute in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Limerick Institute will be constrained unnaturally in its approach to the giving of awards to undergraduates. In regard to certificates and diplomas, though I accept that the NCEA are the proper award-giving body, I say that the Minister was wrong when he drafted the Bill in such a way that the door has been closed to the institute in relation to awarding certificates and diplomas, which should have been left to the discretion of the governing body to which award-giving body they would apply in regard to certificates and diplomas, but particularly to degrees.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to force the institute to seek awards from the NCEA alone because it could be dangerous.  In order to ensure standards, it is important that there should be a certain amount of competition so that degrees awarded to the institute will be comparable with those granted by the universities.  That is not the position under the Bill because there is a danger that degrees awarded by the NCEA may not be acceptable internationally. I know the Minister does not want that any more than I or anybody else in the House.  We have an obligation to ensure that the standards to be set will be unquestionably high, and because of that I feel there is a need to allow the institute to seek their degree awards not only from the NCEA but from equivalent degree-awarding authorities.</P>
    <P>An any rate, I doubt if the NCEA are competent to grant all the degrees which the institute will be offering to undergraduates. I am open to correction on that but I fear that the NCEA may be in that position.  If the institute should wish to introduce a degree level course, the time it will take the NCEA to validate and recognise such a course for degree awarding may be such as to hinder the institute in its establishment of that course.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the debate here, I feel the Minister is being pig-headed about that.  Looking back on the various <Col N="1794" /> debates in this House and the Seanad on higher education it seems clear that the Minister has not been in favour of a comprehensive system of higher education in the short term.  Perhaps he favours such an approach in the long term but in the short term he is supporting a division between the higher education authorities and that is unfortunate for a small nation like this.  It would have been far more realistic and progressive if he had opted for a comprehensive system of third level education and allowed for the proper development of the HEA and the institute in Limerick in the context of a unified higher education system.  He has not done that, he has not grasped the opportunity to ensure openness in the third level sector and he has closed the door on a unified system in that sector of education.</P>
    <P>In his approach the Minister has displayed a narrow-minded attitude in regard to the Bill.  When the matter of transferability and degree recognition arises we will be depending on vertical and horizontal mobility but very little recognition is being given to that necessity in the third level sector.  That is the basic difference between my party and the Government on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will be forcing a division on this amendment in an effort to spell out the need for a unified approach which would be educationally sound, understandable and progressive.  My object in pressing the amendment is to show clearly our opposition to the Bill, which has been drafted very badly.  The large number of amendments which the Minister himself introduced indicates that he knows this. My amendment shows our opposition to the composition of the Bill and to the negative manner in which the Minister has approached the debate on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson):</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the amendment, basically for the reasons given by Deputy Collins.  Indeed I challenge him on his statement that it is educationally unsound not to have more than one awarding body or council, on the basis that for an institution to have <Col N="1795" /> more than one could put a particular strain on the structures in the institution. It could dissipate efforts to achieve the kind of standards the Deputy was talking about.  On Committee Stage Deputy Horgan agreed that transferability was very important, but he did not seem to agree with Deputy Collins that it is necessary to have awards made by an institution other than the NCEA in order to achieve that transferability, and I agree with Deputy Horgan on that.  I submit to the House, and I have said already, that I am not putting a <i>ne plus ultra</i> on the development of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  I have conceived of it as an institution, with its sister institutions in Limerick, as being capable of development into one of our finest third level complexes.  The bones of this Bill sustain that position.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept from Deputy Collins that there is the slightest danger that the awards of the national council will not be acceptable internationally.  This was often urged at the beginning of this century with regard to various third level institutions envisaged at that time.  They have established themselves internationally and the awards now being given by the National Council for Education Awards have already established themselves as being internationally up to standard.  I know any further advancement, courses or validation that takes place will meet the same acceptance internationally as the ones already made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment states &ldquo;by a university in the State or equivalent degree awarding authority of international repute&rdquo;.  In his contribution the Deputy did not mention any equivalent degree awarding authority of international repute and I cannot accept that there would be any such body which would be <Col N="1796" /> able to process claims for courses or assess, validate and make awards with more speed than the NCEA.  It was specially designed to achieve that purpose. It was specially designed so that it could quickly assess and sanction courses and quickly make awards.  I cannot see that going outside the country, if that is what the Deputy has in mind, will bring any greater speed to the process.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made a rather heavy point about comprehensivisation.  He is on record in one of his speeches in this House as seeming to favour the comprehensive in one part of the speech and in another the non-comprehensive or binary system in third level education. He has made it quite clear now that he has pinned his colours to the comprehensive mast and, as I have said both inside and outside the House, I have no quarrel with the comprehensive system. I have no great urge to keep two rigid systems going without meeting.  What I hope is that the two systems will make maximum contact and that there will be both horizontal and vertical mobility within the two systems.  What I am saying at this stage is that the NIHE Limerick are suitable in our present stage of development.  They are adaptable, flexible and creative in our educational system.  For that reason I cannot see any valid reason whatever for this amendment proposed by Deputy Collins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister has at least acknowledged the correctness of comprehensivisation of third level education and that in the long run we may see that. We discussed it at length on the NCEA Bill and here as well.  I am pleased to note that he has not shut the door altogether on the concept of comprehensivisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Second Stage of this Bill and on the Committee Stage concentrated on the very many ways in which I and other Opposition speakers thought that the Bill ought to be amended in order to give the board of the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick reasonable freedom and flexibility in the pursuit of its objectives and in the fulfilment of its task.  Only today I was reading the National College of Art and Design Bill and noticed a general section in that Bill which gives the board of the National College of Art and Design sweeping powers to do all that it needs to do to run the college.  It is a pity that the Minister did not see fit to introduce such a general section into this <Col N="1799" /> Bill.  As a result of the discussions on Committee Stage I felt it necessary to put down a further amendment to restrict still further the area in which the Minister's express permission or approval is needed before the board of the NIHE could go about its ordinary business.  I put down an amendment which is in fact one of a series of amendments to achieve the same objective. Since tabling my amendment I am interested to see that the Minister has put down an amendment, amendment No. 3, obviously with the same intention as my own.  There are some differences between the Minister's amendment and my amendment, but in my view they are not substantial enough to justify wasting the time of the House arguing about them, much less voting on them.  I am glad to see the Minister taking the points that were made from this side of the House during the early Stages of the debate.  This amendment, which is one of the Minister's most substantial amendments to date, represents something of a retreat from Moscow in so far as his general line on this Bill is concerned, and in the light of that fact I will be happy to withdraw the two related amendments in my own name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all trying to achieve a situation in which the institute is allowed to go about its ordinary day-to-day work of maintenance and management and administration of its property.  Both Deputy Horgan and myself have put down amendments and I am pleased to note that the Minister has come in with an amendment which does not go as far as I would like it to go but nevertheless is an improvement on the rather narrow approach which was adopted on the Second and Committee Stages.  I am glad to know that the Minister's amendment is a prescriptive amendment which allows the Minister to prescribe conditions concerning the management, maintenance and administration of the assets of the institute. That goes some way towards allowing the institute a fair amount of flexibility. However I would like to refer the Minister to section 6 (1) where this matter <Col N="1800" /> is already dealt with and to this extent there is a duplication in the Bill.  Section (1) states:</P>
      <P>Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the Governing Body shall manage and control all the affairs and property of the Institute...</P>
      <P>That is quite simple, clear and straightforward. The governing body, without let or hindrance, has the responsibility under section 6 to manage and control all the affairs and property of the institute. There is really no need for the Minister to prescribe conditions under which the governing body should manage a building.  After all, if the roof is leaking surely it is within the competence of the governing body to get the roof repaired without having to refer to the conditions of the Minister for Education. It seems unnecessary.  I admit that in relation to the purchase of buildings or property the Minister's sanction should be sought and given, but for the ordinary day-to-day management and maintenance surely we could have confidence in the governing body to maintain the property.  For that reason I would have preferred section 6 to be the operative section in relation to the management of the property of the institute. Because of that and in order to highlight section 6 I intended moving amendment No. 5, which deletes the words &ldquo;maintain, manage, and administer&rdquo; from section 4.  The Minister's amendment does not go quite as far as I would like but it is an improvement on the first position so I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>The original was not narrow. I made the point already on this Bill at an earlier stage that certain technological institutions for which technologists have the height of respect are subject to far more central control. But, as the NIHE felt that there might, despite section 6 which was mentioned by Deputy Collins, be an undue measure of control over certain aspects of the activities of the governing body, I am introducing this amendment as a liberalising one and I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 31, to delete &ldquo;nine&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for this amendment are quite clear.  It reduces the power of the Minister to nominate nine members of the governing body.  At the moment the Minister can appoint nine members.  I want that to be reduced to four.  In amendment No. 7 I recommend that there be five direct appointments to the governing body.  I recommend that there <Col N="1802" /> be appointments from university College, Cork, and from University College, Galway.  The reason for those two is that in relation to vertical and horizontal mobility it is very important for the institute to work hand in glove with the universities and the two nearest universities are obviously Cork and Galway. Therefore, I am asking for direct representation from these two colleges on the governing body.  I do not think that is being unreasonable.  I am also looking for a member from the farming community through the IFA and from the industrial and commercial sector through the Confederation of Irish Industry. That is a reasonable request and it is important in view of the technological nature of the institute.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am looking for direct representation from the Limerick City Vocational Educational Committee.  The institute is sited in the catchment area of the VEC and it seems eminently reasonable that they should have an appointment on the governing body.  I would therefore ask the Minister to consider these changes favourably.  It is no wish of mine to interfere with the method of appointment, but I feel that my amendment is a far more liberal and progressive approach to the problem of representation on the governing body.</P>

      <P>We are talking about a situation here in which the Minister nominates directly some 13 of the 23 ordinary members of the governing body.  I believe that the central government should have a substantial nomination of members to this national institute.  But I am sorry the Minister has not seen fit, after considering this matter, to reduce his total number of nominees to marginally less than half the total number.  This would provide him with a hedge against any possible accusation that he was trying to pack the governing body with his friends and supporters without interfering in any way with the workings of the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, I particularly welcome the provision, which is not interfered with by Deputy Collins's amendment, that at <Col N="1803" /> least one of the persons to be appointed to the board will be a member of the non-academic staff of the institute.  It is high time that the work of the non-academic staff in all our institutions was given more appropriate recognition in the governing of the institutes.</P>

      <P>The point just made by Deputy Horgan is covered, as the Deputy knows, under section 5 (4) (c). There is representation for the non-academic staff.  The expressed motivation of Deputy Collins of aiding mobility vertically and horizontally &mdash; and I would be particularly interested in the horizontal &mdash; in the context of the universities is a good one.  His objective is good but it is not necessary in the particular context.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Horgan that the Minister's appointment will be based on very sound principles and not on any personal or political preference in this instance. I pointed out on Committee Stage that the weighting is already 15 to 10 in favour of the academic education sector.  If Deputy Collins's amendment were accepted the balance then would be 18 to 7.  This would be totally out of proportion and could not give a good balance.  As is stated in the Bill, the Minister must take cognisance of industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce protection and so on when making his appointment.  With the provisions of the Bill, added to the common sense of the Minister, the House can be assured that the representation will be well made.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 42 and 43, to delete &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the conditions in section 6 will be prescriptive rather than dictatorial &mdash; in other words, that the Minister would prescribe the conditions under which the director would be appointed to the institute.  The Minister should not have to approve the appointment of the director.  The governing body should do the necessary administration, advertising, selection and appointment.  This is preferable in the context of a third level education institute. The unnecessary constraints placed upon this appointment will leave it open to the possible interpretation that it will be a party political appointment, which is to be avoided at all costs in third level education.  The governing body and the academic body will obviously be made up of people with high intellect and integrity.  In that context, the need for formal ministerial approval does not exist.  What is preferred is a prescriptive condition to the appointment of the director.</P>

      <P>Section 9 provides for the appointment of members other than the director to the staff of the institute and exacts ministerial approval.  As the director's is the most important post in the institute, it is reasonable and in accordance with sound practice that ministerial approval should be written into the Act.  As the House knows, the NCA Act of 1979 has a similar provision. I accept, as Deputy Collins says, that the governing body will be beyond impugning as far as intellect and integrity are concerned.  I cannot envisage any situation where the Minister will turn down the recommendation of the governing bodies, but it is reasonable and in accordance with good practice to maintain the position that the Minister's approval has to be sought and received.</P>

      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 19 to 31, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6. (a)  Where a member of the governing body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will be sympathetic to this amendment which simply allows Members of the governing body freedom to stand for election either for the Houses of the Oireachtas or for the European Communities.  The Bill as it stands would mean that a member of the governing body would have to resign if he were nominated to stand for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas or for the European Parliament.  I contend he should be allowed stand freely.  Indeed we should encourage such participation in public elections.  If he were elected he would then resign but if he were not, he could continue to be a member of the governing body.  The amendment is reasonable in the context of attracting people into public life and we should certainly allow them stand and, if not elected, remain members of the governing body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper:</NameTxt>
      <P>The major reaction of most people concerned with the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, was one of disappointment that the Minister has been so receptive. This is the opinion not alone of the people immediately involved with the institute, such as the governing body, staff and students, but also professional bodies, such as the Irish Federation of University Teachers who see in this Bill some very dangerous precedents for university colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has effected substantial amendments. Whether or not they are sufficient time alone will tell.  The Minister paid tribute himself to such NIHE graduates who have gone abroad.  In Ireland the institute has a better percentage placement record for their graduates than any of the traditional universities and the CAO first choice applications for 1980 illustrate that the parents and school teachers of Ireland are rapidly recognising this fact.  Whereas the first choice applications this year for all of the traditional universities are down significantly on last year, with the exception of Trinity, which is up 4.1 per cent <Col N="1810" /> and UCD which is up by 1 per cent, the number of applications for the NIHE are up by 35.8 per cent on 1978 and considerably higher on the year 1979.  The Minister and his predesessor emphasised the need for this type of graduate in Ireland taking his proper place in the world of the 1980s.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended for his decision to make money available for the retraining of commerce graduates in engineering and science.  But if the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, is to maintain its present rate of progress it cannot afford to be shackled.  They must have power to hire the personnel they deem most suitable for their needs and to dismiss them if necessary subject of course, to the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  Above all they must have the resources necessary to allow them fulfil their role.  This role, although exercised in Limerick is a national one and not alone Limerick but the nation will hold the Minister accountable if he refuses to allow it develop its full potential by keeping too tight a grasp on the purse strings.</P>
    <P>The Minister and indeed other people involved in education have said that the NIHE, limerick, should be as good as other universities.  I can tell the Minister that the NIHE, Limerick, is as good but will be better.  It is at present the envy of a lot of universities.  If the Minister is fair with it I believe the NIHE Limerick has fantastic potential.  We in Limerick and in that region are very proud of it.  We are monitoring very carefully what the Minister and his Department are doing for the institute.  We are very proud that it is located in Limerick.  We know it is the envy of a lot of other areas.  We hope that the Minister and his Department will not in any way shackle its progress.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the measures taken by the Government controlling and regulating exports to Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory Instruments 145 and 146 of 1980 which have been laid before this House enable exports to Iran to be controlled and regulated.  The issue of these Orders followed on a decision of the nine member states of the European Community <Col N="1812" /> to impose limited trade and diplomatic sanctions on Iran.</P>
    <P>The chain of events which led up to that decision of the Nine may be said to have begun on 4 November last when demonstrators led by militant students occupied the US embassy compound in Tehran and took captive over fifty members of the embassy staff.  The seizure of the embassy was one incident in a long period of instability which included frequent mass demonstrations in Tehran and other cities, fighting between the armed forces and factions opposed to the Shah, the departure of the Shah and the return from exile of Ayatollah Khomeini, one of the spiritual leaders of the Shia Moslem community which is the predominant religious faith in Iran. More recently, there has been the execution of many highly placed officials and military officers of the Shah's regime and the growth of tension between Iran and neighbouring countries, particularly in the Gulf area.  It is clear that in the last two years Iran has passed through a traumatic period.  An elected assembly is now meeting, for the first time in many years, and we can predict that its decisions will be of fundamental importance for the future development of Iran.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the other member states of the European Community have followed these developments with great interest.  While the Nine have expressed concern over the frequent executions, it is neither our intention nor indeed our right to challenge the free choice of the Iranian people in regard to the form of Government and institutions under which they choose to live.  These are matters which they must determine for themselves, and we accept that fully.  The European Council in their statement of 30 November 1979 made it clear that the Nine Community member states fully respect the independence of Iran and the right of the Iranian people to determine their own future, and are aware of the importance which the Iranian people attach to the changes which have taken place in their country.</P>
    <P>The students who took captive the staff of the US embassy claimed that <Col N="1813" /> they intend to hold them as hostages for the return of the Shah and of assets which he and members of his family had removed from Iran illegally, or acquired abroad with funds taken out of the country illegally.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to go into the matters at issue between the US and the Iranian authorities in regard to events during the Shah's regime, or the matters alleged by the students.  The specific point at issue in the discussion about sanctions has been the holding as hostages of diplomatic personnel, properly accredited, whom it is the duty of the host country under international law to protect.  The European Council characterised the holding of the, hostages as a flagrant breach of international law.</P>
    <P>That the Iranian authorities have failed to act in accordance with their clear obligations under international law is evident from the fact that no effort has been made to remove the hostages from the control of those who hold them and to set them at liberty.  The Revolutionary Council, which was the <i>de facto</i> authority in the country prior to the election of an assembly, in fact refused to accept responsibility for the hostages.  The newly elected Assembly has not to date deliberated on the hostages issue and there is no evidence that it intends to take it up with any urgency.</P>
    <P>The United States administration for its part has made it clear that it considers the holding of the hostages and the whereabouts of the Shah to be separate and unrelated questions.  The United States has tried to avail of such means of recourse as are open to it at the international level.  It has taken the matter up both in the International Court of Justice and in the United Nations Security Council.  It has also tried to use various channels of mediation.</P>
    <P>On 29 November 1979 the United States instituted proceedings in the International Court of Justice against Iran, seeking an order to the Government of Iran to release the hostages and return US property.  The Iranian authorities declined to appear, arguing that the <Col N="1814" /> holding of the hostages should not be dissociated from its proper context, namely, the whole relationship between Iran and the US over the last 25 years, and that matters arising out of the Islamic revolution of Iran fell within the national sovereignty of Iran.  In its judgment given on 24 May the court rejected this argument and pointed out that if Iran believed it had legitimate grievances against the US it was free to bring these before the court, by way of counter-claim or otherwise; however, Iran, by refusing to appear, had deprived itself of the opportunity to make its case before the court and seek redress.  The court pointed out that there is an obligation, long established in international law, on receiving States to protect diplomatic personnel and premises.  Islam had itself contributed to the development of international law on this subject.  These obligations remain in the event of the breaking off of diplomatic relations or even of war between states.  The court also pointed out that states are not obliged to maintain diplomatic relations, but those which do are obliged to respect the norms of international law governing them.</P>
    <P>The matter of the hostages was also considered in the United Nations Security Council.  On 25 November 1979 the Secretary-General wrote to the Security Council describing the holding of the hostages as a grave situation posing a serious threat to international peace and security.  The Security Council on 4 December 1979 expressed deep concern at the dangerous level of tension between Iran and the US, which could have grave consequences for international peace and security.  It reaffirmed the solemn obligation on all states that were parties to the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations to respect the inviolability of diplomatic personnel and premises.  It called on the Government of Iran to release the personnel of the US Embassy, afford them protection and allow them to leave Iran.  It asked the Secretary-General to use his good offices for the immediate implementation of the resolution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> The Security Council considered the hostage question again on 31 December 1979 and decided, in the event of non-compliance with its resolution, to adopt effective measures under Articles 39 and 41 of the United Nations Charter.  These articles provide, among other things, for the imposition of sanctions.</P>
    <P>The Security Council met again on 12 January 1980 to consider the issue of the hostages.  At this meeting the US presented a request for sanctions against Iran in certain specified areas, the most notable exclusions being foodstuffs and medicines.  Despite the absence of any improvement in the situation and the commitment to action in the Security Council's Resolution of 31 December 1979, the Soviet Union voted against the imposition of sanctions, thus frustrating the earlier unanimous decision.</P>
    <P>The US has also had recourse to mediation.  In the early days of the hostages' captivity President Carter sent personal envoys to Iran, but they did not complete the journey when it was made clear that they would not be allowed to meet Iranian government officials or the hostages themselves.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General in the exercise of the &ldquo;good offices&rdquo; function entrusted to him by the Security Council, remained in contact with the parties to the dispute and on 19 February 1980 nominated a Commission of Inquiry comprising five members, eminent lawyers or diplomats from Algeria, France, Sri Lanka, Syria and Venezuela. The mandate of the commission was &ldquo;to undertake a fact-finding mission to Tehran to hear Iran's grievances and allow an early solution to the crisis between Iran and the United States&rdquo;.  Initially it appeared that the commission would be able to play an important part in resolving the problem.  They travelled to Tehran and heard evidence, from the students holding the hostages and others, of injustices under the Shah's regime and of alleged US involvement.  After the commission had completed their investigation into Iran's grievances the students holding the hostages offered to turn them over to the Revolutionary <Col N="1816" /> Council.  The council refused to accept responsibility for them.  The commission was unable to gain access to the hostages.  The members of the commission left Tehran on 10 March and later informed the Secretary-General that they had been unable to carry out their mandate fully and were not in a position to submit a report.</P>
    <P>At this point it may have appeared to the US that all the normal avenues of recourse had been tried and had failed. There had often seemed to be grounds for hope that a solution would soon be found, but each time the hopes had been disappointed and the efforts bedevilled by the absence of an effective central authority in Iran, and in the last analysis by an absence of political will on the part of the Iranian authorities.</P>
    <P>However, the US decided to proceed with the imposition of sanctions against Iran on the basis of the draft Security Council Resolution which had been vetoed.  On 1 April President Bani Sadr of Iran held out the prospect that the hostages would be transferred to government custody and the US deferred the application of sanctions.  President Bani Sadr's statement came to nothing.  On 7 April Ayatollah Khomeini stated that the situation of the hostages was unchanged and that the students would continue to hold them.  The US then broke off diplomatic relations with Iran and imposed economic sanctions.  The US also appealed to a number of West European and other countries including the member states of the Community to join in the imposition of sanctions on the basis of the vetoed Security Council Resolution.</P>
    <P>The Nine had followed the hostages situation with the utmost concern from its earliest days.  I have referred already to the position taken by the European Council on 30 November 1979.  In the months following 4 November, the heads of mission of the Nine in Tehran, first under the Irish presidency and later under that of Italy, were in regular contact with the Iranian authorities with a view to bringing about improvements in the conditions in which the hostages were held, and their eventual release.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> These messages did not unfortunately produce any change in the situation.  The Foreign Ministers of the Nine met in Lisbon on 10 April and decided to instruct their representatives in Tehran to approach President Bani Sadr immediately and request the release of the hostages and details of the timing and manner of the release.  The heads of mission were instructed to report back to capitals on the reaction to their request. The Foreign Ministers stated that they would study their positions in the light of the reports they received.  The approach was made and the heads of mission, including the Irish Chargé d'Affaires, reported in person to their respective capitals.</P>
    <P>At their next meeting, on 22 April 1980 in Luxembourg, the Foreign Ministers again discussed the hostages question.  They noted that, while the International Committee of the Red Cross had been permitted to visit the hostages and President Bani Sadr had given assurances about their living conditions, no commitment had been forthcoming in regard to their release. They were concerned that the continuance of this situation was intolerable from a humanitarian and legal point of view, and would endanger international peace and security.  They accordingly decided to take certain measures at once against Iran.  These included reduction of Embassy staffs in Tehran, introduction of a visa requirement for Iranian nationals and withholding of arms or defence-related equipment.  They agreed that if by 17 May, the date of their next meeting, there had been no decisive progress leading to the release of the hostages they would proceed to the application of sanctions on the basis of the vetoed Security Council resolution.  The heads of mission in Tehran were instructed to inform the Iranian authorities of this decision.</P>
    <P>The European Council, meeting on 27-28 April, described the continued holding of the hostages as an inadmissible violation of international law.  They reaffirmed their solidarity with the <Col N="1818" /> government and people of the US in this difficult situation.  They endorsed the decision of the Foreign Ministers and expressed support for the efforts of the Secretary General of the United Nations to bring about a resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Ministers met again on 17-18 May in Naples.  They acknowledged that since the date of their last meeting there had been no progress towards the release of the hostages. They decided to impose sanctions against Iran on the basis already agreed. They stressed that the only purpose of these measures was to hasten the release of the hostages and that they wished to respect the independence of Iran and the right of the Iranian people to determine their own future.</P>
    <P>To sum up, our view is that the position created by the taking of the hostages is of concern to all states, since the violation of international law which it involves touches on the rights and interests of all.  Whatever Iran's grievances, it is clear that channels of recourse are open to it, and they do not justify the taking of diplomatic personnel as hostages.  This is not only a very serious breach of international law, but a continuing one which the Iranian authorities have to date shown no disposition to remedy.  Iran is flouting the laws by which relations between states are governed.  To that extent it can be said to have put itself outside the normal operation of these relations. The Nine have tried to point out to the Iranians the seriousness of their action. We have given them time in which to consider our appeals.  The International Court of Justice and the Security Council have also given their judgments.  All this has been to no avail. We have accordingly taken a step which we hope will bring home to Iran the unacceptability of the course in which it is engaged and contribute to efforts by peaceful means to bring it to reconsider its actions.</P>
    <P>Given the danger to the lives and wellbeing of the hostages and the dilatory approach of the Iranian authorities, the <Col N="1819" /> intensity of feeling which led the US to decide that a mission should be undertaken to rescue the hostages is understandable. However, we and our partners in the Nine have expressed the hope that the US will continue to use peaceful means for the release of the hostages so as not to incur the danger of international conflict.  It was in the hope of contributing to pressure on Iran through peaceful means that we agreed on the imposition of sanctions, to which the Security Council was in principle committed, and it is in that hope that we are implementing them.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are striving to increase our exports it is not lightly that we take measures to restrict Irish exports to a specific country.  We consider, however, that in this case the extreme gravity of the situation justifies our action. I hope that the need for these extraordinary measures and for the orders which have been laid before this House will rapidly disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that we should have this debate.  The taking of trade sanctions against any nation is a very serious step which warrants discussion in the Dáil.  I am glad that the Government, following on our putting down a Private Members' motion in regard to this, raised the matter by way of a Government motion so that we could have a discussion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable reservations about the imposition of trade sanctions against Iran in the context of a complete condemnation of the taking of diplomatic hostages by students in Iran. It is absolutely clear that their action is totally in breach of international law and conventions and nobody can have the slightest reservation about issuing a total condemnation of it.  From time immemorial there has been a convention that diplomats have immunity in their guest country.  Far back in history there was a period when this was not so, and I recall the activities of one Peter the Impaler who treated the diplomats in his day in a most appalling manner.  Over the last hundreds of years, however, it <Col N="1820" /> has been accepted that the placing of diplomats has helped in the reduction of tensions between countries, not just in peace but in war times, and they have always been accorded a traditional immunity.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the safety of the hostages is with the Iranian authorities and the continued retention of these hostages is something for which Iran must be condemned.  However, I have reservations in regard to our joining in a trade boycott of Iran.  Such a course may be ineffective and may be counterproductive. I recognise that the action taken was taken in good faith and with the best intentions and I raise my questions quite genuinely and not in any political context. The effect of Ireland controlling exports to Iran must be a very doubtful one and in his reply I would ask the Minister to indicate in terms of goods and money what exactly is involved.  It appears to me that such action on our part will not have any great effect on the Iranian authorities from the point of view of encouraging, cajoling or forcing them to implement their national obligation to free the hostages.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I accept that we have to look at what we are doing in the broader context of the EEC and we have to look at what may be the effect of the overall banning or limitation of exports to Iran from the entire EEC.  Will this lead to the desired effect?  Will it result in the release of the hostages?  My worry is that such measures may only solidify the anti-western feeling that is in Iran and may fortify the seige mentality apparently developing there.  In Iran we are not talking of a situation where central government are in control of affairs.  The situation there is very unstable.  There are divisions of authority among various persons and groups.  There is a lawfully elected president, Bani Sadr, who apparently wishes to negotiate a speedy and full settlement of this problem.  On the other hand it appears that policy is undermined regularly by the Ayatollah Khomeini whose statements tend to range from the rational to the bizarre. Then there is the newly-elected assembly <Col N="1821" /> and it now appears that the majority in that assembly will not be answerable to the wishes of President Bani Sadr.  There is also the position of the students actually holding the hostages.  There are also the various revolutionary groups and militias, control of which is, to say the least, doubtful.  We are not dealing with a strong Government with control, either because of the democratic process or for other reasons.  In that unstable situation I am worried lest the measures that have been announced, not just by this country but by the other members of the EEC, may be ineffective or in fact counterproductive.</P>
    <P>A line of approach that occurred to me, seeing the agony of the hostages and their people in the US, was that we might be able to help by using our neutral status as a small country in an effort to exert pressure through mediation and discussion with Iran.  I accept that there have been many efforts at mediation and at discussing the problem with them, some of them outlined by the Minister in his comprehensive speech. There were others such as that most recently by Chancellor Kreisky and efforts by other Europeans.  In looking to the future, I think we must consider both the short-term and the long-term.  The aim must be to ensure that Iran does not fall victim to Soviet aggression and that Iran will be encouraged to seek help and support from the West in the re-establishment of her economy when the present troubles there settle down.</P>
    <P>In the short term there is the danger that steps being taken may be counterproductive.  I do not speak <i>ex cathedra</i> in that matter; I merely voice reservations I have and genuine worries I have regarding the hostages.  In relation to the long-term aim I believe there is genuine danger that Iran, which has such a rich potential may be a target for the Soviets.  This is highlighted by the invasion of their neighbour, Afganistan, and the provision of ready jumping-off points, for what to the Soviets would be the rich prize of Iran's oil deposits.  In considering the future one must look at <Col N="1822" /> the global picture and the situation of the Soviets after a period of about 15 years when their oil situation will be causing them major concern.  In that context anybody looking at the position objectively will certainly be watching the attempts of the Soviets to expand their sphere of influence in that area and particularly in Iran.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, is it wise on the part of the Western nations and more so on our own part as a small neutral nation to take steps against Iran which (a) appear to me not to have a hope of succeeding in the short-term objective of freeing the hostages and (b) which will arouse the animosity of the people of that country which may endure for many a year and may have the effect of turning their minds towards support and assistance from the Soviet bloc.  No doubt the potential of Iran which could be one of the richest in the world has not been exploited and there is need for very great help from the point of view of technology and so on in building up that nation particularly as regards restructuring and restoring it after the revolutionary period.  I hope Iran will ultimately be helped by the western nations and to some degree by ourselves in whatever way we can so that we will show them that we are friends and anxious to help.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record firmly my total condemnation of the taking and holding of the hostages in Iran.  My remarks tonight are in the context of reservations I hold that the measures proposed may be ineffective or counter-productive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been part of the Conventional wisdom in commenting on this situation that western spokesmen particularly in western Europe and the US and Canada should place particular emphasis on the &ldquo;breach of international law&rdquo; on the part of Iran.  It is also part of the conventional wisdom of the western democracies that we have failed time and again to put the situation in perspective as seen by the people of Iran and by very many Governments other than <Col N="1823" /> those in the west.  We would be entirely hypocritical if we did not try to appreciate the absolute depths of feeling within the general population, not just of Iran but of the surrounding states, in relation to the history of domestic tyranny of the most brutal and prolonged kind, which they suffered at the hands of the Shah, who was, if one may quote the words of Edward Kennedy, one of the most tyrannical despots in the history of that part of the world.</P>
      <P>I have a very jaundiced view about the adoption of the export sanctions referred to.  Lest we appear to fall into the trap, which has been set for so many countries, we should clearly put on record our absolute abhorrence, repugnance and detestation of what went on in Iran under the hands of the Shah.  He had the total support over 20 years, especially in the past decade, of the official authority of successive presidents of the USA, the CIA in America and a large number of security agencies of a parallel kind of western powers. They exerted massive influence in Iran and exploited the reserves of that country.  They bolstered it up with military hardware of a massive kind with monthly injections, where necessary, particularly in terms of the sale of arms to the Shah and in respect of the non-publication of the murder and torture of thousands of people by that particular despot in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hands of America, in particular, in relation to that appalling situation in Iran, are not just unclean but are absolutely bloodstained.  Let us have an Irish vision of what happened in that period.  No matter how much I or any other citizen in any democracy in western Europe may detest the aberrations and interpretation of democracy unique to the Ayatollah following his return, we must not shut out from our minds the history of that country in relation to that period.  It is only by taking that fully into account that we can try to understand why it appears to us as a nation, that its students and its revolutionary council, as it emerged <Col N="1824" /> from such a tyranny and its spiritual leaders, would act in what might appear to us such an unconventional, strange and at times undemocratic manner.</P>
    <P>There was what can only be called mass post-revolutionary provocation by America in relation to this situation. There was the acceptance of the Shah into the USA in which Henry Kissinger played a large part.  The arm of President Carter was massively twisted by the erstwhile supporters of the Shah.  It was certainly no great surprise to me that the Ayatollah, the student revolutionary council and the revolutionary council &mdash; it should not have been a surprise to anybody in America or to the Irish Government &mdash; engaged in such a continued violent reaction of such intensity as we saw on our television screens and we read about in the international agency reports, following the acceptance of the Shah into America by the American Government.</P>
    <P>I do not, nor do my party, while I am making that very strong preamble to my comments, go along with, even in our reasonable appreciation of the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United States and Iran, and publicly condone the taking into hostage of diplomatic personnel even though it has been suggested that a substantial proportion of those who were taken into captivity of a prolonged and rather brutal kind at times, were in fact agents of the CIA.  It is not unknown to those of us who have some knowledge of that part of the world, that a proportion of such personnel in those embassies tend to be in inverse ratio to the gravity of the situation in the area.  I accept in the conventional diplomatic sense that they were accredited diplomatic personnel. Accredited diplomatic personnel in that part of the world have a very acute sense of the prospects of their personal safety when they operate in that part of the world.  That is another <i>caveat</i> I have to enter here.</P>
    <P>In case there be any misconstruing of the view of the Labour Party in this matter we still submit to the Iranian authorities that no long-term useful purpose is served by, and no great victory is <Col N="1825" /> likely to result from, holding on to such personnel.  There is a further real danger that the Iranian authorities, by holding on to such personnel, are likely to provoke the USA into a major breach of international peace.  After reading the American investigation reports one can only describe as harebrained the particular rescue attempt by the Americans, which could have resulted in a major conflagration in that part of the world. God only knows what would have happened if it had proceeded beyond the befuddled state where the thing collapsed. That scenario has only been referred to by the Minister in a very minor way towards the end of his speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not a man known to keep his tongue unduly tied in his cheek, but he was masterful when he went on to say that the Nine expressed the hope that the US would continue to use peaceful means for the release of the hostages and then he said that it was understandable that the US should have considered it right to undertake a rescue mission.  While that might have been understandable, it was a harebrained effort which did not help in any way either in rescuing the hostages or in lessening tensions in that part of the world.  Neither did it help in regard to giving the Western democracies some opportunity of getting the hostages out of their situation.</P>
    <P>I have been exceptionally strong in my condemnation of the exploitation of the US in the situation in Iran for 25 years.  I have been vehement in my denunciation of the role of the Shah and of the US in that part of the world.  They exploited the situation utterly to their mutual ends.  I have been jaundiced about the way in which the Western democracies were dragged by the US diplomatic post into supporting their efforts in that area.  We had a very reluctant Nine trying to save face, trying on the one hand to hold out half a finger to America by saying that they go along in this direction and, on the other hand, saying to the Iranians: &ldquo;We hope you appreciate our position but we intend imposing a ban on exports <Col N="1826" /> to your country.&rdquo; Such a ban is totally ineffective because even the Israelis could teach the Iranians how to cope with that situation and if they needed further advice they might only have a word with any of the South African diplomatic posts who would advise them on how to destroy completely this purely cosmetic exercise of a ban on exports. Such sanctions are treated with contempt. Even the most inexperienced or unconventional Iranian businessman in a diplomatic post in London could get around those sanctions within a very short time.</P>
    <P>As a delegate to the Council of Europe &mdash; a body which may not be of any great consequence but which may nevertheless have some influence on the situation &mdash; I have said, both privately and publicly, that the Iranian authorities should release the hostages, that they should try to deal with the situation in a more rational manner and that no useful purpose is being served by keeping the hostages in captivity.  At least half of the hostages should be deported formally as staff of the CIA and the other half should be set free as ordinary diplomatic personnel, but since they are all accredited they should all be freed.  The students who are holding the hostages would have been well advised to have adopted that approach in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I recall being critical here of America's involvement in Vietnam and I recall also asking questions of former Ministers about American involvement in Cambodia, but I was classified then as being one of those rather odd Irishmen who was suffering from anti-American aberrations.  I assure the House that I do not have any such obsession or preoccupation. At the risk of not receiving any invitation from the US State Department to visit that country during the next ten years, the best thing we could do to the American Government is to tell them the truth occasionally.  They would respect us for this and in the process we should tell the Iranian Government that, much as we sympathise with their history in this situation, <Col N="1827" /> the way they are dealing with it is not the right way.  We should tell them that there is a way out for them and that their country can progress in peace and prosperity, in economic and social development with a new parliament, a new hope and a new beginning.  That would be something that the Irish people would wish for, having regard to our revolutionary past and our efforts to get us out of the kind of situation in which the Iranians also found themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the constructive approach that has been adopted by speakers representing Fine Gael and Labour in regard to this matter. I think we would all agree that this question of sanctions in regard to Iran is not designed in any way to harm the Iranian people as such.  The main thrust of the sanctions is to emphasise a very important principle, a principle that has been held rightly by civilised nations from the dawn of civilisation and which has been held particularly by the Muslim nations that have taken part in the growth and development of that civilisation. I refer to the principle whereby the emissaries of one nation living in another nation are respected.  That is something that has developed into a whole <i>corpus</i> of international law down through the years.  It has been acknowledged in many conventions and developed in law for thousands of years.  Civilised conduct between nations, regardless of creed, colour or culture, would be impossible without a clear and resounding acknowledgment of diplomatic immunity so far as are concerned personnel living in a nation other than their own but representing their own nation in that other nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That principle is the only legal basis behind the sanctions.  It must be made known to countries, regardless of how revolutionary or how extreme their attitudes may be, that this fundamental principle must be adhered to.  There is plenty of precedent for this so far as the various revolutionary countries have been concerned down through the years. <Col N="1828" /> For example, in the early days of the Russian state after the revolution or in the early days of the French state after their revolution as well as in many other post-revolutionary countries there was protection for their citizens who acted as diplomatic representatives.</P>
    <P>This has now grown into a firm principle of international law, sanctioned by conventions in all countries and recognised throughout the world as being fundamental and basic from the point of view of reasonable behaviour between nations.  Unless this basic right is acknowledged it will be impossible to communicate, and the only way to break down barriers between nations of different views, different colours, be they extremely authoritarian, extremely democratic or extremely on the left or the right, is by exchange of diplomatic personnel and the growing communicating of facts on each side which would lead to growing understanding of where common interests lie, and gradually over the years to improvement of relations and relaxation of tension.</P>
    <P>To bring the matter down to perspective, first of all in regard to Irish exports to Iran, food and medical and pharmaceutical products are excluded from the sanctions.  That is relevant from our point of view.  I have the figures here for the first four months of this year.  The exports which have been excluded from sanctions accounted for 90 per cent of our total exports to Iran.  That has not just happened this year because in 1979 a very high percentage of our total exports was composed of food and medical and pharmaceutical products.  The percentage was 81.4 per cent of our total exports.  They are excluded from our trade sanctions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am only trying to bring things into perspective.  We acted in conjunction with our Community partners.  One may agree wholeheartedly or disagree with particular actions, but within a Community context it is important to ensure that a formula will be worked out agreeable to all the countries within the Community.  I played a part in working out a moderate formula in regard to exports to Iran, excluding certain products, and the net result is that we have demonstrated as a Community, in conjunction with the US, our view of the wrong nature of the action in Iran when they took diplomatic personnel as hostages.  There is no question of the Irish Government or the Irish people adopting an antagonistic attitude towards the Iranian people.  We have seen and appreciated their difficulties and their problems.  We should like to see some order developing out of chaos in that country in an orderly democratic manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the sort of situation that gave rise to the revolutionary process there.  However, the revolutionary process of itself has not led to a restoration of order but indeed to a slowing down to a substantial degree of the entire economy, of production in regard to basic products such as oil.  At the moment there are serious problems in regard to production caused by the dispersal of power and there does not appear to be any real decision-making process.  There appears to be a pattern of division of power and inability and incapacity to come to grips with realities in regard to the running of that country.  I hope the Iranian people will work out of this situation and I would not like to see <Col N="1830" /> Ireland or the EEC doing anything that would exacerbate the situation there to any degree.</P>
    <P>What has been done by the Community is the bare minimum necessary to indicate the Community's rightful abhorrence of interference with the civilised principle of immunity of diplomatic personnel which goes to the heart of relations between states and the fundamental principle of international law.  One of the Community's principle functions is to emphasise aspects of that kind.  The area covered by the EEC is one of the remaining parts of the world where Governments are democratically elected.  One may say there is not any great harmony in regard to decision-making, but decisions are made by nine democratic Governments.  A great part of the world today, unfortunately, is ruled by arbitrary totalitarian Governments. Despite faults and failings, the EEC represent nations who abide by the rule of law, who seek to ensure that the rule of law is observed on an international basis between nations.  The stand taken by the Community on this issue, in conjunction with the US, was based on that principle.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not greatly involved in the trading and economic sense, but some of our European partners stand to lose substantially through these sanctions.  But they went along with them because of the basic violation of international law to which I have referred.  We as one of the nine partners could not stand apart.  As I have said, the harm or damage done to us has been infinitesimal compared with the losses suffered by some of our partners, such as Italy, Germany, France and the UK.  The Community decision was taken to underscore the importance of the fundamental principle of law in relation to behaviour between civilised nations.</P>

      <P>It was decided by the European Council that for a five year period Ireland should receive 67 million European Units of Account&mdash;about £45 million&mdash;in interest subsidies each year on loans from the European Investment Bank and the new financing facility. These subsidies represent the equivalent of interest at 3 per cent per annum over the life of each subsidised loan and are payable in capitalised from to the Exchequer at the time of the grant of the corresponding loan.  In 1979 the amount received was £44.4 million.  To date in 1980, £22.1 million has been received and a further £7 million is due in respect of other subsidised loans signed recently. <Col N="1541" /> The European Monetary System moneys are disposed of in accordance with the EEC Council Regulation on in terest subsidies for loans granted under the EMS.  These subsidies are available for the general purposes of the Exchequer. The regional fund moneys are governed by the regional fund regulations and are in the form of capital grants for specific projects.  European Investment Bank assistance is in the form of loan capital for specific projects and, unlike EMS and regional fund moneys is repavable with interest.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to avail of the full EMS moneys each year and as a minimum to borrow from the EIB such amounts as will be necessary to ensure this.  As regards the regional fund, it is the intention to continue to submit to the Commission each year sufficient projects to ensure that our full entitlement is received as early as possible. Plans for 1981 cannot be finalised until the Government has settled next year's Public Capital Programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in the publication of the bound volumes of statutes for the years subsequent to 1975 is mainly due to a shortage of staff in the Translation Section of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Also, the 1976 statutes are exceptionally bulky running to two volumes.  Due to the delay in the preparation of these volumes, which have now been <Col N="1542" /> published, the volumes for subsequent years will also be delayed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the paper covered an nual indexes to the statutes, which supplement the five-yearly Consolidated Index, the indexes for 1976, 1977 and 1978 are available while the 1979 index is in the course of printing and should be published within a few months.

However, as these figures represent the net of all external receipts and payments, it is inappropriate to aggregate the figures for those months when the change is positive and negative respectively and interpret the results as representing gross inflows and outflows respectively for the period, as appears to have been done in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the newspaper report to which the Deputy refers.  The measures referred to were in fact decided upon by the Government in February 1979 and are aimed at improving conditions on inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands off the west coast including those islands off the south west Cork coast.  These measures were based on proposals put forward by the Central Development Committee, which reports to me, and include the provision of electricity on certain islands, improvements in assistance for housing, improvements to water supply, sanitary services and communications, general economic development and community development.</P>

The question of diverting such savings to the official development assistance budget does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>There is, however, no question of a cut-back in the official development assistance programme as the amount provided for this year is £16.226 million as compared with £13.313 million last year.

These changes were the abolition of wealth tax for valuation dates occurring on or after 5 April 1978, the substantial reliefs introduced in capital gains tax and the provision of a specific exemption from capital acquisitions tax for heritage property, in relation to which incidentally no case has yet come before the Revenue Commissioners.  As regards the other ten proposals, the introduction of legislative measures to implement them is not considered necessary or appropriate in view of the issues involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy):</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 80 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The tax exemption limit on deposits has been raised from £70 to £150&mdash;from £140 to £300 in the case of married couples&mdash;in respect of deposits with the Post Office Saving Bank and certain deposits with the Trustee Savings Banks.  The increase has been confined to the savings banks for a number of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exemption limit is intended solely as an incentive for the small saver, and traditionally the savings banks have <Col N="1552" /> relied almost exclusively on the small saver for deposits.  Furthermore, these banks have been losing ground in attracting deposits in recent times.  There was a net outflow from deposits with the savings banks for most of 1979 and this outflow has continued in 1980.  I am particularly concerned about this development since the bulk of the savings banks' deposits are lodged with the Exchequer and used for the financing of the capital programme.  The increase in the amount of tax-free interest is intended to correct this situation.  If the improvement had not been granted, it would have been necessary to increase substantially the savings banks' deposit rates.  However, these rates are kept unchanged for long periods.  The same circumstances do not apply to other financial institutions.  I do not agree, therefore, that the concession represents discrimination against other banks; in fact, the tax exemption on deposit interest applies only to a very small number of banks.</P>
    <P>The increase relates only to the exemption allowed to depositors under section 344 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and it does not alter the reporting requirements of section 175 of that Act. Both the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks will continue to be required to disclose to the Revenue Commissioners particulars of interest paid or credited without deduction of tax where such interest is in excess of £70 and in this respect they are no different from other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that there is an unnecessary workload associated with the collection of tax on deposit interest.  The number of persons whose income exceeds their tax-free allowances solely by reason of having interest in excess of £70 from the qualifying institutions would form a very small proportion of the total number of taxpayers.  Furthermore, in the relatively few cases where income exceeded tax-free allowances for this reason, the exemption thresholds and the marginal relief which I introduced for those on low incomes and for the elderly would, in the main, eliminate or substantially reduce liability to tax.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he proposes to introduce legislation or new regulations to control the problem of roadside traders and scrap merchants who are causing traffic and pollution problems particularly in, and adjacent to, towns, and abusing the use of car park facilities provided by local authorities; if it is his intention to introduce on-the-spot fines for such offences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett):</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation for the control of roadside trading is a matter for the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  Measures to deal with pollution problems arising from such activities are the responsibility of local authorities.  With regard to the traffic aspects, I am satisfied that the existing statutory provisions governing dangerous parking, obstruction of traffic, and the control of parking are adequate. Parking offences on public roads, subject to local traffic and parking bye laws, come within the &ldquo;on-the-spot fines&rdquo; system.  The garda and the road authorities have power to remove and, if necessary, dispose of unlawfully parked vehicles.  Local authorities are empowered to make bye-laws to control the use of car parks provided by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in granting a free electricity allowance in this case was due to the fact that the applicant gave an incorrect pension number and as a result it became necessary to contact the British Authorities on two occasions and the applicant herself in order to obtain the information required.</P>
      <P>The allowance is now being applied with effect from the December 1979-January 1980 billing period onwards. The applicant is now being notified to this effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley):</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are the grant schemes administered by my Department in the current year:</P>
      <P>(i)  £5.8 million is being granted to the town gas industry by way of subsidy to the 8 town gas companies to enable them to reduce the price of gas to their customers by between 16p and 19p per therm approximately.</P>
      <P>Each company's allocation for a year is proportionate to their sales of gas in that year and is paid on a quarterly or half-yearly basis.  The companies are obliged to submit an auditor's certificate in respect of each claim for subsidy by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) Grants are available for the repair of bog roads over which turf is transported to the four small electricity generating stations at Gweedore, Screebe, Miltown Malbay and Cahirciveen. <Col N="1581" /> The grants are paid to the county councils concerned on receipt of certified returns of expenditure and they are allocated by reference to the quantity of turf actually delivered to each station in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>(iii) Grants of up to £35 per householder are available for the installation of bottled gas equipment in rural households which have not been connected to the electricity supply and who because of their location can obtain connection only on payment of a capital contribution.  These grants are not available for bottled gas equipment already installed.  Householders with bottled gas equipment already installed who qualify under the above criteria eligible for a grant up to a maximum of £25 for the purchase of additional bottled gas equipment.</P>
    <P>(iv) Grants of up to 33 per cent are available to manufacturing and service industry and hotels towards the cost of engaging consultants to carry out fuel efficiency surveys.  To qualify, an application should be made before the survey begins, together with a preliminary report from the consultants indicating the scope and estimated cost of the survey. A preliminary report is not necessary if the survey is expected to take 2½ days or less.</P>
    <P>(v) As part of the national energy conservation programme which is funded by my Department and carried out by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, a national boiler testing service is provided under which every non-domestic boiler, over 50 KW in size, is tested for combustion efficiency, free of charge, and a report on performance is supplied to the organisation.</P>
    <P>(iv) As a demonstration project worthy of support from an energy conservation point of view, my Department is grant-aiding a project for the use of reject heat, at Lanesboro electricity generating station, for horticultural purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant-in-aid for Cultural Relations, which amounts to £150,000 in 1980 is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the assistance of the Cultural Relations Committee. This voluntary advisory body, consisting of not less than nine and not more than eighteen members, is appointed annually by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to advise on the administration of the annual grant-in-aid The Minister is not obliged to accept the committee's advice, but may not incur expenditure from the grant-in-aid otherwise than on its recommendation.</P>
      <P>Most of the funds allocated to cultural promotion abroad are given in response to applications received by the committee from individuals or groups for projects involving performances, lectures or exhibitions outside the country.  Priority is given to projects of a high standard which are expected to contribute to the enhancement of Ireland's image abroad and to the development of cultural relations with other countries.</P>
      <P>In the Vote for International Co-operation, grants are made available for aid to developing countries and are disbursed either multilaterally, i.e. through various international agencies engaged in relief work and assistance, or bilaterally.  Grants are also issued from the Disaster Relief allocation in response to appeals by national or international agencies or national Governments for aid in emergency situations.</P>
      <P>Four grants-in-aid are administered under the Vote for International Co-operation. The first is that to the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.  The reason for establishing APSO was the desire to promote personal service in developing countries by Irish people. APSO has been allocated £600,000 in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second is that to the bilateral aid programme.  As Deputies are aware this <Col N="1583" /> subject has been discussed recently in the House.  The criteria for selection of the five priority countries, Lesotho, Sudan, Zambia, Tanzania and India, are given in the reply to Question No. 405 of 13 November 1978.  A total of £2,275 million has been allocated to the Bilateral Aid Programme in 1980.</P>
    <P>The third grant-in-aid is for Gorta&mdash;the Freedom from Hunger Campaign, set up in 1960.  As Minister responsible for Development Co-operation, I became President of Gorta last year.  A grant of £25,000 will be made as in past years to Gorta's administration costs in 1980.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation.  This council was set up to provide a forum for a representative discussion of matters relating to development co-operation and to offer advice to the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs on such matters. £25,000 has been allocated to the council this year towards its administration costs.</P>

      <P>A licence to excavate is normally required under section 26 (1) of the National Monuments Act, 1930, for archaeological excavations carried out by or on behalf of the National Museum. However, section 18 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954, modifies section 26 of the Principal Act in that it provides for an unlicensed excavation to take place to secure the safety of a monument or where a monument or archaeological object is in imminent danger of destruction or decay.</P>

In pursuance of this requirement each housing authority is expected to consider the circumstances of individual housing applicants, including the level of their incomes, in deciding whether they should be approved for re-housing or whether they could reasonably be expected to provide accommodation from their own resources assisted by the generous aids provided for this purpose from public funds.</P>

      <P>Dublin County Council commenced work on the laying of the sewer line referred to by the Deputy without the approval of my Department and consequently without a commitment to the sanction of a loan to finance the scheme.  I understand that the council have now ceased work pending receipt of the necessary sanctions.</P>
      <P>My Department have drawn the council's attention to the implications of departing from the standard procedures laid down for approving and financing sanitary services schemes.  It will be appreciated that those procedures are essential to enable me to programme annual expenditure on public water and sewerage schemes in accordance with the overall capital provision for sanitary services and that it would be entirely unfair to other local authorities to permit one local authority to pre-empt capital for their schemes by breaking the procedures which other authorities respect.</P>
      <P>The question of approving this scheme must be considered in the context of the overall resources available for the sanitary services programme and the number of fully approved schemes in progress or getting to construction.

      <P>Information available in my Department relates to the average gross price of houses for which loans are approved by the main lending agencies. The average gross price of such houses was £14,011 in the quarter ended 30 June 1977, and £24,184 in the quarter ended 31 March 1980.  The houses concerned are not necessarily comparable from quarter to quarter or between one area and another.  Subject to this reservation the difference in price, which represents an increase of 73 per cent is attributable to several factors including (a) increased labour, material and site <Col N="1662" /> costs and (b) the substantial improvement during the period in the standards of privately built houses, as confirmed by surveys carried out by An Foras Forbartha.</P>
      <P>An index of house building costs is prepared by Dublin Corporation in conjunction with the Department.  The index is normally published on the second Friday of each month.  Trends in the index since 1975 are set out in Table 21 of the Department's Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 438 by the Deputy, the information available in my Department in the case of private houses relates to the average gross price of houses for which loans are approved by the main lending agencies.  The houses concerned are not normally comparable from quarter to quarter or from area to area.  This applies particularly in areas where the numbers of loans approved in a quarter by the different lending agencies vary appreciably and the average prices can also be influenced significantly by the costings of individual housing schemes. Subject to these qualifications, the average gross price of private houses in the Dublin area was £14,415 in the quarter ended 30 June 1977 and £25,894 in the quarter ended 31 March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum SDA loan available was £7,000 in June 1977, having been increased from £4,500 as from 26 May 1977, following the change of Government. The maximum loan in June 1980 <Col N="1664" /> is £12,000.  An interest rate of 12½ per cent applies in both cases.  In fact, the average loans advanced under the scheme in the quarters ended 30 June 1977 and 31 March 1980 respectively were £3,480 and £8.040.  Repayment of the loans at the fixed rate of 12½ per cent over a 30-year period would amount to £10.73 a month for each £1,000 borrowed.</P>

    <P>F.  No teachers were recruited from any particular district to act as superintendents in Dublin centers. <Col N="1673" /> Because of the distribution of examination centres <i>vis-á-vis</i> that of superintendents homes (residences) and because of the excess of vacancies in the Dublin area (City and County) over the number of eligible applicants from that area it was necessary to assign 295 additional superintendents to the Dublin area from other counties.  Four applicants were Athlone based and two were Cavan based.</P>

      <P>The Department have under continuing appraisal the staffing needs of all the Farm Development Service local offices.</P>
      <P>As a result, the strength of the field staff attached to the Killarney office was increased earlier this year from six to seven and it is intended to increase it further to eight in the immediate future. It is also proposed that pending a re-examination of the clerical staff strength at the Department's local offices generally, clerical staff at the Tralee office will provide some help with the work-load at the Killarney office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded a contributory old age pension of £26.30 a week, i.e. the maximum rate appropriate to a married man, with effect from 17 November 1978.  The pension included an allowance of £10.25 which was the amount payable at that time in respect of his wife as an adult dependant under age 66 years.</P>
      <P>A pension order book at the rate of £26.30 payable from 15 December 1978 was issued together with a payable order for £105.20 in respect of the arrears due for the period 17 November 1978 to 14 December 1978.</P>
      <P>He subsequently claimed a higher rate of allowance in respect of his wife on the grounds that she had reached age 66 years.  He was unable to furnish a birth certificate, however, as she was born in England.  Following inquiries he furnished evidence of her age in December 1979 by way of a letter from the principal of the school which she had attended in Cork and her date of birth was accepted as 6 May 1913.</P>
      <P>A pension order book payable from 4 January 1980 in respect of the increase in the rate of the allowance for the wife issued on 14 February 1980.  A payable order for £73.10 in respect of the arrears due for the period 11 May 1979 to 3 January 1980 issued on 20 June 1980.</P>

A cheque in payment of the full amount due on the claim issued on 16 April 1980.  It was reported to my Department, however, that the cheque was not received by the claimant.  Following the necessary inquiries a replacement cheque issued on 3 June 1980.</P>

      <P>A pension order book at the pre-Budget 1980 rate of £17.70 per week, payable from 4 April 1980, was issued to the designated post office for collection by her in March 1980.  The supplementary book at the rate of £4.45 a week containing orders also payable from 4 April 1980 has now been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in the issue of the supplementary book was due to the fact that in the processing of the large number of supplementary books for more than <Col N="1691" /> 320,000 pensioners during April and May last the issue of the book to this widow was inadvertently overlooked.  I would like to thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to my attention and I regret the inconvenience caused.</P>

      <P>Her husband had been in receipt of unemployment benefit (including pay-related benefit) at the rate of £67.42 a week up to the date of his death.  In order to avoid hardship while awaiting the processing of the widow's pension claim the payment of £67.42 a week continued to be made to her for a further six weeks. She only became entitled to payment of widow's pension from the Friday following the expiration of that period, i.e. from Friday 6 June 1980.  Pension order books to the value of £60 a week, the maximum rate appropriate to a widow with five qualified children, issued to the designated post office for collection by her on that date.</P>
      <P>The widow has accordingly received payment at the rate of £67.42 a week in respect of the first six weeks after her husband's death and at the rate of £60 a week thereafter.</P>

      <P>Ireland, as a member of Eurocontrol, contributes to the investment and operating budgets of the organisation and to a special budget for Ireland.  The expenditure allocated to the operating budget relates to the cost of personnel, maintenance and operation of the central services of the organisation, etc. The expenditure allocated to the investment budget comprises the expenditure relating to the provision of new facilities such as control centres and radar stations. Expenditure under the special budgetary annex relates to work carried out exclusively for Ireland.  There are similar annexes for other states.</P>
      <P>Two factors are taken into account in determining the contributions to the operating budget, i.e. the value of the gross national products (GNP) of the member states and the value of the services rendered by the organisation to civil aircraft registered in their territories. The contributions of the member states to the investment budget are proportional to the respective values of their Gross National Products (GNP).  Expenditure under the special budgetary annex for Ireland is 100 per cent chargeable to Ireland.</P>
