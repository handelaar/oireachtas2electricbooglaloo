    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to what should be one of our fastest developing <Col N="3" /> industries, the fishing industry.  I am disappointed with the Book of Estimates. The total increase for fisheries is just around £750,000 and one-third of that increase is for wages alone.  We have about a 3 per cent increase in the money made available to the Department of Fisheries last year.</P>
      <P>There is potential for development of the fishing industry.  An investment of something in the region of £3 million could provide anything up to 400 or 500 jobs in the fishing industry in the areas where jobs are most needed, in the west, and north west and the south west areas. According to the experts the area of fisheries to be developed relates to aquaculture.  The experts maintain that if we develop the aquaculture side of fisheries over the next four or five years about one-third of our total exports totalling about £15 million could be had from that sector.</P>
      <P>Aquaculture deals with the development of salmon, trout, mussels, lobsters, oysters, clams, scallops and shellfish generally.  The experts and research laboratories all hold the view that if the Government made money available for this sector where there is unlimited potential we could develop the north west and the south west areas.  In about a quarter of our bays and estuaries local people would be willing to form co-operatives in this sort of development if they were trained and given the right financial backing, If the local people were willing to form co-operatives small business people could develop this area which has been largely ignored up to now.</P>
      <P>I was particularly disappointed that the new Minister for Fisheries did not mention one of the most improtant developments taking place here.  We are encouraging foreign companies to come in.  Yesterday there was talk about a thousand jobs coming from America and they are welcome but in this area of aquaculture we could provide jobs for about 500 people with an investment of not more than the cost of a new trawler. I appeal to the Minister of State to take note of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day I finished by talking about the price of diesel oil. Because of this increase in price many fishermen find it difficult to make a living. I said that most of the boats will have to pay between £400 and £600 extra per week for oil and this will be an insoluble problem for a lot of skippers. Since I spoke last week it came to my notice that quite a number of fishermen are finding it difficult to meet the repayments on their boats.  A total of 432 boats were grant-aided by BIM.  Over half of these people are behind in their repayments and, more seriously, about quarter of them have an arrears situation. That is a barometer whereby we can point to the Department of Fisheries and to the Minister for Finance for putting this extra price on diesel.  These fishermen should get special priority at present, otherwise we will not be talking about 432 fishermen this time next year because a lot of them will have gone to the wall.  Our neighbours across the water in Britain suddenly have brought in a new subsidy for their fishing industry of £3 million.  While Irish commercial fishermen are feeling the edge of the EEC conservation measures the British Government are bringing in this scheme whereby they are going to subsidise their industry by £3 million.  The present Irish Government instead of subsidising the fishing industry are penalising the boat-owners who are already behind in their repayments.  This is very serious indeed.</P>
      <P>The other reason is that the price of white fish has fallen dramatically in the last 12 months.  The reason that the price of fish has fallen is not that we have caught more fish but that more white fish are coming in from other countries outside the EEC.  Some of these other countries who are able to send the white fish into our markets have no limits at all.  They have 200 miles of free zoning for their country while in this country we have practically no exclusive zone for our fishermen.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might have a better opportunity during the Estimates to speak on fisheries.  The Financial Resolution is rather restricted in its scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at some length on fisheries before this under this resolution. Finally, I appeal to the Minister for Finance even at this late stage to give a rebate on the diesel oil for these fishermen the same as the British Government have given for their boats.  It seems crazy that French boats are getting subsidies to fish in Irish waters while Irish boats are being penalised by the Irish Government. The theme song of fishermen for the next couple of weeks is that they should demand from the Minister for Fisheries a total rebate to compensate for this savage increase in their costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 20p per gallon which the Government have put on petrol will affect the tourist industry dramatically. We are not talking about a 20p increase; we are talking about a 32p increase and the reason is that we have had three different increases in the price of petrol in the last couple of weeks.  When the Minister for Finance was talking about tourists in his speech he went so far as to state that he could not see how this savage increase in the price of petrol is going to affect the tourist trade.  Maybe he is not as much involved in the tourist trade as are some of us who live along the western seaboard.  I have worked out that any motoring tourist coming to this country will find that it is going to cost him about £25 per week extra just for the increase in the price of petrol alone, not taking into account the high cost in this country of restaurants and hotels or the price of drink and cigarettes.  Let us be fair about this.  Most tourists, particularly the English, Scots and Continentals, in the past came to Ireland because they got value for money.  I am very concerned that we are starting to price ourselves out of the tourist market. Last week I had a drink in a hotel in this city, whiskey and soda, which cost £1.04 and in the same place a pint of drink cost nearly 90p.  Even though the measures in <Col N="6" /> England are smaller, and the same applies in Spain and other Continental countries, we must now be one of the dearest countries as far as the prices of petrol, drink and cigarettes are concerned and also a lot of our restaurants are becoming expensive.  The reason is the high cost of living in this country.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that when the Minister was introducing his Estimates, he would not penalise the tourist sector, who had a hard, tough time last year.  A speaker on the other side of the House has stated that we reached nearly £400 million for our tourist industry last year. Sometimes I wonder where Bord Fáilte get these figures.  I would like to see a breakdown of this £400 million.  It is not easy to estimate the number of tourists coming from the North of Ireland, but I can say there are not large numbers of tourists visiting the west coast, whatever the number may be in the big hotels in the cities.  Last year was disastrous for the tourist trade.  One speaker from the far side of the House even blamed the weather.  He said that was the main cause of the drop in the number of tourists.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons is that we are starting to price ourselves out of the tourist trade.  Any tourist planning a motoring holiday is going to weigh up the cost of the petrol in a country before he decides to go there.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not help the tourist trade by some kind of subsidy such as was suggested a couple of years ago which could be operated very easily because we have only a few ports where car ferries come in.  There is no reason in the wide world why a few people, three or four perhaps, could not operate a petrol subsidy scheme which would encourage tourists to come to this country.</P>
    <P>Regarding industry, and exports, every pound that we can attract to this country through the tourist trade is in itself an export which is forgotten about by a lot of people when they are talking about the balance of payments and so on.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Finance did not have a look at the position regarding tourists who are <Col N="7" /> leaving this country to go to America and to the Continent in particular.  Surely these people are of no benefit to Ireland.  The Minister should consider if it would be possible to put a tax on people going from here on foreign holidays. I go on as many foreign holidays as anyone else does, I suppose, and if I decide to go to the sun I will not object to paying that little bit extra towards the Irish economy.  After all, I will not be spending my money then in this country, I will be spending it outside.  Usually we have to change our money into sterling. The poor rate of exchange of the punt with the pound is very serious.  On the one hand we must change our money into sterling and on the other, we spend our Irish currency in foreign countries. The Minister is dealing a harsh blow to the tourist trade.  Last year we had the telephone and postal strikes and the severe shortage of petrol and then, at the end of August, we had the Mountbatten murder.  All those factors, plus, to a slight degree, the weather, caused terrible problems, particularly in the large guest houses and small hotels, to the people who are relying entirely on the summer trade.  I know, from talking to these people, that, unless they have a good couple of years' trade from now on, for many of the bed and breakfast establishments and small hotels the bells are being sounded, because the Government have no interest, particularly so far as the tourist trade in the west of Ireland is concerned, which is very serious.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are not making enough grants available.  A hotel applying to them for a grant could be waiting two years before they know whether the grant will be available or not and Bord Fáilte's reason for not giving grants is that the Government have not made the necessary allocation of money.  I should like confirmation on this point from some Minister.  Is it a fact that many smaller hotels are not being passed for grants?  My information is that Bord Fáilte have not received the necessary money from the Government.  I know of some hoteliers who are waiting to do <Col N="8" /> small extensions and are afraid to go ahead with the work for fear that they will get no grant.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the problem of giving value for money and of encouraging people from abroad to come here.  The Minister for the Environment should have a look at the policy regarding the anti-litter campaign.  When we go abroad, the one thing that strikes us on our return is that so much of our environment is polluted&mdash;and that is the correct word to use&mdash;with litter of different kinds.  We are not, by nature, a tidy race and people should be encouraged to keep our beautiful country unpolluted.</P>
    <P>Another, problem affecting the tourist trade concerns the troubles in our country over the last 11 years.  Cardinal Ó Fiach, when speaking on 17 March, appealed for an end to the troubles, as we all do.  One section of the community affected more than any other is the tourist section.  Leaving aside high prices, certainly as far as the English tourist is concerned, many of these are still afraid to come here for holidays until the troubles cease.  Let us make an appeal to all sides to try to get together.  These troubles are not benefiting anybody and are sending people futher apart.  We now have new church leaders on all sides; we have a new Cardinal in the Catholic Church a new Presbyterian Moderator, a new head of the Church of Ireland and of the Methodist Church.  They should try to get together and appeal to those on both sides using violence to come together and stop these drastic things which are happening in the name of Irishmen.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to have a further look at how the tourist trade can be developed properly.  I am not satisfied that Bord Fáilte are doing everything they should be doing.  I am not satisfied that the Government are giving Bord Fáilte enough money to do what they intend to do.  In this industry, as in the fishing industry, there is plenty of room for development.</P>
    <P>Last week, a speech was made on the other side of the House blaming the banks for the credit squeeze taking place <Col N="9" /> in Ireland at present.  Fianna Fáil blame everybody but themselves for this tightening of bank credit.  It is only right to point out that if the Central Bank have issued their guidelines and if the public sector, the Government sector, use up more than their fair share of capital, the Central Bank must put a limit on the private sector, which is what has happened.  Anyone in banking and anyone looking for loans realises that the banks put an increased guideline of 18 per cent on lending money last year. What was not taken into consideration was that, at the same time, there was a 16 per cent inflation rate.  This meant that the ordinary sector&mdash;the business people looking for loans, hoteliers looking for loans, people looking for loans to build houses, even people looking for loans for a couple of months to tide them over until the county council passed money into their hands&mdash;could not get loans and have not been getting loans over the last 6 or 8 months.  We now have a critical situation here.  No matter how good one's credit standing with the banks, the banks cannot lend money because they have none to lend in the private sector.  I understand that the banks guidelines this year are being cut from 18 per cent to 13 per cent.  It is also, even now, estimated&mdash;and even those on the Government side of the House are beginning to realise&mdash;that the inflation rate in 1980 will be something in excess of, or around about, 20 per cent.  With the cut-back to 13 per cent, the banks will have to cut back on 7 per cent of their loans this year and we have seen nothing yet as far as the credit squeeze is concerned.  It must be said loud and clear, that there is no point in Fianna Fáil putting the blame on the banks.  We must blame the Government for overspending in the last couple of years.  Everybody is now being asked to pay for his mistakes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>People living in rural areas are very worried indeed with the punt's falling value, particularly in the last <Col N="10" /> week.  It is very nearly at an all-time low today&mdash;89p against the £ sterling.  It was stated by an economist recently that the English economy is anything but sound. That being the case, it gives great cause for concern for our economy.</P>
      <P>As regards social welfare, we all welcome the increase of 20 to 25 per cent.  We are now concerned that the inflation rate will be over 20 per cent and that those getting massive increases will be worse off at the end of the year than they are at present.</P>
      <P>As far as the small farmers' assistance scheme is concerned it is not publicly known that no increase has been given to farmers living in the west of Ireland.  In the past farmers with ten or 12 acres who were married and had a family were entitled to sign on at their local office and get assistance&mdash;that is the word because they could not live otherwise&mdash;to their income.  They will have no increase in 1980.  Under the assessment scheme their stock, sheep, hens or pigs will be taken into consideration and revalued.  This is wrong.  The assistance scheme encouraged small farmers to produce more but this scheme will encourage them to produce and keep less because the less they have the more the Government will give them.  There used to be a slogan &ldquo;To hell or to Connaught&rdquo; but the slogan as far as the assistance scheme is concerned is to hell with the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is very little money available for sewerage schemes.  The Government have not made them one of their priorities even though there are villages and small towns with no such facilities. Our friends from the EEC would not believe that there are still no such facilities in some villages and towns in modern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking about one budget but about a budget a day since 1980 began.  The Government did away with re-construction grants, central heating grants, increased the price of practically everything since the beginning of the year&mdash;ESB charges by 20 per cent, gas and food.  As regards bridging loans, <Col N="11" /> there is no money for anybody wanting to build a house because of the credit squeeze, because of the way Fianna Fáil spent money in the past few years.  This budget is not a good one, especially for people living away from Dublin.  It is penal on them.  It is only as weeks go by that it will sink in how hard the budget affects the ordinary person in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one paragraph in the Minister for Finance's speech on the budget which sums it up and that is:</P>
      <P>This is a realistic budget, which recognises that a significant start has to be made on resolving the problems we face.  I believe it will help to point the direction which all of us can follow&mdash;benefits for the needy, opportunity for the able and a conscientious dedication at work for all.</P>
      <P>That sums up the budget which has been very well received.  Even the Opposition have failed to put forward any serious criticism of it.  We know that substantial progress has been made in a number of areas particularly in that of income tax. The concessions given there are greatly appreciated by the general body of workers, so too are the increases in social welfare.  We have seen increases of 20 per cent and 25 per cent across the board.  This is the biggest increase ever given by any Government to recipients of social welfare.  I am happy to see this happen because we know that these people are relying on the Government for help.  They do not have pressure groups to fight their case.  They have no unions or associations as other have.  It is only right that the Government help these people to give them a reasonable standard of living in their later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget will not satisfy all the conflicting demands but the Minister has tried to strike a realistic balance between them.  In the area of job creation the Government are determined to strive ahead and achieve their target of 30,000 <Col N="12" /> new jobs in 1980.  The State's investment in industrial promotion has been increased by £30 million this year and the bulk of this money is being made available to the IDA for the purpose of creating new jobs.  We know that since we have such a very young population it is the duty of the Government to make every possible effort to provide jobs for them at home.  I am very proud of the record of the Government in that regard. The hope and confidence given to young people over the past few years is evident. Job opportunities are there and hopefully the Government will continue to try to find the jobs so necessary to give our young population an opportunity to work in their own country.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism on the efforts he made in the United States to get industrialists to invest here.  I was happy to hear his announcement of the number of new jobs that are coming here over the next year or two.  This is the type of work the Government must be involved in and I am glad that they are achieving considerable success in that area.</P>
    <P>Tourism has been mentioned many times during the course of the debate. We all know that it is a very important industry.  I do not think the increases imposed on petrol will seriously affect the industry.  Nobody planning to spend a holiday here will be put off by the increase in the price of petrol.  It will only mean a few pounds extra in the cost of the holiday.  Prices here compare very favourably with other countries. Anybody who travels abroad knows that this is the case.  The increase in petrol and oil prices may also encourage people to conserve energy.  We are all aware that there is a lot of unnecessary waste in this area, waste of a commodity that has become very expensive and difficult to find.  Because of our industrial developments in the last few years we are using more and more of this commodity which has become the soul of the earth and so difficult to find.  We are aware also that the demands will increase and that, unfortunately, our Government have very <Col N="13" /> little say on the prices being charged. Therefore it might be a good thing were we to devote more of our time to endeavouring to conserve that energy and make as much use of it as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>This budget rightly places emphasis on bringing more order into the State's finances.  The level of external borrowing had become a matter of serious concern and immediate action was required.  Any budget has to deal with conflicting objectives and interests.  The Minister for Finance has managed to maintain the correct balance between competing objectives. There was urgent need to bring a greater degree of fairness into the taxation system.  We had to deal with the problem of foreign borrowing.  At the same time there is the overriding necessity to preserve the right atmosphere for economic growth.  This budget deals comprehensively with these requirements.</P>
    <P>My concern relates to agriculture and I should like to confine my remarks to that area, particularly in so far as it relates to the western counties.  It has been claimed that the level of expenditure on agriculture has been curtailed and indeed, that this sector has been victimised. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  The combined Estimates for Agriculture and Lands have been increased from £197 million in 1979 to £205 million in 1980.  The position is that, when account is taken of receipts from FEOGA, more money than ever is being poured into the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Government is to ensure the right environment for development. The Minister for Agriculture has already indicated his determination to negotiate the best deal possible in Brussels.  Nobody can be in any doubt about his position on the anti-surplus proposals and especially on the super levy.  We regard the role of the individual farmer as crucial to the future development of agriculture.  Our policy is to give every possible encouragement to improvements at farm level.  The farm modernisation scheme provides generous <Col N="14" /> grants for farmers wishing to improve their holdings.  I was amazed to hear allegations that grants under this scheme will be curtailed during 1980.  There is no basis whatsoever for these allegations. We are providing £36,500,000 under the farm modernisation and western drainage schemes.  Any farmer who embarks on farm improvement works, with the normal prior approval, can be sure that he will receive the appropriate grant assistance.  Any suggestions to the contrary are mischievous and misleading and, I regret to say, show a total disregard for the best interests of agriculture.  Progress under the farm modernisation scheme has been satisfactory. There are now over 90,000 farmers participating and, since its introduction, over £93 million have been paid out in grant aid.  The farm improvements involved represent an investment of £280 million.  These figures speak for themselves and show confidence on the part of farmers in the future of agriculture. There are, of course, certain areas that could be improved and the appropriate directive is currently under review at EEC level.  We are seeking greater flexibility in the scheme to make it more suitable for Irish conditions.  In particular, we are anxious to have the development category extended and I hope the eventual outcome will be a better scheme for Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>The western drainage scheme is an excellent example of the Government's concern for the west.  Our target is to drain over 100,000 acres and so far the response to this scheme has been overwhelming.  Over 26,000 applications have been received and these are being processed with the utmost haste.  I have no doubt that we will reach the target within the specified time limit of five years.  I am confident also that this scheme will have a dramatic effect on the standard of farming in the west, that it will generate more productive land, a basic requirement for improvement in output and efficiency.</P>
    <P>Farmers in western counties also receive direct assistance through the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I consider <Col N="15" /> that this scheme is of considerable benefit to areas with structural problems and helps supplement the incomes of smallholders.  One of the questions which I know concerns some Deputies on both sides of the House is the revision of the boundaries for this scheme.  Shortly after assuming office this Government instituted a detailed and thorough-going review of these boundaries.  This review was completed over a year ago and a submission was made to the EEC Commission in February 1979 setting out certain proposals for changes in the boundaries in Ireland.  Since then detailed discussions have been held on a number of occasions between officials of the Department of Agriculture and of the Commission.</P>
    <P>A substantial volume of supplementary information on the submission has been supplied at the request of the Commission. While the matter is still being discussed with the Commission I do not wish to prejudice the outcome by referring to any particular areas but it would be no harm to attempt to clarify the present position.  The EEC Commission has recently proposed that, as part of the present structures package, member states be allowed to extend the limits of their disadvantaged areas subject to certain conditions.  In the first place, extensions will be allowed, when the amendment goes through, by up to 1½ per cent of the total agricultural area of the state rather than by ½ per cent as at present. In the second place they will still have to meet the criteria laid down in the directive. Any change would have to be agreed by the Commission and by the permanent committee on agricultural structures before coming into operation. We understand that there is a considerable amount of support for this amendment to the basic directive, 268 of 1975.  However, the amendment is dependent now on the structures package itself being finally resolved.  The Minister for Agriculture has been pressing very strongly for this matter to be treated as one of urgency and I am hopeful that the Council will be able to <Col N="16" /> reach agreement in the matter in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these schemes because, regardless of what the Opposition may say, the Government are providing extensive and valuable aid to farmers.  The schemes I have mentioned and the response to them are evidence of what the Government are doing in this area.  There has been an allegation that there is a crisis of confidence in agriculture but this allegation is based more on rumour than on fact.</P>
    <P>A facet of the work of the Land Commission on which particular emphasis has been placed in recent years is the division of commonages.  As Deputies are aware, the bulk of the lands held in common are in counties that are adjacent to the western seaboard where, generally, holdings are below viable standards and off-farm employment is scarce.  While there are not available precise figures for land so held it has been estimated that commonages account for something of the order of 500,000 hectares of which possibly 30 per cent would have potential for substantial agricultural development but this potential cannot be realised fully while the land is held in undivided shares.  On the other hand, if the commonages are divided into individual plots and each farmers co-owner given his own portion, the extra area could in many cases be a valuable adjunct to the smallholder.</P>
    <P>Obviously, not all commonages are suitable for division.  Agricultural potential, high development costs and difficulty in regard to lay-out are factors which often militate against division but there are many commonages which are very suitable for division and where such division would result in doubling the carrying capacity of the holdings concerned. Since 1971 the Land Commission have divided 191 commonages comprising 15,000 hectares approximately.  This is an undoubted contribution to agricultural production and is indicative of what can be achieved if commonage owners are prepared to co-operate with each other and with the Land Commission. It is the intention of the Land Commission <Col N="17" /> to accelerate commonage division. Towards this end, additional Land Commission inspectors are being recruited for those areas in which the commonage problems are most acute.  I need hardly remind western Deputies in particular that co-operation is the name of the game and that without the goodwill of commonage shareholders this new initiative by the Land Commission cannot be expected to produce a worth-while result.</P>
    <P>The Government are providing incentives to western farmers by way of various schemes, to develop their holdings and to improve their incomes. Such benefits should be taken into account when considering the decision of the Government to maintain the rates of unemployment assistance to small holders who opt for the notional system of assessment of income at their October 1979 level.  This means that the small-holders concerned will retain the value of the temporary increase in grants in accordance with the national understanding.  It cannot be denied that farmers' incomes, including the incomes of western farmers, have increased greatly in the past few years.  I am aware that there was a temporary setback in incomes last year but I am confident that with the incentives available and having regard to the conditions created as a result of Government policies, farm incomes will increase again.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that, generally speaking, assessment on the notional system does not reflect true incomes.  For example, under the notional system and with the present multiplier, a farmer with a £5 rateable valuation is assessed as having an income of less tha £3 a week.  Of the 21,000 smallholders approximately who are drawing the unemployment assistance, 18,000 are assessed on the notional system.  It will be open to those people to decide to have their incomes assessed on a factual basis if they so wish.  I should point out also that the multiplier in respect of valuations of £10 or less has been increased only once since 1966, that was from £20 to £30 for each £1 of land valuation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> The most important point in this matter relates to the income supplements paid to farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  These supplements are paid under the various headage schemes.  By way of an amendment made to these schemes we are trying to ensure that the benefits from them will accrue to those farmers who need them most.</P>
    <P>Another development which is most welcome to all in the west is the development by Bord na Móna of Doire Fadda bog.  There are about 12,000 acres of bog involved and the proposal of the board to erect a briquette factory near Ballyforan is a logical development.  This will provide employment for 660 people when in full production.  The location of the factory in that area will create badly needed employment and will give to many an opportunity to acquire new skills.  It will provide an opportunity also for the establishment of allied industries and services in this area which for so many years in the past suffered from the haemorrhage of emigration.  It gives new hope to young people who at last see an opportunity of employment in their own locality.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that a subcommittee of the central development committee have been investigating the prospects for increasing turf production in the western still at about 13 per cent of GNP&mdash;how ted the report of the subcommittee.  Shortly, the report will be submitted to the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>I have touched briefly on some of those areas in which I consider the Government's policies to be geared towards the creation of conditions for the development and future progress of agriculture in the western regions.  Farmers can be assured that both the Minister and I appreciate the difficulties confronting farmers in the area. However, I am sure they will appreciate that by way of the schemes geared especially to the needs of farmers in the west and by way of general Government policy, every opportunity possible is being given to the progressive farmer to develop his holding, to improve his income <Col N="19" /> and, consequently, to benefit both the region and the country generally.</P>
    <P>This budget is a major contribution towards the economic development of the country.  Opportunities for new jobs, for the advancement of the health services, for the building of additional houses for our young people and for additional facilities for them are provided for in this budget, and it will go down in history as a major breakthrough, one of the best budgets ever introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to try, if it is possible, to dispel the image that regrettfully has been created that somehow or other this is the first budget of this administration.  That is not the case.  This is the third budget of this administration, of which Deputy Hussey has been a continuous member since 1977.  To look at it in the pretence that it heralds the advent of a new administration is to give substance to the cleverly promulgated misconception that has been foisted on the community since the change of leaders in the Fianna Fáil Party before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I was not here when the Minister for Finance delivered the budget speech last month, but I read and perhaps saw more clearly the contents of his speech.  The first phrase in that speech would be comical if it were not tragic:</P>
      <P>Prudent management of the public finances and improving the climate for economic development are normal priorities for a Minister for Finance....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that prudent management of public finances has not been a normal priority for major political parties when drawing up manifestos, because there is no relationship between the kind of sanctimonious micawber economics that permeate this budget speech and the manifesto that unfortunately was bought by the people, or perhaps they were bought by it, in June 1977.  The speech is full of assertions which do not stand the test of any critical analysis.  For example, on page 8 of the published version, dealing <Col N="20" /> with the economy in 1979, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Obviously there has been a complete change of circumstances compared with the situation as it appeared this time last year.  Nobody foresaw then the massive oil price increases that were to come later in the year, with their attendant problems.</P>
    <P>Since 1973 every serious economic specialist has been stating continuously in any journal one cares to read that energy prices would undoubtedly be increased. But this Government which published, and repudiated on 11 January 1980, the fourth instalment in a series of White Papers, made specific reference to energy and again told the community who went through the 1973 recession because of the then unprecedented energy price increases:</P>
    <P>Since the White Paper was finalised, the international outlook and the domestic situation have worsened, particularly in relation to the price and availability of energy.  These will have an adverse effect on the prospects for the Irish economy and the various assumptions and expectations outlined in the White Paper, and will need to be reassessed in the light of these developments.  This will be one of the main tasks of the Government in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Embodied in that statement, which was contained in the preface to the White Paper, is the stamp of the new Taoiseach.  The opening statement in the budget speech is a callous attempt to hide behind the previous two years of Fianna Fáil attempts to make capitalism work in this country by throwing money at it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey never believed that the budget strategy of Deputy O'Donoghue or Deputy Colley would actually work.  In reply to a criticism I made of the 1978 budget&mdash;a budget that was supposed to transform the face of the Irish economy, that would put thousands of young people to work in a way the Coalition Government had manifestly failed to do, provided the <Col N="21" /> economy would respond to the exhortations to it&mdash;the Minister for Health and Social Welfare at that time said of my contribution:</P>
    <P>His contribution was entirely constructive. I do not agree with his general approach to the budget, but I recognise that Deputy Quinn has attacked head-on the budget and the thinking behind the budget.  The Deputy has set out to make what is probably the only valid argument that can be made against the budget, that is, that it is over-reliant on private enterprise. The Deputy's arguments in that regard are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I had criticised the budget on the basis that it was naive to expect the private sector to produce the jobs expected of it, and I quoted the chairman of a major private company who had refused to accept responsibility for producing the jobs the Government thought the private sector would produce.</P>
    <P>It does not give me any great pleasure now to be able to say that the private sector has not produced the jobs expected of it.  In a desperate attempt to make the employment figures promised in the manifesto stand up&mdash;we do not hear so much about them these days&mdash;the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development, we presume with the support of the entire Cabinet, transferred a lot of resources into the public sector in service jobs in order to maintain employment levels at something approaching the targets in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>Three years afterwards, in this third budget, we had a speech which abandoned all of the optimism of the first budget, all of the implicit promises in the manifesto, and now frankly and clearly the budget recognises that the best we can do in 1980 is to try to take some of the sting from the irrationalities of capital.  This budget speech makes interesting reading if it is compared with what was said on the hustings in 1977. For instance, at page 12 of his published speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> We cannot ask the taxpayer of tomorrow to pay for the services we require today.  This would be socially unfair and economically irresponsible.</P>
    <P>If we look at the national debt&mdash;it is still at about 13 per cent of GNP&mdash;how can they justify the abolition of car tax in a country where half the population are not old enough to drive?  Is that not asking the taxpayer of tomorrow to pay for the services of today?  A little later in his speech on the third Fianna Fáil budget the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Government subventions should be paid only to those who need them and should be designed to achieve the maximum economic and social benefits.</P>
    <P>How do you reconcile that phrase with the Fianna Fáil cheers that followed the announcement of the abolition of wealth tax three years ago?  This budget is not a new departure for an alleged new Fianna Fáil administration.  It is a recognition of the implicit failure of the first three years of Fianna Fáil's economic strategy and a confirmation of the correctness, as perceived by the now Taoiseach, in abolishing the Department of Economic Planning and Development and despatching with it the Minister who held that post.</P>
    <P>To a generation of Irish people who had come through a particularly difficult recession which had stopped the continuous growth of western economies which had continued more or less unimpeded since 1945, a generation who from 1973 to 1977 had to live with a particularly difficult and expensive security problem on both sides of the Border, the Fianna Fáil Government, when they came into office attempted to say that, in implementing this manifesto, somehow they could make capitalism work for the benefit of all, that somehow because of their experience and expertise gained over many years they could provide the full employment that no other capitalist economy has ever provided, that somehow because they had the doctrines of economic expertise they could reduce inflation in an open economy irrespective <Col N="23" /> of what happened to commodity prices in the world; that somehow they could produce jobs from the private sector despite the fact that the private sector itself repeatedly disclaimed responsibility for the provision of those jobs; that somehow by throwing money up into the air&mdash;borrowed taxpayers' money&mdash; some or most of it would land in such a way as to produce secure employment for the children of this nation and their children's children.</P>
    <P>Labour Party members are frequently described as dogmatic idealists who insist on pursuing a particular philosophy which is out of date and old-fashioned, as rigid in their thinking and hung up on fixed ideas, but I should like Deputy Hussey, Minister of State who has acquitted himself well in his own Department, to go into any school in his east Galway constituency and explain to the pupils in terms of 1980&mdash;20 years from the end of the twentieth century&mdash;how it is that he and his party support an economic system that has hundreds of people without homes and thousands of construction workers without jobs; how his party support this system that has many acres of land either unutilised or under-utilised and many young farmers without land to farm; how many old people or children of poor families are either under-nourished or suffer from serious forms of malnutrition&mdash;yet, the EEC proposes to tax farmers for producing too much milk&mdash;how it is that the road system of the country is totally inadequate to carry the traffic on it despite the fact that we have the materials and the labour to make roads.</P>
    <P>It is not for the Labour Party to defend its philosophical approach to solving human problems; it is for people like Deputy Hussey, Minister of State and his colleagues on the Government benches to explain to the present generation of Irish children why it is that Fianna Fáil continues to support such an irrational system and why it continues to spend, even in advance of it being earned, the tax of the young people to pay for the profligate policies of the past two years of this Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> There are numerous examples of a party which would pride itself in being a reasonably good capitalist party distorting and over-heating the capitalist market itself with taxpayers' money to the disadvantage of those people which it purported to help.  The most drastic example&mdash;and it runs right through the system&mdash;was the announcement on 20 May 1977 in the Fianna Fáil manifesto of the £1,000 house grant which was confirmed on 6 July and the procedures for its delivery simplified so that it would not become payable until the house was actually completed.</P>
    <P>In reply to questions here from myself and others the Minister for the Environment conceded that by the time the first £1,000 house grant had been paid the price of housing in that quarter from July to October had risen by £1,004. The continual increases in income limits and sums that can be borrowed have simply chased, in many cases, the prices of land and housing.  The Minister can correct me and statistically stand on the Government side of the House and point out the amount of money spent by this administration, but in order to balance the books properly he must also talk about the doubling of inflation in the same period and the incredible increases in the cost of certain basic commodities. Rather than being a budget which redistributes in any serious way the wealth of the nation, this budget marginally compensates sections of the community who have been victims of the Government's economic policy over the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>Throughout the entire budget speech of the Minister for Finance there is an explicit rejection of the expansionist, naive belief which Deputy Dr. O'Donoghue expressed and which Deputy Colley as Minister for Finance implemented and which all the 83 Fianna Fáil Deputies applauded from the Government benches in 1977.  There was massive borrowing, a massive injection of capital in 1977 into an economy which every commentator recognised at that time had come through the worst and was already in a very healthy state. <Col N="25" /> Three years later the same party that delivered endless goodies in the form of tax concessions and confetti money tells the nation in the Minister's budget speech:</P>
    <P>I am sure that our people now accept that we cannot continue to live beyond our means, nor to award ourselves increases in incomes which are not accompanied by an increased margin of productivity to guarantee the competitiveness of output at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not recall that particular expression being attached to the abolition of the wealth tax or stitched into the manifesto beneath the section promising the abolition of car tax and the abolition of rates. Who are living beyond their means and not paying their way?  Where is the productivity implicit in this budget?  The Government have made a number of concessions to different sections of the community which appear on the surface to be attractive and to show the generosity within Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There has been no serious critical analysis by the Government of the impact of the budget concessions in relation to personal income tax and the real purchasing power of social welfare recipients.  Such an analysis has been done by Paul Tansey and others in the national press and I am sure this has already been put on the record of the House.  It is clearly indicated that to a large extent the budget provisions are a matter of robbing Peter to pay Paul and the real level of income tax take-out from the economy will be marginally increased having regard to the rate of inflation which will occur this year.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party draw their support from across the nation from many different sectors of the community in a tradition that goes back over the best part of 40 years.  Their twin aims are the unification of Ireland and the restoration of the Irish language, aims in which they have been manifestly unsuccessful.  Their third aim has been the development of the economy and they have used virtually every kind of economic policy and <Col N="26" /> device ranging from simplistic Sinn Féin isolationist development to the open-market Keynesian approach of Deputy O'Donoghue.  By any objective standard of measurement, either in terms of employment or social justice, they have failed.  This budget recognises the specific failure of the past two years of Government policy and the determination to replace the Government of an expansionist economist with the Government of a cautious accountant.  That is what we have in this budget.</P>
    <P>There is another way to develop our economy which does not rely on the hope that somebody in the private sector will be a bit more encouraged than last year and will provide a few extra jobs this year.  There is another way where we do not have to rely on anonymous private house builders hopefully responding to market forces and perhaps producing houses cheap enough for people to buy with the aid of building society or SDA loans.  We do not have to hope that this time the combination of corporation tax and the credit guidelines issued by the Central Bank will bring the banks to recognise their responsibilities and channel the savings of the nation into those areas that would be most productive either in terms of employment or wealth creation.</P>
    <P>The economic policy and budget strategy of the Government are akin to a person like me, who knows little about agriculture, going into a field, throwing down seeds, getting down on my knees and saying &ldquo;Please let the grass grow&rdquo;. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hussey, would approach the matter rationally.  He would analyse the soil, buy the best seed, know the cycle of climate and apply fertiliser when required.  He would have a plan of production for that field and we would not see him on his knees praying to the skies and hoping that this year would be a little better than last year and the soil would be a bit more productive. Yet that is the level of the logic of economic development implicit in the policy of this Government; give money to the IDA in the hope that they will get <Col N="27" /> jobs since they got so many jobs last year.  Where we are going to put them or what sort of jobs they are to be we are not quite sure.  They give money to this or that sector in the hope that something will come out of it.</P>
    <P>There is no underlying plan of production or approach which recognises that a particular section of the economy has the capacity to grow and will require an input of capital or expertise.  If there are dogmatists or ideologues represented in this Parliament, they sit on the Government benches.  They have never adequately defended intellectually the system of capitalism which they prop up and support with taxpayers' money, yet there is constant defence for the repeated failures of capitalism.</P>
    <P>Writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 February 1980, Paul Tansey stated:</P>
    <P>While the PAYE taxpayer finds himself lumbered with an ever-increasing tax burden, Ireland's major banks and financial institutions enjoyed a dramatic decline in their effective tax rates in 1979.</P>
    <P>In the financial year ended March, 1979, the country's biggest bank, the Bank of Ireland, paid only £3.3 million in current tax on a pre-tax profit of almost £47 million.  Trying harder, the country's second-biggest bank, Allied Irish, managed to reduce its current tax liability to a mere £600,000 on pre-tax profits of £41 million in the same financial year. These represent effective current tax rates of 7 per cent and 1½ per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State reckon that the banks are responsible institutions responding to the needs and wishes of the democratically elected Government and the desires and aspirations of the Irish people?  If they do not pay tax then it must be paid by the Minister and by me and also by the farmers and the self-employed. Who gets these profits?  To whom do they belong?  With whose money are they made?  They are made with the community's money and they <Col N="28" /> are not being channelled back into the community on terms or in directions which the community can control. Money which is lodged with any of the major banks is manipulated with considerable managerial and administrative skill to evade or reduce tax liability where possible.  For whose benefit?  Certainly not for my benefit or that of any other current account holder in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>Yet we are denounced as dogmatists if we suggest that the banks might be taken over or that the control of their credit policy could be more directly taken into account in national economic planning and development.  We are accused of attacking the interests of private property if we suggest that the banks should be owned by the people who bank their money with them.  The people who accuse us are good, solid Deputies on the other side of the House who say we are attacking the interests of the people. Whose interests are served by that kind of evasion?  Any Deputy who participated in or saw the taxpayers' marches during the past year recognised quite clearly the growing cleavage between those who own and control wealth and those who produce it.  The running contradiction in this budget which continues the contradiction in the two previous budgets is that somehow or other a mythical group of people, a minority of entrepreneurs, given the right incentives and encouragement and unshackled from unnecessary social considerations, will produce the necessary wealth, provided the rest of us accept wage restraint and do not ask for so much.</P>
    <P>What kind of republican philosophy is it that after 50 years of independence and getting rid of the minority of people who control the majority, they can suddenly turn around and say to an elite minority: &ldquo;Our entire destiny is in your hands. How much incentive do you need from the taxpayers in order to produce?&rdquo; That is the level of rationality implicit in the economic development of Fianna Fáil.  There is not one iota of <Col N="29" /> republican sentiment in it that would suggest that only the companies which involve the workers in their enterprise and in participation in investment decisions would benefit from the 10 per cent tax levels in 1980.  There is no suggestion that the workers who are expected to exercise wage restraint&mdash;we will now be looking for another year of industrial peace and wage restraint&mdash;in either the speech of the Minister of State today or in the budget speech that those people who are the wealth producers, who are expected to agree to a reduction in their standard of living, might be entitled to see the accounts of those enterprises in which they work and to have any say in the investment decisions that will be made with their profits.  If they postpone or reduce the wages taken out from those companies the profits will be that much larger.  If that is republicanism according to Fianna Fáil it is a long way from Wolfe Tone, Fintan Lalor and John Mitchel.  It is much more republicanism according to Richard Nixon and much closer to republicanism according to John Connally in the United States.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the Government who are now asking for wage restraint and industrial peace have offered absolutely nothing in terms of participation or involvement to the industrial work force or the agricultural work force?  There is no mention of this in the budget speech. There is a hope that somehow or other things will be kept together, that people will be well behaved and that we will have a year of industrial peace in 1980. The year 1980 could not be as bad as the year 1979.  In fact, no year could be as bad as 1979.  In relation to the Lemass tactics and the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> early in the sixties, if you set your targets extremely low so that they will inevitably be reached in the first place, as was the case in relation to that plan, you can at the end of the year congratulate yourself on having reached your targets.  The only way we will get industrial peace this year is if the Government as an employer do not repeat the outrageous performance they carried on last year in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and if the Government <Col N="30" /> as an employer in the State sector pursue the policy of participation and consultation that was initiated by the previous Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary.  Fianna Fáil were not opposed to the measures for worker participation which were a very initial, tentative step initiated by the previous Government yet the Minister for Labour and the Fianna Fáil Government have been remarkably quiet in relation to labour relations in terms of actually involving people in the process of wealth production and wealth management, which is what our economy should be about.</P>
    <P>The budget represents a stalling of the Government's economic strategy and the hope that somehow or other things will be kept reasonably quiet for the next year, that the economy will not get worse.  It certainly holds out no prospect of the economy getting significantly better. The great optimism of the manifesto has disappeared.  The phraseology, the figures and the assertions about employment have disappeared.  The commitments which were given so eagerly by every Fianna Fáil Deputy from every platform in every town and village have disappeared.  Many of the things which were promised are not even mentioned now despite this being a researched plan from the think-tank.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil said in the manifesto that a lot of money would be spent to help to boost production and employment.  They also proposed a campaign to &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; which would switch 2p in the pound from imports to home products.  They said this would be made work, that Fianna Fáil knew how to do it and they would call on the natural patriotism in the country.  Our natural patriotism could not wait to buy Japanese imports. Our natural patriotism, fuelled by the inflation of Fianna Fáil, probably created more jobs in Korea and Taiwan than it did here.  Fianna Fáil were told at that time that that would be the case.  In opposing Senator Justin Keating, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce in the previous Government, Fianna Fáil promised the devil and all in terms of natural resources.  They stated in their <Col N="31" /> manifesto that the State should retain control of the conversion processes of minerals, oil, gas and so forth to ensure that they are used here to the maximum benefit.  They also said that a State owned smelter could be established here for £40 million and that £10 million of this could further the equity capital.</P>
    <P>We would not disagree with this. Some of the capital which has been thrown away and some of the capital which has been given back to the owners of wealth in the country could be used for that purpose.  What has been the most significant investment decision the Government have made with my money, your money and the money of every Deputy in the House?  They have bought into a private exploration company whose most significant characteristic is the political allegiance of the directors of that company.  That is a long cry from developing the natural resources of our economy in a planned and comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil promised us that the public sector of our economy, which is an enormous component of the economy, would benefit from a national industrial consortium, which would coordinate the productive capacity of the public sector.  We have not heard anything about that.  We are, instead, using millions of pounds of the taxpayers money to attract more and more foreign-owned and foreign-controlled industry into the country which will provide us with jobs.</P>
    <P>There was another generation of people who came to this country, some of them invited and some of them not invited, who provided Irish people with jobs.  We built walls around country estates for sixpence a day.  We were provided with jobs and if we reduce ourselves again to the level of begging anyone to come and provide employment without any rational plan behind it, without any control of the way in which we want these jobs to develop and without any recognition of the potential spin off that such employment might <Col N="32" /> create, we will be reducing ourselves once again to the level of wall builders and road builders which was the status to which we were reduced by another group of entrepreneurs in 1841.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are quite happy to see the IDA attract foreign industry provided the percentage of employment so created relates to an overall economic plan.  We do not have such a plan.  The Labour Party do not see the logic of, on the one hand, giving enormous capital inducements to these companies to come here to exploit our technologically trained labour force and, at the same time, financing the education of engineers to emigrate to work in the head offices in Pittsburg, London or France.  Because whilst we are seeing the assembly plants of the multi-national corporations being established in this country, we are not seeing the research and development units of these companies being established here and we are not getting an opportunity to control or own a part of the technology information and expertise that these companies have.  It is only the State sector here, properly invested and capitalised from within our own resources, some of which could come from the banks who are so shy about paying corporation tax, that would enable us to develop technological expertise suited to our own economic development requirements and which we will own.  Let us have no doubt about it. If we continue to opt out of controlling a proportion or a significant part of the technological expertise that belong to the western world we will reduce ourselves to a totally dependent status in relation to those other economies.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion in this budget, although it was implied in the manifesto, that after three years of being in office, after three years of managing the economy&mdash;initially in a period of boom and latterly in a period of energy price instability&mdash;this republican Government has the slightest intention of doing anything like this.  One cannot help but observe that the energies of this Government have, for the last nine months, gone into a leadership struggle to the detriment, <Col N="33" /> first and foremost, of our presidency of the EEC and secondly the development of a long-term economic strategy for the country.</P>
    <P>The various budget provisions, which seen on their own can be presented in a favourable light provided one leaves out of account the rate of inflation, must be looked at in the context of overall economic policy for the next year and for the next three or four years.  If taken on that basis&mdash;and any budget must be taken on that basis&mdash;this budget marks the end of Fianna Fáil's naive belief that they alone can make capitalism work in an open western economy.  There is no such rash assertion contained in the pages of the Minister's speech in anything like the way his predecessor, the Tánaiste, Deputy Colley, so confidently asserted in the first and second budgets of this Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would ask incoming Fianna Fáil TDs whose speeches have not yet been completed and who rise from the Government benches as the pragmatic politicians that they frequently pride themselves on being, to explain to me and to this House why it is that they defend a system of economic development that rests so much more on hope than on reality and depends so much more on faith than on reason. They are the real dogmatic idealists of this House, the people who are hooked on the idea of capitalism as a natural course of economic development, the people who have claimed consistently that they can make it work.  If they would look and read through the manifesto that they so eloquently and professionally carried around the country in May 1977 and read the very explicit promises in it and the follow up of the various programmes for national development published by their Government, and compare that with the reality now, the two simply cannot be matched.  It is not for us to defend what we purport as an alternative way because that at least has never been tried and could, when tried, be found wanting in many respects.  But they are defending a way of economic development that is under-pinned by this budget.  It is for <Col N="34" /> them to reconcile the reality with the claims implicit in the budget speech and in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>This budget holds out no hope for a serious development and creation of wealth in our economy on behalf of all the people.  It says nothing to those people who produce wealth in the home in the form of a secure and emotionally satisfying environment, to those people who produce it from the sea or from the land or from the factory.  It does not indicate that somehow or other these people have a right to see how the wealth which they produce can be consumed and can be redistributed.  This budget says nothing to the children of the nation who, along with the elderly, constitute a much higher dependency in our population than in any other EEC country.  It says nothing to them in terms that this generation of Irish people, 20 years off the end of the 20th century, propose to attack, in a scientific and rational way which would somehow or other reflect the progress of humanity, the problems of transforming the basic raw materials and natural wealth of this country into a substance that would eliminate poverty, that would eliminate homelessness and that would eliminate the other forms of material misery that still exist here.  It is a miserable, unoptimistic and pathetic budget speech which, in the words of Shakespeare, &ldquo;curses the darkness when the candle goes out&rdquo; rather than seeking rational, intelligent and modern ways of developing the resources which, after hundreds of years of colonial ownership, we now at least own.</P>

      <P>I was interested in listening to Deputy Quinn.  I had hoped that he would have some constructive criticism to offer.  Most of it was very negative.  Deputy Quinn said that Fianna Fáil are capitalist and I take exception to that.  In saying that Fianna Fáil could not produce the jobs he ignored the fact that Fianna Fáil, who are a republican party and proud to be so, have in the last two years made history by the number of new jobs that have been created, 30,000 new jobs in 1979.  These jobs mainly went to young people.  Deputy <Col N="35" /> Quinn rightly referred to our young population because 50 per cent of our population are under 30 years.  Our job creation success was the highest in six years in the EEC.  Especially in my locality, mid-Cork, many people who had emigrated some time ago have been encouraged to come home by a scheme set up by the Minister for Labour to attract skilled workers.  Many of these people are now living and working in my home town, Carrigaline, a fast-expanding Cork harbour industrial area.</P>
      <P>The budget was received very favourably by the majority of right-thinking people.  It was another step towards implementing many of the items mentioned in our 1977 manifesto.  The majority of these items have been implemented but some, due to circumstances outside our control, will have to be altered and rightly so, because it is the job of the Government of the day to take the right decisions at the right time.</P>
      <P>By comparison with former years, the recent taxation changes especially for the PAYE sector can be termed as radical.  It must be pointed out that over the last two years this Government gave other tax concessions to that sector.  This year the Minister took major steps to create an equitable tax system. Hopefully in the very near future we will see a tax system where all sectional interests are equally catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should aim more towards indirect rather than direct taxation.  This gives a person a choice, whether to spend or to save.  When I was going to school it was the norm to save.  We all had money boxes and post office saving books, but the present generation&mdash;and this goes back a number of years&mdash;do not know what saving is.  This is probably due to the economic way of life over the past few years because the whole concept of saving has been undermined.  Some people might ask why save when inflation absorbs interest and eats capital?  The present attitude of the youth is to borrow as much as possible because in the long run it is cheaper, and anyone who saves <Col N="36" /> is a sucker.  We have to change this attitude.</P>
    <P>We must start a promotional savings campaign showing people the desirability and the advantages to themselves and to the nation of saving.  We must encourage our children to save, to put something in a savings book every week.  This simple philosophy could lay the foundation in later years for a sound economic outlook.  Many people drink and smoke to excess because they have too much money readily available.  They were not trained to save for the rainy day, to provide for their future, to have money to buy a site or build a house.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the expansion of company savings schemes.  The Minister might consider using the proposed tax advisory office to double as a savings advisory office.  I agree with other speakers who said that in 1980 the £70 tax free income limit was outdated. It should be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe everybody should own his or her own house.  Present day trends of spiralling land prices, speculation, artificially inflated house prices, costly mortgage financing and what I term the penal bridging loan system grossly militate against the achievement of this aspiration.  We should question the whole concept of bridging loans.  The interest rate on bridging loans at present stands at 19 per cent and can last between 6 months to three years, and even longer.  I know an unfortunate person who had a bridging loan for seven years. He paid in interest the price of his house but he still had capital to repay.  In my opinion the bridging loan system is totally unjust and is a penal system.</P>
    <P>Most prospective house purchasers, especially newlyweds hoping to raise families, are forced into this system. They have no option but to hand over a substantial amount of their hard earned and much needed money to pay this interest. This system must be changed. The banks say they do not want it, that it is not their type of business.  Yet, £100 million or so is tied up in such loans. Building societies and local authorities should be able to get more involved in <Col N="37" /> the organisation of loans for house builders and house purchasers.  Building societies should be able to clear a couple for X amount, whether it be £10,000, £12,000, £15,000 or £20,000.  Such couples could then purchase a house because they would know what money was readily available to them.  Before they buy a house they should have their loan organised.  It should be sanctioned before they even look at a house.  Houses should not be advertised for sale until the title is in order.  I do not know whether a change in legislation would be needed. Perhaps it could be done by a direction or by a ministerial order, but the whole thing needs to be streamlined.  This would involve solicitors and the Land Registry.  I want to compliment the Land Registry.  In any dealings I had with them, everything was in order and cases were dealt with promptly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I urge building societies and local authorities&mdash;and we had a motion before Cork County Council yesterday&mdash;to generate schemes whereby it would be possible to advance money stage by stage in line with the construction of houses.  When the title is in order I do not see any reason why building societies and local authorities cannot accept a letter of guarantee from a solicitor that, when the deeds are ready, they will be placed at their disposal.  I cannot see any reason why building societies and local authorities should not become involved in the financing of a house at the foundation stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social aspects of the budget, one of the main aims was to reduce Government borrowing and improve our balance of payments.  More basic was the aim to improve the conditions of people on lower incomes and also of the young, the old and the infirm. I am very pleased with the substantial increases in social welfare benefits: 25 per cent for long term recipients and 20 per cent for short term recipients.  This is very welcome and I have been advocating it.  We should look after these sections of our society.  I should like to see something done about people who are fully fit and able for employment and <Col N="38" /> who do not take the jobs offered to them. It would be interesting to know how many job opportunities are available. Statistics confuse us at times, but I should like to know the number of job opportunities available.  We should encourage people to make an effort to do something for themselves and for our country.</P>
    <P>It must always be our aim to maintain a just and dignified standard of living for all our people.  Many private groups and individuals are playing a very important role in Ireland today in filling gaps which Government resources cannot reach. These groups and individuals must be encouraged and listened to when it comes to formulating Government policy.  It would be impossible for any Government to deal with this problem successfully on their own.  The Government and all the people of Ireland have a social responsibility to each other.  You might be well off today, but who knows what the future may bring.  No man is an island, and we are all dependent on each other.</P>
    <P>We must be willing to contribute our share to the social services.  I should like the Government to publish figures showing the working people&mdash;and the majority of us are working people&mdash;exactly what percentage they are contributing to help the less well-off people in our society.  If we saw these figures in their proper perspective, we might ask ourselves whether we are doing enough, or whether we could do more and contribute more.  In this budget the Government have made fantastic advances in social sharing.  It is up to ourselves to develop our social conscience and awareness.  Until we do this, to a large extent the Government are limited in what they can offer.</P>
    <P>A number of Government opponents said we had weakened in our commitment to education.  I am glad to report that only last week in my own town. Carrigaline, the foundations were started for a new community school costing £1.7 million.  This is very welcome.  The advances being made in education are also very welcome.  The concept of community <Col N="39" /> schools is very exciting to me. They are becoming the centre of local communities.  Previously the resources within schools were under-utilised to a large extent.  They were available to pupils only during school hours.  Nowadays whole communities can benefit from the use of halls, meeting rooms, sports facilities and library facilities.  All such facilities throughout the country, in which there is heavy capital investment whether it be in land, in buildings, in equipment, or in personnel, should be utilised to the full and with maximum efficiency. I admire Newman's concept of education for education's sake, but I recognise that, in this present breakneck technological age, in Ireland we cannot really afford such a luxury.</P>
    <P>We must gear our education system to take advantage of technological developments. Much has been said about the mighty electronic chip and this is where much of the world's development lies. Thanks to the foresight and expertise of the IDA we got in at the beginning and this is one of our fastest growth industries. I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the signing of the contract in Paris for the new digital switching gear for the telephone system.  We will have some of the most modern equipment available and this will encourage our research and development teams of which Deputy Quinn was unaware, in their work.  We will also have the prospect of thousands of new highly technological jobs.  This year about £650 million is to be spent on the telecommunications system.  With the right combination of staff, money and advanced technology we will have the best phone system in the world.  I compliment the IDA on their achievements to date.  It is heartening to note that they got an increase of something like £30 million in their budget this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to education I hope that the restrictive and out-dated curriculum operating in some schools will be revised and that secondary school subjects will be expanded to cater for modern skills. <Col N="40" /> Specialised subjects such as computer studies, programming and electronics should be introduced as examination subjects.  We should also look at the present intermediate and leaving certificate examinations to see if we could introduce alternative examinations supplemented by continuous assessment and field work.  We should also coordinate education at national level and involve State bodies, such as the IDA, so that talents will be matched with job opportunities. There is much room for improvement in career guidance and we should educate people for the jobs that will be available in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I am saddened to see a lack of national patriotism in our youth and we should do something about it.  The practice followed in France and America of assembling the pupils at the start and the end of the day for the raising and lowering of the national flag should be encouraged in our schools.  This along with the teaching and singing of the national anthem might inspire our young people with patriotism.</P>
    <P>The Government have rightly cut back on public spending in certain areas. The time has come to take stock of structures in the public sector.  For years in public and private sectors we have been subsidising gross inefficiency.  We must get back to the idea of maximum utilisation of skills and resources.  The present cutback will give the impetus to achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>I suggest the use of a lottery as a method of gaining finance for local authorities to supplement their allocations. This is very popular in England, on the Continent and in the USA and Canada.  There is nothing wrong with this method of raising funds and I have urged Cork County Council and Cork Corporation to get together to approve a lottery for the county.  I understand that a change in legislation would be needed for this, and I hope it will be made.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been made about the large increase in the tax on petrol. However, the total percentage of tax in the price of petrol is less than it was in previous years.  During the Coalition <Col N="41" /> term of office 58 per cent of the price was tax and in 1980 it is only 50 per cent.  We have to cut down on our dependence on petrol and imported oil products.  The Taoiseach suggested that we encourage the formation of car pools. Successfully operated, these are a great saving for the individual and for the country as a whole.  As we drive to work we see many cars driving in the same direction and covering the same distance with just one person in them.  This very simple, practical measure should be promoted and encouraged.  Energy is the real key to our balance of payments and the prosperity of our country.  We must strive towards the ideal of self-sufficiency but this will require meticulous planning and foresight.  We must extract from our natural resources the maximum energy potential possible. I know how conscious the Government are of these factors.  The Minister for Energy has special responsibility for that and I urge him to make further studies of hydro schemes and to see that our experts are kept abreast of wind, wave, solar, nuclear and biomass technology so that as they evolve, as they will, to a practical stage we can take full advantage of them.</P>
    <P>At present we are not taking advantage of our natural gas supply.  A policy should be laid on the line as soon as possible to decide how we will use the gas, whether we will have a national grid, whether it will be used in the precincts of the gas find in the greater Cork area to encourage gas-based factories, or whether it will be used in other towns and cities.  If the latter is the case provision should be made in housing estates at the building stage to see that all the necessary infrastructure is laid on.  Now is the time to do that.  Whether in Cork city, in Dublin or any other city it does not matter, if they will be receiving gas two or three years from now the necessary piping and ducting should be laid at this stage.</P>
    <P>The IDA, whom I compliment again for the work they are doing, should encourage more industries where the highest possible potential of gas will be <Col N="42" /> exploited.  In this the use of gas for the generation of electricity is wasteful to some extent and does not avail of the optimum energy potential of the gas being so used.  Much of the energy of the gas is lost in the generation of electricity.  In other countries this waste heat is spread around the districts and used for heating water and so on.  In Denmark especially something like 25,000 homes are heated by district heating from the generating plants there.  The Danes have reduced their dependency on domestic heating oil by over 90 per cent.  This would also reduce greatly the cost of heating for the family house.  We should consider when we are building generating stations in the future whether it might be right to build them in or near areas of population where the waste heat could and should be used to its full potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture dealt at length this morning with agriculture, and rightly so, because it is our basic industry and most important to our national economy.  Of the total workforce of the country 23.1 per cent are working directly on the land and another 49.2 per cent are in the supply and services area.  That is a total of 72.3 per cent and as many as 90 per cent are dependent on the success or failure of agriculture.  The percentage of our GNP in relation to our agriculture is 18.2 and this is more than 7.5 times the percentage of Great Britain <i>pro rata</i> and approximately 4.5 times that of the EEC average.  These figures prove beyond any shadow of doubt the importance of agriculture to our national economy.  We were made very much aware of this in recent times when we had the coming together of the Government, the farm organisations and the trade unions to oppose the levy proposed by the EEC of 57p per gallon on milk.  This to our nation could cause a loss of many thousands of jobs.  I am confident that when our Minister goes to Europe he will not accept this levy.  It is unacceptable in the context that agriculture has for the welfare of our economy.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government examine two areas.  The first is the importation <Col N="43" /> of food from third countries.  I am thinking mainly of New Zealand, the Argentine and, to a lesser extent, Australia.  Secondly, our share of the EEC market is of the order of only 4 per cent and we are not creating surpluses. In fact we are producing approximately 45 per cent of our total capacity while our European partners are producing at over 90 per cent of their capacity.  How can we increase our agricultural production? We can do so by education.  We need to have at least one more agricultural college or to expand the agricultural colleges we have.  Every boy and girl going into agriculture should spend at least one year in an agricultural college.  The necessary buildings for these colleges are available, if they can be acquired and utilised.  Further forms of education are day and night classes through the county committees of agriculture.  These committees are doing great work, no doubt, but are tied up, to an extent, with the agricultural advisers who are being kept in their offices because of non-availability of clerical staff.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Finance, since he is the man who controls the purse strings, to give clearance for the provision of clerical staff to these committees, so that agricultural instructors who are educated and qualified to instruct on the land can walk with and work with the farmers and do the job for which they are specifically trained and qualified.  We need more instructors, double the amount.  However, this cannot be done in a year.  It could take four or five years. With that in mind, we should start now in 1980&mdash;the decade of endeavour.  Why should we do so?  We might ask ourselves why must it be done.  The following are why and how it should be done. We have the ingredients to make it happen, the land and the young people&mdash;over 50 per cent of our population are less than 30 years of age.  Our two greatest assets are our land and our young people.  There are not the risks involved at with drilling for oil or gas, but <Col N="44" /> that is not to say that we should not drill for these commodities.  A good agricultural policy is the cheapest and quickest way for us to increase our total exports, thus helping greatly to reduce our balance of payments deficit.  We need co-ordinating bodies to tie these proposals together, using the full potential of land and people, thus increasing production, job creation, processing and marketing.</P>
    <P>This budget went a certain way towards straightening out the principle of farmer taxation.  We cannot afford a confrontation between the PAYE and the farming sectors and this budget has gone a long way towards defusing that type of situation.  I refer now to the outmoded rateable valuation system as against the taxation system.  It is 100 years since the land of Ireland was valued and there are, to my knowledge, areas valued at a differential between 12½p and about £2 per acre.  In 1980, with an amount of land reclamation, modern transport systems and centralisation, there is land valued at perhaps 25p or 50p&mdash;10 shillings as it was at that time&mdash;of equal value to the land over the ditch or across the river, valued at £.50 or £2.  The valuation is tied up, as the Minister knows, with the taxation system and the discrepancy or anomaly is not so much between the PAYE workers and the farmers as between the valuation of one farmer and another.  We do not want to pit the agricultural sector against any other sector. Agriculture is an industry which is very peculiar to itself and very vital to all of us because of all the spin-offs, the industries affected by it, with so many people involved, and it needs special attention. I hope that in the budgets ahead an equitable system will be found to satisfy the farming section of our community.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I look forward with confidence to the year ahead for the economy to ride out the storm and for the production of the necessary jobs for our young people, which will help to build for the future and make this nation of ours a better nation.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, on his <Col N="45" /> budget and the research that went into it. As I said it has been received very favourably by the vast majority of right-thinking people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ag an bpointe seo san diospóireacht cháinaisnéis bliantiúil tá sé an-deacair ar fad rud nua a chur isteach san díospóireacht ach mar sin fhéin tá sé an-tábhachtach ar fad go leabarfadh an chuid is mó de na Teachtí Dála ar an díospóireacht bliantiúil seo.  This is the twenty-first budget debate I have had the privilege of participating in since I became a Member of the House in 1961. This is the nineteenth annual budget and there were two supplementary budgets in that time.  Budget debates&mdash;this one is no exception&mdash;have followed the pattern of Deputies on one side trying to praise the budget and present it in the best possible light while the Opposition Deputies fulfil their role of analysing, assessing and criticising it where necessary.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of speculation and expectation in the run up to the budget because it was produced in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances unprecedented in my time in the House in that there was a change of leadership and a major Government reshuffle shortly before the budget was due.  People were waiting to see in what way the new leadership and newly reshaped Government would be reflected in the budget and more particularly in the speech of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately after the Minister delivered his speech on 27 February I was invited to participate in a discussion on Radio na Gaeltachta.  My first reaction to the budget speech was that the 1980 budget was merely a cosmetic exercise. It represented slick financial juggling and, at the same time, a deliberate effort to present the picture in the best possible light.  The annual budget in a democratic system of Government is the major instrument of the economic and social policy of the Government.  It is not just an exercise in arithmetic, financial juggling, balancing books or giving a few pounds here and <Col N="46" /> taking them away there.  The budget should and always did, until this one, reflect clearly the thinking and attitude of the Government to the major economic and social problems of the day.</P>
    <P>In their general election manifesto and in the last two budget speeches and various other speeches Fianna Fáil claimed that the major and most urgent priority was the creation of employment. We had continued emphasis on the vital importance of job creation.  Job creation is of paramount importance and is the major problem facing the country and the Government.  A major challenge facing any government is the generation of more jobs and this is particularly important in our position where the population is increasing.  There is absolutely nothing in the budget or in the Minister's speech to indicate any new approach or new dynamic in relation to generating the necessary economic activity which will create the jobs adequate to absorb the growing labour force coming on the market.  The jobs should be of a range and variety which will satisfy the aspirations and expectations of young people who are well-educated as a result of better opportunities for post primary and third-level education.</P>
    <P>The Minister had to be preoccupied and take note of the appalling mess in which the finances of the country had descended following the squandermania of the last two years.  To talk about balancing the budget and straightening out the country's finances without taking into account the economic and social problems facing us is crazy policy.  It does not speak well for the new Taoiseach and Government that such an important area as job creation and employment has been relegated to irrelevancy in the Minister's speech. There is nothing in the budget to indicate that there will be any new momentum in job creation other than the allocation to the IDA who, since their foundation by the then Inter-Party Government, have been a credit to the country irrespective of what Government were in power.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will allay the fears <Col N="47" /> expressed by many people, trade union spokesmen, business men and young people who are in their final year in the various educational institutions who will be trying to find employment suitable to their qualifications and talents.  I challenge the Minister for Finance to state what the Government's policy is in relation to the creation of full employment. Is it a major objective of Government policy?  Is it a top priority in Government policy under Deputy Charles J. Haughey, the new Taoiseach? If it is, the Minister should spell out clearly what economic strategies will be applied in the light of the difficult international situation that exists with spiralling costs of fuel and so on.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of speaking in the presence of he Minister of State, Deputy McEllistrim, and I should like to congratulate him on his recent promotion.  I wish him well in his onerous task.  It is ironic that the Minister of State present&mdash;a man for whom I have very great respect, as I had also for his father, with whom I had the privilege of being a fellow Member of this House from 1961 to 1965&mdash;who is in charge of the Office of Public Works, an important area of national activity, an important source of employment and so on, should be placed in the situation in which, as I understand it, the subvention for arterial drainage is being reduced. Certainly that subvention has not been increased to the extent that would enable the accelerated arterial drainage programme to be implemented, about which there was so much publicity 12 months ago, particularly in the context of the sums that would be forthcoming from the EEC.  This type of cut-back on public expenditure does not make sense. In certain circumstances I can understand&mdash;and indeed my colleague, Deputy John Kelly, has often referred to this&mdash;the creation of purely civil service desk jobs, as such.  But arterial drainage is an entirely different ball game.  It entails the type of work that not alone provides tremendous employment but adds also to greater productivity in relation <Col N="48" /> to our greatest natural resource, that of land.</P>
    <P>We as a party are very conscious of the effects of arterial drainage.  In my constituency the drainage of the river Maigue is well under way.  I should say that the work done to date is very satisfactory and is a credit to the Office of Public Works and all involved.  There has been agitation for years by people in the Mulcaire catchment area&mdash;half of which is in my constituency and the other in that of the Minister for Finance &mdash;about the delay in getting to grips with the drainage of that river.  I hope the necessary finance will be made available to the Minister to enable him have the preparatory work done so that when the Maigue scheme is completed in a couple of years time we will be able to start with the Mulcaire scheme.  I realise that there are problems with regard to engineering and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is well aware that we are starting the drainage of two new rivers this year under the arterial drainage scheme, so things are not as bad as the Deputy is portraying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a great believer in arterial drainage.  I have seen its results in the western part of County Limerick as a result of the Feale Drainage Scheme initiated by the late Donagh O'Malley.  We are very concerned to ensure that funds be made available, particularly, for the drainage of the Mulcaire, so that the machinery can be moved in once the Maigue scheme has been completed.  That would appear to be a very logical development. I sincerely hope the Minister will keep a close watch on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to speak in a very special way about an aspect of national life which gravely concerns me&mdash;social welfare.  While I welcome the increases granted to social welfare recipients in this budget they are minimal only, the minimum with which any Government could get away.  However, in the light of <Col N="49" /> the continuous increases in foodstuffs they are gestures only, because, as many others have said, we have had budgets week after week over the past four or five months with food subsidies being knocked over the past two years.  I am gravely concerned&mdash;and I say this in a totally non-party political sense&mdash;about the hardship and the amount of poverty existing in our society at present.  I am very conscious of this because I represent a largely urban constituency, including the city of Limerick.  It is inevitable that in any large urban area, whether it be Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Galway, there will be the poor, underprivileged, unemployed and aged.  I want to condemn this Government, this type of society, for having these unfortunate people daily and monthly fighting a losing battle against inflation, many of them existing on the minimum subsistence level, totally dependent on their pensions, finding basic food commodities going up in price continuously.  Also I want publicly to deplore the additional hardship imposed on those unfortunate people in the past 12 months by the prolonged postal strike that left many of them for months without their social welfare payments or pensions as the case may be.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the increases to the social welfare categories in this budget it would appear that the whole administration of the Department of Social Welfare is breaking down and unable to cope with the situation.  In my constituency office in Limerick I have been listening to the cases of people&mdash;and other Deputies have referred to this matter in the course of the debate over the past couple of weeks&mdash;unfortunate people who are entitled as of right to their pension or social welfare cheque but which does not arrive on the specified date, thus imposing enormous hardship on them and their families&mdash;for instance, on the family of an unemployed man, a sick man, the family of a deserted wife who when Friday comes along is left without any means of buying foodstuffs.  Then one has to endeavour to telephone the Department of Social Welfare.  I should say that the officials both at local level in <Col N="50" /> Limerick and in Dublin are most courteous and helpful, but they are fighting an impossible battle.</P>
    <P>If the Government have any social conscience at all they must take a hard look at the administration of the Department of Social Welfare, which will have to be re-vamped, re-organised and, most important of all, decentralised to a greater extent, because the present situation in which applications, appeals and so on are passed from Limerick to Dublin and back can no longer obtain. Greater autonomy will have to be given to the provincial offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  I make a special appeal in this respect.  I feel very strongly about it because I have seen such hardship, misery and disappointment.  It is a situation which would make one's heart bleed.  One can readily see the position of a deserted wife in any large urban area at present of being left with no money to buy food for her children because the postal services are not operating efficiently or because her cheque is not sent out from the Department of Social Welfare.  In our preoccupation with the economic situation, with the grave energy crisis and so on, I appeal to the Government and the Minister for Finance not to forget our poor, our underprivileged sections of the community, those sections being hit more and more by the impact of inflation and for whom this budget has done a little but nothing like sufficient.</P>

      <P>Grants of this kind are not available from State or EEC sources and I do not propose to make them available.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that dumping fish is not desirable but I am sure the Deputy appreciates that if you were to instal adequate processing facilities you would need to be sure of a regular supply of fish.  Dumping occurs only on rare occasions when there are big catches.</P>

      <P>Surely this crazy regulation should be scrapped.  Will the Minister agree that it is not necessary to dump fish in order to qualify for the intervention money?  Prime fish of first-class quality is being dumped around the coast.  Is it not true that charitable organisations in towns and villages would take the fish if offered it without payment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the fish first of all is offered for sale in the public market.  If it is of such prime quality as the Deputy told us about is it not a wonder it is not bought?  This system was introduced to ensure that fishermen would get adequate prices for their fish.  When fish does not reach such prices it is withdrawn under EEC regulations and it is left to the fish producers' organisation to dispose of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC in their wisdom decided that fish offered for sale and not disposed of in the public market may not otherwise be sold afterwards because <Col N="53" /> this would interfere with the original reasons for the introduction of the intervention system.  There are four different options open for the disposal of fish: it can be processed into meal, it can be used as an animal feed, it can be used for purposes other than feed, including dumping, or it can be distributed free of charge to charitable organisations.  It is not always easy for the fish producers' organisations to do that, but it is an option that is open to them.</P>

      <P>The board have arranged training programmes for filleters in the past and will continue to do so where a demand for this type of training exists.

Such fish is, however, first offered for sale for human consumption and is only withdrawn from the market where it fails to reach certain price levels.</P>

      <P>Surely it would be possible to make prior contingency arrangements with charitable organisations that when fish become available they will be communicated with and they could send a van to collect the fish?  It requires little imagination and little action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to prior contingency regulations.  He must understand that the intervention system was brought in on the assumption that when fishermen go out to fish they do not know how much fish they will catch. One would not expect fishermen to go out with the knowledge that they would catch fish they may have to dump. Fishermen go out to catch fish that they can sell when brought ashore, and when they find it does not reach a certain price on the market they dispose of it to the producer's organisation who pay the intervention price.  Prior contingency regulations could not be made in respect of a situation we could not be aware of in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke of &ldquo;prior contingency arrangements&rdquo;, under which charitable organisations would be notified that at certain times fish might become available unexpectedly and they could be asked to dispose of it if they could collect it.  That should be a simple thing to do.  The dumping that is going on at present is indefensible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The marketing of fish for human consumption is governed by the provisions of EEC Council Regulation No. 100/76.  This regulation provides for the establishment of a common organisation of the market in fishery products comprising a price and trading system and common rules on competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prices obtained by fishermen for their catches are subject to supply and demand factors but producer organisations <Col N="57" /> of fishermen are enabled by the above regulation to intervene on the market by applying withdrawal prices below which fish may not be sold.  Such intervention assists in the stabilisation of prices and guarantees as far as possible a fair income to fishermen.</P>
    <P>Retail prices for fish are a matter for the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Deputy might consider addressing the second part of his question to that Minister.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that fish has been fetching a very low price during recent months?  Fish which has not been sold into intervention is left on piers while owners try to find a market.  When we had the opportunity we found markets in Asia.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is desirable that the best possible deal should be made. There would appear to be some incompatability between the first and second parts of this question.  Deputy Treacy asked me to see that fishermen were adequately compensated for their labours and I think the withdrawal system does that, though whether it does so adequately or not I am not quite sure; then he wanted to ensure that fish was available to the public at prices they could afford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the development of outlets on the home market for increasing supplies of pulpwood which are becoming available from State forests, my Department have entered into an arrangement with an Irish company who are proposing to export a quantity of the excess material.  This will enable my Department to continue to have forests thinned so that future production of good sawlog timber will be achieved.</P>
      <P>The arrangement is, of course, short term.  The Industrial Development Authority, in close consultation with my Department, are continuing their efforts to attract investment in new processing mills to utilise pulpwood at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The ideal thing would be to process that timber at home.  When we have not the processing facilities to do that we are faced with the situation where it would cost us quite a considerable amount of money to thin the forests which must be thinned to allow the mature timber to grow.  The arrangement we have entered into for a short-term period is one which enables us to gain a certain revenue and have someone else thin them for us and export them.

      <P>Am I right in suggesting that the grant the Minister is talking about is phased over a five-year period and is not a straight grant?  Surely he must accept that the lion's share of forestry development, where there is such a great potential, must be taken on by the Department of Forestry and that <Col N="67" /> as far as private people are concerned it will only be a very small percentage which they can contribute to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant is paid in instalments over a period of eight years.  That used to be ten years and the recent announcement has reduced it to eight years.  This allows for proper husbandry and proper forestry practices.  The phasing of the grant enables the Department to examine them and see that they are carried out.</P>

      <P>The number of kiosks out of order at a recent date was about 400, over half of them due to vandalism.

The measures taken include reinforcing coin boxes, replacing glass by specially strengthened plastic and improving the light in kiosks.  Specially strengthened coin boxes are being brought into service progressively and over 200 of these are already in use resulting in a reduction in the number of kiosks out of order due to vandalism.  A new type of kiosk is also being installed in a number of centres which as well as being more attractive visually is less susceptible to damage and <Col N="73" /> it is planned to instal 1,000 new-type STD coin boxes later this year which should be much less prone to damage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Except in certain well defined cases such as telephone calls monitored at the request of the subscriber or letters opened because they are undeliverable, telephone calls and letters are intercepted by my Department only in compliance with warrants issued by the Minister for Justice.  The circumstances in which warrants are issued are matters for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that any unauthorised interception of telephone calls is taking place and no such case has come to my notice.  If evidence of any such interception is brought to my notice, the matter will be reported to the Director of Public Prosecutions for such action as he may consider appropriate.</P>

      <P>There was a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> last month attributing to the Dublin No. 4 Branch of the Irish Post Office Engineering Union a statement that telephone tapping was widespread.

      <P>What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;anonymous report&rdquo;? Most newspaper reports are anonymous in that they appear as news items, sometimes over the byline of a journalist, but usually not.  What does the Minister mean by anonymity in this context?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I disagree with Deputy FitzGerald.  On such an allegation it is not normal.  In my opinion it was a very serious allegation for such a paper to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is ill-informed about the press.  He must not read the papers much.  Most news items published as news items are not over the byline of a journalist.  That is not anonymity, it is reporting in the press and the Minister has a responsibility to investigate it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, when a report like that appears in a very reputable daily newspaper and the Minister says he did not investigate it any further because it was not a signed article, it is reasonable to assume that the editor accepts responsibility for such an article, particularly an article dealing with such a sensitive area.</P>

      <P>Second, which is far more important, I always understood that if a statement is being made in the press a person puts his name to it.  If we are talking about an article, as suggested by Deputy Cluskey, that is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this certainly will give rise to public concern, over and above the original article, when he is so unwilling to investigate this matter and so ambivalent in his approach to it?  Would he not agree that in view of the way he answered these questions there is now very serious reason to seek to have the matter investigated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering the question on the Order Paper according to precedent in this House.  The question put to me was would I investigate this statement in the paper.  If that was a statement why did the person who made it not put his name to it?  That was an anonymous statement and therefore I will not investigate it nor would I expect Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Cluskey or anybody else to investigate it.  If that were the case I would spend half of my time investigating anonymous letters and press reports.  I know that the Opposition would not like me to be wasting my time in the Department.</P>

      <P>Since the present postmaster was appointed in 1976 he has enlarged and modernised the premises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer given to a previous question from Deputy Treacy on the 18 October 1979.  The position regarding the cashing of Irish postal orders in the United Kingdom was set out in a general advertisement inserted by my Department in the national newspapers on the 8 October 1979, and suitable instructions have been issued to counter staff.  There is no international agreement on the acceptance of other countries' postal orders, but a small number of sterling-linked countries have continued to accept Irish postal orders despite the break in our link with sterling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that following the break in parity between the IR£ and sterling the British Post Office continued for a time to accept Irish postal orders, cashing them in sterling at face <Col N="83" /> value, but because of the widening gap between the two currencies they ceased to do so from the beginning of August 1979.

    <Title>Visit to Paris: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement about my recent visit to Paris.</P>
      <P>In response to an invitation from Prime Minister Barre, I made a working visit to Paris on Thursday 13 March accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan.  During the visit President Giscard d'Estaing hosted a working lunch in my honour.</P>
      <P>The main matters discussed with the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister Francois-Poncet and other Cabinet Ministers were matters affecting the European Community, including political co-operation items, Northern Ireland, cultural relations and a contract for the supply of telecommunications equipment by Telectron Limited, Tallaght, in co-operation with the French firm CIT/Alcatel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the next European Council is due to be held in Brussels on 31 March and 1 April.  Our <Col N="110" /> Paris discussions covered issues likely to arise at the Council, including convergence and the British contribution to the Community budget, the working of the European Monetary System, the possibility of a Community tax on energy, agricultural prices and surpluses, sheepmeat and, in particular, the proposed super-levy on milk production to which we expressed our total opposition.</P>
    <P>I made our position clear on the question of the British budgetary contribution, namely, that we were anxious for a solution but could not accept one which would be detrimental to our interests or to the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Developments in Afghanistan and the Middle East, which the French President visited recently, and East-West relations generally were also discussed.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity of outlining for the President and Prime Minister our policy on Northern Ireland and my view of the urgent need for a just and lasting solution.  The President and Prime Minister listened with understanding and sympathy to what I had to say.</P>
    <P>There were exchanges about cultural relations and it was agreed that the possibility should be actively pursued of having an exhibition held in Paris in about two years time on the lines of the Treasures of Ireland Exhibition which recently toured the United States.  I mentioned a proposal of the Royal Irish Academy to hold a colloquium in the Irish College in Paris in 1981 which the French side noted with interest.  There was some discussion of the possibilities of more university exchanges between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen the announcement of the decision to order exchanges designed by the French firm, CIT/Alcatel, the telecommunications subsidiary of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite.  The exchanges will be supplied through the Irish firm Telectron and will form an important part of the network to be provided under the accelerated telephone development programme.  In consequence of the contract the French Ministry of Posts and <Col N="111" /> Telecommunications will provide extensive training and technical assistance; finance will be provided under an extension of the bilateral aid facility arising out of Ireland's participation in the European Monetary System; and two new industrial projects will be established in Ireland to manufacture telephone switching equipment and advanced transmission equipment.  These projects will involve the creation of about 1,000 new jobs and investment of over £7 million.  The Prime Minister and I agreed on the usefulness of these exchanges of views and it was decided that they should become a regular feature of the relations between our two countries.</P>
    <P>This was my first visit abroad as Taoiseach.  I regard it as having been highly satisfactory in the understanding we reached with the President and Prime Minister and in its confirmation of the value of the long-standing relationship between Ireland and France.  The arrangements made for our visit were superb and I would like to take this opportunity publicly of thanking again the President and Prime Minister for the cordiality of their reception and the hospitality they so graciously extended to us during the visit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a brief statement from each leader in the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his brief statement on his visit to Prime Minister Barre and his lunch with President Giscard d'Estaing.  He has confirmed in his statement the long-standing relationship and cordiality with France which is more than a cliché.  I know from my own period as Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is a reality based both on common interests, which within the EEC are strong and binding, and a genuine kind of sympathy.  It is a good thing that the visit the Taoiseach paid was to this neighbour of ours with whom we have such close bonds.  I am glad that such visits are to be a regular feature in future and they will be a useful <Col N="112" /> development of our relationship with France.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in these discussions naturally raised, and had raised with him, questions affecting the EEC and in particular the problems arising from the British requirement for a second renegotiation effectively of the Treaty of Accession.  The Taoiseach has not said much on this subject and it may be that it is not possible to say much on it at present. In view of the fact that the British claim is based on being the third poorest country in the EEC and was made despite the favourable balance of payments situation of the UK, I would trust that the Taoiseach in his discussions sought to ensure that, in so far as measures are taken to reduce the burden on the UK as the third poorest member and despite their favourable balance of payments situation, equivalent appropriate measures will be taken in relation to this country also, which of course is the least well off member country with a balance of payments deficit probably the worst in relation to its GNP of any member country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that if any part of a solution that may be proposed at the forthcoming European Council&mdash;or more probably at a later one&mdash;involves special measures such as financing a channel tunnel, an equivalent and parallel arrangement will be made for similar projects in this country whether they be cross-Border or other projects.  It is important that we should not allow British diplomacy to create an impression that Britain has a special problem greater and worse than that of countries less well off than themselves and whose external payments position is worse.  The nature of the campaign waged by British politicians on behalf of their country, as is appropriate for them to do, calls on our part for a presentation of our position realistically and factually so that in any solution we should not be left at a disadvantage. It would be very ironic indeed for a country less well off than Britain&mdash;although we have caught up with Britain to a degree over the last 20 years&mdash;because of the nature of our historical relationship with that country, <Col N="113" /> if we were called upon to provide subsidies to aid a country significantly better off than we are.  There would be no logic or justice in that, and a degree of charity beyond what is called for even between friendly neighbours such as we are, with Great Britain next door to us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the proposed super levy on milk production and he said that this was something &ldquo;to which we expressed our total opposition&rdquo;. I was a little disturbed by this phrase because it is a unilateral expression of our opposition and I would have hoped that the Taoiseach would have been able to say that this was a matter on which the French Government and ourselves jointly expressed total opposition. One of the primary purposes of this visit should have been to secure from the French Government a clear commitment that they would oppose any form of super levy, which is the equivalent in its effects of a quota restriction on the output of Irish dairy products and which would run against and undermine the most basic principles of the Community&mdash;the principle of comparative advantage based on fair and free trade&mdash;and would prevent our agriculture from making up the leeway lost over several centuries of an essentially exploitationary relationship with a neighbouring island.</P>
    <P>The expression here does not suggest that the Taoiseach on this issue secured complete support from the French Government.  I hope that my interpretation of his words is incorrect and that on this issue we will have the complete support which we thought to have, not because of any special claims that we wish to make by special pleading on our behalf, but because of the fundamental principle involved here of allowing comparative advantage to operate.  We have allowed it to operate in regard to industrial products with the result that the EEC countries on the Continent have increased their exports to this country much more than twice in volume terms since we joined and they will continue to do so with no restrictions of quota, controls or super levies on them.  By definition <Col N="114" /> we on our side should not be inhibited or impeded from developing our natural advantages here.  We should ensure that there is no question of a freezing of the present pattern of milk production with in the Community, which is distorted by historical factors, with a much lower output in this country than would be the case if free competition were allowed to operate within the Community over an adequate number of years for us to overcome the disadvantages of our history.</P>
    <P>I note what the Taoiseach has said about taking the opportunity of outlining to the President and the Prime Minister of France our policy on Northern Ireland and the Taoiseach's view of the urgent need for a just and lasting solution. I note that he said that they listened with understanding and sympathy to what he had to say, but he does not suggest that they made any comment on it.  It has, of course, been the universal practice, certainly in my experience of such visits to other countries, whether on a Prime Minister level or a Foreign Minister level, to inform the other member countries of our position and our concern as they are, at the moment in time, as regards Northern Ireland.  This has been done on all occasions that I have been aware of, since the period when I was in Government, in any event, and it has been an important feature of our diplomacy to use these opportunities to inform our partners in the Community and other countries abroad of our view of the situation and ensure that they understand fully the problem of Northern Ireland as we see it.  It has not, however, been our practice in the past to highlight particularly this aspect of the diplomatic exchanges which have been a part of quiet diplomacy carried out with a view to producing the most effective results.  I would have some fear lest the heightening publicity attaching to them&mdash;however beneficial that might appear to be in terms of domestic opinion&mdash;might prove counter-productive and perhaps especially at a time when, very belatedly, after five years of almost total inertia, the United Kingdom Government are seeking to <Col N="115" /> make some progress in this area, in the first instance through negotiations taking place in Northern Ireland and, ultimately, through the decision which they propose to take after these negotiations, whatever their outcome.  Nothing we do at this stage should be such as to arouse in the United Kingdom any feelings that might be counter-productive to a constructive outcome to the reconsideration of the Northern Ireland problem at present under way.  I shall leave the matter at that point, without further comment, but I feel that that much needs to be said.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear of the proposal to consider having an exhibition in Paris in about two years' time, on the lines of the Treasures of Ireland Exhibition which recently toured the United States. Anyone who has had occasion to visit the French capital over the years will be aware of the immense impact made there by exhibitions of this kind from various parts of the world.  The effect on French opinion, which is, one could say, very highly culturally-orientated, of having an exhibition of that kind from this country could be very considerable and has been in relation to other similar exhibitions. This seems to be an extremely constructive and useful initiative, which I warmly welcome.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we are pleased about anything which is going to help to improve our telephone system, even if somewhat belatedly, and the project involving additional employment is particularly welcomed.</P>
    <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his statement, following a precedent in this matter, and am glad that the conversations appear to have been successful.  I hope that, in working out a solution to the British problem, the Irish and French Governments will work closely together to ensure both the protection of our interests and the successful outcome that will enable the United Kingdom to get out of the difficulties which they have got into partly through over-stating their claims and raising the ante too high.  We must try to help the United Kingdom out <Col N="116" /> of their, to some degree, self-imposed difficulties, but help the United Kingdom in a way which does no damage to our interests and ensures their full protection.  I am sure that the Taoiseach's visit to Paris will have been helpful in ensuring that outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to comment on the recent meeting between the Taoiseach and the French President and Prime Minister.  Despite the impression conveyed prior to the meeting it is clear that the discussions which took place in Paris were primarily concerned with matters preparatory to the forthcoming European Council meeting.  As far as the French Government are concerned, this certainly was their intention and in this connection I welcome the accord reached between the Taoiseach and the French President that any modification which might take place in the European budget in the future would not take place at the expense of the weaker regions of the Community. We have experienced, over recent years, the gradual widening of the gap between the more prosperous and the less developed regions of the Community and it is imperative that this already serious gap would not be further reinforced by any adjustment which may prove necessary in the financial arrangements of the Community in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is clear that the contribution of the United Kingdom Government to the Community is a matter of concern to them and, indeed, is a matter which clearly must be resolved in some fashion in the future, it is also clear that it cannot be solved overnight, nor can it be solved in the rather crude way in which the British Government have approached the problem.  I agree also that the United Kingdom's budgetary contribution problem cannot be seen in isolation from a wide range of policy differences which exist within the European Community and which were referred to by the French President in the course of last week's discussions.  In this connection it is clear that, apart from the British contribution problem, matters related to sheepmeat policy, fisheries policy, oil <Col N="117" /> and, in my view, the under-financing of the European Regional and Social Funds, are matters which all require urgent attention.  It is clearly not practical for the Community to adopt the approach pursued by the British, of isolating their particular problem and dealing with it on its own.</P>
    <P>At a time when all of these and other issues require urgent attention by the Community I must repeat a point which I have made on several occasions concerning the way in which the Community go about their work.  In recent years a growing importance in the working of the Community has been given to the European Council meetings.  In my view, the growth in importance and frequency of these meetings has not been beneficial to the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>While they had been significant in terms of public relations and media coverage, it is true to say that they have not led to the solution of many of the problems which I have mentioned and which, indeed, have persisted over a considerable period.  I repeat that the growth of these Council meetings has distracted attention away from the previously existing diplomatic efforts towards solving Community problems and has unbalanced the normal working relations within the Community.  The forthcoming European Council meeting will, once again prove to be little more than a useful public relations exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to comment at any length on the conclusion of the bilateral arrangements for telecommunications which were part of the agreement reached on our entry into the European Monetary System.  It is quite clear that anything which contributes to the remedying of our appalling telecommunication system is to be welcomed. The job creation which will ensue from that agreement might go some way towards counteracting the effects of the cut-back in public expenditure and the <Col N="118" /> subsequent loss of employment that will result from that.</P>
    <P>In the Taoiseach's statement I note that he gives one short paragraph of four-and-a-half lines to the question of Northern Ireland.  What was described by the Taoiseach as a major diplomatic initiative to be undertaken worldwide on finding a lasting permanent solution to Northern Ireland was highlighted in the Irish newspapers, on television and radio prior to the Taoiseach's visit to France as one of the first steps in what was described as a major diplomatic initiative. Its success as a PRO job was far more substantial than its success in solving or even bringing nearer a solution the problems of Northern Ireland.  If one is going to undertake a major diplomatic effort one must do so with credibility in order to have any prospect of success.  In order to obtain credibility one has to be very careful of one own's actions, their timing and one's utterances in domestic circumstances which are very closely followed by other countries particularly those who have diplomatic missions established here and those who are members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The timing of the Taoiseach's speech on Northern Ireland in the middle of the Northern Ireland constitutional conference and the venue, the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, did not add to the credibility. It showed a total disregard for the vague, possibly even remote, prospects of major agreement at the conference but whatever the prospects were the Taoiseach's speech at the Ard-Fheis in the middle of it did nothing to enhance the possibility of agreement.  In his speech the Taoiseach, although speaking to his own party, did not mention the words &ldquo;British withdrawal&rdquo; and that took away considerably from his credibility in the commencement of this major diplomatic initiative.  The initiative itself was nothing new.  It was under taken by his predecessor and also the now President of Ireland, who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery, many years ago.  It, unfortunately, did not meet with much success although the credibility of that Taoiseach was somewhat greater in this area.</P>

      <P>Although the Taoiseach raised this matter, according to himself, with the President and Prime Minister of France, his Minister for Foreign Affairs is also raising it with various Governments at his own level.  The Taoiseach as yet, as far as I am aware, has not sought a meeting with the person primarily concerned, the head of the UK Government. That also, in the eyes of the French, and of other member states, would take away from the Taoiseach's credibility in the serious pursuance of this initiative.</P>
      <P>When he was interviewed in Paris by RTE the Taoiseach was at great pains to try to convey that something concrete had happened although it was quite clear even to the casual viewer that nothing had emerged.  He said that he was listened to with sympathy and understanding by the French authority at the highest level but all we got from the French as far as I could ascertain, was the fact that the talks on Northern Ireland were not on the official agenda of talks.  If I am wrong the Taoiseach can correct me now.  As far as the French were concerned they did not form part of the official talks although the Taoiseach tried, with some success, to convey to the Irish people that it was a question of the Taoiseach, as a guest in a foreign country, having an agreed agenda. Northern Ireland did not appear and the Taoiseach raised it outside the official talks, probably to the embarrassment of his host, who listened in silence as far as we know.  The Taoiseach might have felt free to interpret that silence as sympathy and understanding.  However, I doubt if it will be beneficial in resolving the tragedy of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Taoiseach assumed that high office as far as Northern Ireland is concerned there has been no change in policy except in one respect.  He reverted back to the Fiannà Fáil 1940-1950 rhetoric, stuff to raise the emotions of <Col N="121" /> the Fianna Fáil faithful but the more peaceful members of his own party realise what is happening.  The only two groups who are taking the Taoiseach's major initiative as far as Northern Ireland is concerned seriously are some of the old time Fianna Fáil people who respond to that type of rhetoric which the Taoiseach has been playing like an orchestra since he assumed leadership of the party and, more tragically and seriously, the Protestant people of Northern Ireland.  They are starting to take the nonsense the Taoiseach has been engaged in seriously and that could have very damaging effects on this island and push back the day of reconciliation and unity by agreement by decades.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is serious about Northern Ireland he should do something serious about it; he should go and talk to Mrs. Thatcher. Let us put an end to the nonsense of going around talking to people who really have clearly indicated&mdash;as the French did by saying it was not part of the official talks&mdash;not alone to the Taoiseach but to the British that they do not intend to become involved in that issue.  Go where it counts.</P>

      <P>I shall resume where I left off before lunch, with the plight of what might be described as the underprivileged sections of our community. While the increases granted them in the budget are to be welcomed they are the minimum that could be offered by any Government in present circumstances. These people have had to endure almost <Col N="122" /> inhuman hardship over the past year-and-a-half because of delays in payment of their benefits caused by the postal and telecommunications strike.  Indeed the situation is still unsatisfactory.  Obviously there is a very serious administrative problem in the Department of Social Welfare.  I am sure every other Deputy in the House has had the same experience as I of constituents coming, week after week, complaining that they did not receive their payments on time. This is a very serious matter for a deserted wife with perhaps four or five children, for the family of an unemployed man, for the old age pensioner and the various other categories of social welfare recipients.  The whole administrative system appears to have broken down.  I ask the Government and the Minister concerned to do something to streamline these payments so that these people will at least get their entitlements on the due dates.  I ask also that serious consideration be given to decentralisation of the Department of Social Welfare, with far greater autonomy being given to provincial social welfare officers.</P>
      <P>A lot of commentary on the budget has been in relation to the taxation situation, in particular to the impact of the budget on industry, agriculture, tourism and so on.  But we cannot forget that we have in our society a large section of people totally dependent on welfare of various kinds.  I have just given an example of the manner in which this underprivileged section has been suffering because of the failure of the Department to adopt more efficient methods for examining claims and paying out benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned also about the problem of housing, particularly in large urban areas.  I have represented a constituency for 19 years which includes our third largest city, Limerick, where we have 980 applicants for local authority housing.  Yet in 1979 there were 34 houses built.  One must remember the plight of these unfortunate people, young married couples in particular.  It is quite a common occurrence that the husband may be living with his family, the wife <Col N="123" /> with hers and the children perhaps somewhere else.  There are young families in grossly overcrowded conditions. In one area of which I am aware, where there are almost 1,000 people on the local authority housing list, 34 houses were built last year.  Obviously there is something radically wrong there. No matter what might be the arguments in favour of cutting public expenditure I would oppose vigorously any suggestion that there be a cut-back in expenditure on local authority housing.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk also about the impact of this budget on various sections of our economy.  In my opinion the sector that will suffer most severely is that of tourism, particularly bearing in mind the savage increase in the price of petrol and ancillary commodities.  The tourist industry took an enormous hammering in 1979 because the postal and telecommunications dispute had disastrous implications, when many of our principal tourist areas had neither postal nor telephone services for a considerable period.  In addition there was the petrol crisis in May of last year, all of which had a very damaging effect on the many people whose livelihood is derived from tourism.  I am thinking particularly of the traditional tourist centres, places such as Kilkee, Ballybunion, right around the coast from Tramore up to the northwest.</P>
    <P>It was reasonable to expect some relief to be given in this budget to this hard-pressed industry.  More recently there has been the savage increase in the price of petrol.  There is now no doubt whatsoever that the cost-competitiveness of Irish tourism is very much on the wrong side of the coin, that we are pricing ourselves out of existence.  Over the past 20 years the traditional pattern has been built up of mobile tourism here. This latest savage increase in the price of petrol will be absolutely detrimental to the tourist contemplating a motoring holiday.  Obviously also it will have a very substantial effect on the car hire business, or self-drive business, something which gave tremendous employment <Col N="124" /> and has been a source of considerable foreign earnings.  The cost of hiring a car here has now gone beyond all reason.</P>
    <P>Therefore I appeal to the Minister for Finance to take a very serious look at the impact of his budgetary measures, particularly that of the increased price of petrol, on our tourist industry.  We have established a very successful tourist industry, built up over the past 20 years or more, with a national tourist board respected widely throughout the world as having pioneered many developments. We have also the many regional tourist organisations that have done a tremendous job.  One only has to think of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, probably the most imaginative tourist promotion body of them all.  Our tourist industry has yielded a substantial amount of foreign earnings; it has been our greatest invisible export.  I am gravely concerned&mdash;I say this in all honesty&mdash;not merely about the impact of these budgetary measures on the tourist industry but about its future. Other problems arise from accelerating fuel and access transport costs particularly as they affect aviation costs and air fares to this country, all of which have an impact on tourism.  Indeed the craziest situation of all obtains in relation to access transport.  Last week I bought an air ticket from Shannon to Strasbourg for £255 while a friend of mine who travelled to New York and back found his return fare to be cheaper. Access transport constitutes a vital element of tourism.  I am not blaming the Government for the rise in the cost of aviation fuel but I am fearful of the future of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>There is need for a new approach, new thinking, new policies and a new strategy.  The impact of the petrol price increases will have very adverse effects on an important aspect of our tourist industry, the mobile tourists who use self-drive cars and those who come from Britain and Europe by car ferries.  The attractions for them are now much fewer than they were.  That is why I say we need to look at this whole question very <Col N="125" /> carefully.  We need to consider the cost of access tourist transport, to see how we can utilise our national airline and shipping companies so that our tourist agencies can provide a competitive and therefore more attractive service.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been discussed throughly during the debate so far.  It cannot be stressed too often that agriculture is the foundation of our economy.  One of the tragedies of our economic history has been our failure to recognise its full potential.  There has been controversy and &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; in recent years on the question of farming taxation. Most farmers do not object to paying a fair share of the national tax burden but it must be a fundamental principle that tax will always be based on ability to pay.</P>
    <P>Farmers should be taxed on their profits, but the Government have introduced an entirely new concept.  Last year they introduced the 2 per cent levy which could not possibly be defended on any criterion.  Now the base has been broadened, the thresholds for liability have been brought down and a new dimension has been added to farmer tax, the resource tax introduced in this budget, This is indefensible by any criterion of fairness or equity.  Whether a farmer can afford to pay or not, whether he makes a profit or a loss, this is another form of levy which will be a disincentive to investment.  There has been a good deal of opposition to this tax not because many more farmers will come into the tax net; farmers recognise their obligation but they object to any system of taxation which is not based on ability to pay or on earnings or profits.  Such a tax is bad.  I completely reject this concept of a resource tax for much the same reasons as I opposed the 2 per cent levy last year.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity over the weekend to read the budget speech of the Minister for Agriculture.  He dealt with many aspects and problems facing Irish agriculture.  It must be remembered that 1979 was a very difficult year for our farmers.  It has been estimated by independent assessors that farming income <Col N="126" /> in 1979 was between 15 per cent and 20 per cent lower than the previous year. This is a serious situation and on top of it farmers now have to face an inflation rate 20 per cent worse than last year. Side by side with that comes the resource tax and as well there is the very serious situation referred to by the Minister, Deputy MacSharry, known as the Gundelach agricultural package which will come before the European Parliament shortly.  That is causing particular concern here.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this super levy idea and he will have the full support of our people, of all political parties in the Oireachtas and of those of us fortunate enough to be members of the European Parliament.  The introduction of this super levy would be a disaster for Irish agriculture, having very serious adverse effects on employment and production in agriculture but particularly on exports.  In the treaty of our EEC accession this country was recognised as comparatively under-developed, as a special region.  Our milk production is only half that of Holland.  I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture referred to this very unfair plan as far as Irish farmers are concerned and if it becomes necessary&mdash;it would be an extreme step&mdash;I would be behind the Minister in exercising his veto if it should come to that.</P>
    <P>There is still fantastic scope for Irish agriculture.  There is need for encouragement to increase production, to go ahead with further land reclamation, arterial drainage and other proposals, particularly the development of industries which we call added value&mdash;new production in the field of agriculture. Because of the difficult situation of some industries there is a great danger of unemployment increasing again.  The Government should pay much more attention to the possibilities offered by the food processing industry and to the potential of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the budget to which one might refer, particularly the matter of industrial policy.  I recognise that there has been a substantial additional <Col N="127" /> subvention to the IDA, SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann, but some of our traditional industries are in a serious situation, particularly the textile industry.  A number of frightening developments have come to light in recent weeks, such as the troubles faced by the Seafield Gentex Group.  Clover Meats, one of the oldest industries in Munster, are faced with the possibility of closure.  There is a serious international situation in regard to the textile industry and all of us involved in EEC affairs must watch the situation carefully, though members of parliament have the least power and the least say of all.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the increase in VAT at the upper level.  Strong representations have been made to me that the carpet industry in particular could be adversely affected.  I note that Deputy Fitzsimons expressed concern about the same industry and also mentioned the problems of the furniture industry.  I am drawing the attention of the Minister for Fínance to the very strong representations made to me by those involved in the carpet industry which has been going through a very difficult period in recent times.  The enterprise with which I am most familiar is Youghal Carpets and the increase in VAT gives grounds for concern.  I would plead for exemption for the carpet and furniture industries and any other industry for which a valid case can be made.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I wish to make in the short time remaining to me.</P>

      <P>The presence here of the Minister for Energy, Deputy Colley, brings to mind his important responsibility in an area which is causing grave concern throughout the western world. As a member of the European Parliament, I am a member of the transport committee as well as the regional policy committee and scarcely a day passes without the raising of the question of energy, fuel supplies and the allocation of substantial funds for research into <Col N="128" /> alternative forms of energy.  The Minister is probably as much aware of this as I am, but it is important to emphasise the vital dimension of the energy question. We are concerned about inflation, which is the mother of unemployment, and there are seven million unemployed in the EEC.  Transcending all these considerations is the fear of a serious world energy shortage.</P>
      <P>Some EEC countries are proceeding with the extension of nuclear power and this is a highly controversial subject.  I have been examining this subject very carefully during recent months and I have discovered that none of the 15 Irish members of the European Parliament is on the energy committee.  However, I hope that will be rectified in the future. We are probably the most vulnerable country in the EEC in this respect.  It is a great tragedy that throughout the years we sat back and assumed that oil would flow forever at a low price.  This applies not only to us but to the other countries of the western world.  We had not allocated money for research into alternative forms of energy and there was a panic rush into nuclear power.  In various statements he has made the new Minister appears to have adopted a realistic approach to the nuclear debate. There are imense possibilities in the development of solar technology and the harnessing of wind and tidal energy.  I have seen in France the generating of electricity by harnessing the tides.  Our Government and the entire EEC must allocate much greater resources in money, personnel and expertise to accelerate research into solar, tidal, wind and biomass types of energy.  The occasion might never arise when we will be faced with nuclear energy as a last resort.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his new post.  In so far as any of his responsibilities impinge on the EEC or have EEC implications, I assure him of my personal co-operation and my desire to be of help in any way.  I am sure the same can be said for my colleagues in the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that this budget <Col N="129" /> contains no indication of any new thinking in relation to economic development and the promotion of social justice in our society.  Sooner or later the taxation problem must be tackled in an objective manner.  I welcome the idea of setting up a commission to examine the whole question of national taxation.  An equitable taxation system is necessary if we are to provide the necessary social services and create a just society.  The correct approach is to have an in-depth examination of the whole question of taxation and this can best be done by a commission.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an méid a dúirt an tAire Airgeadais in a ráiteas ar an 27 Feabhra&mdash;an tagairt a rinne sé don teanga Ghaeilge agus don chultúr náisiúnta.

Bhí an Ghaeltacht faoi mo chúram agus faoi chúram an Aire Ó Colla ar feadh tréimhse agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh an Rialtas seo ar aghaidh chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ar gach uile bhealach.  Is í an Ghaeltacht tobar agus foinse ár dteanga agus ár gcultúr.  Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de ná go mbeidh sé mar phriomh aidhm ag an Rialtas nó ag aon rialtas a thiocfaidh sa todhchaí go mbeidh deiseanna fostaíochta agus caighdeán maith maireachtála ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Muna bhfuil na háiseanna sin ar fáil ní fhanfaidh na daoine óga.  Gan daoine ní bheidh aon Ghaeltacht ann agus gan Gaeltacht ní mairfidh an teanga beo.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> In considering any annual budget it is necessary, if one is to form a balanced judgment, to assess it in the context of what has happened in the past and, in particular, what has happened in the year previous to bringing in the annual budget.  I propose, for that reason, to commence what I have to say by looking at some of the features of 1979 because I believe it is necessary to do so if one is to assess the budget for 1980 in any balanced way.</P>
    <P>When we look at the position arising in 1979, and speaking in an economic sense, we find that there were a number of satisfactory features and there were also some features which gave cause for concern.  I shall start with the good things and mention some of them.  First, the fact that the growth in the economy was well maintained is something which was satisfactory.  That growth was maintained despite external difficulties and self-inflicted wounds.  There were very serious self-inflicted wounds suffered by our economy in 1979.  Of course, by self-inflicted I mean internally, something for which we cannot blame anybody abroad or external conditions.  I am referring in particular, to the industrial relations scene and, above all, to the postal dispute and the damage which that caused to our economy.  I will be referring to certain aspects and results of that later on.  In the context of growth it certainly reduced the growth which would otherwise have been available.  As a consequence&mdash;I do not think we should be under any illusion about this&mdash;failure to achieve the growth which was otherwise available meant, among other things, fewer jobs for our people, less revenue for the State and, therefore, greater resort to borrowing in the short term and a consequential resort to higher taxation this year and in subsequent years.  The level of growth despite all that was well maintained.</P>
    <P>Next, I shall refer to the position of industrial exports, which continued to per form very well.  In fact, they rose by almost 25 per cent in value as compared with 1978. Agricultural exports were particularly disappointing.  The disappointing <Col N="131" /> performance in that area contributed in no small way to the problem of the balance of payments front, which arose later and to which I shall be referring. We should not in our concern at the poor performance on the agricultural exports front lose sight of the very satisfactory performance on the industrial exports front, a performance which has been consistently good over the years and away above world performance.  It is true that this is due to a very great extent to the success that has attended our efforts and the efforts of the IDA, in particular, to attract industry here from abroad which is geared to the export market.  This is undoubtedly the main cause of the sparkling performance of industrial exports over the years but that is not to take from the value of the performance. One of the prime purposes of attracting these industries is precisely to get that type of performance.</P>
    <P>Another area which could only be termed satisfactory is the area of investment. For the second year in succession investment was very substantial.  I regard this particular economic indicator as a very important one and a very heartening one because the substantial level of investment means, among other things, money put into various projects which will in due course produce more jobs for our people.  There would be no hope of expansion in employment without investment. In addition, the level of investment reflects a considerable confidence in the future of our economy and not the kind of confidence which all politicians tend to engage in, particularly if we are on this side of the House, but the kind of confidence that is measured by people putting their money into the economy. That is the real test of confidence.  It means people invest not just short term but long term confidence in our economy.  For those reasons I attach considerable importance to the rate of investment as an economic indicator.</P>
    <P>There was another area of satisfaction and that related to interest rates, particularly mortgage interest rates.  It is quite true that we started off at a high <Col N="132" /> rate but during the course of 1979 there has been a constant and dramatic increase in interest rates around the world. I may be wrong in what I am about to say, because I am just speaking from recollection and I have not checked it, but in my lifetime I do not recall interest rates around the world rising at anything like the rate they have been rising during the past year.  Despite that our interest rates did not increase in line with this worldwide movement and our mortgage interest rates from the building societies stayed steady.  That is something that was also a very satisfactory feature of our economy's performance in 1979.</P>
    <P>However, the outstanding feature of the performance of our economy last year was of course in the area of employment. The increase in employment and the drop in unemployment continued to be spectacular.  This trend was contrary to the trend obtaining in almost every other industrialised country in the world, which proves, if it needs to be proved, that it was not an accident but the result of deliberate Government policy, of it being the priority in economic policy of the Government. Also&mdash;it is worth making the point again because so often the point is wrongly made and it is repeated so often that many people believe it&mdash;the fact is that, if one examines the performance of the economy, one finds that the major portion of the new employment created was created in the private sector and not the public sector.  This was precisely in line with what we had planned and with what we put before the people in our election manifesto.  We said we would have to prime the pump and that we would have to make that effort in the first instance in the public sector but that in due course that was aimed to produce a response in the private sector.  The fact is that it did produce it and the majority of the jobs created were created in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The position is that in the two-and-a-half years approximately which elapsed between the time the Government took office and the end of last year there was a net increase in the numbers at work of <Col N="133" /> about 38,000, having allowed for redundancies, people coming off the land and so on.  I do not think we realise just how spectacular this performance was.  Between April 1973 and April 1977 the numbers at work fell by about 20,000. During the decade of the sixties, which was the previous most successful period of our economic development, there was no increase in the numbers at work but in the two-and-a-half years I am talking about, from the middle of 1977 to the end of 1979, there was a net increase of about 38,000.  I hope that fact will tend to put the achievements of the Government in relation to jobs into true perspective.  It has been the Government's priority in the economic field.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil election manifesto in 1977 will come to be seen as a document which marked a major change in Irish economic and political history.  It represented a new and radical departure because it laid down as a central principle that unemployment would no longer be politically acceptable.  The achievement of full employment became the Government's major economic aim and the steady drop in the numbers out of work since we came into office, and which I have just referred to, shows that we were not indulging in idle promises. In clearly defining full employment as our priority and in implementing policies directed to that end, Fianna Fáil since coming into office charted a course that no future Government can reverse. Fianna Fáil had made a commitment to our young people and I believe that this is a commitment which the young people will insist on from any future administration from any side of the House.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that Deputies opposite should think well about this matter because their approach to the question of full employment over the past two-and-a-half years has been timid, to say the least.  Indeed some people would say, strangely enough, that it is the Leader of the Labour Party who has been most vocal in telling us on these benches that we were too ambitious.  We identified unemployment as a chronic social scourge and we resolved to tackle it on <Col N="134" /> an unprecedented scale.  We saw it as the most urgent of all social requirements, apart from its economic aspects.  I wonder will the parties on the other side of the House try to tell the public that we were wrong to do that.  I wonder will they try to tell our young people that. Let us suppose that we had listened to the timid advice we were getting from the other side of the House.  Let us suppose we had watered down our policies in this regard.  If we had done so the result would have been that many thousands of those who left our schools and colleges in 1978 and last year would now be on the dole.  The fact is of course that were it not for the priority we gave to employment since we came into office we would now be facing a major and, I believe, dangerous crisis, not just economically but socially.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the present generation of young people would put up with a situation in which they would have no hope of a job or a future in their own country, and they would be right not to put up with it.  The great significance of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and the performance based on that in regard to employment is that we have established a situation under which no Government from any side of the House in future will be able to disregard the claims of our young people to a job in their own country.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about aspects of the performance of the economy last year which gave satisfaction but, as I said, there are other aspects which were a cause of concern, and I should like to refer to some of them.  First, our borrowing was too high.  It is true that, if one compares our level of borrowing over a number of years with that of all our partners in the EEC for instance, one finds that the level of borrowing in this country as a percentage of GNP is away above that of our partners.  Traditionally it has been so as long as I can remember. The reason is that we are starting from a much lower base and are engaged in a process of development in which our partners are not.  If we are to develop we have to engage in a level of borrowing <Col N="135" /> which would be unthinkable in an economy which was much more highly developed than ours is or has been in the past.  Allowing for all that, our borrowing was still too high last year and exceeded the target I set out in the 1979 budget.  It is necessary to have a look at why that target was exceeded.  It would be totally unrealistic in any review of our economic performance not to examine why that target was exceeded because it is an important aspect of our economic performance.</P>
    <P>The first item that occurs in the reasons why we exceeded our target is one which is unusual in the sense that, I hope is non-recurring.  I refer to the loss of revenue arising out of the postal dispute.  As I said, I hope this is non-recurring.  This year we get in the revenue that was not collected last year and in that sense it is unusual.  I am subject to correction on this because the figures have changed on a few occasions, but as accurately as I can make it out the amount of revenue we should have collected in 1979 and which did not come in because of the postal dispute amounts to £88 million, being £44 million in tax revenue and £44 million in non-tax revenue.  This is an unusual item in that it did not come in last year but it should come in this year, in addition to the same sum coming in in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>There were other items which do not come into that category&mdash;over-spending for one reason or another which we will not recover.  The first item relates to public sector pay.  It will be recalled that when the 1979 budget was introduced the national understanding had not been negotiated and we were therefore in the position where we had to make some kind of estimate of what would emerge.  I do not think it is revealing any secret if I say that we could not disclose publicly whatever estimate we arrived at, because if we spelled it out in advance of the negotiations one could be sure that that would not be the result of the negotiations. Neither am I revealing any secret when I say our estimate in that regard was an under-estimate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> When the national understanding was finally concluded statements were made on behalf of the Government to the effect that we regarded the level of pay settlement agreed as being at the outer limits of what was tolerable and at a limit that would not have been tolerable but for the fact that it was accompanied by other aspects of the agreement which held out hope of, among other things, a greater degree of industrial relations stability.  Although I do not think it is accepted generally that it has resulted in that, I understand the statistics available in regard to man hours lost in industrial disputes since the national understanding was entered into bear out the fact that there was a considerable improvement, presumably as a result of the national understanding.  In the context in which I am speaking, that is, excess borrowing over what was estimated, the fact is that the cost of the national understanding to public sector pay was considerably more than we were in a position to estimate when the 1979 budget was being prepared.</P>
    <P>As the House will recall, there were special PAYE concessions provided for in the national understanding, the bulk of which were paid in late November last year.  They, of course, were not provided for in the budget.  It is true there were moneys coming in from the EMS subsidies which were not allowed for in the budget.  They were kept in hand last year but the items I am mentioning far exceeded the amount of the subsidies coming in in that way.</P>
    <P>The deficit in the operation of CIE cost about £21 million more than was estimated. There was over-spending on social welfare, partly due to the postal strike, which amounted to £35 million, and there was over-spending on health which amounted to £16 million.  These items are in a different category from the first one because once you are overspent on things like this, the money is gone and can be met at the end of the year only by borrowing.</P>
    <P>Something that arises out of the nature of the first item I mentioned, the £88 million in revenue not collected last <Col N="137" /> year because of the postal dispute which should be collected this year, is the current deficit which, as it turned out in 1979, was about £520 million.  If you allow for the £88 million coming in twice this year&mdash;which is in effect what happens because it comes in this year in respect of last year and this year&mdash;it is fair to say that a comparable current deficit between last year and this year would be obtained by deducting £176 million&mdash;twice the £88 million&mdash;from £520 million, giving a current deficit of about £345 million.</P>
    <P>The current deficit budgeted for by the Minister for Finance in this year's budget is £340 million. Some people have said that the deficit is too high having regard to the factor I mentioned, that is, that the figure compared with last year would be approximately £345 million.  Anybody looking at the overall situation and the circumstances obtaining this year will recognise that the effort involved in keeping the current deficit to that level is considerable and has involved substantial retrenchment in certain areas on the Estimates.  A possible response to the situation which faced the Minister for Finance and the Government in preparing this budget, a response which was urged on us from various quarters, is one that would be disastrous and it has been resisted.</P>
    <P>Another item that gave cause for concern is the performance of the economy in 1979 related to the balance of payments, specifically the adverse trade balance from which we suffered.  It is not enough just to take the overall figure and ignore the underlying realities.  The underlying realities show that broadly speaking there are four categories with which we have to deal.  One is the producers' capital goods which have shown the highest rate of growth in imports. That is a good thing as this consists of equipment and plant going into the creation of more jobs and the more efficient production of goods for sale at home and on the export market.  This is something to be encouraged, something without which we could not have any <Col N="138" /> hope for the future.  The next category is semi-finished goods brought in here for final processing and in most cases for export. A lot of jobs depend on those imports and it is one of the features of our economy that whatever we do we still have to have those substantial imports unless thousands of people are to lose their jobs, and they increased substantially as well.  Consumer goods, which also increased substantially, increased at the lowest rate of increase.  The underlying features of imports show that the highest increase was in producers' capital goods, next in semi-finished products and then in consumer goods, which is the right proportion if we must have increases in our imports.  No matter how important it is that we must have imports of semi-finished goods or producers' capital goods there is of course an absolute limit on how much we can pay for those goods and that is pretty important particularly in relation to the last category, which is oil.</P>
    <P>In 1979 we paid about £140 million more for oil imports than we had paid in the previous year.  I described this on occasions as a hand coming into the Irish economy and taking away £140 million. We are all £140 million poorer as a result.  We cannot make it up by taking it from each other; it has gone out of our economy.  The only way we can catch up upon that is by producing more goods more efficiently and selling them abroad.</P>
    <P>This whole question of the price of oil is looming very much over our economy and those of the rest of the industrialised world.  That is what it did to us last year and it will cause more damage this year. Nobody can say with any degree of certainty what the damage will be, but we can be sure that it will cost a great deal more money and possibly the increase in the price of oil this year will be greater than it was last year.  We have to accept the fact that, bad and all as the increase in oil price is, there is also no certainty of supply, which is another factor that has to be considered.  This has operated very much to the detriment of our balance of payments situation and it has also affected our other EEC partners, with the <Col N="139" /> exception of Britain which has its own oil, and all of them have gone into deficit as a result.  It is nice to know that we have companions in distress but it does not get us over our difficulty and we have to do what we can to remedy it.</P>
    <P>However, we should not go overboard in this regard.  We can take steps in regard to energy.  The whole field of energy is one of major debate around the world, and one important aspect of the debate is the element of energy conservation whereby people can save energy and money at the same time by being aware of what energy they are using and making conscious efforts to use energy efficiently. The Government are acutely aware of this and increased importance is being given to conservation in the overall energy scene.  An aggressive energy policy is being developed and many important elements of such a policy already exist, such as the comprehensive programme in the industrial sector being carried out by the IIRS, the energy savings tips for motorists which have been the subject of publicity campaigns, the availability of advice on insulation in the home, a project using reject heat from an electricity generating station for horticultural purposes and the sponsorship by the Department of Energy of a schools competition for energy conservation being organised by the Junior Chamber of Ireland.  Further conservation measures are being evolved and decisions will be made in the near future.  Relating conservation to economic development in most western democracies, we find that a policy of energy conservation is an essential part of policies for long term economic growth.  Ireland is no exception and this is one of the main reasons why conservation is being given such a high priority by the Government.  I referred earlier to the effect that certain advice was coming from certain quarters which if it had been accepted would have been disastrous. I am referring to the aspects of the economy which gave cause for concern. I have mentioned most of them. Perhaps the one I have not mentioned <Col N="140" /> which is of great importance is inflation. The rising rate of inflation was, of course a cause of concern.  There was the combination of the current deficit being substantially in excess of target set for the reasons that I have mentioned with, and as a consequence, the borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP being substantially in excess of the target set&mdash;although substantially less than it was some years ago&mdash;and the increased rate of inflation.  If one viewed all of these together solely as the aspect of the economy with which one had to be concerned; if one ignored the aspects of the performance of the economy to which I have referred earlier which were a cause of satisfaction and concentrated on the items which were unsatisfactory, one could arrive at the situation in which one would say that we had to take drastic action to deal with this.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our membership of the EMS, the fact that we have an independent currency and the necessity to maintain the value of our currency, when one considers all these things there is a great temptation, particularly for the orthodox, conservative, outdated approach to take over and to say that these are the things to concentrate on and to remedy, no matter what the consequences. People tend to forget that we have had experience in the past of that approach being adopted because of concern about the level of our reserves or the excess of imbalance in our trade deficit.  We have had experience of these kinds of what I can only call panic actions being taken and, all right, they have had the effect in due course of bringing down the excessive deficit in our balance of payments.  They have also had the effect of throwing thousands and thousands of people out of work and many more thousands on to the emigrant boat. They have shown at the end of a year or two a better figure for balance of payments and a better figure in terms of the measurements applied by the Central Bank to some aspects of the economy, but they have shown a tremendous drop in growth in the economy together with a tremendous drop in employment and increase <Col N="141" /> in unemployment and emigration. This is what the record shows.</P>
    <P>There was a grave danger that the Government might be stampeded into that approach in preparing this budget because the manner of viewing the performance of the economy in 1979 was unbalanced in the sense that I have mentioned, with the good aspects of its performance being ignored and the bad aspects of its performance being exaggerated. The realities underlying those bad aspects were ignored or overlooked. I am referring particularly to the burden of the excess in the current deficit, how that occurred, the one-off nature of it and how it is being remedied this year. With no special effort by the Government, that is being remedied.  I am referring also to the nature of the balance of payments, particularly the balance of trade and the nature of the burden there. I do not want to be misunderstood in what I say.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I believe that the economic indicators to which I have referred as giving cause for concern were doing so and it was not open to the Government blindly to ignore these indicators.  I hope I would be the last person to urge such a course. It is essential that the Government take note of these indicators, but it is even more important that in taking notice of these indicators the Government should not panic and that the measures being taken should be designed to remedy these difficulties, taking account of the surrounding circumstances, external and internal, and assuring that we do not sacrifice any of our people's jobs on the altar of financial orthodoxy.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be offensive to anybody, but I have noticed that those who are most vocal in their condemnation of the excessive borrowing&mdash;and it was excessive&mdash;and of the excessive balance of payments deficit&mdash;and it was excessive&mdash;and in their urging what I regard as unthinking measures to remedy this, tend to be people who are well off and in very secure jobs.  They do not tend to be the kind of people who personally are going to be affected by <Col N="142" /> these measures.  If you are one of those people who is or would be affected personally by these measures, then you have a more than academic interest in it and you want a Government who will tackle the problems that will arise but who will tackle them not in a blind way which produces a result on a balance sheet while thousands of people are out of work.  That is the old-fashioned way. That is why I was talking about the out-dated approach to this problem.  &ldquo;A conservative, orthodox, out-dated approach&rdquo; is what I said.  That is the approach that we had in the fifties and we know what it did.  We do not want to repeat those mistakes.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer, in this regard, to another piece of propaganda myth repeated so often that many people now believe it, which is that we, in our election manifesto, went out to buy votes and now find that we cannot pay for them.  That is the way, in shorthand, that it is put.  Of course, the reality is, if one looks at the performance of our economy last year, and even at the areas where it fell down, or fell short of the performance we should have liked&mdash;and I have been referring to some of them&mdash; and analyse the causes, it will be found that the cause of our difficulty does not relate to the Government promising so much that it could not pay for it.  In fact, broadly speaking, the main causes of our problems last year were the increase in the price of oil and the damage we inflicted on ourselves by our inability to settle industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Neither of these causes can be attributed to promises made and the Government being unable to pay for them.  That is a myth and, apart from my understandable objection to that myth from a purely political and, also, a personal point of view, it is very bad for the future of politics and economics in this country if we are to reach a stage where we are going to be told no Government ever again can put before the people an economic programme with targets and say to the people &ldquo;If we work together and if we exercise discipline, we can achieve certain targets but, of course, <Col N="143" /> there are things that we cannot control, and if things externally, like the price of oil, go haywire, then we cannot achieve those targets.  If we go mad in the form of strikes and go-slows and what have you, then we cannot achieve those targets.&rdquo;  Are we to be told now that no Government can ever again put that kind of programme before the people? Are we to take it that that kind of programme, which for the first time asked the people, by treating them as intelligent adults, to exercise their judgment, cannot be put forward in future because this myth is being spread around that to do so means that you are just fooling the people and that, in fact, you are making promises which you cannot keep and cannot pay for? Whatever else may be said, by way of criticism of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, that argument should not be made because it is not true.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the provisions in this year's budget relating to social welfare, not to go into them in detail because that has been done by quite a number of speakers, but to point out, once more, the fact&mdash;and it is a fact&mdash;that although speakers on behalf of the Coalition parties regularly tried to put forward the idea that, whatever their other faults, they always had a greater degree of concern for the weaker sections of the community than we have had, that kind of statement is unfounded, if you look at the facts.  Each budget introduced by this Government since the election, including the budget we are now discussing, bears out the fact that, in real terms, the people who are dependent on social welfare are better treated and better off under this Government than they ever have been under any Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I want to refer to the income tax provisions in the budget which take so many people out of the tax net that it should be a very considerable ease to those people and, indeed, let us be honest, to the Revenue Commissioners as well.  Also, for every married couple, whether the wife is earning or not, the effect <Col N="144" /> of this budget must be very substantially to increase the take-home pay. Again, that has been gone into in detail and I do not want to go into any more detail, but I do want to say that, some time ago, I pointed out that I believed that income splitting was the only practical way of dealing with the problem of giving equity to the married couple under the income tax system when we were trying to deal with a situation where, in some cases, both were earning and in other cases only one was earning.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat, for the record, that income splitting is not the ideal answer. There is no ideal answer.  There are snags about income splitting, but of all the possible solutions, that is the one with the fewest snags.  It was part of the Fianna Fáil policy and was held out as such and, indeed, you find it referred to in the national understanding specifically as part of the Government undertaking that it would work towards income splitting.  Income splitting has been introduced fully in this budget.  We have gone only part of the way up to this.  I want to point out to some people who either did not understand or did not want to understand that, when the Supreme Court made its decision in the Murphy case, a lot of people then understood, for the first time, what the consequences would be if that decision were to be implemented and that if we did not have the provisions announced in this budget there would be clear and gross discrimination in such circumstances against the great majority of married couples where there is only one partner earning.  I tried to point this out on a number of occasions.  Perhaps some people did not like the phrase I used in pointing it out, but a lot did not understand it.  I hope they understand it now and know that the Government has taken steps to ensure that no such discrimination will arise in future.</P>
    <P>My final point refers to the increase in oil prices.  There have been substantial increases in taxes on tobacco and alcohol announced in this budget and these increases on tobacco, alcohol and, also, oil all affect the consumer price index. <Col N="145" /> If people in this country think they can make a wage claim which will, for instance, transfer, to them compensation for the increase in the price of oil, all they can succeed in doing is taking it out of the pockets of other members of the Irish public.  They are not taking it from the Arabs or from the people who are producing the oil, similarly in regard to tobacco and alcohol.  There is general agreement that the load of direct taxation is too high and there were great cries for the Government to reduce the level of direct taxation.  How is any Government to do so if they cannot increase indirect taxation on luxuries without having those increases claimed for and multiplied enormously in every wage claim that is made subsequently?</P>
    <P>I am trying to indicate that it is vitally important, in future wage claims following the expiration of the national understanding, that it be recognised that if compensation is claimed for this kind of increase, then we will simply be setting off a spiral of inflation, with prices following wages and wages following prices and that we will all end up poorer. Whereas if people are prepared to be realistic about this and recognise that this kind of increase, particularly in luxuries, should not be compensated for in wage claims then those who need assistance will get it under this budget and those who do not can choose whether or not they wish to pay the increased tax.  If they do not agree to that and say it must be compensated for in their wage packet we are all in for a very rough ride.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the most significant statement in the Tánaiste's lengthy contribution to the debate has been his own sentence &ldquo;Work together and exercise discipline to achieve targets&rdquo;.  I hope he and the considerable following he has within Fianna Fáil bear that in mind over the next 18 months.  I should like to wish him well in his onerous ministry which will become increasingly important in times to come.</P>
      <P>In his contribution to the budget the Taoiseach stated at column 1321 of the Official Report of 5 March 1980:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> We have set a clear course for the economic ship.  We have prudently trimmed her sails.  We intend to keep her head into the wind and sail safely and steadily through these troubled seas, until calmer and better times arrive.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of speech one makes in the throes of an election to set the electorate at one another's throats, to stir up emotions with one's own party and to leave one in no doubt but that one is capable of producing the goods when necessary.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the economic ship is on course but I am not sure of its destination.  The Taoiseach would do well to remember the seanfhocal, is minic a báthadh long lámh le cuan&mdash;many a ship foundered close to shore.  Probably what he did not write into his speech was that somewhere in the depths of his ship he was shouting to his first mate: &ldquo;are you right there, Michael, are you right?&rdquo; or could it have been &ldquo;Michael, row the boat ashore&rdquo;?  Who else is on the economic ship?  How many more members of the Government who have brought the country to its present position are on board?  I have no doubt that the man to whom I unquestionably offer my oscar for 1979, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who produced some eyebrow-raising performances during the last 12 months, is on board that ship.  If that is the case, coupled with the other incumbents in the different Departments, it leaves the destination of our economic ship in grave doubt.</P>
    <P>Much of the budget debate probably took place in Barretstown Castle and the question posed to the Cabinet was probably quite simply: what do we have to do to alleviate the pressure from the PAYE sector?  Having set about drafting the budget in that context the Taoiseach probably followed with a definite question: who must pay for the concessions to these people?</P>
    <P>To say something about the budget that has not already been said requires very close scrutiny of it.  I do not propose to go into detail in relation to the different <Col N="147" /> benefits and concessions offered. When the adjustments have been taken into account the budget does nothing to put right our severe financial difficulties. Rather it leaves it quite plain that in times of fiscal stringency there is a definite go-ahead from the top to cut back in as many services as possible, We might do well to ask ourselves how we arrive in a situation where the volume of public expenditure exceeds our willingness to pay for it.  The NESC report gives as its first answer to that:</P>
    <P>Whether in opposition or in Government the business of politics is to sell policies for votes.  In normal conditions policies which confer benefits on voters as a whole or on significant groups tend to succeed in attracting votes.  Such policies inevitably involve increases in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is no need to go into great detail on that and its relevance for the past two and a half years since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>The selling of policies and buying of votes is aided by the necessary expansion within the different Departments. Ministers or aspiring Ministers who wish to hold their positions must see that the Department they rule expands in order to attract public opinion.  Competition within different Departments to attract money to implement further policies also aids this.  When one considers that we have 13 spending Ministers with just one tax-collecting Minister it is put clearly in perspective.  A very significant factor is that there has not been, in my memory, enough public discussion about the effectiveness of public expenditure.  Perhaps this is something that could be borne in mind.  It is relevant to the document produced for reform of this House by our party.</P>
    <P>The national debt in 1977 was £4,229 million; in 1978 £5,236 million and the estimated figure this year is £6,500 million.  That leaves one in no doubt that the money in the country does not belong to us and the interest on it will <Col N="148" /> have to be paid for by every man, woman and child over the next half century. All that would lead one to believe that there is need for economic planning and development.  When that Department was set up it was welcomed by this party but the person who occupied that office probably did not descend to the level of the people often enough and has since become the scapegoat of the party for the figures and documents he produced with extreme regularity.  He was very perceptive in one aspect of his employment schemes when he said that if it was necessary to dig holes in the roads of Ireland to create employment that would be done.  That has happened without their being dug and it does not seem as if collective responsibility is there to fill them in.</P>
    <P>Revenue from income tax will still be up by one-third even after all the concessions have been implemented and the change in farmer taxation has taken place.  The Minister for Finance should give a clear explanation as to how this situation has come about.  The tax burden on the agricultural sector is rising rapidly.  Their real income is falling at a rate which the PAYE sector will never experience.  There has not been any great encouragement given to young people to save for their futures, to go it alone, as it were, rather than waiting to be placed on a local authority housing list.  It is a sobering thought to realise that the SDA loan limit, at present amounting to £12,000, entails repayments £30 per week over a 30 year period for a young couple, along with ever increasing prices, rising inflation and other items to be accounted for out of their salaries.  All of those combined create a difficult situation for them.  It might very well happen that we would have a supplementary budget before the end of this year, with indirect taxation penalising the less well off sections of our community, with, more than likely, increased demands for higher wages, plus increased demands for further price increases adding further to the spirial of inflation and creating even more difficulties on the economic scene.  At this point in time the PAYE sector may be somewhat relieved.  But I <Col N="149" /> wonder what will be their feelings when the next budget is introduced, when the effect of a 20 per cent inflation has eaten into the tax concessions now granted.  I think it was Goldsmith who said that the laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law.  I wonder does that philosophy still hold.</P>
    <P>The social welfare increases granted in the budget have been dealt with in detail by numerous speakers.  It would be foolhardy of any politician not to welcome social welfare increases whatever their level.  However, a report published&mdash;I think about ten years ago&mdash;by the European Commission entitled <i>The Perception of poverty in the Member States of the EEC</i> came to the conclusion that there was high evidence of poverty in this country but that the rate of personal satisfaction and confidence in society was relatively high among our people.  I often wonder if there is any real conception within the Cabinet of what is exactly the level of poverty here.  Is there any conception of how people living alone may be suffering various degrees of illness along with extreme loneliness, people who must manage and look after themselves in often-times unhealthy and unhygienic conditions while the price of the basic essentials of life rise constantly?  The effectiveness of local authorities in catering for the housing of such people will be limited further by the cost increases in almost every aspect of the building trade, which in turn will drive more young people to seeking housing allocations from local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said on several occasions that people in this country were living beyond their means.  That may well be because price increases right across the board, indirect taxation and so on, hit the less well off sections of our community, they being the people who must spend a greater proportion of their incomes on the basic essentials of life. But if we do live beyond our means why go to the unecessary expense of providing more State cars, along with additional secretaries, when we have not even got sufficient accommodation in <Col N="150" /> this House for the Deputies at present occupying it?  Indeed this situation will be worsened after the next general election bearing in mind the findings of the commission who have reported on the increased population and the necessity for more Deputies to occupy this House. When it is borne in mind that the price of the executive jet, at approximately £2,250,000, would tar a distance of some 400 miles of road in a rural constituency, it is difficult for rural people to accept the sense of that kind of unnecessary expenditure particularly when they have not even decent access to their towns or villages.  A question being asked increasingly of Government representatives in rural constituencies is: why, if as the Taoiseach says we are living beyond our means, should he force an unnecessary expense on people for something they never wanted?</P>
    <P>The abolition of reconstruction grants also hits rural areas.  One must remember that 50,000 applications, between reconstruction and home conversion heating grants, arrived on the Minister's desk a fortnight after his announcement that these would be withdrawn.  On the assumption that each of those grants would be worth £600, that adds up to £30 million.  Some of the applicants may have had the appropriate work completed already and may not receive the grant allocated to them for possibly several years.</P>
    <P>There is also the withdrawal of lime subsidies which has had an effect already on agriculture, particularly in western areas.  Many small limestone quarries doing a decent job are now in danger of having to close down.  There are tens of thousands of tons of ground limestone awaiting purchase by farmers, farmers who do not seem likely to do so, who are probably unable to do so because of the effect of the withdrawal of the subsidy in addition to having to pay the full transport costs beyond a certain distance.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Taoiseach that the resource tax is purely a temporary measure seems to indicate that he realises that the farming vote still holds <Col N="151" /> quite a punch even though he probably accepts more than anybody else that it is very difficult to change that vote from its traditional acceptance.</P>
    <P>On 28 January last CIE increased their fares by approximately 20 per cent. An ordinary loaf of bread went up by 5p, milk to 13p.  The ESB increased their costs by 20 per cent, following on an increase of 10 per cent last October and an increase of 20 per cent in June last. The cost increase on a ton of coal was over £2.  On 18 February last petrol went up by 10p a gallon, heating oil by 9p a gallon.  These increases do not in any way correspond to the stated forecast in the Fianna Fáil plan for national reconstruction published in 1977, with which everybody is familiar and which stated that in 1977 prices would decrease by 1 per cent, by 2 per cent in 1978, by a further 2 per cent in 1979, and the wonder of it all was that 1980 was left blank. It appears to me that our people have now become price drunk, so much so that if the Taoiseach or Minister for Finance decided to increas the price of the basic essentials of life to an even more alarming degree tomorrow it would still be accepted, because people have not realised that we are heading for economic crucifixion.</P>
    <P>On 20 February last cuts were announced in education, health, agriculture and in public spending.  I find it very difficult to accept what the Taoiseach has been saying about the bright young, well-educated, intelligent population we have.  He must remember that they also are members of the electorate who will determine the political future of a Taoiseach who has announced cuts in education spending.</P>
    <P>To my mind, there is an imbalance in the allocation of money to primary as against third-level education.  If there is a fault in the system at its base it continues right to the top, and the effect of it is often seen in the vastly increased numbers of graduates who leave our third-level institutions with no hope of suitable employment, whereas if proper training and career guidance had been given to them <Col N="152" /> at a lower level they would have a much greater idea of what they want to do before they go into a higher education institution in the first place.</P>
    <P>Reference to VAT reminds me that this tax on sports goods, exclusive of clothing, has been increased by 5 per cent.  This is hypocrisy on the part of a Government who rightly advocate the use of leisure time through healthy activities but who now increase the cost of sports goods by increasing VAT on them by 5 per cent.  It means that many voluntary organisations, sporting organisations and individuals who participate in healthy exercise will have to pay increased costs for the basic essentials of the sports they engage in.</P>
    <P>This VAT increase also affects bicycles to whose use we may all have to return shortly.  There has been a definite increase in the numbers using bicycles both for exercise and for travel in urban areas in recent years.  I suggest that the Minister for Finance should have excluded sporting goods from the list of commodities attracting this increase in VAT.  They are no longer luxuries.  The Minister himself has said that the proper use of leisure time is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>In a report in <i>Management Magazine</i> for February it was stated that the effect of the micro-chip on white collar employment will be devastating.  It was stated that increased production in some offices where the most modern electronic equipment has been installed will be about 400 per cent.  This does not augur well for an increase in employment for white collar workers.  It means that more people will have more leisure time in which to follow healthy pursuits but they will find themselves taxed to a greater degree than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Minister's announcement that he will spend £100,000 on the promotion of hurling is welcome to me as a person interested in the sport.  Since he made that announcement I asked whether that is the value he places on the all-Ireland medals held by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch.  If that is so I did not know that the price of gold had risen so high.  I tabled a Parliamentary Question <Col N="153" /> concerning the expenditure of that £100,000 but the Ceann Comhairle ruled out the question.  I hope the Minister will clear the matter up and tell me what expansion he proposes for that scheme in the next few years, assuming he still occupies that office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I should now like to turn to a number of matters affecting the west of Ireland, in particular County Mayo.  Western farmers face crisis this year.  The cutback by the European Parliament in the agricultural budget does not augur well for the immediate expansion of agriculture in the west.  Early implementation of improved expansion proposals in agriculture cannot occur without increased financial allocations.  This should be given a priority rating because western farmers have had a nail driven into their coffin by the effects of this budget.  In recent years increased labour and transport costs and rising inflation have meant that many small western farmers are facing bankruptcy.  Many of them may have borrowed to the level of their potential and they now find themselves unable to move forward or backward because of the certainty that interest rates on their borrowings will be increased daily.</P>
      <P>If we are to increase agricultural potential in that part of the country it seems ludicrous that the ratio of agricultural instructors to farmers in County Mayo is 484 to 1, which means that one agricultural instructor can spend less than a half day with each of the farmers who need him.  With all the paper work these people have to go through it is virtually impossible for them to carry on the work they can do, have been trained to do and are paid to do to the degree that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in the House the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture told me that this is now the responsibility <Col N="154" /> of An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  I hope he will make the necessary drive, in conjunction with An-COT, to see that the ratio of farmers to agricultural instructors will be decreased and not made any worse than at present. It seems to be a waste of time and valuable money for professional people to have to spend so much time doing clerical work when the work they have been trained to do remains undone.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment bears a heavy responsibility.  The limiting of local authorities to an increase of 10 per cent on what they raised last year on the rates is scandalous.  There is no way in which a western county with the valuations they have can hope to achieve their stated aims in regard to progress with a 10 per cent increase in rates.  It is simply not possible and many of the county managers in statements when presenting their books of estimates have indicated this quite clearly.  It is obvious that many local authorities will not be able to retain their existing work forces throughout this year, taking into account that some of these estimates have not made provision for the continuation of the national understanding.  The rates in County Mayo will not be allowed to exceed £17.4603 in the £.  The net valuation increase is £9,684 and that, plus the 10 per cent ceiling, gives an increase of £795,750 leviable expenditure.</P>
    <P>This is the only area in which there is flexibility within the Estimates.  In a county such as mine this means that the county council are faced with the prospect of possibly having to let go many of their work force and emergency situations which arise in every local authority area are unlikely to be dealt with.  The provision of the rates plus 10 per cent does not take into account the continuation of the national understanding. The cut-backs in such essential services as domestic scavenging collections, the carrying out of housing repairs, the provision of adequate fire services and remedying the appalling conditions of the roads leads one to believe that the needs of the west are being put off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> I expect that the Minister for the Environment should by now have received a request for a meeting from Mayo County Council so that they may explain to him the hopeless situation facing the county engineer in relation to the implementation of very necessary works.</P>

      <P>They may decide on that. However, we are limited to 10 per cent and we usually obey the regulations.  The road structure in many western counties will simply collapse unless emergency funds are granted.  Essential work will be drastically hit and seriously curtailed by the effect of the budget and I refer to <Col N="156" /> water and sewerage schemes and environmental works, such as the removal of dangerous buildings and the provision of community centres.</P>
      <P>The seventies was a period of exceptional expansion but the spectre of unemployment which has haunted Europe for some years has begun to raise its head again and I hope it can be kept down.  The 10 per cent ceiling placed by the Minister for the Environment does not give rural counties the necessary buoyancy to generate sufficient income to carry out necessary works.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister for Energy that his Department proposed to set up an experimental biomass station in the Erris region and the rate of planting essential for the setting up of such a station would not be in keeping with the needs of the proposed station.  Six hundred acres of planting would be the equivalent of only 125 acres of milled peat and with a five-or seven-year period of rotation much more intensive planting would be needed immediately if the experimental station, which we would all welcome, is to go ahead.</P>
      <P>The report on the place of the arts in Irish education recommends the setting up in the west of Ireland of a school of music, either as part of the university or as a separate entity, so that students with a practical leaning towards music could follow the subject to its conclusion.  This could be done through the co-operation of the vocational education committees and the regional colleges or the university. The Taoiseach should have an interest in this matter, being a person who has expressly stated his interest in culture and the arts.  I would add that there does not appear to be anybody on the Arts Council who comes from the west.  If this long-term aim of setting up a school of music is ever to have government assistance, it must be followed up.</P>
      <P>The case has been made for a third-level college of education for County Mayo.  Figures have been compiled which are in the possession of the Department.  A further case will be made in the near future regarding the provision of this facility for Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> The effect of the ending of the employment maintenance scheme has been most serious in Westport where the board of Seafield Gentex decided to close the textile factory which had for many years operated there on a profitable basis.  This, to my untrained eye, would appear to be asset stripping and unless the board come up with some logical economic reasons for deciding to close the factory I could not accept their explanation.  The fact that 208 male jobs are now on the line means that 50 per cent of the total male work force of Westport and the surrounding area now face unemployment.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has met several deputations in relation to this problem and he has made announcements about increased employment in the Westport area through the good offices of the IDA and their promotional activities.  However, this will not relieve the situation to the necessary extent and this extra employment would have been coming to Westport anyway.</P>
    <P>The Seafield Gentex factory is about to close, even though approximately 38 per cent of their output is for the public service sector.  Industrial relations within the factory have been good throughout the years and the machinery is of the most modern type.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism should see to it that the IDA move in and purchase the building, saving at least that proportion of the output which is for the public service sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the IDA and the new Údarás na Gaeltachta, which took over the functions of Gaeltarra Eireann, those people have done a great job over the years in attracting industry to rural Ireland.  The commitment and ability of the IDA and of Gaeltarra Eireann, which is now Údarás na Gaeltachta is not matched by the allocation of the Minister for the Environment and the allocations of other Departments to rural constituencies.  It is very difficult to attract an international employer to an area which has a labour force but which may not have sufficient water, decent access roads which may have very <Col N="158" /> limited telephone and telex communications, and which may or may not be served by public transport.  It is very difficult to say to an international employer: &ldquo;If you come to this part of the country we guarantee you a good, hard working labour force and we will provide you with all the necessary facilities&rdquo;. Many of the smaller factories in the West of Ireland have great difficulty in keeping lines open to their international bodies because of the telephone and telex communications they have at present.  I am sure the Minister of State responsible for those matters has had many instances of this in his constituency and that he will give a priority rating to this.</P>
    <P>In relation to the attitude of the Department of Education towards to VECs and the regulations which the Department introduced about the number of teachers which the VECs can employ, there is no conception whatsoever of the physical extent of many of the counties that some VECs cover.  According to Department regulations each VEC committee are entitled to employ a specific number of permanent full-time teachers in relation to the number of pupils attending schools within the VEC area.  It is ludicrous to suggest that if a teacher has some spare time in a school he or she should be asked to teach in another VEC school which may well be 80 and possibly 100 miles away from it. The Department of Education should not see a VEC area as a single unit and not introduce regulations which deter teachers from teaching in some schools and make it almost impossible for them to do so in others.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Energy spoke in relation to his energy programme he mentioned on several occasions the spectacular progress that has been made by his party since taking office in 1977.  We have all placed our hopes in the Porcupine Bank.  We all hope, no matter what political affiliations we have, that there is oil there which may come to our economic rescue.  The Minister for Energy should ensure through one of the Departments here or through connections he might have in Brussels in relation <Col N="159" /> to infrastructural development, that our bogs are open to the people who have the ability to use them.  We could obtain from our bogs a very real source of energy which would mean a real cut back on the amount of heating oil bought and consumed at the moment. There does not appear to be any realisation of the actual extent of our boglands. There was a song which spoke about &ldquo;Francis Farrelly from the bogs below Belmullet in the County of Mayo&rdquo;. Much of that pensinsula and other large areas in that county are composed of either deep or relatively shallow bog which could be opened up if proper infrastructural facilities were given to people from surrounding areas.  Something should be done about this in co-operation with the Land Commission, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Environment.  This will become more essential as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment does not seem to realise that areas directly outside Gaeltacht areas which have not had sufficient finance because of Gaeltacht policies over the years are simply neglected from the infrastructural point of view.  There appears to be a great number of applicants for electricity supply in County Mayo.  I have raised this with the Department of Energy on several occasions and they have been very good in giving me lengthy replies.  It appears that the county is taken in two halves and the waiting period has now gone up to anything from nine to 12 months.  There are cases of people living in fully completed houses waiting for the new housing grant for at least six months and no power connections from the ESB. I have not been made aware of this in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister on several occasions to look seriously at the actual number of labourers employed in those areas by the ESB, because there is no realisation that a complete overhaul of existing line work is necessary and that line deviations are necessary.  There is no provision for damage resulting from storms which can be quite serious.  There <Col N="160" /> is no appreciation of the large number of new house applicants who apply for planning permission each week.  An application for planning permission in rural Ireland usually means that a new house will be built at some stage.  The ESB should review the labour content, skilled or unskilled in their proposals over a period of years when they draw up their budgets.  It seems that the number of people employed by them is not sufficient to provide proper supply at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Programme for National Development, 1978-1981, laid special emphasis on the very high number of young people who are unemployed.  It did say that special arrangements would be very necessary to meet those.  The youth employment action team which was set up has since disappeared.  It produced many proposals some of which were acted upon and some of which were not.  The real fact is now that allocation for the youth employment action team, the work experience programme and the employment maintenance allowance has been reduced from £12.3 million last year to approximately £5.8 million this year.  Someone said the youth of a nation are the guard of its posterity.  One can read two things into that.  It does not appear as if the commitment given to the youth of Ireland by the Government over the past two-and-a-half years is being carried out to effect in the allocations given to the youth employment area.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to the right of young people to a job in their own country. I want to remind him that young people are sensitive and responsive and can be very critical when necessary. They will demand not alone a continuing commitment from whatever Government is in power but an actual creation of real jobs.  It is not realistic for any Government to give a commitment to young people in the very serious terms that this Government have done and then to deny them the opportunity to have decent employment in their own country.  The right to work is a basic right all over the world.  I would not want to see our young people denied this right.  The <Col N="161" /> Taoiseach has stressed his appreciation and awareness of the number of young people here.  I would ask him to bear that in mind because frustration is growing among young people.  It would appear that some of them have been left in a limbo of no hope, no courage, no confidence and no jobs.  New problems demand new solutions.  The old ways will no longer do.  A new approach and a new vision is needed if jobs are to be provided and the commitment given by the Government to our young people has to be seen to its proper conclusion.  If a new vision is necessary I trust that whoever sits in the crow's nest on the ship of state, the economic ship that is now sailing through stormy waters, can see beyond the threat of the very real economic trouble that stares this country in the face at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Members of this House are speaking on the budget it is only natural to speak about current matters; I am referring to the current budget. Generally speaking, the current budget has an immediate effect of hitting a person's pocket whether by way of increasing the amount of money in it through income tax reliefs or by way of taking money out of it.  But the most important part of the budget is the capital budget because it is on the amount of money provided in the capital budget that the growth in the economy in the next year depends.  In the capital budget this year we find that a substantial proportion of the programme affects the building industry. It is estimated that the amount involved in 1980 is £722 million, an increase of some £110 million or 18 per cent on the 1979 out-turn of £612 million.  Irrespective of what has been said this means that there is an increase of £110 million in the 1980 budget.  If we look down through the Public Capital Programme we see the figures for housing, and for water and sewerage are up by £4 million; the allocation for hospitals is up from £25 million to £28 million.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who is sitting here will be delighted that his Department's allocation has gone up <Col N="162" /> from £70 million to £100 million.  I have no doubt that in the next couple of years many people waiting for telephones will have them.  There is also an increase of £3 million for roads.</P>
      <P>I can recall hearing demands at meetings mainly from Opposition members wanting to know what road grants they were getting because they were all expecting a cut-back in these due to forecasts that had been made.  But the amount of money in the capital programme, particularly for road grants and for housing have been increased.  I cannot speak for every county council and I am not a member of my own county council now through no fault of my own but I know that in Carlow there has been an increase of 10 per cent in the amount of money for road development. When one thinks of world recession which affects us so much as a trading country it is indeed a great credit to the Government that this extra money is available in the capital budget for what we refer to as the social end of things, roads, houses, hospitals and so on.  This year in the capital budget, as last year and in the last few years since we joined the Community we got money from the regional fund.  This amounted to £41 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former member of the European Parliament for six-and-a-half years I am pleased that our colleagues in the European Parliament on the Government side of the House are in the group of European Progressive Democrats who have pursued a policy so helpful to Ireland not alone in relation to the regional fund and the social fund but also in relation to the common agricultural policy.  I recall as a candidate during the European elections last June we were attacked at length by the leader of the Opposition because of our association with our French and Danish colleagues in the European Progressive Democrats.  Let me put it on record that I am very proud that we in Fianna Fail are associated with the French and with the Danes because the two countries, like ourselves, support the CAP and fully support the development and expansion of the regional fund and <Col N="163" /> the social fund.  Since the European elections two groupings within the European Parliament have not come up for as much discussion in the press or in the media as they did previously because the elections have been over for five years. At the same time considering the group that Fine Gael are associated with, the European People's Party, and the party that Labour are associated with, the Socialists who are against and are trying to knock the CAP, I wonder if the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are beginning to eat the words they spoke during the European elections.</P>
    <P>Today the Taoiseach made a statement on his very successful visit to France and on his meetings with the French President and Prime Minister which helped so much to strengthen the ties that exist between Ireland and France, two countries in the EEC who have the same policies, plans and ideals for the Europe they would like to see, a Europe where the richer countries would help the poorer, where a sound regional fund would be adopted and where the common agricultural policy would be protected.  I was pleased to hear the leader of the Opposition say he was glad this meeting had taken place but it was a pity that during the election campaign he attacked a party which is part of the present French Government.  We are all human and I am sure those politicians took note of what the Irish people said about them.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record Fianna Fail's happy relationship with the French and with the Danes who are pursuing in Europe a policy that will be financially beneficial to everybody, particularly the agricultural community. One of the principal reasons we joined the EEC was the aid we get from Europe through the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Recently Commissioner Gundelach said there may be a reduction in the sugar quota for Ireland.  It was gratifying to see industrialists, farmers, and trade <Col N="164" /> unionists meet in Nenagh, on the same platform, united in an attempt to ensure that our quota for sugar beet is protected in the European Community.  This is something we should appreciate.  The Taoiseach's message of let the eighties be the decade of endeavour was personified by those people who stood together on that platform working for the benefit of all the people, irrespective of what class, union or association they belong to.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the Minister for Agriculture a recent development within the Community that could affect our sugar quota, that is, an iso-glucose manufactured from corn or maize which can be used as a substitute for sugar in industrial sugar.  If this is used as a substitute for industrial sugar it will affect the amount of sugar from the manufacture of sugar beet or refined sugar cane that would be needed.  Recent figures given to me by the Minister were that last year 165,000 tons of this type of sugar were manufactured.  I hope the Minister will continue with determination in his dealings with the European Commission and the Council of Ministers to ensure that this type of sugar will not be part of the European policy.</P>
    <P>The current budget is the one most people talk about.  Let us briefly look back at the speculation prior to the budget.  Most people were talking about a terrible budget with taxation of unbelieveable amounts and so on.  We had a budget which was welcomed by sections of the community which in the past had never even commented on a budget. It was a fair budget which showed for the first time in real terms that the Government were changing from direct to indirect taxation.  I fully support that idea because it means we are switching to pay as you spend, in other words, optional spending.</P>
    <P>No matter what tax is introduced, it will hit somebody.  A Minister for Finance who can bring in a form of taxation acceptable to everybody will be a magician.  We all know that will never happen.  I was glad to hear that a commission to review our taxation system <Col N="165" /> was being set up and that any inequities that exist in the present system will be examined. When the commission is set up all sections of the community will be invited to submit their proposals, not expecting that all of them will be accepted by the commission or by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned in this House, and the Minister for Finance gave an interview to a Sunday newspaper saying, that the resource tax on land would be reviewed.  Everybody in this House was pleased to hear that. The member of the Labour Party who spoke immediately afterwards said the Government were backing off the resource tax as they had backed off the 2 per cent tax.  As far as I am concerned the resource tax is part of the financial resolutions, is part of the budget and will be part of the Finance Bill to be circulated. If, due to pressure, we start changing financial resolutions we will run into trouble and could end up discussing and amending the budget for months after it has been passed.  I believe the present system, where the Government have discussions with all interested sections of the community prior to the budget to try and work out and include in the budget suggestions made, is the best one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the youth.  I am surprised a young Deputy should refer to the youth as being disillusioned, disappointed, inactive, and he used a number of adjectives I did not write down.  Our youth are dedicated, energetic and willing&mdash;they take a far deeper interest in current affairs and in the economy than many young people of previous generations&mdash;and we should not try to make out that they are not.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the amenity schemes for the provision of sporting centres put forward by the Minister of State at the Department of Education.  This was part of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  In 1977 Fianna Fáil provided almost £1 million for the development of amenities for young people. This was acclaimed not only because it provided amenities but <Col N="166" /> because young people were employed in the spending of grants made available by the Government.  The fact that in a time of tight credit this amount of money was increased from less than £1 million to £4½ million in 1979 and is now part and parcel of our educational policy has been acclaimed by the people.  Because of our increasing young population and because of shorter working hours it is most important that amenities for playing and for pleasure should be available. If these amenities are not provided the energy of the young people not used up in manly sport will be diverted to other areas, to the pub and other places.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more welcome than the youth employment schemes and the extra money made available for them.  To quote the Taoiseach, the eighties should be a time of endeavour.  Every Deputy and every member of every organisation and association should make the eighties a decade of endeavour.  We are all part of the one island and we all have to earn a living.  There is only one cake and it must be divided equitably among the people.  If one section gets too much some other section gets too little.  The more unity, the more meetings we have among the unions, associations and various sections, the better for the development of the country.</P>
    <P>Because of the increase in the tax free allowances the PAYE people get more into their pockets.  So do the people in the poorer sections, specifically the social welfare recipients.  Never before in the history of the State did an increase equal the increases given in this budget either in real terms or in cash terms.  In October 1979 the across the board increase represented about 31 per cent. The increase in old age pension for a man and his wife was as much as their total pension in 1970.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government on the excellent budget presented to the House, a budget people did not believe was possible, bearing in mind the international situation, the world recession, the cost of energy and our balance of payments situation.  No one could <Col N="167" /> have believed that the Minister and the Government could introduce a budget as fair and equitable as the one introduced this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take the Tánaiste to task for some of his comments this evening.  The Tánaiste spent some time complimenting himself and the Government on increase in employment opportunities in the public sector and pointed out that the Government deliberately set about widening the scope of the public sector to create jobs in all areas of it. Having made that decision the Tánaiste has no right to moan and weep in the next breath about the excessive cost of that extra employment.  As former Minister for Finance the Tánaiste must have known that if the public sector were numerically increased the cost would also increase.  The Tánaiste also made the point that our balance of payments deficit, over £500 million, was due largely to the postal dispute and that the loss of revenue involved showed up very clearly at the end of the year.  The solution was quite simple: the Government could have moved in and settled the dispute. It was the obvious thing to do especially when dealing with a section of the service whose pay and conditions badly needed reassessment in any case.</P>
      <P>This budget will do nothing to help our balance of payments in spite of some of the hardships of the budget.  My most serious criticism of the budget is that at the end of the day our position will be no better.  The increase in the price of petrol, drink, cigarettes and all the rest of it would be acceptable if it led to an improvement in our balance of payments without having, as we have at the moment, the vast majority of income tax from the PAYE sector paying the interest on our national debt.  This aspect has been completely avoided by the Taoiseach and by the last speaker.  We are running the country down the greasy slope of debts and more debts with a grim prospect of lack of buoyancy in those areas which would be likely to help and relieve and solve the problems that they have created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> The Minister this evening in this House denied that the Fianna Fáil manifesto in any way contributed to the present situation.  I contradict him flatly on this because of the squandermania type of manifesto which handed out fresh strawberries in December to what proved to be a very gullible electorate and gave away over £100 million in car tax and rates and, more serious still, raised the expectations of people in the PAYE and other sectors far above what we could afford to sustain.  That was most serious of all.  We had been telling the people that there was no bonanza around the corner.  We have no oil wells and no hidden resources.  All we have is what we can produce by the sweat of our brow from our limited amount of farmland. There is no point in saying we are going to create more jobs; the first priority of any Government is to create jobs, but creating jobs, especially in productive employment, is going to cost a lot of money.  We can see for ourselves what the job cost is with the IDA, running into thousands of pounds per job. This has to be done and it is very laudable, but it costs money.  There is no point in saying to anybody at election time or any other time, &ldquo;Vote for us and we will deliver the goods.  We can afford to give all these things&rdquo;.  This is not the case, has not been and will not be the case.</P>
    <P>In the year that we are now facing, a gloom has set in in agriculture.  This gloomy uncertainty has been created by the Government in the areas of taxation and production.  When we were in Government with Deputy Clinton as Minister for Agriculture there was no doubt about farm production and expansion. Expansion was the operative word right across the board.  We expanded our sugar-beet factories, our co-operative societies and our meat factories and we were on the go.  Now we are being told to put on the brakes.  How in God's name does the Minister for Finance expect farmers to pay a £95 million tax bill and at the same time tell them that they have got to cut back in production?  Is he serious about this suicidal course?  It will be very interesting to hear what the new <Col N="169" /> farm leader will have to say when he takes over.  I am convinced that unless credit facilities are readily made available to farmers, unless they are told to go out and produce sugar-beet in the proper quantities as they have always done since we joined the EEC, unless the Minister for Agriculture will ensure that no super levies will be imposed on them, we cannot hope to restore farm confidence which has been shaken badly since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned the effects of the budget on tourism.  As the Fine Gael spokesman on tourism all I can do is endorse what he has said.  With petrol prices as they are at the moment compared with petrol prices in the North of Ireland and Britain, who is going to bring a car from Britain over here?  People who like a quiet holiday driving around our country roads have been deliberately discouraged by this budget. There are also the general costs of running hotels and heating oil costs, all of which lend themselves to increases in prices.  One of the most attractive features in Irish holiday-making down the years, especially in relation to our farm guesthouses and seaside resorts, was that we could offer good value for money.  Now our energy costs and budgetary charges have put up these costs and people naturally tend to go elsewhere.  Tourism is our largest industry and we should be encouraging people to come here and doing everything possible to develop and expand our tourist industry.  Instead of that we are putting on the brakes deliberately and telling people to go elsewhere by jacking up inordinately the petrol costs and also, in the capital budget mentioned by the previous speaker, by our whole approach to our expenditure on roads.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="170" />&ldquo;(1)  That it is expedient that a Select Committee consisting of 7 members (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Minister of State) be appointed to be joined with a Select Committee to be appointed by Seanad Eireann to form a Joint Committee (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Autonomous Non-Commercial Bodies) to examine the Reports and Accounts, policies, overall operational results and value for money of the bodies referred to in the Schedule and shall report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas and make such recommendations as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(2)  That after consultation with the Joint Committee, the Minister for the Public Service with the agreement of the Minister for Finance may include from time to time the names of further bodies and, with the consent of the Joint Committee and the Minister for Finance, may delete from the Schedules the names of any bodies which he considers no longer ought to be subject to scrutiny by the Committee.</P>
    <P>(3)  In particular the Joint Committee shall examine whether the form and content of the report and accounts presented by the bodies referred to the Oireachtas is adequate, and if they are presented sufficiently promptly, or if a report and accounts is not presented to the Oireachtas by a particular body, whether they should be, and if so in what form.  The Joint Committee shall report on these matters to both Houses of the Oireachtas within one year of its being established.</P>
    <P>(4)  That if so requested by a body, the Joint Committee shall refrain from publishing confidential information regarding the body's activities and plans.</P>
    <P>(5)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to engage the services of persons <Col N="171" /> with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular enquiries and to incur such other expenditure, including travel expenses, as may be necessary to the discharge of its functions.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the Joint Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>(7)  That all questions in the Joint Committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the motion is to set up a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad to supervise the 57 State bodies which are listed in the Schedule to the motion. A Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad already exists to supervise the activities of what are known as commercial semi-State bodies.  About 30 such bodies are covered by that committee. However, there are another 57 State-sponsored bodies listed in this motion which are not covered by that committee. They are classified as non-commercial bodies.  There is probably a greater argument for having parliamentary supervision of these non-commercial bodies, because they do not have the discipline of having to make a profit.</P>
    <P>The 57 non-commercial bodies spent about £700 million in 1979.  The most significant group of bodies amongst them are the health boards, which spent about £500 million.  Also included are the Industrial Development Authority, Bord Fáilte, An Córas Beostóic agus Feola and many other important agencies. It is vital that these important agencies be supervised.  It is proposed, therefore, that a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, with similar powers to the existing one on commercial bodies, be established in relation to these 57 non-commercial bodies.</P>
    <P>The detailed terms of reference of this new committee are set out in the motion. They closely follow those of the Joint Committee on commercial bodies, set up some years ago, which has worked very successfully under these terms of reference.  They give the committee strong investigative powers, but provide for safeguards against the publication of confidential information.  There is a major innovation, however, in respect of <Col N="174" /> this new committee, in that it will have the power to have its proceedings broadcast by radio, subject to appropriate safeguards.</P>
    <P>The motion also proposes to give the committee power to inquire into the promptness with which the State bodies concerned present their annual reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There have been cases of very long delays in the presentation of annual reports&mdash; delays, indeed, which would not be acceptable if private companies were concerned, reporting to their private shareholders.  If they are not acceptable in the case of private companies, they certainly should not be acceptable in the case of companies which are reporting to the taxpayers of this country and are spending the taxpayers' money.  The most glaring example of this is to be found in the case of the health boards which, between them, spend over £550 million, or 20 per cent of the entire current budget of the Irish Government. These boards are obliged by the Health Act (No. 1), 1970, to present abstracts of certified accounts to the Dáil each year.  However, in the case of none of the boards have reports for any year since 1976 been presented.  In the case of the North Eastern Health Board, this board have presented no report in respect of any of the following years: 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979.  When this matter was raised recently in the Dáil, the excuse was given that there was a legal dispute between the boards and the local government auditor about their respective functions.  A court case between the two State bodies seems likely to ensue and is a very bad thing.  This would not have happened if the law had been properly drafted in the first place.</P>
    <P>A committee such as is proposed in this motion would help to avoid the recurrence of wasteful and expensive litigation between two tax financed bodies as is now contemplated.  In any event, the health boards are not the only example of delays in presenting reports. The National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty and the <Col N="175" /> Law Reform Commission have presented no reports to this House yet for 1977, 1978 or 1979.  The Higher Education Authority, An Foras Forbartha, BIM, the Nuclear Energy Board, the Irish Goods Council and the Library Council have not presented reports yet for 1978 or 1979.  The utility of reports presented after such a long delay is highly questionable.  The delay, in itself, suggests a great need for investigation by a committee of this House, such as is proposed in this motion.</P>
    <P>The motion also proposes that the committee shall take steps to bring the content and format of the reports up to date.  The aim should be to have reports which are comparable with one another and give genuine and comprehensible information about the relative efficiency of each body and of each sub-unit of each body.  The problem at the moment is that, as far as the layman is concerned, it is very hard to make sense of the reports presented to this House by the various bodies.  This House consists almost exclusively of laymen and it is essential that laymen representing the lay public be in a position to make sense of these reports.  We are proposing, therefore, that this new committee would, within a period of 12 months, be asked to examine the format and content of all the reports being presented, so as to bring about uniform standards for these reports, so that they will be easily understood and comparable with one another and also act as a real measure of the efficiency of the bodies in question.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the problem of these reports not giving a breakdown as to the way in which money is spent by individual sub units of the board.  A very good example of this occurred in the Dáil last week, when there were questions put to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture about the reports of Bord na gCon&mdash;the Greyhound Board.  It transpired regrettably, that, while global figures for the profitability of greyhound tracks were given by Bord na gCon, no report was <Col N="176" /> given about the profitability of individual greyhound tracks, which of course is the relevant information which one would seek.  This example bears out the need for a committee of this nature.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept this motion and to set up the proposed committee. The basic need for such a committee is simply expressed.  These bodies spend vast sums of public money each year on matters of important public policy, such as health, industrial and agricultural development, tourism, training and education.  Public representatives, and through them the taxpayer, should have the power to supervise and investigate the use of such vast sums of public money in respect of such important matters of public policy.  That is the very least that the electorate would expect us to do here in this House.  When these 57 boards were set up in the first place, the powers of this House were thereby diminished.  The boards took over the powers which had previously been exercised by Departments of State in relation to which we could put down parliamentary questions.  However, once these boards have been set up, if we put down a question about the matter with which they are concerned, the Minister can, if he wishes claim that he has no official function in the matter and refuse to answer the Dáil question.  Sometimes, of course, the Minister does give the information, but it is only as a courtesy, not as a matter to which the Dáil has a right. By setting up the committee envisaged in this motion, the House will be merely reasserting a power which it had previously surrendered.</P>
    <P>The proposed committee will help Ministers and Governments to do their job by sharing the work load of supervising the myriad activities of the bodies concerned in this motion.  The new committee will free Minister to concentrate on central issues of policy making.  Now, it may well be argued by some in this House that this committee would be an invasion of the functions of the Government. I do not accept that it would.  We all know that the Cabinet consists of only 15 men and it is not possible for 15 <Col N="177" /> men to be aware of the detailed activities of each of the 57 bodies listed in this motion. If we set up a committee of this sort it will merely help Ministers by allowing some of the detailed work they are now forced to do in order to ensure public accountability for public funds to be shared with other Members of the House of all parties, so that Ministers can concentrate on the really important central decisions which Government have to make about the allocation of public funds.  I do not see any conflict between this motion and the prerogative of the Government.  I believe, in fact, that this motion will assist the Government &mdash;whatever Government it is&mdash;to do its job better and I ask the House to accept it as one means of enabling the Dáil and Seanad to play a more constructive and creative role in our national life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle we welcome this motion.  In the case of a number of the boards and bodies listed under the motion the House has already had a limited opportunity of discussing a considerable amount of business these boards do under the Estimates for the various Departments. There are certain issues on which the attitudes of all Deputies broadly coincide. I am sure there is no one on this side of the House who is not in sympathy with the general principle underlying this motion, that is, that the activities of bodies established in the public domain, drawing money from the public purse, should be made more open to formal review by the Oireachtas.  There is a very real distinction between that unobjectionable principle and the means of achieving it as embodied in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference set out in the motion seemed to be influenced by those of the existing Joint Oireachtas committee which deals with the major commercial State-sponsored bodies.  In his opening remarks Deputy Bruton said that it was somewhat similar to that.  I am not convinced that this influence makes for an entirely satisfactory approach.  There <Col N="178" /> are three fundamental points of difference between the bodies covered by this motion and the commercial State-sponsored bodies covered by the existing committee.  The bodies covered by the existing committee have one vital characteristic in common.  They are intended to live by the sale of the goods and services they provide.  The presence of a profit or loss on their accounts provides a convenient if crude yardstick against which their performance over any given period can be measured.  The soundness of an investment decision in any one of them can be tested with reasonable objectivity.</P>
    <P>On the other hand most of the bodies listed in the schedule to this motion fall into a radically different category.  They do not operate to commercial criteria and were never intended to.  Readymade accounting criteria, such as a return in capital employed, do not provide a suitable means for the evaluation of the success or failure of bodies which are not in the business of making profit.  The second major difference between commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies is that the task entrusted to each commercial body was one which in other circumstances might have been discharged by private enterprise. It is therefore possible to view a commercial organisation in comparative isolation and still form a reasonable view of its success or failure.</P>
    <P>Each of the non-commercial bodies was established to carry out a task or range of tasks which was thought to be suitable for discharge by an organisation outside the conventional civil service framework.  That decision may have facilitated effective day to day performance of the particular task.  It did not remove the strong link between that task and the policy of the Minister or the Department concerned.  Looking at the list of bodies included in the schedule to the motion I can easily discern three instances which suggest that their activity, policy or operational result cannot be seriously examined in isolation from the Ministers and Departments to which they are attached.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> In the case of health boards or general medical service payment board the level of demand upon their services would seem to be determined to a significant extent by the policy of the Minister and Government in relation to eligibility for service.  Their capacity to cope with demand could be affected by the level of resources made available to them.  The operations of the promotional or training bodies would similarly be affected by Ministerial and Government decisions on resource allocation.  A number of bodies listed in the schedule were established to provide advice to a particular Minister.  How can their effectiveness be judged without questioning ministerial policy?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1 of the motion attempts to cope with these problems by providing in the terms of reference that the proposed committee should examine the reports and accounts, policies, overall operational results and value for money of the bodies referred to in the schedule. I accept that this phraseology represents a serious attempt by the Opposition to cope with the problems I have mentioned rather than an attempt to subject departmental policy-making to a new form of parliamentary scrutiny.  But in my view it underestimates the complexity of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a further difference between the bodies covered in the motion and those which fall within the remit of the existing committee which is of some relevance to the motion.  The commercial bodies derive their revenue in varying but large measure from the sale of their goods and services to an extent which varies with the circumstances of each body.  The manner in which they dispose of such revenue was not, prior to the committee's establishment, a matter with which this House would readily concern itself.  It is possible for these bodies to acquire and deploy investment funds without reference to this House.  The position of most of the bodies with which this motion deals is radically different. The bulk of their revenue and capital expenditure is derived from moneys voted <Col N="180" /> by this House.  This House has, through the Estimate debates, an opportunity to consider and give voice to its views on the overall performance of those bodies and the desirability of the levels of subvention provided.</P>
    <P>Given these basic differences between commercial and non-commercial State sponsored bodies, I have some doubts about setting up to examine non-commercial bodies a committee which appears to be based very closely on the model of the existing commercial committee. If and when we come to establishing a non-commercial committee we will have to look long and hard at the terms of reference to cover adequately the very significant differences.  Although I have so far stressed the differences between bodies to which this motion relates and those which come under scrutiny of the existing committee on commercial State-sponsored bodies, I admit there are certain points of resemblance.  Despite their commercial mandate it is generally recognised that the operation of these commercial State bodies has a social dimension.  This view was acknowledged during the debates in 1976 and 1978 on the establishment and reactivation of the existing Joint Committee and has been confirmed by the reports which the Joint Committee have already published.</P>
    <P>When the committee was being reactivated in 1978 we on this side made it clear that we did not see its terms of reference as being immutable.  However, we were prepared to give them a fair trial and to review them in the light of practical experience of the committee's operations.  While the committee has been active in the interim it has not yet completed a cycle of reports on all the bodies within its ambit.  Therefore it is too early to draw valid conclusions on necessary or desirable amendments to its terms of reference.  Any conclusions which relate to the social dimension or to the impact on the bodies of wider governmental policies would be important to the terms of reference of any committee or committee of the kind now proposed.</P>
    <P>Therefore I wish to make it clear that <Col N="181" /> the Government do not object to the principle of having a committee, or committees, to oversee the activities of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. However, we have some reservations about the arrangements proposed in the present motion.  We doubt the wisdom of moving into this area at a time when we are not yet in a position to evaluate the work of the existing committee on commercial bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure those Members of the House concerned about this area of Oireachtas scrutiny over the public sector welcome the opportunity of discussing, however briefly, the role of such public scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing this motion I give Deputy Bruton the benefit of having his heart in the right place and I concede to him the progressive motives in so doing. He did not elaborate on the precise functions of such a committee, but presumably they would be along the lines of the existing committee for the commercial State-sponsored bodies. However perhaps one could say that the proposed structure envisaged by Deputy Bruton and his colleagues may not necessarily, on examination, be the most desirable.  Deputy Bruton is to be commended on having tabled the motion and affording us an opportunity of placing our views on record as to what precisely those of us in the Labour Party and in other political parties feel and how we should progress in this area.  We tend to draw an excessive demarcation line in the State-sponsored sector between the commercial and non-commercial bodies. I do not know where that concept developed.  I suspect it was the product of an over-fertile public service accounting mind when perhaps somebody at Cabinet level said the State should not get too involved in commercial activities. One could advance that argument time and again.  For example, currently under the existing Joint Committee we have CIE&mdash;just to take an example&mdash;the bulk cost of whose real activities comes from State revenue&mdash;it is not really a commercial outfit at all in that sense.  Indeed, <Col N="182" /> it is arguable whether it should even come under the auspices of the existing Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  There are many other bodies one would wish to have involved in scrutiny, many others listed by Deputy Bruton in this motion.  Certainly one could put some extremely interesting questions to some of them&mdash;for example, the Hospitals Trust Board, Bord Fáilte, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara&mdash;on their role in Irish commercial and non-commercial operations which would be a fascinating study, as would be the whole role of An Bord Pleanála as it has developed.  Indeed one would like to have an opportunity to talk to the officers of the Law Reform Commission or the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>I have my doubts about the benefit of setting up another Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, spending a great deal of time, of necessary public money, effort and energy within that structure.  I would suggest that we should have a somewhat different structure.  Speaking as a member of the existing Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies I feel we fulfil a very useful function.  We do an extremely valuable amount of work.  It has been extremely valuable to the Members of both Houses who have had the opportunity of examining bodies like CIE&mdash;eleven Members only from both Houses serve on it.  When we examined bodies like CIE, or Aer Lingus, as we are currently doing, the B and I, or say, the National Stud we found these examinations to be extremely helpful in learning about those State-sponsored bodies.  I have no doubt that the bodies concerned likewise have found their experience valuable when responding to the inquiries and views of members of the Committee.</P>
    <P>But in the long run I would suggest to Deputy Bruton that what we should have are Departmental Joint Committees of both Houses of the Oireachtas. We must remember that we will have another 20 Deputies in this House in the very near future, within two years, when there will be approximately 170 Deputies and 60 Senators.  If these Deputies are not to suffer from palsy, <Col N="183" /> political paralysis, just sitting on these backbenches they should be involved in Departmental Estimates Committees of both Houses.  Indeed, each of the 15 Minister of State, those new, glorified men, instead of running around the country, opening garages, fish and chip shops and entertaining constituents to the affairs, stories and gossip of the State, should have his own Estimates committee and be responsible therefor. Not alone should that Joint Committee be responsible for the departmental Estimates&mdash;as in the United Kingdom they are currently responsible&mdash;but it should be responsible also for the State-sponsored bodies under that departmental Estimate.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister of State at the Department of Labour and the Public Service and the Minister for Labour present.  In time, perhaps during the next Dáil, we might have a Labour Estimate Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to examine the work of the Department of Labour, the Estimate itself, and also the role of AnCO which certainly warrants examination, a massive organisation which has grown over the years whose members, apart from writing the odd letter to the Director-General making representations about somebody having a place in a training course or something like that, know very little about its role.  Such proposed committees should have an opportunity of examining the role of, say, the Employment Equality Agency, if it is still in existence after the next general election.  On that basis committee members would have an opportunity of being directly involved.</P>
    <P>I share the great public-spirited concern of Deputy Bruton in this area.  He has been quite consistent in this.  I echo the strictures he has made on many occasions in regard to the delays of some bodies in issuing their reports.  I would urge also that we be careful in this area.  I would be particularly emphatic that the role of the Joint Committee on which I currently serve be forward-looking and progressive, ensuring that the outcome is <Col N="184" /> not merely a negative examination of the accounts of those State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>We had an example recently of the Director-General of the Irish Management Institute launching a tirade&mdash;that is what I would call it&mdash;on the role of the State in public enterprise.  I thought that rather strange coming from such a person because it was disclosed to me in a Dáil Question last week that that body, got £6 million to £7 million in taxpayers' money to run their outfit in the past decade.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful to examine those bodies in a constructive, forward-looking way so that the chief executives and staff will not be scared stiff coming before a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas but that they will put forward views which will help the economic and social development of the nation.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;premature&rdquo; because if something is premature in Dáil Éireann nothing will happen about it for ten years, but I think this motion is somewhat premature.  I hope that Deputy Bruton will be here in the next Dáil and I urge him to reactivate the motion in 18 months or, if he is then on the other side, to put forward his proposals early in the next Dáil.</P>
    <P>The existing Joint Committee have examined seven bodies and are in the process of reporting on four or five others, and I suggest that before we go out of office we should produce an omnibus report explaining our experience of the work we have done.  In the next Dáil that Joint Committee will be reappointed with a new chairman.  At the moment the Joint Committee have two officers and two persons servicing these officers, a staff of four.  If we were to employ technical staff and a consultant staff, our annual budget would be about £200,000. I am not in any way opposed to spending that kind of money because the volume of expenditure in the public sector is vast.  I share with Deputy Bruton, as a member of a local authority, grave reservations about some health board expenditure throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> If we are to do the kind of examination in great depth that the motion calls for we would need a substantial secretariat.  I suggest that for the moment the current Joint Committee should continue with the excellent work they have been doing.  I share Deputy Bruton's view that if the proposed Joint Committee are to be appointed their proceedings should be publicised because it would bring to the public a good deal of important information.  I can see a new role for the new Ministers of State in a new structure.</P>
    <P>In that context I suggest we should have a look at what has been done in the UK where I understand they have about 14 different committees at Westminster examining departmental estimates and accounts of associated nationalised bodies.  They bring them all in periodically and give them a through examination and report to the House. That is the kind of structure we might very well evolve in the years ahead.  That is not in any way to decry the Joint Committee we now have or the spirit of the motion which in principle the Labour Party support because we see it as a valuable contribution to the public debate in this area.  I am sure Deputy Bruton would like to see introduced a more effective system of checks rather than the simple unilateral approach of appointing one committee which would find itself overwhelmed trying to get to grips with the work.  I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with Deputy Bruton but we are both concerned in this area and I am offering my observations in that spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and first of all I should like to point out that part of Fine Gael's policy is to reform the Dáil.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not suggest an alternative to this motion.  He said that he has some doubts as to the wisdom of this but that he would welcome something like it if it were phrased differently.  The Minister knows that we have got to bring a new approach to the procedure in the Dáil.  I think all sides of the House will agree <Col N="186" /> with that.  This evening the Minister had a chance to put a constructive alternative proposal to the House.  I did not expect him to agree with everything Deputy Bruton said, and of course Deputy Desmond suggested something completely new.</P>
      <P>Obviously Fianna Fáil back benchers find the Dáil proceedings extremely boring. They feel they are nothing better than rubber stamps.  On this side there is nothing to prevent us from getting up to air our view but many Deputies on the other side come in here to mark time and record their votes.  All Deputies should get involved actively in the work of the Oireachtas.  The Minister spoke about the difference between commercial and non-commercial State bodies.  Those 57 bodies mentioned involve a budget of £700 million and the elected representatives of the people should have some kind of say in the spending of that money.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael and Labour Deputies do not have a true function in the spending of that money.  Of course, there are Minister who have control over those bodies but they are the only control units we have.  I am sure the Minister will agree that all sides of the House would be able to give valuable ideas and contribute new thinking on the semi-State bodies.  The £700 million I mentioned is a vast sum of money.  It is hard to believe that the health boards alone account for £550 million.  Any backbenchers seeking information about a health board must put down a question to the Minister for Health, who may reply that this is a matter for the local health board.  Elected representatives have no direct say.  When there are 57 bodies, some things are bound to be wrong.  The ideal is to have about 14 committees, each committee dealing with six or seven of these bodies.  They would act as watchdogs and this might be their most important role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure of taking part in the five-day debate on the Fisheries Bill.  I <Col N="187" /> said in my final contribution that the Bill could have been thrashed out if two Fianna Fáil Deputies, two Fine Gael Deputies and, perhaps, one Labour Deputy had met together and the Bill might then have been passed in a half day. Procedure should be changed and streamlined.  I know from my own experience that there is nothing worse than sitting as a backbencher on the Government side and rubber-stamping everything a Minister does.  The Minister could get ideas from the proposed committees. We should be acting as &ldquo;think tanks&rdquo; and this is what we are elected to be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond talked about the £200,000 expenses for secretarial work. This is practically nothing when speaking in terms of £800 million and it would probably be saved during the first week these committees would sit.  People in semi-State bodies who are not answerable to this House would know that there was a watchdog committee and they might keep a tighter eye on things.  The Minister should have said he would look into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State has said, we on the Government side are in sympathy with the general principle which underlies this motion, that the activities of bodies established in the public interest and drawing money from the public purse should be open to formal review by the Oireachtas.  Speakers have already <Col N="188" /> drawn attention to the fact that we have a particularly large number of more or less autonomous public bodies which are not open to scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee, as are Departments of State.  It is only in recent years that we have seen the establishment of a direct formal relationship between some of these bodies and the Oireachtas with the setting up of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies which deals with commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I should take the opportunity to compliment the members of that committee for their work to date.  It is to their credit that they have produced seven reports already on the 27 bodies and four or five others are at present under active consideration.</P>
      <P>In discussing the motion to establish the committee in 1976 and again in the course of the debate on their reactivation in 1978, speakers referred to the desirability of making a similar arrangement for bodies left outside the terms of reference of the committee, namely, the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. I accept that a reasonable case can be made for setting up the machinery to allow the Oireachtas to examine the activities of the bodies in question.  In agreeing with the general principle behind the motion, let me make it quite clear that I am not for a moment implying any lack of faith in these bodies or any criticism of their operation.  On the contrary, I am glad of the opportunity to acknowledge that they have contributed in a most significant way to the wellbeing of the community.  A cursory glance at the list of bodies in the Schedule is sufficient to remind us of the broad range of activities in which they are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has already referred to the timing of this motion and I agree that it would be unwise to set up a second joint committee to examine State-sponsored bodies.  Time may well show that a second committee is needed. Deputy Desmond adopted a very sensible approach to this whole area and I listened with much interest to what he said.  He obviously agreed with some of <Col N="189" /> the sentiments expressed by my colleague and now by me.  It may well be that a second committee is needed and we have an open mind on the question, but given that the existing committee have been in existence for a fairly short time we should prefer to postpone for the moment a decision on the establishment of a second committee.</P>
    <P>Although the existing committee were first established in late 1976, they had time for only a few meetings before the dissolution of the twentieth Dáil.  Most of those meetings were probably taken up with procedural arrangements.  The committee were re-established in 1978 and set about their enormous task with a great deal of vigour and commitment. They have published reports on the following State-sponsored bodies: Min Fhéir Teoranta, the National Stud, the British and Irish Steam Packet Company, Córas Iompair Éireann, Ceimicí Teoranta, Aer Rianta and Arramara Teoranta.  Given that the committee's terms of reference cover the investigation of some 27 bodies, it will be granted that they are still only in the early stages of operation.</P>
    <P>We have often referred in this House to the physical difficulty of operating the committee system and Deputies who serve or have served on committees will readily agree that membership of a committee makes extremely heavy demands on time and energy.  Given the already heavy demands on Deputies and Senators, the Government consider it is only fair to prospective members of a new joint committee, as well as being a matter of prudence, to wait until we have more experience of the workings of the committee at present dealing with the commercial bodies.  When that committee have had the opportunity to examine a greater number of bodies operating in a wide variety of fields, we will be in a much better position to decide whether the setting up of a second committee is the best way to achieve what we desire in this field.  Should this be the case, the practical experience gained by the present committee will be of great value when it comes to drawing up suitable <Col N="190" /> terms of reference and later in establishing fruitful working methods.</P>
    <P>Deputy White had some comments to make about a reference of his recently in the House to the desirability of having the Committee Stage of the Fisheries Bill taken by such a committee and he said that it would have been a more desirable exercise.  For expediency that can be argued both ways.  If we look, for example, at the experience in relation to the Wild Life Bill taken by a Special Committee of the House during the life of the previous Dail, we will all realise that that was a very lengthy committee session and certainly imposed hardship on the small number of Deputies who had to carry the work load involved.  While it may on occasion work well, on other occasions it may not work so well.  I know the Government's views here would not be to say &ldquo;no changes&rdquo;.  I am one of those who would be quite prepared to consider any change but it should not be change just for the sake of change.  Certain examination in detail must be given to what has been done to date.  I have already spoken at some length about the committee working on the State-sponsored Bodies.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which we should not lose sight of here.  In February 1979, as a result of an Opposition motion and an uncontested Government amendment, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were asked to consider and advise on Estimate procedures.  Deputy Barry Desmond referred to ways and means within the Estimate procedures through which the possibility of certain changes there could be examined.  The Committee have not yet completed their deliberations.  It is not unlikely that the recommendations they may make will have the effect of increasing the degree to which the bodies listed in the schedule to the present motion will be subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas since they derive a large proportion of their voted moneys from Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this would be the complete solution.  However, as the Report of the Committee on Procedure <Col N="191" /> and Privileges may well have a bearing on the matter in hand and as the Committee have not yet reported, I believe we have an additional reason for proceeding with due caution on a proposal such as this one.  There are also a few details of the proposal before us on which I am to some extent concerned about taking a decision without giving it more time and study and examining what difficulties it could create.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the broadcasting of the proceedings of the House and of the Committee.  I have a very open mind in regard to proceedings of the House being broadcast but I should sound a note of caution as to whether it is the appropriate type of committee to commence that type of exercise with for the obvious reason that in the examination of such bodies there may well be confidential, important information that, for commercial reasons, it may not be right to disclose to certain other people perhaps in some form of competition with the State body concerned.  As well, I know that the matter of broadcasting the business of the House has been under consideration on more than one occasion by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>As regards another new committee examining non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, I am not yet convinced that this is the right area for its introduction. I believe the House should have more time to study the possible implications for the 57 companies listed in the schedule.  That is a note of caution I wish to express.  I have a very open mind in relation to broadcasting the proceedings of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also said that long delays have occurred in submitting reports and therefore he would impose a 12-month limit as in paragraph 3 of the motion.  He said it is justified.  I agree with him because I believe that reports of bodies should be submitted as quickly as possible.  I am sure that one cannot expect them for a certain period of time after the end of a particular year.  On the <Col N="192" /> other hand, I believe it is unfair to Members of the House and others that there should be a very long delay.  It may be that this particular paragraph in the motion could well strangle the proceedings of such a committee.  What happens if, for example, due to unforeseen circumstances in the compiling of a particular report, the report is not submitted within 12 months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my desire that reports would come out fairly quickly but that is a point I should make.  The Deputy will get an opportunity to clarify that point.  With regard to the general principle of the motion I believe it needs closer examination for the reasons I have mentioned, further experience of the working of the committee examining the commercial State-sponsored organisations, the possible relevance of the recommendations of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who are examining how Estimates should be handled in the House.  That Committee, as pointed out by Deputy Desmond, could possibly come up with some very useful and innovative ideas in that area.</P>
      <P>Although we are rejecting the present proposal, the Government appreciate the concern shown by Deputies in this important matter.  To underscore our sincerity in this I will undertake to the House to have the whole question reexamined within one year from now in the light of the experience gained in the operation of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and taking account of any recommendations which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges may make, which might be relevant to the matter.  Like Deputy Desmond I consider, with that undertaking, that the Deputy should withdraw his motion. We have had the opportunity of airing it in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's concluding remarks are relevant to the motion before the House.  I would like to compliment Deputy Bruton on putting <Col N="193" /> down the motion, which is timely.  As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored Bodies looking at the commercial bodies, my experience to date and that of my colleagues is that there was a need to set up that committee.  I believe in due time we will have a committee to look at the non-commercial semi-State bodies.  I suggest to the Minister that possibly during the autumn sitting of the House he would consider calling in the existing joint committee looking into the trading semi-State bodies and discussing with them the experience they have built up over three years having seen ten or 12 semi-State organisations.</P>
      <P>The semi-State organisations which we have had the pleasure of working with so far certainly grasped the opportunity to improve communications with the politicians; for far too long Ministers were answering questions about semi-State bodies in the House in a negative way saying that they were not accountable for the everyday activities of those bodies and that there was a board of directors attached to them.  The committee has certainly helped to bridge that gap.  The more progressive semi-State bodies that have so far been examined have taken this opportunity to put forward their track record in the form of a memorandum; they have set out their programme and their requirements for the future.  Contact with the Minister responsible has also been improved by the members on the committee. Experience to date has shown that there is a need for the committee as suggested by Deputy Bruton.  The Minister's view is realistic.  We should let it run on for the remainder of 1980 and then consider the setting up of a committee for the non-commercial semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many benefits attached to the committee.  Semi-State bodies put their proposals which are accepted by the civil service and then reports and recommendations are put before the Minister responsible.  This new committee would have the duty, as the existing <Col N="194" /> committee have, of putting before Ministers another view of the workings of these bodies.  These bodies are now playing a vital role in the trading and non-trading sector of our economy.  In non-commercial area some of the promotional semi-State companies carry vast responsibility for the improvement of our economy by promoting Ireland. Bord Fáilte in particular have a major role to play in the economy.  The importance of these bodies is increasing and the politicians should have the opportunity to meet them face to face and hear their views and their recommendations and table before the two Houses reports and suggestions as to how we can improve their performance.  There has been a gap over the years where Ministers do not deal directly with the semi-State bodies.  This gap must be filled.  The motion would go a long way towards that.  I feel the Minister's recommendation should be accepted by Deputy Bruton. The intention is there and probably by year end the idea behind this motion will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the workings of the committee system, its effectiveness, its efficiency.  He also referred to the burden it puts on a limited number within the two Houses.  That is something that should be said.  The Deputies and Senators who work on these committees are playing a vital role in improving the relationship with the semi-State companies.  I have no doubt that such a committee could improve the situation in the non-commercial areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the broadcasting of the workings of the suggested committee.  Our experience to date on the existing committee has been that here are a number of confidential comments made by executives of semi-State bodies in answer to questions put by members of the committee and it would not always be desirable to broadcast this information which could be of benefit to other bodies in the private commercial sector who could utilise information made available in this way.  So I do not feel that broadcasting the workings of this type of committee would be <Col N="195" /> desirable.  The press have access to the existing committee and their reporters regularly attend our working sessions and have obviously got a lot of useful information from the exchanges between politicians and the responsible semi-State directors.  But I feel that the broadcasting of the workings of any of these committees or of the workings of the House would create a tremendous difficulty as to who would do the editing, who would cut the tape at the appropriate time; there would be a possibility of leaving an impression on an unfinished paragraph and so on.  The experience across the water has been that broadcasting tends to give an incorrect impression of an overall debate.  I suggest that broadcasting is probably not realistic or useful. However, the procedure presently followed by the existing committee where confidential comments may be made by executives of semi-State bodies and the committee accepts them in that way is very satisfactory.  I suggest that when the Minister has had time to study the workings of the existing committee he will consider that that same procedure is probably the most workable.</P>
    <P>The opportunity which the existing committee has given to the semi-State bodies to come forward with their recommendations, their request for future Government funds, is a vital area of communication which has proved very beneficial.  The new committee will benefit from the experience to date in the area of research and back-up staff.  I hope that this new committee when set up, probably in 1981, will be on the same lines as the existing committee.</P>
    <P>I recall the Tánaiste addressing the first working session of the directors of the semi-State bodies and the Oireachtas Members.  He urged that there should be greater discussion of the role the semi-State bodies saw themselves playing in the growth of the economy even to the extent of suggesting that some semi-State companies should consider participation in certain areas of private enterprise. We have seen no great developments in that area but it is a suggestion <Col N="196" /> worth following up.  The actual going out on the ground that the existing committee have had with the seven semi-State bodies that have been looked at to date has brought about a tremendous opportunity for an exchange of views between the key personnel and employees in the semi-State bodies and has shown the excellent job they are doing on behalf of the nation.  For that reason the non-trading semi-State organisations will probably agree that they would like the opportunity to meet the politicians and report on their areas of responsibility, how they are performing, and how they propose to expand their activities and increase their involvement to the betterment of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would be in favour of the Minister's suggestion that we should allow 1980 to be the final year for gaining experience of the existing joint Oireachtas committee. Would the Minister consider discussing with the committee during the autumn session our experiences to date in this area?  If he did, we could put forward positive suggestions about the expanding and setting up of another committee in this direction.</P>
    <P>There are a number of non-commercial semi-State organisations which play a very vital role and which will take on even greater responsibility in the future.  For that reason contact should be improved.  As we move into the eighties State involvement through semi-State organisations will be a continually growing feature.  The recent setting up of the State organisation to handle the purchasing and distribution of oil is another indication of the need for indirect State involvement in the everyday affairs of the country.  Therefore, I agree with the Minister's suggestion that we give ourselves the remainder of this year to gain experience of the existing joint committee and hopefully early in 1981 he will bring forward a motion setting up a similar committee but which will not deal with broadcasting.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time to comment on the facilities made available to members of committees.  If we are to have more committee work, secretarial and <Col N="197" /> support facilities will have to be increased, particularly for Members serving on committees.  For Members of the existing semi-State committee there is a great deal of study involved.  They must study very complex presentations from semi-State bodies.  If they are to study these presentations in detail, they will have to be provided with additional facilities.  When setting up new committees the Minister, who is also responsible for the public sector, will have to look into this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all Members for the serious and nonpartisan way in which this motion was approached.  I was disappointed the Minister had not seen his way either to accept this motion or to put forward specific amendments to it in order to remove or change those aspects he found of doubtful value, and thereby enable an amended motion to be passed this evening and a committee to start working straightaway.</P>
      <P>The Minister said we needed another 12 months to look at this matter and to make a mature judgement to see what was the best means of doing the job.  I want to point out that this motion has been on the Order Paper of the Dáil for the past 12 months.  The Minister and his predecessor had that 12-month period to examine the terms of this motion and to come up with something better.  Having had that period to examine this subject knowing it was likely to be brought up in this House, and not having come up with anything better in the course of this debate, it is something of a disappointment that the Minister should ask for another 12 months, and maybe he will come up with something then.  In my view, he is not tackling the matter as energetically as one might have hoped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something must be done to ensure that there is proper control by Members of the Dáil and the Seanad on the spending of vast sums of public money by these bodies.  If we postpone action on this matter for another 12 months, or for another two years as seems more likely, another £1,500 million will <Col N="198" /> probably have been spent by these bodies without any scrutiny such as is envisaged in this motion.  That would be regrettable.  It would be far better if we were to act on this matter tonight.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the arguments put forward from the other side.  The Minister of State said there was an opportunity, albeit a limited one, to discuss these matters in the course of the Estimates debates.  The vast majority of Estimates laid before this House are never discussed here because of lack of parliamentary time and because they must be passed within the first six months of the year.  The majority of these estimates, encompassing in many cases up to £2,000 million, are passed in one day without any debate and only a small number, perhaps three or four, seven or eight Estimates, are discussed in full in this House.  To say we have the opportunity of discussing the role of these bodies in the course of the Estimates debates is no answer to the case being made.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made much of the difference between the bodies with which this motion is concerned and the commercial bodies with which the existing joint committee are concerned.  He said the motion's terms were too closely related to those of the commercial bodies and therefore inappropriate to non-commercial bodies.  At the same time he made the argument that we should wait to see what will be the experience of the committee dealing with commercial bodies before acting on non-commercial bodies, thereby admitting that there was a great deal in common between the two. The Minister cannot have it both ways. Either the committee on commercial bodies are relevant and their terms of reference are relevant to non-commercial bodies in which case we would act on this motion on terms of reference similar to those contained in the commercial bodies, or they are not relevant in which case the Minister should put forward some alternative.  The Minister cannot use that argument and neither act on this motion nor put forward an alternative. The Minister in his contribution seemed <Col N="199" /> to suggest that perhaps we would not need a second joint committee.  If we were to try to get the existing committee to deal with these bodies, at the rate they are at present dealing with bodies&mdash;about three or four a year&mdash;we would not get around to all of the bodies for about 25 years.  That would not be acceptable if the two committees were to be grouped together.</P>

      <P>Seven in two years.  Some members queried the suggestion in the motion that the committee have the power to have their proceedings broadcast by radio.  The motion says that the committee</P>
      <P>shall have power to allow its proceedings to be broadcast by radio subject to such safeguards or limitations as it thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a matter for the committee whether they allowed their proceedings to be broadcast or not and it would be a matter for the committee to lay down whatever safeguards they thought necessary.  The press are allowed into the proceedings of the joint committee as it is.  I cannot see how members of the press can be allowed in and not radio.  If the press are there the material will become public anyway.  To say that radio should not be allowed in because confidential discussions may take place but that the press can be allowed in, suggests that in some way the committee can nobble the press so that they do not mention anything confidential.  If the members of the press are there and they hear something they will report it so that argument is not on.  If the press can be <Col N="200" /> there there is no reason why radio should not be allowed to be there subject to appropriate safeguards.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were asked to look at the procedure in relation to the Estimate.  The committee were given a six-month deadline to complete their work but they came back about eight months ago and asked for a further six months.  They have not come back to look for a further extension and I do not know where they stand now.  Given that the committee got an extension of six months they should have come back for a further extension if they had not presented their report.  As a non-member of the committee I am disappointed that they have not yet been able to come up with any report, even an interim report on the question of how best to deal with the Estimates.  I agree with the Minister that that report would be relevant to this. If the Minister accepted this motion we could make alterations in its terms of reference to take account of my recommendations made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice earlier today of my intention to raise on the Adjournment of the House this evening the question of the adequacy of the arrangements being made by the health boards to meet the immediate financial needs of people living in the Republic who have pensions coming from Northern Ireland and who are unable to have their pension cheques cashed at the moment because of the industrial dispute in the Northern Bank and the Ulster Bank, upon whom those cheques are drawn, concerning transactions involving the conversion of the British £ Sterling into the Irish £.  At the moment approximately 2,000 pensioners living in the Republic are receiving pensions from Northern Ireland. These people have not received any of their pensions since December.  Many, or indeed most of them, are already living on very low incomes and are unlikely to have reserves on which to draw to meet the situation of being for almost three months without any pension cheques. The fact that their number is small does not, in any sense, mitigate the seriousness of the problem.  If a larger number were involved, I am sure something would have been done by now because of the political and moral pressures which a large number of pensioners deprived of their pensions for about three months would have brought to bear on all the parties involved in this dispute.  The number in this case, however, is small and nothing has been done, so far to cope with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About three weeks ago, when the matter was brought to my attention, I contacted the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Irish Banks Standings Committee.  I asked the Irish Banks Standing Committee to have something done so that these cheques could be met and the people paid.  It is incumbent <Col N="204" /> on all the parties to do something about this very serious problem which has left certain pensioners in a serious situation.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the matter more exactly, I propose to read an extract from a letter which I received from one such pensioner, a lady living in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I am in receipt of a social welfare pension from Stormont which is payable to me each month by cheque since the death of my husband in 1975....  When my February cheque came to hand on the 15th February, I tried to cash same at every bank in Dublin, but they refused to cash it, due to the bank dispute in Northern Ireland concerning the Irish punt.  This monthly cheque helps to pay the rent for my one bedroom flat I occupy here now and I have to draw on my small capital in order to prevent my rent from getting into arrears.  I wrote to Stormont asking them what arrangements they had made for Northern Ireland pensioners to receive their pensions, but received no reply.</P>
    <P>These are the main points from that letter. That pensioner is obiviously in a very serious financial situation.</P>
    <P>The matter that I have asked to have raised here today is somewhat narrower than the general question.  I have asked the Minister to investigate the adequacy of the arrangements being made in the meantime, for so long as this dispute lasts, to pay out money to these people to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the health boards through their powers to give supplementary welfare assistance, have the facility to meet this problem.  They can either make absolute payments to these people which would not be refundable or, alternatively, they could give them a loan of money equivalent to the amount of their pension, so that when they do cash their pension cheques&mdash;presumably when the dispute is over and all the cheques come together for cashing&mdash;the money paid out by the health board can be refunded to them by the pensioner, thereby ensuring that the State is not at a loss.  I am <Col N="205" /> convinced that one or other arrangement should be made in this case to ensure that these people receive an income.  The fact that they are Northern Ireland pensioners does not take from the responsibility of the Minister or the health boards in this matter.  These people are now living in this jurisdiction and if they have not got anything to live on, it is our responsibility in this House and in this jurisdiction to do something to make sure that they have.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to instruct all the health boards to make it widely known in their areas to any Northern Ireland pensioners who are unable to cash their cheques that if they contact their local welfare officer money will be made available to them to tide them over until such time as this dispute is ended and the cheques which they are now receiving and are unable to cash can, in fact, be cashed.  Perhaps the Government could make some arrangements with the Northern Ireland authorities to recoup that money if necessary but, in any event, eventually the dispute will be over and the money can then be recouped and any short-term problem of finance of the health boards will be overcome.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to act on this matter immediately, in view of the fact that these people have already suffered considerable hardship.  I would ask the Minister to make a definite announcement on the matter, if not tonight, within the next two or three days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has supplied some details in quoting from a letter concerning a lady in Dublin who is having difficulty. If he would like to give us those details afterwards, we shall certainly follow that case or any other cases which he may come across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two cases, in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  Any person in receipt of a Northern Ireland pension who is experiencing any undue hardship, as a result of the industrial dispute in the North of Ireland banks, can apply to a community welfare officer for a supplementary <Col N="206" /> welfare allowance and some have been doing this.</P>
      <P>The health boards have been circularised requesting that they adopt the most liberal approach possible in dealing with people affected by the dispute, to avoid any hardship which might occur as a result.  This is part of the point to which Deputy Bruton refers.  To date, only a very small number of cases have arisen and these have been dealt with sympathetically by the health boards.  As I said, if the Deputy has any details of cases which have not been treated satisfactorily, I shall have them investigated immediately.</P>
      <P>The letter which was sent to the health boards was to each programme manager in the community care section of the health board.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is concerned that persons in receipt of pensions from Northern Ireland should, as far as possible, be cushioned against any hardship arising from the above dispute.  Accordingly, the Minister requests that health boards should adopt the most liberal approach possible in dealing with people affected by the dispute, seeking help by way of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme.</P>
      <P>That was a letter concerning the bank dispute in Northern Ireland, sent on 14 March to each health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 14 March.  I could not say exactly when the Deputy raised the matter.  Obviously it was very close to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, a letter has gone to them to that effect.  Certainly, I accept the point made by the Deputy requesting the health boards to make it known to the people concerned that this facility is available and to do what they can in that respect.  I am not quite clear on how they can make it known most readily. Perhaps raising the matter here will help make it known in the first instance.  I will <Col N="207" /> ask them if they can do anything further to ensure that the people concerned know of the facility that is there for them in the event of their needing it.  If the Deputy or any other Deputy has details of any cases where hardship is arising I <Col N="208" /> shall be only too glad to look into it directly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 March 1980.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, however, I should say that the early run of salmon in the River Slaney this year was well above that of recent years.</P>

Inquiries regarding her employment record subsequently established, however, that she had additional contributions in the 1979-80 contribution year which qualified her for benefit.  Payment of disability benefit has now been made in respect of the period from 23 July 1979, the fourth day of incapacity to 31 August 1979, the date of the last medical certificate received in respect of that claim.</P>
      <P>The only medical certificates received subsequently were two first certificates dated 30 October 1979 and 31 January 1980.  No payment was due on these certificates as they only indicate that she was incapable of work on those dates.</P>
      <P>She has since been requested to state the periods, if any, during which she was incapable of work subsequent to those dates and to submit medical evidence covering the full periods of incapacity on each occasion.  On receipt of such evidence the question of payment of disability benefit will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> She has also been requested to submit details of her earnings while employed so that her entitlement to pay-related benefit may be determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The final draft of the new comprehensive scheme for transferring service for superannuation purposes has been circulated to all organisations covered by the existing arrangements for transferring pension rights, asking them to indicate whether they are prepared to accept its terms.  Other public sector organisations were also circulated. Definitive replies are still outstanding from a minority of organisations and, when these have been recieved, arrangements will be made for the formal implementation of the scheme.  The attached schedule shows the position in relation to each of the organisations circulated.</P>
      <P>The terms of the new scheme provide that organisations may participate with effect from an agreed date which must be not earlier than 1 June 1973.  A person transferring between two participating organisations on or after the relevant operative date would automatically benefit; the scheme may also be applied, at the discretion of the final employing organisation, to persons who transferred before the operative date and are still serving on that date, and, in so far as pensions are concerned, to persons who retired before the operative date.  Pending the formal implementation of the scheme it is open to each organisation which has decided to participate to operate the new arrangements on a provisional basis in relation to any other participating organisation. Thus, for example, civil servants are being allowed, subject to certain conditions, to reckon pensionable service in the Defence Forces, Garda Síochána and National and Secondary Teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the schedule, most of the organisations concerned have accepted <Col N="96" /> the new scheme and the majority of those who are still considering the position have indicated that they are, in principle, favourably disposed towards it. The new scheme is a complex one and obviously requires careful examination by the organisations involved, and particularly those which have funded schemes.  Every effort is, of course, being made to expendite its finalisation.</P>
    <P>The scheme will have a vital role to play in furthering mobility of labour within the public sector and its importance in this respect has been brought to the attention of the organisations concerned. However, it will be appreciated that general policy on the operational independence of State bodies requires that each organisation, after considering the alternatives and the stated preference of my Department, should be allowed to take its own decision as to whether, and on what basis, it would join the scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 1978, the Ballina Board of Conservators is responsible for the protection of the fisheries in the Ballina fishery district which includes the rivers Moy and Easkey.  I am satisfied that the board are doing everything possible to combat illegal fishing in the district.  I would add, however, that the setting up of the new <Col N="105" /> regional fisheries boards, with their full-time chief officers and the introduction of greatly increased penalties for illegal fishing, will enable the protection of our valuable inland fisheries to be further improved and intensified.</P>
