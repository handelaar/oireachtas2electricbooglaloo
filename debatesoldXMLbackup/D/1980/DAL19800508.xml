      <P>I should like on behalf of my party to support this proposal. Marshal Tito's work in maintaining the independence and unity of his country, the balance of power in Europe and the status of the non-alignment movement within the limits of his power to the end of his life, are all matters that leave his country and the world indebted to him.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party would like to be associated with the Taoiseach's expression of sympathy on behalf of the Irish Government and the Irish people on the death of President Tito.  This man of tremendous vision and courage contributed much towards trying to maintain world peace.  He did so by his adherence to the principle of neutrality and non-alignment.  One can only hope that, in the future in the readjustment facing the Yugoslav people without their great leader, there will be <Col N="1104" /> no interference from any outside source and that our Government will assist in that readjustment in every way possible.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the outcome of the meeting in Dublin on 2 May of representatives of Governments which contribute troops to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> Deputies will recall that at its special meeting on 20 April, following the murder of two of our soldiers serving with UNIFIL, the Government decided to take a number of steps at the diplomatic level.  In my statement in reply to questions on 29 April I outlined the action which had been taken in this regard.  In particular the Government proposed that there should be a meeting of representatives of Governments which contribute troops to UNIFIL to consider the situation facing the Force in its endeavours to implement the mandate laid down by the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>The Government's intention had been that the meeting should take place at UN Headquarters in New York, but, in order to facilitate high-level participation by a number of countries which indicated a clear preference for Dublin, the Government agreed to host the meeting in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The important aspect in our consideration was to have the meeting as quickly as possible and, even though our preference was to have it in New York in order to emphasise the independence of the approach in regard to all the countries participating and going along with the approach, the fact of the matter is that the meeting in Dublin was arranged and could have been arranged quicker and, accordingly, it took place in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In proposing the meeting the Government had in mind to foster among the troop-contributing states a sense of solidarity in their joint endeavour on behalf of the United Nations.  This solidarity was the important objective in bringing the countries together and success has been achieved in that respect.  Our view was that this solidarity could be utilised in an effort to bring about conditions in which UNIFIL could operate more effectively and in conditions of adequate security for its personnel.  We were conscious of the particular problems which our contingent had encountered, but we were aware that the contingents of almost all the countries participating in the Force had encountered difficulties over the past two <Col N="1106" /> years and in most cases suffered loss of life.  We felt it would be particularly valuable to pool the experiences of the different contingents and to see to what extent we were in agreement and could make a common evaluation of the difficulties with which UNIFIL is confronted.</P>
    <P>In our approach to the meeting we were conscious of the need to ensure that, meeting as troop-contributing states, certain basic considerations should be respected: firstly, that the troop-contributing states would in no way wish to derogate from the role and functions of the Security Council which set up the Force and has responsibility for it.  Indeed, we saw the efforts of the troop-contributing states as being supportive of the objectives laid down by the Security Council.  Secondly, the troop-contributing states would not wish to interfere in any way with the direction of UNIFIL by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the conduct of its operations in the field by the Force Commander, in both of whom all have full confidence.  Thirdly, that, while being fully aware that UNIFIL's problems and those of the Southern Lebanon are part of the overall problem of the Middle East and that the states participating might have differing views on the political issues involved, the meeting should confine itself as far as possible to questions directly arising from UNIFIL and its problems in which all states represented had a common interest.</P>
    <P>Representatives of 11 countries participated in the meeting&mdash;Fiji, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Senegal and Sweden.  All these except Sweden currently contribute to UNIFIL; Sweden will supply medical personnel to the Force from next summer and has been accepted by the Security Council as a contributor.  The Secretary-General was represented at the meeting by Mr. Brian Urquhart, Under Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs, who is responsible for the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations and whose experience in this area of UN policy is virtually <Col N="1107" /> unrivalled.  Mr. Urquhart gave the meeting a detailed briefing on the present situation of UNIFIL and the efforts made by the United Nations, both in general and in specific instances, to improve the position.</P>
    <P>I think I may say that the meeting was very successful and that the decisions and the outcome were most fruitful.  I have placed a copy of the agreed Communiqué issued following the meeting in the Dáil Library and copies have been made available to Deputies.  I would not therefore propose to go through it in detail but rather will try to highlight a number of aspects which emerged in the course of the discussions.</P>
    <P>The most impressive feature of the meeting was the deep and genuine sense of solidarity expressed by all participants. When representatives of 11 countries, situated in different parts of the world and belonging to different regional groups, who had agreed to contribute contingents to UNIFIL at the request of the Secretary General, came together, one might have anticipated that considerable differences of view would emerge.  This was not so.  The views expressed were, for all practical purposes, unanimous and I can therefore, without qualification, speak of an agreed view of the meeting on what was discussed.</P>
    <P>The meeting was fully agreed on the vital role being played by UNIFIL despite the difficulties it has faced, given the situation in the Lebanon and in the Middle East as a whole at the present time.  As expressed in the Communiqué all agreed that the Force &ldquo;continues to make a significant contribution to peace in the Middle East and to the prevention of an outbreak of more general hostilities&rdquo;.  At the present time of heightened international tensions withdrawal of the Force could have the most serious consequences and might easily lead to wider war.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise this fact because the whole situation in the Middle East and to the east of the Middle East, to Iran and Afghanistan, is one of extreme difficulty and one which has very grave <Col N="1108" /> implications for the world at large.  The UNIFIL presence in the Lebanon is one of the bricks in that situation of a very shaky edifice.  The withdrawal of UNIFIL from that area could lead to serious consequences not only in the Lebanon but throughout the whole area which is already in a state of serious tension.  I say this to emphasise the importance of UNIFIL presence in that difficult area and to put the Lebanon problem in the wider context of the whole Middle East and of that whole region from the Lebanon to Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>At the same time, all were agreed that any United Nations peace-keeping operation depends fundamentally on acceptance of the peace-keeping force and of its role in the area where it is to serve. This requires co-operation and support from those who wish a peacekeeping force to be interposed between parties in conflict.  In the case of UNIFIL it has been all too clear that the required co-operation from the parties has not been forthcoming.  Such co-operation is necessary if UNIFIL is to operate in the conditions necessary for the effective implementation of its mandate.</P>
    <P>The meeting was therefore in agreement that the co-operation of all parties was necessary for UNIFIL to function effectively, and it was agreed to call on all parties to co-operate fully with UNIFIL.  All participants however, also agreed that the basic problems of the Force could not be overcome while it was prevented from full deployment in the area of operation assigned to it.  The basic requirement of the Force at present is, therefore, as the Security Council stated as recently as 18 April that it &ldquo;take immediate and total control of its entire area of operations up to the internationally recognised boundaries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They are the internationally recognised boundaries of the State of Lebanon.  That was the basic term in the mandate and it was reaffirmed by the Security Council on 18 April.</P>
    <P>It seemed clear to the meeting that the existence of a strip of territory controlled by the so-called <i>de facto</i> forces is <Col N="1109" /> the principal source of the difficulties at present.  Moreover, Israel's extensive support for these forces has been the key factor in enabling them to maintain control of this strip of territory and to deny UNIFIL the freedom of movement that is necessary to carry out its mandate. The meeting, therefore, called on Israel to cease this support and on all parties in the area to co-operate fully with UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>All participants in the meeting were of course aware that &ldquo;armed elements&rdquo; of Palestinian and Lebanese affiliations also try to operate in the area and have caused difficulties and deaths among UNIFIL personnel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, all were agreed that UNIFIL's inability to deploy fully is the major factor which at present inhibits its ability to discharge its responsibilities effectively.  If UNIFIL were fully deployed and not subjected to harassment by the <i>de facto</i> forces, it would be in a better position to control and ensure the peaceful character of its area of operations.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise this fact because the harassment that is taking place at the hands of the <i>de facto</i> forces is in fact and in practice inhibiting and prohibiting the UNIFIL forces from dealing with other armed elements in the area as a whole. Therefore, far from securing their protection from these other elements, the operations of the <i>de facto</i> forces are preventing UNIFIL from dealing effectively with other elements in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All participants in the meeting were agreed that UNIFIL's role is one of peace-keeping.  There was absolute unanimity on adherence to the principle of the mandate being a peace-keeping mandate. There was no question of a peace-enforcement mandate or anything of that nature.  To the extent that the meeting clarified that aspect of the matter, the decision was very important.  The peace-keeping role was laid down in the mandate <Col N="1110" /> of the Force and it is in accordance with the experience of the United Nations in this field over the years that its effective role must be a peace-keeping role.  Any departure from that role could be counter-productive and nugatory in the extreme.  Any question of peace enforcement would be leading one straight away into the war area in which the UN cannot have any part.  Such a situation would be counter to the whole principles of UN involvement in an area of operation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I indicated to the House at Question Time on 29 April that this was the Government's view and it emerged at the meeting that our view of what the mandate was, is and should be, was fully shared by all participants.  A force, the object of which is to keep the peace and to save lives, cannot adopt an aggressive attitude without undermining its fundamental objective.  As I have already indicated, the basic requirement for peace-keeping is the co-operation of the parties involved and this must be achieved through political and diplomatic means and by negotiation.  This does not of course preclude a suitably firm attitude by UNIFIL on the ground.</P>
    <P>All countries participating in the meeting made clear their wish to continue to participate in UNIFIL in view of the important work they are doing.  It was clear to all, however, that if progress were not made towards the achievement of minimum conditions in which UNIFIL could operate effectively and with reasonable security for their personnel, then the continued viability of the force and the willingness on the part of all troop-contributors to continue to participate, might be brought into question.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that any step or any decision in that direction will be taken by all the troop-contributing countries. We will operate as a group when any decisions are to be taken.  We will not&mdash;and an assurance was given by other countries that they will not&mdash;operate on a unilateral basis.  We will continue to review the matter in a spirit of solidarity and to make decisions, however serious they might be, as a <Col N="1111" /> group of troop-contributors who are making the major contribution towards peace in this area.  We will make our decision as a UNIFIL group.</P>
    <P>Another point on which there was unanimous agreement was the need for continued contact in order to maintain the solidarity of the group.  Representatives of the troop-contributing countries already have, from time to time, met in New York with the Secretary General.  These contacts will now be intensified and take place regularly in the light of the Dublin meeting.  As noted in the communiqué they will continue to discuss with the Secretary-General practical steps which can be taken towards the achievement of the basic conditions which are necessary if the Force is to operate fully and effectively.  It was also the general view that there should be a further meeting at ministerial level to review how far progress has been made towards the creation of conditions which will permit UNIFIL to exercise their mandate more effectively.  Norway offered to host a meeting in Oslo in due course on a date to be arranged with this purpose in mind.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the meeting, it was agreed that diplomatic approaches would be made in a number of capitals. The views of the troop-contributing countries as a group would be presented, using the text of the communiqué as a basis for these démarches.  It was agreed that, in order to emphasise the collective nature of these approaches, they should be carried out by a different group of three countries in each case; each group comprising, in so far as possible, a European, an Asian and an African country.</P>
    <P>Accordingly it was decided at the United Nations in New York, that Ireland, together with Fiji and Senegal, should present the text of the communiqué to both the President of the Security Council and to the Secretary-General, and request that it be circulated as an official document of the Security Council. The approaches in three capitals were to be conducted as follows: in Beirut by Italy and two others: in Israel by the Netherlands and two others; and in <Col N="1112" /> Washington DC by Nigeria and two others.  The reaction to these démarches will of course have to be considered by all troop-contributing countries in New York.  After these various approaches have been made to consider and review the position further, the meeting can take place in New York at ambassador level.</P>
    <P>I would like now to make some remarks of a more general character.  I think the particular value of the meeting last week has been to demonstrate that the troop-contributing countries share a united and common approach in their joint endeavour as part of UNIFIL.  This has shown clearly what it has been the object of the Government to emphasise all along; that the difficulties encountered by the Irish contingent were encountered in the course of the discharge of their duties as an integral part of UNIFIL within a specified area in accordance with the mandate of the Security Council.  There is no question of a bilateral dispute between Ireland and Israel; it is rather a question of securing the necessary co-operation of those concerned in enabling a UN peacekeeping force to carry out the mandate given to it by the Security Council and recently confirmed by that body.  I would hope that all participants in this debate will place their comments in that context.</P>
    <P>It is very much in Israel's interest that peace be established in this area and that her territorial integrity can best be guaranteed in a peaceful settlement of the whole middle east area, and not just the Lebanon alone.  It is very much in Israel's interest as a State that the Lebanon resumes as a peaceful State and that under the protection and guarantees of the United Nations normal living conditions can be restored in the Lebanon and similarly that there will be a peaceful settlement of the whole Middle Eastern area, including the Lebanon and the Palestinian problem, that will guarantee the territorial integrity of Israel and maintain the security and integrity of that State.  It is in the interests of everyone concerned, Lebanese, Israelis and other Middle Eastern countries, that we move towards a settlement <Col N="1113" /> situation where peaceful conditions and the integrity of the states concerned can be guaranteed on an international basis.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion as to whether there are specific reasons as to why the Irish contingent have been harassed by and came under attack from the <i>de facto</i> forces.  I think that on this point I should say, firstly that a number of other contingents, such as the Norwegians, have previously been the focus of Major Haddad's attentions for some time; it appears to be part of his tactics to probe different contingents from time to time.  More important, however, is the fact that the Irish contingent controls an area of notable strategic significance in military terms, in particular a ridge that has a commanding position over much of the surrounding country.  I do not believe that one needs to look any further for an explanation of the attack on At-tiri and the pressure on the Irish contingent area generally.</P>
    <P>These attacks have been continuing off and on over the past two years.  The most serious attack, and one that thankfully did not cost any loss of life so far as Irish personnel were concerned, was the shelling of Naquora, the UNIFIL headquarters, in April 1979.  These off and on attacks relate to the tactical and strategical situation on the ground as the <i>de facto</i> forces see gaining particular ground as being a factor in regard to controlling the situation.</P>
    <P>There has also been some disquiet, naturally, about an apparent press campaign directed against Irish troops and the Irish contingent. I should say that the United Nations have been and are concerned to make the facts available as effectively as possible, and we of course give them any help we can.  At the same time I think that all must realise that to engage in a propaganda war would not necessarily serve the interests of peacekeeping and the need for impartiality of those involved.  I think that the recent meeting has in any case been most useful in emphasising the common <Col N="1114" /> approach of all troop-contributors and the pointlessness of a campaign directed against any one participant in particular. There is also a certain responsibility on newspapermen and journalists to evaluate carefully reports that emanate from the region before giving them further currency.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the countries which participated in last Friday's meeting are under no illusions that the objectives which they have outlined can be easily achieved.  The prime responsibility still rests of course with the Security Council and the Council will have to address itself to these issues again not later than 19 June next when the mandate of UNIFIL again comes up for renewal.  The troop-contributing countries have been concerned to make it clear that certain conditions must be met if the Force is to operate effectively and with adequate security for its personnel. In so far as they believe that UNIFIL should have full freedom of movement in the area assigned to it so as to exercise the control that is basic to its functions the troop contributors are asking only for what the Security Council itself has stated to be essential.</P>
    <P>Although Ireland was prompted by events affecting our troops to propose the meeting it is now clear from the ready response of other troop-contributors to the suggestion made by Ireland that all were concerned about the present and potential situation of the Force to which all have contributed.  It is our hope that by channelling this concern into political and diplomatic action we can help the United Nations bring about the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence will, I understand, later in the debate comment in detail on the work of the Irish contingent. However, I would not wish to conclude without placing on record once again on behalf of the Government and I believe the whole Irish people our admiration for the impartial, dedicated and competent way in which successive Irish contingents have carried out their very difficult task.</P>
    <P>I should like finally to put clearly on <Col N="1115" /> the record again in summary form the principles which have guided the Government in their attitude to this meeting and to Ireland's continued participation in UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>We believe that over the two years of its existence, and despite many difficulties, UNIFIL has made a significant contribution towards the prevention of an outbreak of general hostilities in the Middle East.  Ireland is proud that over these two years the officers and men of our Defence Forces who have volunteered for service with UNIFIL have played their full part in accordance with our best tradition of involvement in UN peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>We believe that a withdrawal of the force now could have the most serious consequences and might easily lead to a wider war.  We do not want to see such a withdrawal.</P>
    <P>We recognise the concerns of the countries and peoples of the region for their security and their rights.</P>
    <P>In particular we understand that Israel is deeply concerned about its security.  We deplore and condemn attacks from across its border which have brought death or injury to its people, just as we deplore and condemn all acts of violence that bring death or injury to people in the region.</P>
    <P>We agreed to take part in UNIFIL because we felt that as a country with a tradition of involvement in UN peacekeeping we could play a helpful part in the effort by the international community to bring some measure of peace and stability and prevent a wider war.</P>
    <P>We would deeply regret it if this effort to play our part should be seen as adversely affecting relations between Ireland and Israel.</P>
    <P>At the same time we are entitled to insist that if a peacekeeping force is to continue to operate it must be given the necessary conditions to do so effectively: the most basic of these conditions is that the force should operate <Col N="1116" /> with consent&mdash;a peacekeeping force should not have enemies.</P>
    <P>The time has now come to create the necessary conditions for the effective functioning of UNIFIL.  The force must be allowed to carry out its mandate in every respect and it must have freedom of movement through the area assigned to it and in conditions of adequate security for its personnel.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of our meeting on 2 May was to develop and maintain solidarity between all 11 troop-contributing countries in demanding these conditions.  In acting coherently as a group and in bringing our views to the attention of those most directly concerned, I believe we have achieved that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we are afforded the first opportunity of debating the position in the Lebanon and our Middle East policy generally since the May 1978 debate on the sending of Irish troops as part of UNIFIL to the Lebanon.  Accordingly we must look at the picture in a broad context and not within the very narrow confines of the UNIFIL operation itself.  This leads one to look at how one should conduct one's foreign policy in that area.  It seems to me that the Middle East is a very difficult and complex area and that our foreign policy, particularly in that area, must be conducted in a very delicate and sensitive manner. We were fortunate in the past, during Coalition days, when Deputy Garrett FitzGerald was Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he conducted our foreign policy in that and indeed other areas in such a manner as to inspire confidence at home and abroad in our ability to play a role in international affairs.  I have to put on record that since the assumption of office by our present Minister, Deputy Lenihan, confidence in the handling of foreign policy issues at home and abroad has been shattered.  We have had a situation in which our present Minister&mdash;it gives me no great pleasure to say this but I feel it to be my duty&mdash;within months of assuming the Fisheries portfolio effectively jettisoned <Col N="1117" /> our claim to an exclusive 50-mile limit and within months of his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs, he created a serious imbalance in our Middle East relationships, particularly as a result of the Bahrain communiqué.  In both of those portfolios his actions have seriously damaged this country and lead me now to suggest that his talents should be employed in an area other than that dealing with foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>I do not think we can consider the position of our troops and UNIFIL in isolation.  The Lebanon and that area of the Middle East is a tangled web through which we must tread with sensitivity and diplomacy.  There are quite a number of areas to be considered here.  Firstly we must consider the position of our troops in Southern Lebanon.  As far as we are concerned that is a priority issue.  Secondly, we must consider the UNIFIL operation generally.  Thirdly, we must consider the position of the Lebanese Government; fourthly, the Palestinian problem; fifthly, our relationships with Israel; sixthly, the activities of Major Haddad and the Christian militia in the area immediately north of the Israeli border; seventhly, the efforts of Egypt and to some extent the United States and the present talks going on in the context of the Camp David agreement; and finally, the involvement of the EEC and the UN and our contribution to that involvement.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the position of our troops in the Lebanon and the UNIFIL operation generally I take this opportunity to place on record, on my own behalf and on behalf of my party, our appreciation of their efforts in their peace-keeping role in a very difficult situation in Southern Lebanon.  Our Army has a proud tradition in peace-keeping, dating back to the days of the Congo and they are continuing today to add to that proud tradition.  It is only proper that we should say in this House, in the Parliament of their land, how proud we are of their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proper also to recall that in the May 1978 debate the original resolution <Col N="1118" /> referred to the dispatch of a contingent for service outside the State as part of UNIFIL for the performance of peace-keeping duties of a police character.  It is important that we keep in mind that the function of the UNIFIL is not that of a warlike body.  We must recall that these UNIFIL troops are sent there for the performance of duties of a police character in an effort to separate the various warring elements in the area.</P>
    <P>In the light of the present situation there we must discuss the ability of UNIFIL, because of their peace-keeping role, because of the police character of that role, to fulfil the United Nations mandate, which had three components. There was, firstly, the job of confirming the withdrawal of the Israeli forces who had invaded north to the Litani River and who were to withdraw south to their own borders.  There was, secondly, the job of restoring international peace and security; and, thirdly, the assisting of the Government of the Lebanon in ensuring the return of their effective authority in that area.  We are faced with the situation that because the first part of the mandate was not fully and effectively established the present difficulties are being undergone by those forces.  We can recall that the withdawal of the Israeli troops was to be in three stages.  The first and second stages went without difficulty. The Israeli troops withdrew in two separate stages there and the UNIFIL troops took over the area from which the Israelis had withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, and this goes back to the very beginning, the third stage&mdash;that is the withdrawal of the Israeli troops in the approximately ten mile wide zone north of their own border&mdash;was not completed in the same way because when the Israelis withdrew they left behind the forces of Major Haddad and the Christian militia.  The result was that on the Israelis withdrawal the UNIFIL troops were unable to take control of that area.  This has to be borne in mind and it has to be borne in mind that from the very beginning this militia force supported and financed by Israel was in such a position that the UNIFIL troops <Col N="1119" /> were unable to establish their effective mandate over that vital area of ground immediately north of the Israeli border. We therefore have to face some serious questions here as to whether in fact while Major Haddad's forces are there and continue to be financed and armed as they have been, the UNIFIL Force can establish its mandate over that zone.  I am not suggesting at all that this should be done by military means.  We now stand, as we did two years ago, in the position that the UNIFIL Force continues to be kept out of that area.</P>
    <P>I would have hoped that the Minister today in his statement would have dealt with this aspect in more detail because it is one of the most vital aspects of the operations there.  After the meeting last Friday a communique indicated that all the UNIFIL states might withdraw if Major Haddad stayed.  I have seen that the efforts to convince Israel to withdraw their support from Major Haddad do not appear to have been successful.  I see in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today, on page 1, a statement of a senior UN official that &ldquo;The UNIFIL peace-keeping mandate in southern Lebanon is now in jeopardy because of the stated intention of the Israelis to continue supporting the irregular forces of Major Sa'ad Haddad in defiance of the UN Security Council&rdquo;. I would have hoped that the Minister would have given more of an indication as to the outlook of the Irish Government in that situation.  There appears to be a suggestion of further meetings.  One in Norway was mentioned and, of course, there was the question of the renewal of the mandate in June.  Perhaps some &ldquo;Government&rdquo; speaker will deal with this later in detail, as the question has been raised.</P>
    <P>In regard to the meeting last Friday, I thought it was a good idea.  I believe that discussions between the various bodies including UNIFIL would be helpful.  Unfortunately however whether such a meeting could be categorised as successful, as indicated in the Minister's speech, is a moot point.  It certainly did not do any harm.  It certainly engendered and will continue to engender a degree of <Col N="1120" /> solidarity and open lines of communication among those countries contributing to UNIFIL.  However the vital issue does not appear to have been discussed.  This is: what will be the position of those countries in the event of Major Haddad continuing to occupy the area which he does occupy in the event of arms and finance continuing to be supplied to him and thus ensuring the support of his militia in that area?  It is clear that the co-operation of Israel is needed and if it is not forthcoming we shall have to bear in mind the very considerable influence of the United States on Israel.  The question must be raised of obtaining the total support and commitment of the United States to the UN resolution.  The connection is very clear.  The United States supply Israel with arms; Israel supplies the Haddad forces with arms.  The same arises in the financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>One point I would like to return to is the standardisation of the equipment among our troops there.  This suggestion was made seriously by me last week and after discussion and consultation with officers of our Army, many of whom I met when I visited them in the Lebanon. While we accept that our role there is a peace-keeping one and that our weaponry should be in a defensive category I suggest seriously that, if only from the psychological point of view, it is important that our troops be armed with armaments of at least an equivalent range and accuracy as those of the Haddad militia.  In that context I throw out the suggestion of the possibility of our troops in the UNIFIL Force being supplied with TOW anti-tank missiles and .5 heavy machine guns.  From my discussions there it was mentioned to me that certain of our armaments, light machine guns and mortars, do not have the range and accuracy to counter the armaments of the Haddad militia.  I am not raising any scare about the inadequacy of our armaments but I put it forward as a serious suggestion that was made to me by serving officers.</P>
    <P>Another point that must be discussed is the position of the UN headquarters at Naquora.  It is clear in the context of the <Col N="1121" /> present situation that it is causing a lot of difficulty to the operations there to have the UN headquarters in the middle of a zone over which the UNIFIL troops do not exercise their mandate.  I appreciate the difficulties about removing the headquarters, the possible danger of lending a degree of legitimacy to the Haddad situation by a pull-out of the headquarters at Naquora, but consideration will have to be given to possibly relocating part of the operation in a more accessible location while at the same time allowing to continue in Naquora possibly the Norwegian hospital unit and other parts of the operation.  In other words, I am not recommending a pull-out from Naquora but I think consideration will have to be given to the relocation of certain parts of the UN headquarters established there.</P>
    <P>In considering the operation in the Lebanon one must look at the position of the Lebanese Government.  We must recall the disastrous civil war in that country which left 50,000 people dead in 1975 and 1976 and the split that occurred in the army.  We must not forget that this established the present unhappy situation in that country.  When I visited Beirut I was told on good authority that in the Lebanon there are 25 different armed groups outside the UNIFIL contingent in the Lebanon, 25 groups, many of them with conflicting outlooks.  It is clear on the ground there the difficulties of the Lebanese Government in establishing effective control when one has to go through as many as a dozen checkpoints manned by different groups when one travels even a short journey in the Lebanon.  However, we must bear in mind that the original mandate envisaged possibly as the main part of its operation, that the job of the UNIFIL troops would be to assist the Government of the Lebanon in ensuring a return of their effective authority in the area.  As I understand it the up-to-date situation is that fairly successful efforts have been made in the re-establishment of the Lebanese national army which has now about 25,000 men.  Discussions will have to take place on how these people can be <Col N="1122" /> brought more and more into some type of joint operation with the UNIFIL troops.  I understand certain contingents are operating with some of the battalions there, but in the long term we will have to try more and more to involve the new Lebanese army in that operation so that the UNIFIL troops can be withdrawn secure in the knowledge that effective control of the area is in the hands of the Lebanese Government.</P>
    <P>The other major component in the problem&mdash;and many would say it is the key to the solution of many of the problems not only in the Lebanon but in the Middle East&mdash;is that relating to the Palestinians.  This is something that has to be discussed in this context.  It is clear to all who have taken an interest in this area that a solution to the Palestinian problem ultimately will have to be found and unless and until it is found there will not be peace in that area.  That is not to say it is the only problem there and that securing a solution to that problem will establish peace, but one can put it in the negative fashion and say that without securing a solution there will not be peace.</P>
    <P>Our position and that of the EEC was stated in September 1979 by the Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, on behalf of this country and the Community when he spoke at the United Nations.  This statement was very carefully worded.  It recognised the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.  It recognised their right to a homeland and, through their representatives, to play a full part in the negotiation of a comprehensive settlement.  That statement by the Minister was very carefully worded and one he was delivering with the full support of the EEC.  Then came the Bahrein communiqué and to a considerable degree it burst like a bombshell on the diplomatic scene and on the Middle East scene.  This communiqué referred to an independent State in Palestine, to recognition of the role of the PLO and to withdrawal by Israel from Jerusalem.  One has to say that this communiqué must be faulted.  I can see that time will not permit me to discuss it in too much detail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The communiqué can be faulted on at least six grounds.  It made no mention of the right of Israel to exist secure and guaranteed within its pre-1967 borders. There was no official declaration from the PLO prior to the issue of that communiqué about its links with the IRA here.  There were no concrete assurances with regard to the PLO activities in the UNIFIL area and infiltration across it to the Israeli border.  We have to bear in mind that despite the current difficulties with Major Haddad and his militia difficulties have been experienced by UNIFIL with the Palestinians and the PLO. The Fijians lost five or six of their troops who were shot in a fracas with the Palestinians.  This brings us to the question of the balance we are trying to find and maintain between the PLO and the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>The fourth aspect on which I would question the Bahrain communiqué is that there was no indication in it of our nonacceptance of the PLO covenant calling for the destruction of the State of Israel. Fifthly, there was no indication of our recognition of the complex position of Jerusalem.  That is something that has been the subject of such discussion going back for many long years, back to the Vatican proposals that Jerusalem should be a city with international status because of its holy places revered by many hundreds of millions of people of different religions.  It is certainly a complex question which cannot be disposed of in the manner in which it was disposed of in the Bahrain communiqué. Lastly, that communiqué was seen in international terms as being opportunistic, lacking credibility and as being related solely to the oil situation in the world. Hardheaded people will know well that our supplies of oil and the price we pay for them are not related in any way in the views we take on the Palestinian question.</P>
    <P>What is important in the context of this debate is that in view of our involvement through the UN in that area it has been and will continue to be necessary for us to be cautious, diplomatic and balanced in our approach.  I accept that <Col N="1124" /> we are entitled to express sympathy and support for the position of the Palestinians but that has to be balanced by an outlook that would not disrupt relationships with Israel and the other countries.  In that context, the Bahrain communiqué was a major blunder. Another aspect that must be recognised in dealing with the Palestinian question is that there are separate elements in the PLO, some moderate and some extremely radical and our diplomatic efforts and responsibilities in the Palestinian situation have to be related to the support that can be given to the Palestinian moderate elements as opposed to the extremely radical ones, those who believe in diplomatic initiatives and efforts rather than those who believe in outright terrorism.  We also have to bear in mind the position of the Palestinians on the West Bank.  I recall a remark made having discussed the situation with one of the mayors of the West Bank in relation to the PLO and the future possibility with regard to Palestinians generally.  The remark, in reply to a question about the return of the Palestinians was that the Palestinians were welcome to return to the West Bank from the refugee camps outside the area provided they came with an olive branch and not with a gun.  It is important to bear in mind that the outlook of the Palestinians in that area may be slightly different from that of those who live in the refugee camps.</P>
    <P>In the context of this debate we must also consider the position of Israel and our relationship with Israel.  I am glad that the Minister's statement made it clear that despite our difficulties with Israel, those difficulties do not arise in a bilateral capacity but simply because of our involvement in a UN operation.  It is important to bear in mind that our difficulties with Israel arise from their backing for the Haddad militia and their virtual refusal to co-operate in the implementation of the UN resolution both in the letter and in the spirit.  Our difficulty arises because that impedes us as part of the UNIFIL force in doing the job we have been asked to do by the UN. In considering our relationship with <Col N="1125" /> Israel we have to understand that every one of them, from their Foreign Minister, Mr. Shamir, to all the officials with whom I discussed the position, evidenced this seige mentality&mdash;the fact that they were alone with hordes of other countries around them seeking the destruction of their State.  Any objective observer will also have to look at the fractured state of their Government at the moment which is leading to these attempts to establish settlements which are causing so much trouble in the area.  Basically, we have to make it clear in our representations to them that our row is not with them as between Ireland and Israel but that our difficulties are related solely to our efforts to carry out a UN operation.</P>
    <P>Israel has been requesting for many years to have an embassy established here.  They have had diplomatic relations with us since the foundation of their State, but they never had the opportunity of having an embassy here although they have been pressing from time to time to have one established.  If the Minister or Foreign Affairs officials wish to discuss anything with the Israelis they have to send to them in London for such discussions. The fact that they lack an embassy here means that the possibility of more effective communication with the Israelis is lost.  In that regard serious consideration should now be given to exchanging the establishment of embassies as between Dublin and Tel Aviv.  There is also the question of restoring the balance which has been put out of plumb by the Bahrain communiqué, the effect it would have in the United States where we have to concentrate a certain amount of our diplomatic effort as a nation and through the UN and through the UNIFIL countries, so that they can in turn assert their influence on Israel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the question of the difficulties that arise from lack of information.  There is clearly a lot of propaganda emanating from Israel and <Col N="1126" /> other quarters about the UNIFIL troops and about the Irish troops.  If we had an embassy in Israel in exchange for one established in Dublin there would be the possibility, through an information officer, of ensuring that propaganda was countered effectively.  There is always the long-term situation about trade and so forth.</P>
      <P>They are some of the main points I was interested in making&mdash;time will not permit me to go into much more detail. How do we control the activities of Major Haddad?  How can we assure the Israelis that the UNIFIL troops control that zone and that the Israelis must co-operate with those troops to establish control of that zone?</P>
      <P>I should refer briefly to the Egyptians and to the Camp David talks while discussing the establishment of peace in that area.  There is the question of what we can do in co-operation with our EEC partners to have a more effective voice in securing ultimate peace and an ultimate settlement in that area.  It is very important that those involved at Government level should see the practical difficulties in this matter.  We have had an opportunity to visit our troops and to meet various bodies with an interest in the Lebanon, including the Palestinians on the West Bank and the Israeli Foreign Minister.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the morale of our troops and the recognition of the job they are doing, I suggest to the Minister that he should visit our troops, accompanied by an all-party delegation, to indicate our support here for their efforts. Such a party would not be going on a picnic, but we have a duty to help to maintain the morale of our troops serving with the UN force.  Such a delegation could avail of that opportunity to have discussions with the Israelis.</P>
      <P>Time does not permit me to deal with this problem in greater detail but I hope we will have a further opportunity soon to discuss the position of our UNIFIL troops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought this debate in the hope, forlorn as it now turns out, that <Col N="1127" /> the Government might explain or try to justify some of their actions in the political and diplomatic spheres on the Lebanon situation.  I say that it has been a forlorn hope because if one reads the Minister's speech it becomes clear he was far more concerned with the Government's political plank than explaining the situation in the Lebanon or justifying his own and the Government's contribution towards the deteriorating situation there.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one thing clear. As far as this party are concerned we have a particular pride in the operation of our troops serving with UNIFIL.  Our only criticism might be that they were too restrained, too disciplined and not sufficiently aggressive to engage the forces who fired on them.  Otherwise we can be proud of our troops there.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, we are highly critical of the Government's political and diplomatic policy in this regard which I believe&mdash;and I do not say this lightly&mdash;particularly with regard to the Bahrain communiqué, was a major factor in contributing to the deteriorating situation which resulted in the deaths of three Irish soldiers.  I believe that that statement in Bahrain contributed to that end result.  There has been no justification given for that statement nor has there been an attempt by the Government to justify it or their policy towards the Middle East.  They have never attempted to justify in this House that policy either in political or diplomatic terms.  We have a right to demand such justification in this House.  The time has long gone for it, but at least let the Minister take this opportunity to do that in this House for the benefit of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been very tragic consequences for our soldiers in the Labanon and the danger is still there.  It is a very complex situation and naturally our anger and most of our worries have been directed against the Israeli Government, and rightly so, for their support of the <i>de facto</i> force of Major Haddad.  He could not operate or last 48 hours in the Lebanon if he had not the full backing, <Col N="1128" /> the full military, financial and moral suport of the Israeli Government.</P>
    <P>Our troops serving in the Lebanon are there as a peacekeeping force with other national contingents and with the agreement of the Israeli Government.  The arrangements under which they undertook to go into the Lebanon were that the Israeli army which had invaded the Lebanon would be withdrawn right back across Israel and that the occupied land would be handed over to the UN forces. Of course, the Israelis drew back a certain part of the way towards their own border, but they left approximately a five-mile strip without handing it over to the UN forces as a buffer zone between them and people they believed with considerable justification were threatening their very existence, the PLO.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable features of the Minister's speech this morning is that in that whole speech the PLO and their contribution to the situation in the Lebanon are not mentioned once.  The Minister talked about the <i>de facto</i> forces under Major Haddad, which we all agree with, and other UN soldiers from different contingents being killed by other armed elements.  As the Minister knows, the other armed elements are the PLO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when you made the statement in Bahrain was a major factor in the developments which have taken place in the Lebanon.  Let us look at the Lebanon before the Israeli invasion. Before doing that, I want to place this on the record.  I condemn the State of Israel for their continued support of Major Haddad and the <i>de facto</i> forces.  I condemn them for their defiance of the communiqué issued after last Friday's meeting and the wishes of the UN, and for their breach of the agreement they entered into in the mandate by not handing over to the UN forces.</P>
      <P>Let us look at how the situation developed in the Lebanon.  The Lebanon was a French colony.  It was occupied by the French for a number of years.  When it got its independence&mdash;in many respects like our own country&mdash;it had two communities, two different religious groupings.  It had an unwritten constitution which tried to allow for the fact that there were two religious groupings, two traditions, in the country.  It worked very successfully for a number of years.  I recall that in 1972, 1973 and 1974 people here were looking at the situation in the Lebanon because it had worked so well, and wondering could it be applied here in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was recognised as the most successful country in the Middle East.  It was economically very sound and very prosperous.  It also had the virtue of being one of the few parliamentary democracies in the Middle East, apart from Israel.  In Jordan the PLO were building up considerable strength.  They were operating a state within a state.  It developed to such a pitch that the King of Jordan and the Jordanian authorities came to the conclusion that it had to <Col N="1130" /> end.  There was a pitched battle between the Jordanian army and the PLO.  It took place in the capital city, Amman, and, as a result of their defeat in Jordan the PLO moved into the Lebanon.  This country was very delicately balanced and the influx of the PLO and the forces and pressures which they brought to bear within that society led to the civil war there, led to the situation which developed in the Lebanon.  It was the reason given, again with some justification, although I am not trying to justify an invasion, why the Israeli army moved into the Lebanon.  It was being used by the PLO for direct assaults against Israel.</P>
    <P>Under the covenant of the PLO, their aim is the total annihilation of Israel. When I asked the Minister, after his Bahrain statement, was he aware of this, or had he got any undertaking from the PLO that they were prepared to abandon that principle, the Minister's reply&mdash;it is on the record of the House&mdash;was &ldquo;what covenant&rdquo;?  The Minister is the man who is in charge of our foreign affairs, the man who made the statement in Bahrain recognising the PLO.  At that time the whole emphasis of the Minister's contribution in the House was on the question of the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland.  The implication of that statement and bluster about the rights of the Palestinian people was that we were not in favour of that. That we were against the Palestinian people, that we did not believe that they had a right to a homeland, which is totally contrary to the truth.</P>
    <P>We believe in the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland.  We always have.  The Minister recognised the PLO. The whole justification for their very existence is the elimination of the state of Israel.  They have engaged over the years in international terrorism and have never publicly disowned or abandoned that fundamental aim, the elimination of the state of Israel.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognises the PLO because they are in favour of a Palestinian homeland.  Could I ask the Minister a hypothetical question?  The Provisional <Col N="1131" /> IRA are in favour of a united Ireland.  Is the Minister saying we should recognise the Provisional IRA as the legitimate spokesmen of the people of Northern Ireland, or even of the minority in Northern Ireland?  That is the logic of the Minister's attempted justification of his recognition of the PLO.</P>
    <P>Our country is very small.  Over the years our Army have made a considerable contribution to peace-keeping efforts by the United Nations.  A situation has developed in the Lebanon in which there are warring factors.  The major warring factors in the situation in which we were called in, were the Israeli army, the <i>de facto</i> forces, and the PLO.  We were sent in there to police the situation and our major task was to stop infiltration by the PLO into the state of Israel while they were engaging in terrorist acts.</P>
    <P>While we have 700 of our troops there in that very delicate operation, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanying our President on a State visit to Bahrain makes a statement in which he recognises a terrorist organisation as the &ldquo;legitimate voice of the Palestinian people.&rdquo; The full implications of that statement would appear not to have registered with the Irish people at the time, but as a result of the very tragic events concerning some of our troops since then our people have been paying a lot of attention to the stand taken by the Government on the question of the PLO. One can only judge the effect on the whole Middle East area by way of the views being expressed on that statement by the various sides concerned.  When a view is expressed by one side it has an effect on the view to be taken by the other side.  In this regard I should like to quote from <i>The Palestinian Report</i> for March, 1980.  This publication emanated from the London office of the PLO.  I am interested particularly in a reference to our President.  Under the heading &ldquo;Ireland leads EEC on Palestine Question&rdquo;, there is the following observation:</P>
    <P>In a joint Irish-Bahrein declaration issued on 10th February, at the end of <Col N="1132" /> a state visit to the Gulf State by Irish President Patrick Hillery, Eire's Foreign Minister Mr. Brian Lenihan praised PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and said he would have no objection to holding talks with him.  The Irish pronouncement is seen by observers as <i>de facto</i> recognition of the PLO.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian Liberation Organisation has welcomed the new Irish position, declaring that it hopes Ireland's recognition of the right of the Palestinians to an independent state in Palestine will be recognised by other European countries.</P>
    <P>The PLO's official spokesman, Mahmoud Labadi, said, &ldquo;We appreciate the new position of the Irish Republic expressed by the President and the Foreign Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure that is incorrect and that our President on a State visit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a rule with which I agree totally, but I am anxious to ensure that the position of the President in matters such as this will be maintained.  The paragraph continues:</P>
      <P>He added, &ldquo;We hope that the European countries will recognise the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestine people, and the right of the Palestinians to establish their own independent state.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only have we 700 troops in the Lebanon and not only are we seen in that very delicately balanced position to extend recognition to the PLO but we are put forward in their official publication <Col N="1133" /> as leading the rest of Europe on this question.  What effect could that have on the situation, on the tension and the dangers for our men serving in the Lebanon, without there being any justification for it?  What was the political need or the desirability of such a statement being issued?  What was the diplomatic justification for it?  I should like answers to these questions although I have my own ideas as to why the statement was made.  I believe it to have been made in the private commercial interests of Irish nationals who are closely associated with Fianna Fáil.  My reason for saying this goes back to 1974 or 1975 when as Parliamentary Secretary in the Coalition Government I took part in an all-party delegation that had been invited by the Arab League to visit Libya.  The invitations were issued to individual members of the three political parties and I sought and received the permission of the then Government to take part in the delegation.  We went there just after the <i>Claudia</i> affair.  One of the reasons for my going to Libya was to try to ensure in so far as possible that the real nature of the Provisional IRA was made known to the Libyan authorities and that we might exercise as much influence as possible on them to stop supplying the Provisional IRA or to desist from giving them support of any kind.</P>
    <P>One of the members of that delegation is now a member of the Cabinet.  I refer to the Minister for Agriculture.  Our first meeting was with the President of the Arab League at the time.  There was one person on the delegation who was not a parliamentarian.  He was there to engage in discussions on trade between Ireland and Libya.  There was a disagreement between the Fianna Fáil representatives and myself regarding the eligibility of that gentleman to attend meetings of a political nature.  My objection was based on his not being representative of any political party, that he was representing his own interests.  In the event I refused to attend any meeting of a political nature with that gentleman.  This led to conflict on the spot, and because we were accompanied by Irish journalists <Col N="1134" /> the incident was given considerable publicity at home.</P>
    <P>At the first meeting we had in Libya the message to the Irish delegation was that Libya was now a very wealthy but an underdeveloped country, that she was engaged in massive development and there were boundless opportunities of an economic nature for any country or, indeed, for any individual who would be disposed favourably towards Libyan foreign policy and to their attitudes to some problems in the world.  They made it clear that they looked for a commitment from us as a parliamentary delegation regarding our attitude toward Israel and towards the PLO and also our attitude towards a solution of the Northern Ireland problem.  There were between eight and 12 Members of this House present when this was said, and the reply that I gave and with which, in fairness, no one dissociated himself was that as far as Israel was concerned, our position was that of the UN as set out in Resolution 242 and to which our Government has subscribed.  As far as Northern Ireland was concerned we would be very interested to enter into a full discussion with them during our stay, but only as parliamentarians and not allowing people who were non-representative to participate in that meeting.</P>
    <P>It is known to me and others&mdash;and I do not say this lightly&mdash;that there are Irish nationals engaged in very considerable commercial transactions within the Arab world, particularly Libya. These same people are very closely associated with the present, I emphasise that, administration.  Some of them were very prominent members of Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very easy to say &ldquo;tone down&rdquo; but in these circumstances it is not easy to do.  I believe that was the major factor which influenced our recognition of the PLO.  I can see no political or diplomatic justification in the circumstances in which our armed forces found themselves for taking such a step. The Minister had three or four opportunities either at Question Time or in making statements to the House to attempt to justify our very dramatic change towards the PLO and the situation in the Middle East, but he never attempted to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made this statement to underline the seriousness of this situation and to give the Minister every opportunity today to justify in political and diplomatic terms the decision and the <Col N="1136" /> communiqué in Bahrain.  If he can do that, let the Irish people decide what motivated the Government in issuing that communiqué in present circumstances. As I said, that decision and that communiqué contributed to very tragic events.  As far as our people in the Lebanon are concerned, they are not out of the woods yet.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express sympathy once again to the relatives of the three Irish soldiers recently killed in the service of the United Nations in Lebanon.  I hope that those injured will soon be restored to full health.  On this occasion I think it would be fitting to remember the casualties sustained by other nationalities who have contributed troops to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  All these tragic events underline the serious situation existing in that troubled area and the urgent need for strong support for the United Nations in their efforts to attain their objectives of maintaining peace and restoring the rule of law in south Lebanon.  This country has consistently supported the policy of the United Nations in regard to peace-keeping missions which have worked well to defuse tension.  Our strength in maintaining this support has lain in the fact that as a small nation Ireland has no ambition to involve herself directly in conflict elsewhere in the world.</P>
      <P>We recognise the value of international involvement in peace-keeping and have contributed actively and continuously to it for the past 22 years, from the time in 1958 when the first group of officers left Ireland for Lebanon to participate in the United Nations Observer Group which was then being set up.  Our firm commitment to peace-keeping has been based, among other things, on the belief that the co-operation of all the conflicting sides is essential to a satisfactory outcome of any mission undertaken. This co-operation has been available in other mission areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to have to say that it was the absence of such co-operation that led to <Col N="1137" /> the death of Private Griffin and to the murder of Privates Smallhorne and Barrett, all three of whom had volunteered for service in Lebanon.  This country's commitment to peace-keeping could not have been so well demonstrated had not successive generations of our young soldiers been willing and eager to volunteer for United Nations service, a tradition which, I am happy to say, remains unshaken, despite the tragic events of the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>In response to the Secretary-General's request to provide a contingent for UNIFIL, Ireland provided a contingent of approximately 750 all ranks in May 1978.  Since then the Government have four times extended their approval for the supply of a contingent and the Irish troops now serving in Lebanon comprise the fifth Irish contingent.  The numerical strength of the contingent has varied over the past two years having regard to United Nations requirements and to exigencies at home.  The strength of the present contingent is about 670 all ranks, comprising one battalion of 595 all ranks in the Irish battalion area of operations, a camp command element of 48 all ranks at UNIFIL headquarters at Naquora, and about 27 UNIFIL headquarters staff.</P>
    <P>To date about 3,500 Irish troops, including the present contingent, have served in Lebanon.  These contingents together with those supplied by other nations have come together under the direction of the Secretary-General and the command of the Force Commander, Major-General Erskine, to form the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. The mission of the Force is to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, to restore international peace and security and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in that area.  In the discharge of that mission all these different nationalities have been fused together as an international United Nations Force under the control of the United Nations.  It is a great pity that they have not had the co-operation so <Col N="1138" /> necessary to allow them to get on with their peace-keeping work.</P>
    <P>The situation arising from the recent tragic deaths of Irish soldiers and also of military personnel of other contributing countries prompted this country to call together all the troop-contributing countries to discuss the serious difficulties experienced by UNIFIL in its efforts to carry out its mandate in south Lebanon. I can assure Deputies&mdash;as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has done already&mdash;that this move by Ireland, which one might term a landmark in peacekeeping, was praised as an excellent initiative.  From the unanimous and warm response to the initiative it was quite clear that all of the countries involved, while recognising the need for supporting and contributing to UNIFIL, appreciated the urgent necessity for creating conditions in the mission area in which the Force and its personnel could operate safely and effectively.  The feeling of the meeting was that the troop-contributing countries could strongly support the Secretary-General in his efforts to secure the proper conditions for the Force personnel while, at the same time, recognising that the Secretary-General, under the authority of the Security Council, has the responsibility for the peace-keeping operation.  If UNIFIL were to fail in its efforts in south Lebanon the implications would go far beyond the mission area and the whole concept of peacekeeping would be in the balance.</P>
    <P>One significant result of this unique meeting was the stated intention of the Governments of the troop-contributing states to monitor developments through continuing regular meetings and their intention to meet again at Ministerial level to review progress.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said already, the Minister for Defence of Norway pointed out that not only was his country willing to host the next meeting but would be very anxious to do so.</P>
    <P>The strongest impression emanating from the meeting was the unanimous commitment of the participating countries to the concept of peacekeeping and their will to support fully the Secretary <Col N="1139" /> General in his efforts to create conditions which would permit the Force to operate effectively.  Some facts which had been clear for some time were reiterated at the meeting.  The <i>de facto</i> forces have resisted UNIFIL attempts to extend its controls over the full area covered by the mandate.  These forces have regularly harassed and attacked UNIFIL and the local population.  Also groups of the so-called armed elements are still in UNIFIL's area of operation. These factors have inhibited UNIFIL's ability to discharge its responsibilities effectively and have denied UNIFIL full freedom of movement within its area of operation.  In that regard I do not think it is too much to expect that all parties to the conflict in the Middle East should recognise and respect the peace-keeping role of the United Nations and afford the United Nations Force personnel the co-operation which is their due and which is essential for the successful completion of the Force's mandate.  United Nations soldiers on a peace-keeping mission are not the enemies of any party involved in a conflict.  Their stock-in-trade consists of negotiation and persuasion with impartiality, instruments which in past peace-keeping missions have proved remarkably effective.</P>
    <P>I sincerely trust that all those who can influence the situation in south Lebanon will now appreciate, as a result of continuing diplomatic and political initiatives, including the meeting in Dublin last Friday, that the security of their personnel in the mission area is of paramount importance to the troop-contributing countries.  All elements should also understand that their co-operation in establishing proper conditions for the discharge of the Force's mandate is regarded by the troop-contributing countries as essential if the Force is to be fully effective.  In that regard it must be manifest to anyone who has studied the situation that, with all the limitations and harassment, the Force has had to contend with, UNIFIL has made a significant contribution over the past two years towards the prevention of an outbreak of hostilities in the <Col N="1140" /> Middle East.  I hope that all parties to the conflict will now see the serious consequences for peace and stability in the region which could flow from a policy of non-co-operation with the efforts of the United Nations Force to discharge its mandate and that failure of the United Nations efforts could well lead to much wider conflicts.  The success of the diplomatic initiatives at present being taken is of vital importance if the United Nations Force is to be given a reasonable opportunity, including full freedom of movement within the whole of its area of operations, to pursue its mission to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>I can say that Irish contingents serving with UNIFIL are better equipped for their peace-keeping role than any other Irish contingents that have served with other United Nations missions.  This may be due to some extent to the call for a self-sufficient contingent but it is due also in very large measure to the careful planning of the military staffs at home and in the mission area.  The battalion is self-sufficient in communications; it has its own transport, maintenance and engineering services which include a capability for clearing mines.  Included in the battalion is a reconnaissance group of armed vehicles consisting of armoured personnel carriers and armoured cars. There is also a platoon of heavy mortars, and an adequate number of anti-tank weapons are deployed throughout the battalion.  In general their equipment compares favourably with that of other contingents and their overall defensive capability is certainly of a very high standard.  In the operations on the ground the Irish contingent co-operate with other contingents and have in turn, the back-up resources of these elements of the Force where the UNIFIL authorities see a necessity for such a service, as indeed they did not very long ago at At-tiri.  We should keep in mind the fact that UNIFIL is a peace-keeping force and is not in the business of escalation of hostilities in its mission area, a policy which would have disastrous results for the local population and for the effectiveness of UNIFIL.  Its main armoury consists of negotiation and persuasion <Col N="1141" /> in which qualities such as patience, tact and impartiality are far more effective than armed force.  If the Force is to retain its effectiveness as a peace-keeping agent it must continue with its policies of working towards the restoration of peace through the means utilised up to the present.</P>
    <P>Other services provided with the contingent include a medical platoon consisting of two medical officers, one dental officer and supporting staff who, in addition to looking after the general health of the Irish personnel, are providing medical and dental support for the local population as part of the general procedure operated on such missions. The health of the personnel is maintained at a high level due to the dedicated medical staff.</P>
    <P>I should say here, partly as a counter to the rather strident propaganda emanating from certain quarters in the area, that there is ample evidence to show that the Irish troops are popular with the local population and that their presence has been welcomed by villagers within their area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <P>The services provided in these areas by the Irish troops in health and in other ways are very much appreciated by the local people, many of whom have been able to return to their homes and to lead normal lives because of the presence of Irish troops and the protection from harassment which they give in the course of the discharge of their duties.  Schools have been reopened and normal commercial activities have been resumed throughout the villages. Tobacco crops, the main cash crop in this area, have been planted, harvested and marketed.  None of this would have been possible without the help and protection provided by the Irish contingent, and the local people have on many occasions expressed their thanks and appreciation and the desire for a continuing United Nations presence in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> That, of course, will not surprise Deputies.  Irish personnel have established for themselves a very high standard of performance in all their theatres of operation.  This has been fostered by the inclusion in each contingent of a number of experienced officers and NCOs who ensure continuity of the approach to peacekeeping necessary for such achievements.</P>
    <P>As regards the operational situation involving the Irish troops, the phasing out of the United Nation's Emergency Force in the Sinai in 1979 resulted in the provision of a contingent from Ghana for UNIFIL.  This battalion became fully operational last September.  The provision of this contingent, increasing the number of infantry battalions from seven to eight, necessitated some redeployment of the force.</P>
    <P>This redeployment in the southeastern part of the central sector entailed a significant reduction in the area of operations of the Irish battalion.  The Secretary General, reporting to the Security Council last December, noted that this redeployment reduced the operational strain on the Irish battalion. As the Irish area had been of considerable size and complexity, this move was a very welcome relief.  This was, as I pointed out, in 1979.</P>
    <P>In the same report, the Secretary General noted that there were increasing attempts by the <i>de facto</i> forces to encroach upon the UNIFIL area of deployment while, at the same time, there were increasing attempts by the armed elements to infiltrate the UNIFIL area.  As encroachments by the <i>de facto</i> forces and infiltrations by the armed elements are closely linked, one leading to the other, both problems must be tackled simultaneously.  In the Irish area of operation, the main problem arises from the actions of the <i>de facto</i> forces, but the main problem for some of the other battalions stems from the actions of the armed elements.  The <i>de facto</i> forces have established four positions inside the UNIFIL area, two in the Irish area of operations at Rshaf and Bayt Yahun, and have so far refused to withdraw from <Col N="1143" /> these positions.  This has made it more difficult for UNIFIL to stop infiltration by armed elements and to reduce the number of those elements in its area.  The efforts by UNIFIL to stop and contain the attempts at encroachment and infiltration led to a number of incidents, some of which were serious, involving UNIFIL personnel.</P>
    <P>The incidents last month, which resulted in the deaths of three Irish soldiers, arose directly from such an attempt by the <i>de facto</i> forces to establish a permanent post at the village of At-tiri in the Irish area of operations.  This village is in a very strategic position and the <i>de facto</i> forces have been attempting, since the Irish battalion was first deployed in the area in 1978, to take over this village.  These attempts have been firmly resisted and the <i>de facto</i> forces eventually withdrew to the enclave.</P>
    <P>I would point out again that the events of last month were nothing new to the village of At-tiri.  This village wishes to remain under United Nations protection. The village leader has stressed this, time and time again.  The continued presence of Irish troops in the village will ensure that the villagers are afforded the opportunity to live their normal lives without outside interference.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL maintains a number of positions within the enclave controlled by the <i>de facto</i> forces.  These positions have also been frequently harassed.  In confrontations with <i>de facto</i> forces, the safety of personnel manning these positions must always be borne in mind.  Up to recently, four of these positions were occupied by Irish personnel.  Three of these positions are now manned by the Norwegian battalion and the fourth, which is the Observer Post Ras, by observers from the United Nation's observation organisation.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the equipment of the contingent and have shown that it is as good as the best in the peace-keeping context.  While not wishing to intrude on the responsibilities of the Force Commander, I feel that I should now reassure <Col N="1144" /> Deputies that it is the opinion of our military authorities that the guide to the use of force by UNIFIL personnel issued by the Force Commander gives ample power to local commanders to deal with any situation with which they may be confronted.  The circumstances in which unarmed or armed force may be used are well defined, and the decision to use force, whether it is unarmed or armed, always rests with the commander on the spot.  In such an important aspect of peacekeeping, it is right to leave the final decision to the commander in the area concerned, who would rely on his training and judgment in reaching his decision.</P>
    <P>As regards welfare, arrangements exist for the despatch each day of the daily newspapers to the contingent&mdash;Sunday papers are also included in this arrangement. A UNIFIL request programme lasting half-an-hour is compiled by RTE each week, with the assistance of the Army Press Office.  This programme is broadcast by Radio Cyprus to the troops on Thursday nights.  The Army Press Office keeps in regular contact with RTE, with a view to making special programmes about or for the troops serving with UNIFIL.  From time to time, RTE and Bord Fáilte send special films from Ireland, while the army commands have their own internal arrangements for sending tapes with local news and requests to their own troops.  In an emergency, a soldier overseas can be put in contact with his family at home by telephone.  The co-operation of all concerned in relation to these arrangements is much appreciated.</P>
    <P>Ancillary services for the contingent include refrigerated trucks for the storage of perishable foodstuffs and water trucks.</P>
    <P>Accommodation, which was mostly tentage two years age, has been improved very considerably.  Despite the difficulties caused by periodic firing and shelling in the UNIFIL area of operation, considerable progress was achieved by the Force authorities on the transfer of personnel from tents to prefabricated installations, both at Naqoura headquarters <Col N="1145" /> and in the field.  In the contingent areas, work on the replacement of tented by prefabrication accommodation has continued, and the erection of cookhouses and dining-halls at unit headquarters is proceeding.  This programme will continue, and consideration will be given by the Force to the transfer of personnel now in privately-owned buildings to prefabricated accommodation.  Most of the prefabricated buildings in the battalion areas have been erected by the battalion engineers on a self-help basis. Tented accommodation, while ideal for summer weather, was not at all comfortable during the winter.  Because of the programme outlined above, it is expected that permanent or prefabricated accommodation will be available from now on for all personnel.</P>
    <P>It has been the custom to pay overseas allowances to personnel serving with United Nation's peace-keeping forces.  The personnel serving with UNIFIL are in receipt of the highest rates of allowances, largely because of the conditions under which they serve. The personnel are allowed to have these amounts credited to their pay accounts at home, and many of them avail of this facility.  In addition, personnel receive from the United Nations a local service allowance.</P>
    <P>Frequent inspections of the contingent and the conditions under which personnel are serving are made by senior officers. Visits to the troops by the Minister, the Secretary of the Department, the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General or the Quartermaster-General are arranged at appropriate times in consultation with the United Nations.  Any improvements deemed necessary as a result of these inspections and visits are dealt with expeditiously.  Any matters of particular urgency can get priority by reason of the radio link between the contingent and Army headquarters.</P>
    <P>At the moment apart from isolated firing incidents the Irish area is quiet.  The roads into the enclave are still closed to Irish personnel, and this restriction is the <Col N="1146" /> subject of continuing negotiation by the Force headquarters.  The restriction has not affected the current rotation of the Irish contingent, and arrangements are in operation whereby the contingent is being supplied.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned a possible visit by the Minister to meet our troops on the ground.  I want to make it clear that my immediate reaction on hearing of the wounding of Private Griffin and the circumstances surrounding it was to go at once to the Lebanon.  I consulted with the General Staff and they were opposed to such a visit at that time. They pointed out to me that the presence of a Minister in Lebanon in the particular circumstances would create problems for the Irish battalion and for UNIFIL generally.  I accepted the validity of their point of view.  I will, of course, be quite prepared to go to Lebanon at such time as the military and the United Nations advise that such a visit is opportune.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The United Nations are holding an inquiry into the death of the Irish soldiers.  This is the course pursued by the United Nations in the case of deaths of UNIFIL personnel. In addition, an Irish inquiry will be held into the deaths in accordance with the relevant Defence Forces Regulations. The inquiry will be conducted by five officers and the prime function will be to establish the facts concerning the deaths of the soldiers.  An advance visit to Lebanon has been made by the Deputy Judge Advocate General to make preparations for the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be able to inform the House that, notwithstanding the tragic losses recently suffered, the morale of the Irish contingent is high and the personnel are continuing in their dealings with the people of south Lebanon to observe the strict impartiality that is so necessary for the success of their mission. There is no shortage of volunteers <Col N="1147" /> for United Nations service, which remains popular with members of the Defence Forces.  At no stage during the past 20 years has it been necessary to invoke the legal provisions which require personnel to serve with United Nations forces.  Indeed, any complaints that have been received recently relate to some personnel who were disappointed when the latest contingent took up duty because of a slight cut in strength requested by the United Nations.  I hope these personnel can be facilitated in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be assured that I will continue to do all in my power to ensure that the Irish contingent will have all the support and assistance that the State can provide in their difficult task&mdash;not only through the supply of necessary material but also through close monitoring of their day-to-day needs without, of course, intruding on the authority of the Force Commander and his staff. Deputies may also be assured that the intensive efforts now being made to support the Secretary General in his efforts to secure proper conditions for the effective operation of the Force will be pursued vigorously in conjunction with other troop-contributing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the delicate position in the Middle East I am conscious of my responsibility in contributing to this debate.  I am also aware that nothing should be said that will heighten international tension in the area.</P>
      <P>I welcome most of the matters discussed at the meeting in Dublin on 2 May by representatives of governments who have contributed troops to the UNIFIL force.  I recognise that the State of Israel has rights and that those rights should be protected, as the Minister rightly pointed out.  I also recognise that the State of Lebanon has rights.  I was disappointed that in the statement of 2 May the Minister did not cover some other serious matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister in the House previously about the situation at Naqoura, the headquarters of the UNIFIL <Col N="1148" /> force, and he promised me that he would take up the matter at the meeting.  The Minister is well aware that this is a serious matter.  The headquarters of the UNIFIL force is situated in the Christian enclave and it comes under harassment from the Haddad forces from time to time.  On my visit there the road leading to the headquarters was blocked by Christian militia.  The high ground around the headquarters is manned by Christian militia and from time to time they fire rounds of ammunition into the headquarters.  When I was there I was informed by the medical staff that a soldier of the Norwegian force had been hit from this high ground around the headquarters at Naqoura.  This harassment is continuing not only in Naqoura but in the Christian militia enclave controlled by Major Haddad.  I want to put on the record of the House, as Deputy O'Keeffe has done already, the fact that the Israeli backing of Haddad is the serious problem.  Not alone is Israel backing Haddad with military equipment, they are also backing him with money.  Haddad can move freely in the area and be a menace to peace and a serious threat to our troops.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that after several days of debate at the United Nations in New York the Security Council on 14 June 1979 agreed by 12 votes to nil to extend the UNIFIL mandate.  At the same time the Security Council called on Israel to cease forthwith its acts against the sovereignty and political independence of the Lebanon, in particular its incursions into Lebanon and the assistance it has continued to lend to irresponsible armed groups.  Clearly they were talking about the assistance the Israelis are giving to the Haddad forces.</P>
    <P>I suggest we should seek a change in the stand taken by Israel.  We should use all our diplomatic channels to put pressure on the Israeli authorities to cease supporting Haddad and let UNIFIL continue their mandate right up to the Israeli border and take over the area which is under the control of Major Haddad.  If this is not done it will be impossible for the UNIFIL forces to complete <Col N="1149" /> their mandate.  I recognise that both Israel and the PLO have certain rights and that in any settlement between them the PLO will have to recognise the existence of the State of Israel and Israel will have to recognise that the Palestinians have the right to a homeland.</P>

      <P>In 1978 the Lebanese forces had 7,000 men and the aim of President Sarkis was to build the forces up to 15,500 and get his men into southern Lebanon where they would take over the duties of the UNIFIL forces and work side by side with them. That was happening to a certain extent when I was there.  However, since the latest problem with Haddad this great effort by the Lebanese Government to build up their forces in southern Lebanon has been torn asunder.  President Sarkis also informed me that the Lebanese forces which he had put into southern Lebanon were continually thwarted by Haddad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States who supply arms and fighter planes to them should apply pressure to the Israelis.  If the Haddad forces wish to carry out sorties into the UNIFIL area, the F 15 fighter planes are there to support them.  They have been used to strike against civilians and for the destruction of property in southern Lebanon.  On August 21 last Israeli and Christian militia men assaulted 26 villages killing 11 people and wounding 20 others.  During that attack the United States expressed concern that Israel might be violating UN regulations by continuing to use US weapons for nondefensive purposes.  We should press the United States to bring pressure to bear on the Israelis in order that Haddad could be brought under some control. On August 24 the State Department warned that if these alleged attacks on the villages were true they might end their military aid to Israel.  We have a weapon here that we can use.  We can ask the Americans to help in this situation and that would help our troops in the Lebanon to carry out their duties.  It <Col N="1150" /> was reported that during these attacks phosphorous and fragmentation bombs were used.  These bombs were banned by the Geneva Convention and this matter should be brought to the attention of the Americans in our efforts to get them to pressurise the Israelis.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister the importance of establishing an Israeli embassy in Dublin.  This would be good for relations between our two countries and would be in the interests of keeping our troops safe in their mission in the Lebanon.  I am happy with what the Minister for Defence said this morning about our troops and I, too, compliment them on carrying out a very difficult job. As I mentioned before, President Sarkis went out of his way to compliment me on the behaviour of the Irish troops.  We in Ireland, as President Sarkis said, have a great tradition of peacekeeping throughout the world and our troops are well able to handle any problems of an international nature.  If peace in the Middle East can ultimately be achieved by agreement on the establishment of a homeland for the Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza, it should be seriously considered.</P>

      <P>I welcome and endorse everything that has been said by the Minister for Defence in relation to the strategy, disposition and overall effectiveness, within the limits that exist, of our troops in the Lebanon.  Irish people as a whole have every reason to be proud of them and it is appropriate that the Government should have given time for a motion which enables the Minister to give a full and detailed account of what is happening on the ground in the Lebanon both for the information of the House and not least for the information of the families of the Irish troops who are serving out there who are, more immediately than most people, affected by any developments that may relate to their welfare.  I also express on behalf of this party, our sincere sympathy to the families of the soldiers who have died in the service of the UN in the Irish contingent. <Col N="1151" /> I also sympathise about soldiers of all nations who have contributed to this operation.  Our natural concern with our own casualties has never blinded us the the fact that other nations are involved and they have also suffered casualties.</P>
      <P>I was particularly struck by the attitude of the media to the series of events which led up to the latest casualties among the Irish in the UN troops.  As a former journalist I was interested in the terminology used.  It will not have escaped the notice of Members of the House that there was virtual unanimity among the media in describing the two most recent Irish deaths of Irish troops in the Lebanon as murder.  This it undoubtedly was.  I hope it will not be taken amiss if I make the point that it is altogether appropriate for the media to use that terminology at this stage in history.  This terminology is very important where it is appropriate.  I argue that the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; not only can but should be used on all occasions on which unarmed Irish people are killed by illegal paramilitary organisations, not least and perhaps especially when those murders take place within the confines of this island.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs made one comment during his remarks this morning which I could underscore.  He asked for acceptance on all sides of the House that what was involved here was not a war or battle, whether of words or any other kind, between the State of Israel and the State of Ireland, but a conflict at various levels between forces which are effectively armed and controlled by Israel, and the UN itself.  It is appropriate therefore to suggest to the Israeli Government that if they seek to rely, as they are legitimately entitled to do, on the provisions of the UN Resolution 242 in relation to their territorial integrity and their rights to exist as a nation, they cannot and should not turn around and flout other UN resolutions and provisions because temporarily it is diplomatically and even militarily appropriate for them to do so at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> It is not unusual, of course, that nations in general, not just Israel, will tend to approach UN resolutions selectively. It is part of the weakness of that organisation and it will inevitably be a continuing weakness of that organisation in the foreseeable future, but all of us who are interested in the future of that organisation and in seeing an increase in world respect for its decisions and deliberations should point out occasions on which countries are attempting to have it both ways.  This is undeniably so on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It is true that the degree of support by the Israeli Government to the <i>de facto</i> forces in the Lebanon could not exist without arms supplies from the US.  If my memory serves me correctly, it is not long since the Taoiseach wrote directly to President Carter asking him to do what he could to bring influence to bear on Israel, influence which he undoubtedly has, to hinder Israel's support for the <i>de facto</i> forces.  I am surprised the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not make a reference to this in his speech.  I hope he will indicate to us in his reply the result, if any, of that initiative by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I was depressed by a particular strain running through the Minister's remarks&mdash;his frequent and continual use of the word &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;.  I have no doubt, on the basis of the communiqué he furnished to us this morning, that there is now solidarity among all the troops of the contributing nations of UNIFIL in relation to the issues they all face, but I must ask the Minister how he can reconcile his claimed solidarity with the Bahrein declaration.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bahrain declaration, I should like to turn the situation around and see what it would be like if it happened to us instead of to somebody else.  Can we imagine the reaction in this country if the Fijian Foreign Minister on a visit to Tel Aviv said that he recognised the <i>de facto</i> forces controlled by Major Haddad as the effective authority of southern Lebanon?  There would be uproar here.  Yet when we remember that the Fijian troops had <Col N="1153" /> twice as many of their men killed facing the PLO as we had facing the <i>de facto</i> force we must marvel at the restraint of the Fijian and other UN forces faced with a declaration by our Minister for Foreign Affairs which must be considered as inflammatory.</P>
    <P>That Bahrain declaration by the tion to what was actually said in Bahrain State visit by the President, whom the Minister accompanied.  I cannot recall any occasion on which such a major shift of policy was announced by our Minister for Foreign Affairs (a), abroad and (b), in the context of a State visit by the President.  Whatever about any justification which may or may not have been advanced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his statement in general terms, I find it difficult if not impossible to imagine that in any sense he can justify that statement at that time and in that place.</P>
    <P>At the very best it was counter-productive. At worst it was tragic and in all events it was unnecessary.  Everybody knows that the Palestine Liberation Organisation will be involved in any final settlement of the Middle East situation, but to take the attitude the Minister adopted, to make the statement he made at that time and place, cannot be regarded as contributing in any positive way towards the achievement of such a settlement.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party has spoken on what he believes to be the reasons, or among them, for such a shift in policy by the Government.  I should like to make it clear that we have no particular quarrel with anybody outside this House, but we would like to retain some belief in the political morality of the Irish Government, and it is this belief more than anything else that has been eroded seriously by the events of the last few months and by the Bahrein declaration in particular, which has ill served not just our national interests but the interests of our men who are serving the cause of peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, on behalf <Col N="1154" /> of the Labour Party I should like to reiterate our support for the role that has been undertaken by the Irish troops in what must be emphasised as a peace-keeping mission in southern Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL forces.  Nobody in this House is under any illusion about the difficulties of that task.  The troops and people who are related to members of the Defence Forces should be reassured of the kind of support this House is now putting on record.</P>
      <P>I support the comments made by my colleagues on all sides of the House.  The question of peacekeeping is particularly important.  The role of a country like Ireland within the context of the United Nations in maintaining and expanding the capacity of the UN, whose track record of peacekeeping is not as successful as all of us would like it to be, should be strengthened and enforced irrespective of the tragic cost it may be from time to time and irrespective of the deaths which from time to time inevitably will come about from such a role.  We have a contribution to make in this area and in so far as the Minister has attempted to co-ordinate the troop-contributing countries in their efforts in this area I commend him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the honour and pleasure of recently hearing Lord Philip Noel-Baker speaking, as a person of 90 years of age with unrivalled experience on the question of disarmament and peacekeeping generally, about the increasing capacity of small nations to perform the role of peacekeeping.  We cannot talk of peacekeeping in a vacuum in south Lebanon without looking at the whole question of Israel.  We cannot do that without realising how critically important the Middle East is for this country and for the world.  It is the powder keg of the third world war, Afghanistan not withstanding.  It is the powder keg for many reasons but perhaps the most critical is that of energy supplies to the western world.  Prior to the oil crisis of 1974 western countries and conservative parties tended to support the Israeli state without too much criticism.  Fianna Fáil had long been associated as an uncritical <Col N="1155" /> supporter of the Israeli state.  The harsh reality of the Arab control of oil supplies has dramatically changed that.</P>
    <P>It is hard to reconcile the statement contained in the Minister's speech which reads:</P>
    <P>In particular we understand that Israel is deeply concerned about its security.  We deplore and condemn attacks from across its border which have brought death or injury to its people&mdash;just as we deplore and condemn all acts of violence that bring death or injury to people in the region.</P>
    <P>One would expect a Minister with the actual experience of office of the present incumbent to be particularly sensitive to the very delicate situation that exists in the Middle East.  One would expect that a Minister with the experience in politics, both domestic and international, that the present incumbent has would be acutely aware of the history of the Israeli people who, since the foundation of the state under a United Nations resolution in 1948 to the present day, have been under attack or threat of attack.  One would expect that, with a Minister who has the advice, experience and expertise of the Department of Foreign Affairs which, as far as this party is concerned has the expertise to keep most of its Ministers right in sensitive areas, the statements that emerged from Bahrein on a return trip home would have been avoided.  The Minister may say what he likes in relation to what was actually said in Bahrain but the response of the State of Israel to their reading of that statement&mdash;this after all is the essence of diplomacy&mdash;was perceived, as Deputy Horgan said, as a major shift in the Republic of Ireland's attitude to the State of Israel and its security.  The Minister said in his speech that the only reason why the <i>de facto</i> forces have put pressure on the Irish contingent was their unique security position, given the geography of that area of south Lebanon.  It seemed to be part of a pattern where the Haddad forces would probe contingent by contingent. He made no reference to the fact that as far as the state of Israel is concerned there was a perceived shift in the Irish <Col N="1156" /> Government's attitude to that state's right of existence.  The Minister now says, and has repeatedly stated, that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>History has a savage and vicious lesson to teach all of us.  We have been prepared to tolerate minorities when times were good but we made minorities the scapegoat of the failure of economic systems, such as capitalism, when times got bad.  Now, because of the energy crisis and because somehow or other a minority in the world's population appear to be in the way of preventing western Europe from getting access to energy supplies, our memory is fading very rapidly.  If the State of Israel is breaking United Nations resolutions, as we know it is, it is at least doing it with the memory of the abandonment of it by the people of Europe in the past.  There has been a horrible re-echo of history in the way there has been a rush to embrace Arab delegations, Arab contracts and Arab prospects because of the present situation, not just by this conservative Government but by others as well, their common characteristic being their conservative nature, be they Gaullist, Fianna Fáil or right wing of one kind or another.</P>

      <P>They have a particular record in this regard.  The Minister is attempting to suggest to the House that the statement of Bahrain had nothing to do with what happened recently in south Lebanon.  He cannot prove that or effectively make it stick.  Leaving that aside, let us look at some of the other initiatives taken by this Government in relation to the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the countries contributing troops were brought together in this country.  I read with interest the communiqué the Minister made available to the House.  I hope the démarches in the various capital cities will produce some kind of response.  Effectively we all realise that to enable UNIFIL to operate in southern Lebanon there must be consent and co-operation <Col N="1157" /> from Israel.  Israel must be reassured in the context of the oil crisis concerning the entire world that it will not be abandoned. The biggest backer in terms of equipment of Israel is the United States. The Minister for everything in particular, or so it would appear, the Taoiseach outside the House indicated that he had specifically requested the US President to exercise pressure on the State of Israel and their Government to try and influence the <i>de facto</i> forces which it effectively controls to make the role of UNIFIL possible in south Lebanon.  There was no mention of that in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>There was no mention of any response whatever from the Unites States President. Are we to assume that the Taoiseach sent a message to the United States President?  Was this part of the overall exercise in government by performance in the newspapers and the media, but when you try to put down a question here you get nothing from it?  If we were to put down a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;there would be no point in putting it down to the Taoiseach because he would deny responsibility for it&mdash;what answer would the Minister for Foreign Affairs give us?  In his reply will he tell us what exactly has been the response of the President of the United States?  Obviously it has not been of great substance.  If it was, it would be stitched into the Minister's opening speech.</P>
    <P>Because of the size of this country, because of the impact of the deaths, the murders to use Deputy Horgan's words, particularly of two of the soldiers, we have focussed in on the happenings in south Lebanon without perhaps looking at the reasons why we have people there in the first place.  Why is it essential that it is a peace-keeping rather than a peace-enforcement role?  What is the long-term prospect?  Is this a stalemate that will go on forever?  What are the ingredients for getting a long-term solution for this problem?  Since its accession to the United Nations in 1956 this country has consistently and strenuously supported the role of small nations in attempting to <Col N="1158" /> get some degree of co-operation and agreement throughout the world in international affairs.</P>
    <P>Any action the Government may take in strengthening the role of small nations through the forum of the United Nations, and in strengthening the role of peace-keeping forces in any part of the world, particularly in an area as sensitive as this, certainly warrants our support and will certainly get the support of the Labour Party.  We are not prepared to give support to that kind of diplomatic endeavour which, by its very nature, takes time and effort and persuasion, if it is to be thrown out the window in a speech by the Minister on the way home from Africa when for economic reasons or for other reasons he puts that whole role at risk.</P>
    <P>The Minister will strenuously deny that that is the case but, as far as the media are concerned, as far as the response of the state in question is concerned, that is the case.  It is quite possible that the Minister may not have meant it like that, but what he meant and what he did are two different things. What is now the reality is the situation in south Lebanon.  We need to reinforce the capacity of the UNIFIL forces, working through the procedure of the United Nations and with their full support, to fulfil the task they have been requested to do.  We will support the Minister in the areas where he can be supported, because I believe in as much co-operation as possible in international affairs in the House.  The Labour Party support those efforts, but they must not and cannot be undermined by a contradictory foreign affairs policy on this area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in his reply, to give the House the benefit of his knowledge of how successful the Taoiseach's intervention has been with the United States President in relation to exercising the pressure the US appear to have with the State of Israel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I should like to join with other Members <Col N="1159" /> of the House who paid tribute to our Army, who have played such an important role as peacekeepers throughout the troubled spots of the world, and to sympathise with the families of the Army personnel who were killed or murdered in the Lebanon.  We saw that endorsed in no uncertain way by the Irish people at the funerals of those men.  I hope their widows and families will be looked after in the matter of housing and compensation and that their needs will be met adequately.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach gave us an opportunity to have this debate and that the Minister contributed to it.  I am glad the Minister for Defence spoke about the equipment and support for our troops in the Lebanon, because there is a rumour that they are not as fully equipped as the other United Nations troops.  I am glad the Minister for Defence made a statement allaying those fears and discounting those rumours.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that a Minister and a parliamentary delegation should visit the Lebanon for on-the-spot negotiations and discussions.  It is difficult to understand the situation without being on the ground there.  The Minister said that the presence of a Minister in the Lebanon would aggravate the situation, or endanger it, or words to that effect. That is hard to understand.  This small nation has contributed very much to world peace, and I cannot understand why the presence of a Minister and a parliamentary delegation in the Lebanon would endanger or aggravate the situation. I should like the Minister to clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second short debate we have had on the situation in the Lebanon.  On the previous occasion I contributed on behalf of my party together with the Leader of the Labour Party and the Minister.  I suggested certain ways and means of bringing pressure to bear on Israel, because I believe the Israelies are mostly the cause of the trouble and the harassment out there.  I suggested that there should be a meeting of representatives of the governments supplying troops to UNIFIL.  I <Col N="1160" /> thought that was a powerful weapon, and I still think it would be most effective.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of the influence of the President of the United States.  I am glad the Taoiseach took the initiative and asked the President of the United States to use his influence.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs is replying perhaps he would give as some indication of what the response was, if there was a response.  I am still very concerned about the harassment of our troops and the campaign of vilification against the Irish troops in particular. While we availed of the meeting at which the Minister presided, regrettably I have to say that the request to Israel from that meeting was not accepted.  It seems that Israel turns down any plea to end support for Major Haddad.</P>

      <P>The meeting took place on 11 April and we do not yet know whether that request was accepted.  This is why I think a delegation to the Lebanon is of paramount importance, particularly including a Government representative.</P>
      <P>We threw away one of our greatest leverages in the Minister's Bahrain speech.  The response by Premier Begin was that we were an unfriendly nation and that it was a hostile statement.  I do not want to go into that in detail now because this is not a time at which we should be divided or apportion blame to anybody.  We must have a united approach in this Parliament to Israel.</P>
      <P>What concerns me is a statement which was published in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on May 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A claim by Lebanese Christian Militia leader Major Saad Haddad that the Irish Army had paid over &ldquo;blood money&rdquo; to the family of a <Col N="1161" /> sixteen-year-old youth killed in clashes with Irish UN troops was strongly denied yesterday.</P>
    <P>Haddad, who is now demanding more than £5,000 in blood money from the Irish Army before he declares an end to his feud against Irish UN in Lebanon, has gone on Israeli television to claim that the army has already handed over some of the money to the Bazri family.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why Israeli television is being used constantly by Haddad for the purpose of his campaign of vilification against the Irish troops. This is a very serious matter.  As the Minister has said, there has not been any response from the Israelis to the representations made to Mr. Begin as a result of the meeting of the 11.  I am pleased to note that there is to be a meeting of the 11 again and that the Minister will then have a progress report but the point must be made that an immediate response is absolutely necessary.  Since we have been through the normal process of negotiations there should be direct contact now with the Israeli Government because of the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>Something else to come out of that meeting was the news that an indication was given at least that, if our operations in the Lebanon were not successful and that if we were not able to implement the mandate given to us, there was the suggestion that we would have to consider our usefulness in the area.  We have a serious and a vital international role to play in the preservation of world peace and it is important that we would continue to have a presence in the Middle East or in any other such area.</P>
    <P>This raises the question of the mandate. It is extraordinary that at the meeting concerned the Minister should have said that the question was not one of renewing the mandate but one of fulfilling it and of the UNIFIL forces' ability to fulfil that mandate.  Is the time opportune to review the mandate?  If it cannot be fulfilled is it not important that <Col N="1162" /> it be reviewed and that changes would be made to it if necessary?  It is worth recalling in this context that during the debate in this regard in this House in May 1978 the leader of this party, speaking from his experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the previous administration, said that the mandate was vague and he forecast the situation exactly as it has arisen today.  Therefore it is important that the mandate be reviewed and, if necessary, changed.  It is necessary to reiterate the fact that our troops are not in the Middle East to be put in any position of confrontation with any of the forces there.  Neither are they there to take sides.  Perhaps what the Minister for Foreign Affairs had to say on the occasion concerned had some merit, but the timing was wrong and to that extent it was irresponsible.  We must explore every avenue to ensure that the campaign being launched against our troops will not continue.  If there should be any suggestion that we have not been playing a useful role in the area such suggestion would be regarded as a victory for the Haddad forces.  Although Israel indicated her full support for the mandate she might not be all that much displeased if the UNIFIL function in the Lebanon should prove to be unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that the Minister clarified the position in regard to arms and equipment.  The Minister referred to a number of armoured cars and to vehicles of that kind.  My information is that we have four Panhard-90 armoured cars and that these are not sufficient for dealing with the situation.  They may be all right in a situation of peace and quiet but not in the event of serious confrontation. However, I am glad to hear that there is co-operation and that our people may call on other UNIFIL forces in the event of an emergency of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am informed also that we acquired some Milan anti-tank missiles in 1979 and that their use should be considered in this operation because of their usefulness in respect of the duties which our troops must perform.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing from the Minister in respect of the various questions <Col N="1163" /> I have raised and I should like to hear why the presence of the Minister for Defence should aggravate the situation in the Lebanon.  We deserve an explanation as to why the political head of a Department should aggravate a situation by his presence.  He should be able to visit the troops if he so wishes.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions but I would point out that some of the remarks made by Deputy Cluskey were ill advised, to put it mildly, and I shall deal with them before going on to the main tenor of my reply.</P>
      <P>In respect of Irish foreign policy in the Middle East or elsewhere, it is dictated entirely by Ireland's national interest, as the Government of Ireland see it.  There is no question of any pressure from groups of businessmen or groups of any kind exercising any influence whatever in the determination of that decision taken by the elected Government in the interests of the Irish people.  That is our consistent approach to foreign affairs decisions.</P>
      <P>I also want to reject absolutely any suggestion that there is a correlation between the Irish foreign policy attitude and the unfortunate casualties in the Lebanon.  These casualties, thankfully, have been very few so far and have been spread throughout all the troop-contributing countries.  In an RTE interview the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland was asked if Irish recognition of the PLO having a role to play in the Middle East had any bearing on the situation in south Lebanon.  I quote from what he said: &ldquo;I think there is no correlation there and none should be suggested&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would like to emphasise also that the reality behind Irish foreign policy in the Middle East is directly in accordance with the stated decided policy of the United Nations.  A number of resolutions taken last November <Col N="1164" /> finally culminated in a resolution of 29 November 1979, incorporated in the record of the 34th session of the United Nations.  A specific resolution was passed by an overwhelming majority.</P>
      <P>The General Assembly,</P>
      <P>Having considered the report of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people,</P>
      <P>Having heard the statement of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, the representative of the Palestinian people,</P>
      <P>1.  Expresses its grave concern that no just solution to the problem of Palestine has been achieved and that this problem therefore continues to aggravate the Middle East conflict, of which it is the core, and to endanger international peace and security;</P>
      <P>2.  Reaffirms that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East cannot be established without the achievement, <i>inter alia</i>, of a just solution of the problem of Palestine on the basis of the attainment of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right of return and the right to national independence and sovereignty in Palestine in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations;</P>
      <P>3.  Calls once more for the invitation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the representative of the Palestinian people, to participate, on the basis of General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX), in all efforts, deliberations and conferences on the Middle East which are held under the auspices of the United Nations, on an equal footing with other parties;</P>
      <P>That is the policy of the United Nations. It is also the policy of a number of troop-contributing countries who have specifically stated that Palestine should be recognised and that the role of the PLO should be acknowledged in such negotiations.</P>

      <Col N="1165" /> Ghana said:</P>

    <P>Italy said:</P>

    <P>I could also refer to a number of our European partners who expressed themselves equally forcibly.</P>

The first is the right of the Palestinian people to have their problem finally settled along the path of self-determination, so that they are no longer the refugees of the Middle East, and the second is that that be done within the context of a negotiated peace settlement of the Middle East in which the territorial integrity of the State of Israel will be guaranteed. That is the central issue in the whole Middle East problem.</P>

      <P>Ireland is in accord with all our fellow member states of the European Economic Community and with the overwhelming majority of states members of the United Nations.  So far as Europe is concerned, peace in the Middle East is essential because the two parts of the world are complementary&mdash;technology and expertise on the one hand in western Europe and natural resources and naturally intelligent people on the other.  These people are utilising legitimately the revenues they are getting from their own natural resources.  Within that context, the State of Israel must be guaranteed its territorial integrity.  That is a <i>sine qua non</i> in regard to any peace settlement or any attempt at a peace settlement. The <i>sine qua non</i> is that all parties sitting down around a table to negotiate a peace settlement must recognise the right of Israel to its territorial integrity and to its independence as a State.</P>

      <P>I am not going to comment on Middle Eastern rhetoric; I am talking about the need for a negotiated peace settlement.  I quote from paragraph 5 of the Bahrain Communiqué in this respect which says:</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed that the Palestinian people had the right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State in Palestine within the framework of a negotiated peace settlement which would include the principles of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.</P>
      <P>These are the specific resolutions to do with organising a negotiated peace settlement that would, as a pre-requisite, recognise the independence and territorial integrity of the State of Israel. Therefore the recognition of Israel is built into that paragraph.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 6 of the same communiqué states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two sides stressed that all parties, including the PLO should play a <Col N="1168" /> full role in the negotiations for a comprehensive peace settlement.  In this regard, Ireland recognises the role of the PLO in representing the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>It says nothing more and nothing less than that.  That is precisely in accordance with the terms of the United Nations Resolution I have just read out, a United Nations Resolution passed by an overwhelming majority of all the civilised nations represented there.</P>

      <P>The exact figures were: 117 for, 14 abstentions and 16 against. That is where our policy stands.  Indeed our whole policy has been dictated since our entry into the United Nations by a recognition of the fact that it is only through the medium of the United Nations that peace can be maintained in the troubled areas of the world.  As a small country we have played an honourable role in that respect by contributing to various peace-keeping forces in various parts of the world over the years and, through our military personnel, have acquired a recognised expertise in handling these particularly ticklish problems on the ground in an excellent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the immediate question of the Lebanon, but I thought I would make those earlier remarks because those matters tended to dominate the debate.  Indeed that is only proper, because the whole question of the Middle East is like a domino situation, each one affecting the other.  It is important to recognise that within the Lebanon itself the presence of the UNIFIL force is an essential element in preserving a very shaky fabric, a very difficult fabric to sustain.  But the presence of the UNIFIL force is essential in order to maintain that fabric.  Its withdrawal would be very serious and disruptive.  We feel very strongly that, provided we can get the mandate made effective, a continued UNIFIL presence there, of which we can be a partner, will be beneficial to the Lebanon and to the area as a whole.  The purpose of our <Col N="1169" /> meeting last Friday was to take steps to ensure that that mandate will be made effective, and we have already initiated diplomatic moves in that direction.  I have had no response yet&mdash;the meeting was held only on Friday last&mdash;but all I can report to the House is that it was very successful and that we shall move on from there in pursuance of our objective in a political and diplomatic manner.</P>

We will pursue our responsibilities on the basis of solidarity.  If we take any decision on a review of the matter in regard to our continued presence there, it will not be a decision taken on a unilateral basis but rather one taken as a group and after full consideration of all the facts.</P>

    <P>There is one final matter to which I should refer, raised, I think, by Deputy Creed&mdash;the question of the possibility of a visit by the Minister for Defence to the Lebanon.  On the occasion of the first incident the Minister for Defence very rightly took up the matter with the Army <Col N="1170" /> authorities.  The Army authorities, in their wisdom, decided that, as a matter of military security, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to go there. But I have no doubt that the Minister will go there when the Army authorities deem it proper and opportune for him to do so.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the opportunity this has offered for a constructive debate.  I do not think on this occasion I will exclude Deputy Cluskey from that.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of an ombudsman, whose function is to investigate individual grievances arising in the course of public administration.</P>
    <P>In introducing this measure, I recognise the need to safeguard the rights of individual citizens in our modern society.  In recent decades, in Ireland and elsewhere, the scope of state administration has greatly expanded, especially in the fields of education, health, social welfare, housing and physical planning.  Areas previously considered to be the preserve of private individuals and undertakings now come under the wing of the State.  The State now offers a range of financial incentives for agriculture and industry; it provides health services, housing and income maintenance schemes for large sections of the population, and it regulates working conditions, food standards and physical planning.</P>
    <P>Clearly the individual citizen now comes into increasing contact with Government Departments and other public agencies.  Decisions taken within those Departments or agencies may have a considerable importance for him. Problems can therefore arise in reconciling the efficient exercise of governmental power and treatment of each individual case in a clearly just and fair way.</P>
    <P>Given the huge volume of State activity, it is inevitable that errors of one kind or another will sometimes give rise to wrong or unfair decisions or cause a citizen to feel he or she is deprived of some benefit to which he or she is entitled, or which he or she feels is his or her due.  A citizen who feels aggrieved will find little consolation in the knowledge that he is one of a small minority and that, generally, the system works well.</P>
    <P>There is really no fail-safe method of ensuring that wrong or unfair decisions are never taken by public officials.  What can be done, however, is to provide machinery whereby the individual affected can bring such a decision to light and have it speedily rectified.  For this reason, most developed countries provide formal <Col N="1172" /> channels of appeal for an individual who feels he has been treated unfairly by a public official.</P>
    <P>There is no need here to elaborate on the nature and limitations of our existing appeals arrangements.  These have been discussed at length in the Report of the All-Party Informal Committee on Administrative Justice established in 1976. At present, the aggrieved citizen can seek redress by taking the matter to court, by direct approach to the Minister or by raising the matter in the Dáil through a parliamentary question.  In addition, in certain fields such as social welfare and income tax there are special appeals facilities which are widely known and used.</P>
    <P>However, the present arrangements are for the most part designed to cope with specific situations: they do not adequately cater for the whole area of public administration.  The ordinary person with a complaint may be reluctant to use a direct approach to the Minister.  He may regard the special appeals facilities as part and parcel of the whole bureaucratic set-up which in his view is unlikely, therefore, to produce a fair result.  An appeal to court can be a long drawn out and expensive business and, since most disputes between individuals and public agencies concern relatively small matters of immediate moment, courts do not really present an appropriate forum for airing the citizen's grievance.  While Parliamentary Questions have, to some extent, been used to highlight individual problems, Deputies would readily admit that they can never fully meet the problem.  In sum, existing procedures and institutions do not provide an adequate appeals system.</P>
    <P>The problem of ensuring an effective means of redress for the aggrieved citizen has been tackled in other countries, some of which have sought a solution in the establishment of an ombudsman. Of course, the idea of setting up an ombudsman in Ireland is not new. But perhaps the best starting point for consideration of the present proposals is the establishment by the Dáil in 1976 of an All-Party Committee to consider the <Col N="1173" /> desirability of the ombudsman institution. The Committee consisted of 12 members drawn from both Dáil and Seanad.  Its Chairman was Deputy Ryan, then Minister for the Public Service, and the vice-chairman was the present Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary here to go into any great detail on the work of the All-Party Committee.  It held its first meeting in July 1976 and published its report in May 1977.  Suffice it to say that the committee's recommended the establishment of an ombudsman along the lines of the accepted international model.  The committee's report was released to the press without delay, with a statement indicating that the Government proposed to legislate to give effect generally to the recommendation.</P>
    <P>Following the change of Government in July 1977, the new Minister for the Public Service informed the Dáil that, while there was no objection in principle to the committee's recommendations, there had been general agreement among the committee members that the views of interested members of the public would be obtained before the legislative proposals were prepared.  Advertisements for this purpose were published in the newspapers early in 1978 and following consideration of the responses preparation of the legislation commenced.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of delay in bringing forward our Bill.  Indeed, last November Deputy Ryan introduced his own Private Members' Bill and we on this side of the House explained that the legal difficulties were such that we could not accept Deputy Ryan's Bill, even as a basic draft.  There is no doubt that our present Bill proved a difficult one to draft, but let me make one thing clear, our concern is not&mdash;as was alleged during the debate on Deputy Ryan's Bill&mdash;to bring in a Bill which is perfect, or to which the collective wisdom of this House can add nothing.  Our concern is to bring in a Bill which is workable, which will stand the test of practical operation over a reasonable period of <Col N="1174" /> time.  We think it important that we get it right first time around and avoid the necessity for amending legislation which could deflect the ombudsman and his staff from their work at the crucial initial stage of the office's operation.</P>
    <P>Much of the legislation with which we in this House deal is limited in scope; it deals with a single problem area or with one part of our public administration. Some of it, like our company law or taxation law, is prepared in the full realisation that those affected by it will, in practice, be assisted by trained specialists or have its detailed workings examined by the courts.  Ombudsman legislation is different. It grafts onto our public administrative and political systems an entirely new institution.  It introduces into the working environment of virtually every public official a new element of constraint.  It superimposes on a maze of self-contained legal provisions administered by public bodies a new law which affects all of them.  All these departures from the legislative norm call for extraordinary care in translating the general blueprint provided by the All-Party Committee into sections of a Bill. The really unusual feature of this Bill is that it provides a redress facility which can be activated, not by professionals but by any citizen who feels he has been `done down' by the bureaucracy.  We want to ensure that when a citizen triggers off an ombudsman's investigation, the ombudsman can proceed to the heart of the matter without getting entangled in legal disputes or bogged down in a morass of conflicting statutes. Because of this, we thought it necessary to take exceptional care in drafting our Bill and in visualising the practical situations which will arise on its implementation.</P>
    <P>It would be easy, and wrong, to see the ombudsman legislation in isolation. For my part, I see it both as an enhancement of individual rights and as one of many steps required in a major programme of public service reform.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State entrusted by the Government with carrying out that programme, I am dismayed to find that <Col N="1175" /> the public&mdash;and, indeed, politicians &mdash;sometimes see public service reform as marginal to the business of government, or irrelevant to the needs of the individual citizen.  It is not, and the conflicting criticism often heard that public servants are seen as having on the one hand too much and on the other too little discretion is a clear illustration of its relevance.  The civil servant dealing with the public is, under our present dispensation, in a difficult position.  He is expected on the one hand to be an adviser, ensuring that all his Minister's actions are legally correct and defensible and analysing and offering views on the available options.  This role calls for certain skills, temperament and expertise. At the same time, he is expected to be a manager in the best modern manner, identifying and even anticipating the citizen's needs and taking imaginative steps, within the law and within Government policy to meet them.  While, in general, our civil servants perform with a high degree of dedication and competence, it is clearly very difficult for any individual to discharge both of those roles at once.</P>
    <P>One of the prominent features of the Government's present programme of public service reform is to separate those two roles.  The task of advising Ministers and assisting in policy formulation will be carried out by groups closely involved with Ministers, while the execution of the policy will be the responsibility of much more autonomous groups of staff with much less ministerial intervention on a day-to-day basis.  The ability of the ombudsman to investigate complaints about the way in which these officials perform their duties will ensure accountability and protect the citizen against arbitrary behaviour.</P>
    <P>A second facet of this devolution of functions affects, as will the institution of an ombudsman's office, the role of deputies and senators.  All of us in this House are aware of the dual function of the public representative as both a legislator and sort of roving ambassador from constituents to various branches of the administration.  The latter is a task <Col N="1176" /> which most of us willingly accept as a concomitant of electoral success; it does, indeed, play a vital part in the operation of our current administrative structures by ensuring that the upper echelons of our public service are kept in touch with their organisation's public contact point. I would expect that, to some small degree, an ombudsman would relieve public representatives of the more routine aspects of this task and allow us to bring more of our energies to bear on the review of policy and the consideration of legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the proposals in the Bill, let me first clarify what exactly the ombudsman is intended to be.  There seems to be some misapprehension on this subject.  The ombudsman is not intended to be some kind of overlord, avenging the misdeeds of bloody minded bureaucrats.  Rather, he will be an independent and easily reached mediator. His role will be purely to investigate and report.  His importance will lie in his power to investigate the actions of administrators and to report on these to the Oireachtas.  To the man in the street, the ombudsman will seem an important and independent figure, a known form of redress.  Informality, speed and accessibility will be the keynotes of his office.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the Bill provides for the establishment of an ombudsman who can investigate, either of his own motion or on the basis of a complaint from any member of the public, actions taken by a body listed in the first schedule of the Act.  Initially, his remit will be confined to Government departments and offices staffed by civil servants, but the Government will be empowered to extend it by subsequent orders to local authorities, health boards and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Certain areas, notably the courts, security matters, military activities and intergovernmental relations will be exempt from his scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into detail on the specific provisions of the Bill, but since it is a long and complex measure I propose to comment on some of its noteworthy features.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> It is proposed in this Bill that the ombudsman shall be appointed by the President on the resolution of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  Deputy Ryan's Bill, following the recommendation of the All-Party Committee, provided that the appointment and removal of the ombudsman would require a two-thirds majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, this would contravene Article 15.11.1 of the Constitution, and to conform with the requirements imposed by this Article we have provided that only a simple majority is required.  Notwithstanding this departure from the letter of the committee's recommendations, I and the Government regard it as vital to the success of the institution that the ombudsman be acceptable to all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>The terms of the employment of the ombudsman are very important.  These are set out in section 2 of the Bill.  The independence of the ombudsman is of vital importance, because if he is to be widely accepted he must be seen to be an independent authority.  The Bill sets out that the ombudsman shall be independent in the performance of his duties.  It is hoped that the six-year term of office will underline the independence of the ombudsman's office from any government.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman may undertake an investigation either of his own motion or as a result of a complaint by a member of the public.  This is unlike the situation in England, where the complaint must be made through a Member of Parliament. We feel that to channel all grievances through a Deputy would be unnecessarily complicated and might prevent some complaints from reaching the ombudsman.  Initially, the ombudsman's remit covers only the actions of Government departments, with certain specified exceptions.  We have decided, on practical grounds, as recommended by the All-Party Committee, to exclude for the time being the actions of local authorities, health boards and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Let <Col N="1178" /> me stress, however, that the exclusion is simply a temporary one and that the Bill provides for the extension of the ombudsman's power to these areas.</P>
    <P>Certain activities of Government departments will not be subject to the ombudsman's scrutiny, notably the Gárda and prisons.  These activities have been excluded because their work is mainly subject to the scrutiny of the judiciary or else related to security or subject to existing appeals machinery.</P>
    <P>Needless to say the ombudsman may not investigate an action if it is trivial or vexatious, if the complainant has insufficient interest in the matter or has not already used reasonable means to remedy his grievance.  However, the ombudsman will give the complainant reason for his refusal.</P>
    <P>Certain other matters are excluded from the ombudsman's remit, and although I do not intend to detail all of these I would like to make a few observations on some of these exclusions.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman will not investigate where legal proceedings have been initiated or where there is a statutory right of appeal to a court or where there is right of appeal to independent tribunals or referees drawn from outside the civil service.  It is not intended that the ombudsman should replace existing appeals procedures or interfere with the judicial process.</P>
    <P>Defence matters have been excluded on the ground that they do not greatly impinge on the everyday life of the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>Public service personnel matters are also excluded.  We feel that the ombudsman is intended to be concerned with grievances arising out of the dealings of public servant with the ordinary citizen and not with the relationships between employer and employee.  Any alteration in the mechanisms available to public servants aggrieved in matters of a personnel nature are not appropriate for consideration in the context of this Bill. In order to avoid a backlog of complaints, any action done prior to the <Col N="1179" /> passing of this Bill is excluded and there is a 12-month time limit on complaints.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I refer to an exclusion which caused some contention in the debate on Deputy Ryan's Bill.  I refer to section 5 (3) which effectively allows a Minister to have an investigation stopped. The background to this provision is that the All-Party Committee made an explicit recommendation, that notwithstanding the existence of an ombudsman, &ldquo;certain decisions of Ministers where they were required or allowed to make value judgements&rdquo; should be excluded from the ombudsman's remit.  It proved technically difficult to draft a provision which gave effect to the committee's recommendation, and section 5 (3) is the draftsman's attempt to give effect to the recommendation.  I would like to stress that this provision is not as open-ended as it seems.  In any situation the ombudsman's only weapon is to criticise and make public such criticism. Clearly if the ombudsman felt that the provision in section 5 (3) was being abused he would, of course, be free to draw attention to it in his report or indeed to make a special report to this House on the matter.</P>
    <P>All the investigations of the ombudsman will be carried out in private. He will indicate to the body or person against whom the complaint is being made that he is intervening and allow them to comment.  He may require persons to furnish documents and information for investigation, but has no power to compel the disclosure of any document or information relating to decisions by Government.  Any publication or utterance by the ombudsman in the course of his investigations is privileged.  These provisions, I am sure you will agree, provide ample protection for privacy of the complainant, the administrator and the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government are totally committed to the Bill which I now put before this House and as such have spent a long time in carefully and scrupulously constructing it to ensure the best practical effect.  It is an important step in the improvement of administrative justice in <Col N="1180" /> this country.  I have already discussed the advantages of the ombudsman as an accessible and informal investigator to the man in the street.  The establishment of this office should also improve the quality of public administration. However, we anticipate that the majority of cases, as has been the experience in other countries, will be found to be unjustified. In this way, the existence of an ombudsman, by dispelling any myths which exist in the public mind about the scale of administrative incompetence, should improve the image of the public servant.  Lastly, the ombudsman, by putting information before the House which might otherwise not be known, should complement the work of Members of the Oireachtas.  For all sectors of society, this is an important and beneficial Bill and I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</P>

      <P>This is my first opportunity to wish the new Minister well in his office.  Having served with him on many committees I know we are fortunate in having a Minister of the calibre of Deputy Calleary in this office.  I wish him success and I wish that we on this side of the House could leave him there.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which has been on the cards since I put down a Private Members' Motion in May 1975.  As a result of my motion an all-party Committee was set up to make recommendations on the establishment of an ombudsman. There was agreement on all sides that such an appointment should be made and a comprehensive report was laid before the House.  It took some time for the Bill to be introduced here, but legislation is slow and what is important is that it is here now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any amendments that I feel are necessary will be put down not to score political points but to strengthen the office of ombudsman.  It is essential that this gets off the ground in the right way. The Minister in his brief said that many complaints will be decided unfavourably for the complainant, but that is not what matters.  The person with the complaint should have an independent platform on which it can be heard.  An ombudsman <Col N="1181" /> would have the advantage of being able to see both sides of the coin.  Deputies can put down questions to the Minister but we have never had the advantage of being able to see the files.  We just had to accept the answer given and many people have felt that their complaints were not given the scrutiny they deserved. With the establishment of an ombudsman justice will be done and will be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>The person in question will have the satisfaction of knowing that his case was pursued to the end and that the decision is final.  Although many cases will not stand up, the very appointment of an ombudsman will tend to make officials more exacting.  I do not accuse officials of being lax, but we are all human and tend to take shortcuts.  The fact that a higher authority can scrutinise in the interests of the public to safeguard public rights is very important, and officials, Ministers and others will feel the onus on them to ensure that their investigations into complaints are made more diligently. That in itself will eliminate a number of complaints.</P>
    <P>Many areas such as social welfare, health, education housing and so on relate directly to the public on a day to day basis.  Many decisions which directly affect individuals are made from day to day, and up to now people did not have the right of appeal to an independent authority.  The fact that a person has to approach a politician with a complaint is a bad policy; it denotes a closed shop.  It means that politicians are cocooning themselves and are taking on unnecessary work.  People at all levels should be free to make a complaint to an independent authority.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the question of excluding for the time being local authorities, health boards and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, although they can be included by order. Whatever about local authorities, the health boards should be included straight away.  I do not anticipate a tremendous work load at the start of this, so we should cover all the areas of the State-sponsored <Col N="1182" /> bodies, the health boards and local authorities.  If we wait for a future time delays will occur and reasons will arise to put it back as the office might not want to take on extra work for one reason or another.  If these boards are included now the office will come into operation without any constraints and complaints can be submitted straight away.  Many complaints arise in relation to these bodies, and if they are included the complaints can be processed straight away.  Some of these complaints may seem trivial to us, but the ombudsman should be the man to decide whether they are trivial or vexatious and to eliminate them.  Is the reason suggested for the Oireachtas.  However, Article 15. know the workload of the office from the beginning?  That is not a sufficiently good reason for putting them on the long finger, and that is why I will be referring to it again on Committee.</P>
    <P>On the appointment and removal from office of the ombudsman, the committee recommended that it be by a two-thirds majority of the voting strength of the Oireachtas.  However, Article 15. 11.1 of the Constitution requires that a simple majority will suffice.  I am afraid this is another example of the Constitution impeding justice in a number of things.  Justice in this case demands that the ombudsman will be independent and be seen to be independent, and this demands that he can be dismissed by a two-thirds majority of the Oireachtas. Some time ago a person was dismissed arbitrarily by a Minister&mdash;I will not refer specifically to the case&mdash;and if we want to show that the ombudsman will be beyond political influence I suggest that the two-third voting majority of Oireachtas Members should be applied. As I have said, this is an area where the Constitution can be seen to be impeding justice.  I do not know how the Minister, in the final draft of the Bill, will be able to overcome this, but some arrangement should be possible to see that it will be done.</P>
    <P>In this case the independence of the person dealing with grievances will be all important.  From the beginning, if he is <Col N="1183" /> not seen to be independent the people will lose confidence in the office, right or wrong though the decisions may be.  We must guard against such loss of public confidence.  We have waited long enough for this office to be set up and we should now ensure that the office will be independent and seen to be so&mdash;that it will have the confidence and respect of the people.</P>
    <P>This office will be of importance not just in name but in the quality of the person appointed.  We have had the happy knack of filling such appointments from the judiciary&mdash;we have always looked to the personnel of the High Court and the Supreme Court to fill such appointments. Generally, judges have expertise, legal knowledge, to bring to bear on such jobs, but what we need here is a person trained in how to deal with human problems, not so much the law.  In other words, we need a man of great humanity who will be able to overcome bureaucracy and who will come to decisions that will not only be fair and humane but be seen in that light.</P>
    <P>A heavy onus will rest on the ombudsman to ensure that people will have had a thorough hearing before a decision is arrived at.  That will ensure that people will accept the decisions.  If the public are not satisfied with the person appointed they may tend not only to doubt the fairness of the decisions but to lose confidence in the office.</P>
    <P>Of great importance is the suggestion that the ombudsman should report at least annually to the House.  We should be made aware of what is happening in the office, the type of cases coming before the ombudsman, and he should make recommendations to the various Departments, whether they be at government, local authority or health board level, in regard to areas of discontent or irritation.  These reports of the ombudsman should be accepted and acted on by the authorities concerned.  The ombudsman will be remote from the day to day operations of the various authorities, and his comments and recommendations will therefore be of value to the authorities concerned.  If <Col N="1184" /> these recommendations are not acted on, the office of the ombudsman will not serve the purpose this House intended it should serve.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the general question of the examination of cases by the ombudsman, there must be a situation in which it will be seen that the purpose of the office of the ombudsman will be to see that justice will be done, and to effect that situation.  Departments must give full information in regard to all cases submitted to the ombudsman.  I know it would not be done intentionally, but given the volume of work many Departments have to deal with they could overlook supplying the full case to the ombudsman.  That would be wrong.  The ombudsman must be facilitated in every possible way, otherwise the whole purpose of his job would be defeated.</P>
    <P>The public and the Government are in conflict over matters about which there should be no conflict.  Agitation is caused because of closed door attitudes and lack of information from many Departments.  I hope that, without going to the ombudsman, a lot of bureaucracy might be broken down and people will take on the responsibility of considering claims and cases.  The office is so important that it will have a tremendous effect.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies will welcome it because in trying to elicit information we are often frustrated.  Now we know that there is someone we can appeal to and we can advise constituents, if we are not satisfied with the question or letter system, to take the matter to the ombudsman who will investigate it for them. He will be able to see the whole case where we only see half of it.  This is what we want.  People are not unreasonable once they see they are getting a reasonable hearing.  Sometimes people have no confidence in the way they are being dealt with.  We will find, as other countries have, that there will be fewer complaints because of the ombudsman's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The fact that the ombudsman will only deal with problems outside the <Col N="1185" /> public service and not with internal public service matters is correct.  In our document on working together we mentioned the appointment of an ombudsman in the industrial relations scene, and if such an appointment were made there would be no need for an ombudsman in the public service.</P>
    <P>It is important that local authorities and health boards should be included from day one.  The Minister said that section 5 (3) allows a Minister to have an investigation stopped and that the background to this provision is that the all-party committee made an explicit recommendation, that notwithstanding the existence of an ombudsman, &ldquo;certain decisions of Ministers where they were required or allowed to make value judgments&rdquo; should be excluded from the ombudsman's remit.  I know what the committee were looking for, but they should not be excluded <i>per se</i>.  He should make the decision and it should be written into his terms of reference.  He should not be debarred from giving an opinion on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that it proved technically difficult to draft a provision which gave effect to the committee's recommendation.  I should like the Minister to look at this again because I am worried about excluding anything like this.  It is not good and should be examined to see what can be done to ensure that the ombudsman has a totally free hand and that at the end of the day he will make the decision.  If we appoint the right person to the job there should be no conflict between Departments and the ombudsman.  If there is no conflict we have no problem.  Any person taking up the position of ombudsman will read the report of the contributions made and will know what the House was looking for.</P>
    <P>We are talking about administering justice and not just a set of rules laid down by Parliament.  Justice is not a code of conduct but will come from commonsense.  Commonsense will play a major role in the functions of the ombudsman. There should not be any constraints put on the holder of that office. <Col N="1186" /> As far as dealings with the public are concerned there are too many delays in relation to inquiries at State offices.  The income tax offices and the grant offices were closed for a period recently because the officials involved were experiencing a lot of pressure.  That is a bad sign in any democracy and the public suffer.  It is important that the holder of the office of ombudsman should be given adequate staff to carry out his duties.  I hope there is no cheese-paring.  Decisions must be made quickly and there should not be any backlog.  We must consider the question of imposing a time limit on the holder of the office and expect him to reach a decision within a specified period.  Where time limits are not imposed applications build up, as we experienced in relation to planning applications. Under the planning laws the authorities have two months within which to reach a decision, but when an appeal goes to the planning board there is no time limit, with the result that appeals can take as long as 18 months.</P>
    <P>Unless we introduce a time limit the whole question of administrative justice will fall down.  We are appointing an ombudsman to eliminate a lot of the suspicion and problems which occur in relation to Departmental work.  If backlogs occur the position of ombudsman will not be effective.  Most of the enlightened countries have an ombudsman and they are operating successfully.  The number of complaints may not be great in those countries but that is a tribute to the way the system operates.  I expect that when the ombudsman is appointed the number of complaints to public representatives will drop.  The fact that the holder of the office will report regularly to the various Ministers and this House will mean that a greater effort will be made to deal with complaints speedily.  When those reports are presented to the House I hope they are debated fully and that any changes suggested by the ombudsman are implemented without delay.</P>
    <P>One important aspect in relation to the functions of the ombudsman is the question of secrecy.  People making complaints are always concerned about confidentiality, <Col N="1187" /> and if they can be assured about that they tend to give more information. Changes in legislation and regulations suggested by the ombudsman should be implemented fully.  I consider this appointment to be a start in the right direction.  It is important that we take in such areas as local authorities, health boards and the non-commercial semi-State bodies.  The whole question should be reviewed after 12 months and if further legislation is required to help the holder of the office in carrying out his duty we should introduce it.  We must give the ombudsman all the scope and power necessary to carry out his duties.  He must have the facilities and the authority to investigate all aspects of complaints made to him.  It is important that the House gives support to the holder of this office, because we have all been frustrated by the many problems presented to us by constituents. We find it hard to get the answers we require and to cope with some of those problems.  Consequently, public representatives will be happy in the knowledge that if they fail to get a satisfactory reply to a complaint they can go further.</P>

      <P>There has been a significant drop in the numbers gaining the Higher Diploma in Education in recent years.  1,470 new teachers with Higher Diploma in Education have been employed in secondary schools in the last three years.

      <P>An agreement reached at the Conciliation Council for Teachers provides for credit on the incremental salary scale in respect of approved teaching experience abroad up to a maximum of four years in respect of service given prior to 1 June 1979 and to a maximum five years in respect of service given thereafter.</P>

      <P>As I explained, this is an entirely new scheme.

As I said I am concerned about the maintenance of the project and that it be utilised to the maximum extent.  While I cannot say at the moment precisely what form the local board of management will take, I hope the local authorities and the voluntary organisations to benefit from the service will combine to act as a management board.  In that connection there would obviously be representation for the local development association or community council on the board of management.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will outline the progress to date on the survey of urban archaelogy commenced in 1976, the number of officers involved in carrying out this survery in the Office of Public Works and in the National Museum, if any of these officers are full-time and in the case of part-time officers the approximate proportion of their time spent on the work of the survey; the areas surveyed in detail to date, the areas yet to be surveyed; the type of information obtained and the form the survey is taking; if any of the material collected to date is ready for publication; when and in what manner he intends to publish the survey; and if any or all of the results obtained to <Col N="1211" /> date have been conveyed to planning authorities who may need the information for planning applications covering the areas in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question on 23 May 1979, the Department of the Environment, the office of Public Works and the National Museum have arranged for one officer each to spend part of his official time on duties relating to the survey.</P>
      <P>Research has been carried out into the procedures adopted in other countries for the preparation of a plan for urban archaeology.  The purpose of the research is to establish whether a similar approach is appropriate for this country.</P>
      <P>In view of the involvement of the National Museum in the actual excavation of an urban site the amount of time that has been devoted to the survey in recent months has been restricted.  Decisions have not yet been taken on the form in which the results of the survey might be published.</P>
      <P>I am having the situation reviewed for the purpose of deciding on whether it is appropriate to proceed with the survey as originally visualised, and, if so, what measures are required to ensure its completion within a reasonable period of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not given any great thought as to whether the results of the survey should be published.  The Deputy will take it from my reply that I am not wishing to be taken as reporting that any great progress has been made in this area.  Part of the reason for this is that when the earlier proposals were made, the situation was not copperfastened. <Col N="1212" /> Instead, what was involved was more of an aspiration in respect of any plan.  The Deputy lived with this situation for the best part of a year and I do not think he can claim that any great progress was made during that time in the matter of the survey.  However, I accept the spirit of what is intended but the Deputy will accept that because of the new duties which fell to the museum as a result of having personnel on the Wood Quay site, it was not possible to proceed with the survey in the way the Deputy would have hoped and in the way in which I would have considered desirable. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the last paragraph of my reply where I indicated my resolve to proceed with the survey as was envisaged or else to pursue some other line by which what is required would be provided.  The Deputy knows that I am embarking on a programme of the decentralisation of the museum services and whether what is involved in this instance is something that should become part of that programme is a question that I shall be considering.</P>

      <P>I would not agree and I think that the Deputy is reflecting on the local authorities and in particular on Dublin Corporation in that he would give the impression to the House that the corporation were not sensitive to a situation such as Wood Quay.  Dublin Corporation employ planners, architects and other people who have a sensitivity in this area of archaeology and they are not necessarily waiting for a representative from the museum or from the Department of the Environment or from the Office of Public Works to tell them about the regard they should have for archaeological considerations.</P>

      <P>The Commission's proposal to establish a common classification system for beef carcases should lead to a more uniform application of intervention measures throughout the Community.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if the GATT agreement recently concluded (a) restricts in any way the possibility of action by the European Community to reduce imports of fats which compete with dairy products and aggravate the dairy surplus and if so, how; (b) restricts in any way the possibility of action by the European Community to reduce imports of manioc used in certain continental countries to produce surplus milk and if so, how; (c) allows for imports of cheese on a permanent basis from New Zealand, Canada and Australia and if so, the quantities, varieties and on what basis, and the impact this will have on Irish chedder cheese exports to the United Kingdom and (d) allows for permanent access for third country beef to the European Community and if so, on what basis and the source and quantity of such beef; if he agreed to these measures, in view of the <Col N="1217" /> difficult market situation currently obtaining in the Community for both beef and milk, if any estimate has been made of the financial cost to the Irish beef and dairy industries of the concessions and if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The replies to (a) and (b) are &ldquo;no&rdquo; in each case.  As regards (c) and (d) the Community's import régime has always permitted imports of beef and cheese from third countries subject to payment of the appropriate levies and/or customs duties. In the recent multilateral trade negotiations the Community granted some concessions on cheese and beef to third countries.  The concessions on cheese involve a reduction in levy subject to observance of a minimum import price; details of the sources and quantities were given to the Deputy in reply to a previous question from him on 11 March.  The concessions for beef were (i) an increase in the annual GATT frozen boneless beef quota from 38,500 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes, (ii) an annual levy-free quota of 21,000 tonnes of high quality beef cuts&mdash;USA 10,000 tonnes; Australia and Argentina 5,000 tonnes each and Uruguay 1,000 tonnes&mdash;and (iii) an annual levy-free quota of 2,250 tonnes of buffalo meat from Australia.</P>
      <P>Throughout the negotiations Ireland objected to the concessions.  They were accepted finally only as part of an overall package, the main benefits of which in so far as agriculture is concerned were detailed in the reply of 11 March already referred to.  In the case of cheese the Council, following representations from Ireland, approved of the Commission's putting forward measures to assist the structural adaption of the Community cheese industry.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to make a realistic estimate of the financial cost of these concessions to the Irish beef and dairying industries because of the many variable and speculative assumptions that would enter into such an estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>At present about 72 per cent of the Community's public intervention stock is stored in the Federal Republic of Germany.  Under the relevant Community rules each member state can purchase into intervention only butter produced on its own territory. There is, therefore, no possibility of butter from other member states being bought into intervention in the Federal Republic.  Due to the value of the green rate for the deutschemark the intervention price is higher in Germany than in other member states but Community aids for alternative disposal&mdash;for instance export subsidies&mdash;are also correspondingly higher.

      <P>Yes, in general, in the Luxembourg compromise proposals as agreed by eight out of the nine countries in the common organisation of the sheep market.  I think, with the exception of the United Kingdom, eight of the delegations could accept the common organisation. There was one point to which the French were objecting as well but every delegation is anxious for a conclusion of these negotiations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the reason frozen processed vegetable imports to this country have increased by approximately 169 per cent in volume terms in the past three years, if this trend is likely to continue and if he will outline its impact on Irish producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in imports is due to a rising demand for a wider range of frozen vegetables, particularly in the catering trade, which has not been met from home production.  A major part of the import increase consisted of potato products which are not produced here.  The frozen food industry is a high-cost production and distribution one in which economies of scale are an important feature.  The upward trend in demand for frozen vegetables is expected to continue and the future for the Irish industry depends on the ability of manufacturers to broaden their range of production and to compete in a highly-competitive market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>Two difficult seasons were experienced by onion growers throughout Europe in marketing the 1977 and 1978 crops.  This was due to heavy supplies and low prices.  This situation, coupled with the inclement planting conditions in the spring of 1979, resulted in a sharp decline in the acreage of onions in this country last year and a corresponding increase in imports. Market prices in the current season have been considerably better and should provide the basis for increased production this year and, I would hope, reduced imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Largely because of the seasonality of supply most of our meat export plants operate well below capacity for much of the year and could deal with larger numbers of cattle without any significant increase in employment. Increased processing of the large quantities of beef currently exported in bone-in form or as live animals would, of course, be most desirable.

      <P>The number of approved applications received from County Roscommon in the 1977-78 and 1978-79 seasons were 269 and 295 respectively.  The corresponding figures for the other counties covered by the scheme were 3,313 and 4,149 respectively.</P>
      <P>The number of grants paid under the scheme in County Roscommon in the 1977-78 and 1978-79 seasons were 241 and 481 respectively.  The corresponding figures for the other counties were 2,893 and 2,871 respectively.</P>

      <P>Grants are paid when there is evidence that the machinery is being satisfactorily used by the group for the purposes for which it is intended.  This will normally be at the end of the fodder-making season.</P>

      <P>The Government's proposals for a review of the disadvantaged areas were submitted to the EEC Commission in February 1979.  Since then detailed discussions were held on a number of occasions between officials of my Department and officials of the Commission and a substantial volume of supplementary information was supplied at the latter's request.  The matter has been pursued at Council level in the context of the Commission's proposals on policy with regard to agriculture structures.

They gave an undertaking in the election manifesto of 1977 that they would undertake a review of the disadvantaged areas.  They did that.  The proposals are submitted to Brussels, as I have said.

      <P>I have seen press reports regarding the practice of glue sniffing. There is no firm information which would suggest that the incidence is growing in this country.</P>
      <P>It is not clear that legislation would be effective in controlling such practices. The variety of substances which are capable of being sniffed is considerable and as most of them have quite legitimate normal uses the exercise of strict control over them would be unnecessarily restrictive.</P>

      <P>I assume this question refers to the distribution of toothbrushes to pupils of national schools as part of an exercise which commenced in Dental Health Week 1979 and was organised by the Health Education Bureau and the Dental Health Foundation.</P>
      <P>Sufficient toothbrushes&mdash;approximately 600,000&mdash;were made available under the scheme and all but approximately 10,000, a very small proportion of the total, have been distributed to pupils.  Eight thousand of this 10,000 is accounted for in Carlow where brushes are being distributed as part of a systematic programme of talks to school children.  Factors involved in other areas include difficulties associated with arranging distribution to outlying schools and requests from schools for additional supplies.</P>
      <P>The cost of purchase and delivery to county centres amounted to £65,000 approximately. Separate cost figures are not available for local distribution which generally was undertaken as part of the day-to-day activities of health board staffs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the press report in question and I am aware of the problem referred to. However notifications in recent years under the Infectious Diseases Regulations of salmonellosis in humans do not indicate an increase in the incidence of this infection.</P>
      <P>The Food Hygiene Regulations and health education generally, are aimed at the prevention of infection from any source, including cooked and uncooked food.  The spread of salmonellosis can be prevented by adequate cooking of vulnerable foods and by careful attention to hygiene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the institution of a special <Col N="1242" /> review of the incidence and prevention of infection in poultry factory farms I have drawn the Deputy's request to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, who has overall responsibility for animal health.</P>

As the Deputy says, many cases of salmonella in humans are of a minor nature and it is accepted that the notified incidence is not a true reflection of the actual incidence. Recent reports from regional laboratories do not show any increase in salmonella isolations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Free travel passes are issued by the Department of Social Welfare to all those who satisfy the qualifying conditions, without regard to their place of residence.  However, the entitlement of some disabled persons to free travel facilities is linked to their entitlement to a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  This allowance is not payable to persons in institutions.  I would expect, however, that health boards would give reasonable assistance to such persons who wish to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> I dealt further with this matter in my reply of 24 April to the Deputy's question to me in my capacity as Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;Dáil Debates Volume 319, column 2124.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the situation he has outlined does not meet the needs of people whose free travel vouchers have been taken away from them for the reason he has stated, because the most generous of the health boards do not seem to be able to rise above £2 or £4 a week in addition to the cost of patients' residential care?  Does he realise that the patients concerned simply would not have enough disposable income from this source to pay both for transport and for any reasonable recreation they would be entitled to?</P>

      <P>I dealt with that aspect in greater detail in reply to the Deputy's other question.  I pointed out then that I am aware of the dissatisfaction expressed by the various organisations about this situation.  This will be borne in mind in reviewing the arrangements for the care of the disabled in residential centres.  The review is now being commenced and it will involve discussions with health boards, the managements of these homes and institutions and representatives of disabled people.  I have asked that the review be undertaken as a matter of urgency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of people are involved.  The Department would have to pay for each person, whether he or she makes use of the free travel benefit or not.  That would involve establishing a suitable administrative procedure to meet a need, without, in some cases, transfers to the transport undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Present indications are that, allowing for recent pay awards and so on, Exchequer expenditure on health in the present year will represent an increase in cash terms of 27 per cent on the out-turn for 1979.  Because about 60 per cent of health expenditure is for pay and changes in rates of remuneration are not always directly related to the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index, it is not practicable to adjust the figure for the percentage increase in <Col N="1245" /> cash terms to real terms by relating it to the expected inflation rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is possible for the Minister to take the anticipated expenditure in the Department and relate it to the outturn for last year, and to compare the difference in the two figures with a suggested inflation rate of 18 per cent.  A child in the national school would be able to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy likes to take the increase in cash terms, which would be 27 per cent on the out-turn for 1979, it is simple.  However, there are different factors which will incur different rates of increase.  One cannot take it on an overall basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The House cannot accept that sort of answer.  Deputy Browne's question asked for the real increase or decrease based on an inflation rate of 18 per cent.  The Minister evaded the question in his reply.  The question is quite simple: will the Department get more money this year in real terms than last year?  The answer is no, but the Minister does not want to say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne suggested an overall inflation rate of 18 per cent.  I have told the Deputy that in cash terms the increase is 27 per cent and if the Deputy likes to deduct the 18 per cent from the 27 per cent he will have the overall increase in real terms.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the case of an applicant (details supplied) for unemployment assistance in County Cavan who had her means assessed at £18 per week derived from benefit of board and lodging in her father's home, if he considers this reasonable and if he will take steps to have the regulations amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined this case and I find that a deciding officer of my Department, in the normal manner assessed the person concerned with the value of her board and lodgings in her father's home by reference to the size and standard of living of the household. The applicant claimed unemployment assistance for a short period between November 1978 and January 1979 during which time she was living at home with her father who was in a full-time occupation and was running a farm of which he was the owner.  As the assessment exceeded the statutory limit for entitlement which stood at £11.35, and in fact did so by a considerable margin, the applicant was not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The yearly value of board and lodging is one of the items which deciding officers and appeals officers are obliged by the law to take into account in the assessment of the means of applicants for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not specify the method by which the value of board and lodgings should be calculated.  Each case is decided on its merits having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> While I have no proposals before me to amend the existing legislation, I have the question of the manner of assessing the value of board and lodgings kept under continuous review in my Department to ensure that the amounts of the individual assessment will in all cases reflect in a reasonable manner the value of the benefit to the applicant.</P>

      <P>Is there any prescribed method for assessing the value of board and lodging for means purposes in this case?  Is the Minister aware that there are considerable anomalies as far as assessment of board and lodgings is concerned? For some benefits, such as old age pensions, board and lodgings are not assessed as a means at all and in the case of other benefits they are assessed at a high level.  This is an anomalous situation.</P>

      <P>The fuel scheme, which operates in 17 cities and towns mainly along the eastern and southern coasts from October to April inclusive, is administered by the local authorities concerned under the general control of my Department.</P>
      <P>Those eligible under the scheme are recipients of non-contributory old age or blind pensions, widows' pensions, contributory or non-contributory, supplementary welfare allowances and unemployment assistance, where there are dependants, as well as persons on low income. The cost, excluding administrative expenses, is met from the Vote for my Department except in the case of supplementary welfare allowance recipients.</P>
      <P>As from the current season the local authorities concerned issue vouchers to the value of £1.50 weekly which are exchangeable for any type of fuel or which can be used to pay gas or electricity bills.

With two exceptions all the local authorities are operating the revised scheme and in Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire recipients have a choice of either method.</P>

      <P>The EEC are already contributing towards the grant scheme and this year £5 million has been approved for capital grants and £1 million in regard to interest subsidy on the figures.  Arising out of the Deputy's question concerning the request to have a moratorium, it is interesting that arrears represent only 8 per cent of the total debts on BIM boats, so that the arrears figure is at the lowest level for years.  This would seem to indicate that a large percentage are in a position to repay their liabilities.  That total of 8 per cent would hardly indicate a serious situation, but there are cases of genuine <Col N="1258" /> hardship and where skippers are in arrears with repayments arising out of hardship they are treated sympathetically.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the problems that arise by reason of the escalation in fuel oil prices, but the only country in the Community operating such a subsidy is France and the Commission are investigating it on the basis that it is not in accordance with Community practice and they will not be allowed to pursue it.  That is our information, so we are very reluctant to introduce a system which would be regarded as illegal from the point of view of Community practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>There are no grants available for the purchase of second-hand fishing vessels. Under the Marine Credit Plan operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, however, subsidised loan facilities of up to 90 per cent of the board's valuation of such vessels are available at a rate of interest which at present stands at 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to fishing gear, grants of up to 25 per cent are available together with loans of up to 65 per cent in respect of the first issue of gear for a new fishing vessel at a rate of 13 per cent.  There are <Col N="1259" /> no grants available for gear purchased subsequently or for a secondhand vessel, but loan facilities of up to 90 per cent are available at an interest rate of 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>I regard these terms as adequate and do not propose to alter them.</P>

Further consultations will be necessary if there are any further Commission proposals, but so far there has been very extensive consultation. The matter has been discussed with IFO representatives recently and the position explained to them fully. There are on-going consultations at the moment to ensure that this is done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before any development of this site <Col N="1269" /> can be commenced it will be necessary for the developers to obtain approval for the detailed plans for the development.

The plans to be lodged for approval shall include a detailed tree survey showing the species, height and circumference of all trees on the site, and indicating the trees proposed to be retained and those proposed to be felled, together with detailed proposals for the protection of the trees to be retained and their root systems during building operations.  The precise location of new houses on the site shall be determined by reference to the location of trees to be retained and their root systems, and the layout of the proposed development shall, if necessary, be revised accordingly&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) On 31 December 1979 there were 4,678 persons in special residential centres for the mentally handicapped.  In addition it is estimated that approximately 20 per cent of the 12,681 persons resident in psychiatric hospitals on 31 December 1979 were mentally handicapped.  A further 377 mentally handicapped persons were placed in community based hostels.</P>
      <P>(b) The following is a list of new residential places created in the last four years: 1976, 16; 1977, 167; 1978, 113; 1979, 144.  In addition a total of 115 hostel places in the community were created in these four years.</P>
      <P>(c)  During this year it is expected that a total of 240 new residential places will be ready to come into operation.  In addition it is expected that an extra ten new hostel places will be created.  It is not known yet how many new residential or hostel places will be created in 1981. This will depend to a large extent on the speed with which schemes at present in building can be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) Total capital expenditure in the mental handicap services in each of the <Col N="1271" /> last three years was as follows: 1977, £1,393,823; 1978, £2,151,710; 1979, £3,492,889.  A part from expenditure on schemes which created new residential places which came into operation during these years the total expenditure included <i>inter alia</i>, (i) the cost of various improvement schemes at existing residential centres and (ii) expenditure on projects which on completion will provide new residential places.  A total of some 1,200 additional residential places will be created over the next few years when the many approved schemes at present at various stages of planning and building have been completed.  In regard to capital expenditure during the current year there is no specific capital allocation in respect of mental handicap services. Provision is being made, however, to meet expenditure on on-going schemes as it arises; this is estimated to by £4.2 million.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension at the maximum rate from 1973 to 15 November 1979.  Following a reinvestigation of her means it was ascertained that the family farm is no longer worked by the widow but is let in conacre. After making allowance for expenses necessarily incurred it was decided that her means as assessed are in excess of the figure which would entitle her to the maximum rate of pension.  She was accordingly awarded a non-contributory widow's pension at a reduced rate from 16 November 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations made by the Deputy on 29 November 1979 were accepted as <Col N="1272" /> an appeal on behalf of the widow.  A form on which to state the facts and contentions relied upon in support of the appeal was issued to her for completion in January 1980.  A duplicate form was issued in April 1980 as the original had not been returned.  Further representations made by the Deputy in April 1980 in support of the appeal were submitted to the appeals officer.</P>
    <P>The appeals officer has requested that further inquiries be made regarding the assessment of means.  These inquiries are being expedited and it is hoped to have a decision in the matter available from the appeals office at an early date.</P>
