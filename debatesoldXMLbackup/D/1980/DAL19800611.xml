      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see in the list of Estimates any sum of money for Fóir Teoranta.  The annual report of Fóir Teoranta for 1979 has been published this morning and it says that they expect an increased number of firms to seek assistance during 1980.  They also said&mdash;and it is very surprising that the Government did not forsee this&mdash;that last year the number of people seeking assistance began to increase from the middle of the year.  Yet the Government provided a sum in the Estimates for 1980 which is half the amount of money that had been estimated for 1979.  It is obvious to us on this side of the House, and I should have thought to most people outside the House, that because of the way the Government have mismanaged the economy for three years many more jobs will be threatened and many more redundancies may come about.  Yet, the Government have done nothing to provide the funds that are necessary for this agency to rescue them.</P>

The Estimates which are to be taken and discussed and the times allocated have all been agreed by the Whips.

      <P>Are there to be any additional Supplementary Estimates over and above those contained in this list before the Dáil goes into recess?  I raised this question for a particular reason.  I note that there has been in the Estimate for Education an under provision for school transport and the Department have now decided to maintain the scheme as it now stands.  This will presumably mean that a Supplementary Estimate for school transport will be necessary to make up the deficit which was not provided in the original Estimate. I am surprised that there is not among this list of Estimates any provision for a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Education to enable this deficit to be made up.  Will such a Supplementary Estimate be introduced? Are any other Supplementary Estimates to be introduced on any other subject before the Dáil goes into recess?</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with a point which the Taoiseach has made.  If I understood him correctly, the Taoiseach said that those Estimates only and no Supplementary Estimates will be discussed. Our understanding is that there is a proposal to have Supplementary Estimates, one of which has been named, the Environment, and we are told there are others.  The Taoiseach has now contradicted this in the House, which makes it difficult for us to know where we stand.  I seek clarification on that.</P>

It might be more appropriate to pass a financial resolution of this sort at the end of Committee Stage or at the end of Report Stage when the amendment has been made.  When one has had clarification, then one can have a net discussion on the principle rather than trying to accept the principle before you know even what it means.  I do not blame the Minister for this situation because it is due probably to something contained in the procedure, but it is unfortunate <Col N="185" /> that we cannot get this clarification from the Minister before agreeing to a principle.</P>

I did not get a chance to look at it yet but I will accept the Minister's word and if that is so I will withdraw these amendments the purpose of which was to make sure that tax would not be deducted from couples which they were not immediately liable for because their income limit is below <Col N="186" /> the level at which people are exempt from tax but could be above the level at which normal tax rates would come into operation.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are for that purpose and the Minister assured me on Committee Stage that arrangements were being made with the Revenue Commissioners to issue tax-free allowances to people under £3,400 per annum if married and £1,700 per annum if single exempting them from payment of tax.  I understand at that stage that he would be putting into the Bill as amended in Committee some provision to cater for that.  If that is in the Bill I will withdraw my amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 10, to delete &ldquo;husband&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is in page 14 line 10 to delete the word &ldquo;husband&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; and the related amendments to which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle referred do the same.  It is accepted nowadays that husband and wife, man and woman, are equal and they should be treated as equal, yet in part of the Bill before us now there is an unintentional appearance of putting the wife in this case into a subsidiary position.  It was to change that and to ensure that they are not alone <Col N="187" /> treated equally but spoken of as equal persons in the legislation going through the House at the moment that I put down amendment No. 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated to the Deputy when we were dealing with this on Committee Stage that for the purpose of the convenience of the vast majority of taxpayers we were approaching this on the basis that their income would be deemed to be the income of the husband with the right to single or double allowances.  Each would have the allowance in respect of that income.  This was proposed because it was seen that the vast majority of cases would come within that category, and to enable it to apply automatically without putting these people to the trouble of having to make specific requests on notice to the Revenue Commissioners, we decided to do it that way.  If you were to accede to what Deputy Barry is suggesting, you would then not be able to follow the easy and convenient procedure that I have suggested.  You would have to arrange that in each case they would indicate who it was they wished to be liable to tax on the income.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, there is no financial gain from this separate or single assessment as the case may be.  It will apply automatically once the income is deemed to be that of the husband. The allowance will be doubled for the husband and wife.  It is for the convenience of the taxpayers.  Under the amendment they would have the obligation to notify who the person responsible for the tax is.  I indicated to the Deputy on Committee Stage that we could not agree to his proposal.  I understand what the Deputy has in mind about the recognition of the equal status of the partners.  We have given effect to that in the Bill.  The consequence of his amendment would be to make a lot of unnecessary work for the taxpayers and a lot of unnecessary work in the administration of his proposal.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 13 to delete &ldquo;interest over £4,800, or&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;interest over £4,800,</P>
      <P>(b) in the case of a widowed person, on the excess of the interest over £3,500, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are designed to give effect to the statement I made on Committee Stage.  Provision is being made to raise the interest relief to £3,500 for widowed persons.  The amendments provide for the increased limit and make certain consequential changes in the section. As the House will be aware, the provision of a limit of £3,500 for widowed persons is supplemental to the provision of a limit of £4,800 for a húsband who is assessed on the combined income of himself and his wife.</P>
      <P>I listened to the points made by Deputy Barry and Deputy Lemass on Committee Stage and I am responding to them.  We acknowledge that a married person whose husband or wife dies may have to continue his or her existing mortgage in order to retain possession of the dwellinghouse.  It is probably fair to say that in the vast majority of cases, they will be covered by a mortgage protection policy in one way or another. This relief will probably apply more to widowers than to widows.  That does not take from the effect or impact of it.</P>

    <P>Before the death of the spouse there would have been an entitlement under this new provision to loan interest relief up to £4,800.  In the absence of a provision such as that being proposed in these <Col N="189" /> amendments, the death of one of the spouses would have reduced the entitlement to £2,400.  That figure represents the interest in an average case at 14.5 per cent on a borrowing of about £16,550.  In many cases it would not be enough to give full relief on the house purchase commitment.  The limit of £3,500 now being proposed represents interest at the same rate on a borrowing of about £24,140 and would cover most people's house purchase commitment.</P>

      <P>I can give a qualified welcome to this amendment.  I accept that the Minister has gone part of the way to meet the point made in amendment No. 5.  The Minister is probably correct when he says widowers will benefit more than widows.  There is no doubt that the psychologically disturbing experience a widow goes through on the death of her husband takes a long time to get over.  If, added to that, there is an extra financial burden placed on her, the State has a duty to ensure, as far as possible, that she is relieved of that anxiety.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that most widows are covered by a mortgage protection insurance policy.  That is probably right.  In recent years a condition of being granted a mortgage was that it had to be covered by an insurance policy in the event of the death of the bread winner.  Unfortunately, the section is not confined to interest on mortgages.  Any interest, no matter for what purpose, can be claimed against tax.  We would certainly advise a person in that position not to borrow for consumer spending, to buy cars, or yachts, or to go on foreign holidays.  In the event of the death of the person who is claiming that loan interest against his income tax, the person concerned must pay off the overdraft and cannot make the same claim in respect of the interest on that overdraft as when the husband or wife was alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has moved from £2,400 to £3,500 for a widowed person.  That is a movement in the right direction.  I thank the Minister for listening to the points raised on Committee <Col N="190" /> Stage and bringing in, as he promised he would, an amendment to cater for them on Report Stage.  I had hoped that he would have gone further. Amendment No. 5 is in some way more limited than the Minister's, because there is no time element in the Minister's.  On remarriage they would be cut off from benefiting under the section.  In fact, they would cut themselves off because they would automatically benefit under the £4,800 provision.  In my amendment there is a time limit of seven years even if they do not remarry which would give people a chance to reorganise their finances.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister has done.  It is a step in the right direction.  It does not go as far as I suggested in my amendment.  However, unlike a lady in a neighbouring island I am grateful for half a loaf.</P>

    <P>This is the amendment that was referred to in the course of the resolution being discussed this morning.  Section 10 of the Bill provides for an increase in the exemotion limit from £3,000 to £6,000 for certain lump sum payments made as compensation for loss of employment. <Col N="194" /> When dealing with it on Committee Stage I drew attention to the fact that some top executives and directors of close companies, when leaving their companies, so arranged their affairs as to escape tax altogether on a very substantial golden handshake.  I said then that I would introduce an amendment to deal with this and to counter these devices and this is the purpose of the present amendment.  There will be a consequential effect which I will refer to in a moment.  It substitutes a new section for Section 10 of the Bill.  First of all it will provide for the increased exemption threshold of £6,000 and for the application of a new formula for calculating what is commonly referred to as top slicing relief.  This relief originally was designed to ensure that a taxpayer would not have to pay tax at an excessively high marginal rate on a large payment received in a single year.  Tax planners have, however, over the years exploited the relief and the various weaknesses in the existing formula.  In fact they have created a situation whereby directors and executives in receipt of very substantial golden handshakes have escaped tax altogether which of course was never the intention of the significant relief that was provided at the time.</P>
    <P>The new formula will apply an average rate of tax to the chargeable element of the lump sum, that is to say, the average rate of tax charged on the recipient's taxable income over the five years previous to the assessment.  In case there is any doubt about this I should say that it will be the actual average of the tax charged and not the average of the bands to which he was liable which would not in fact be an average in any event.  That would be the rate at which the figure then becomes liable to tax. The new formula is contained in the schedule which it is proposed to substitute for schedule 3 to the Income Tax Act, 1967, where the present formula is contained at the moment. That is the first point.  The second is at least as significant and will be a matter of considerable relief and easement to a wide variety of people who are in receipt of redundancy lump sum payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> The present legislation draws a distinction between compensation and non-compensation payments.  There does not appear to be sufficient reason for maintaining this distinction and it is proposed to eliminate it in the new provisions.  The second change relates to a provision in the existing legislation which enables recipients of lump sums to substitute for the exemption limit a deduction equal to the standard capital superannuation benefit from the employment.  A formula is provided for calculating this deduction which may produce a higher exemption figure than the figure specified in the section, that is, the £3,000 which has now been raised to £6,000.  It may produce a higher figure than that £6,000.  It is proposed to widen the provisions relating to the substitution of this deduction which was designed to enable an individual who might have no pension scheme or whose employer might wish to increase the benefits due to him under such a scheme to receive at least as much tax free on termination of his employment as he could have received tax free under an appropriate superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>In practice the ordinary worker gained very little from this provision and with the raising of the exemption limit to £6,000 he is unlikely now to derive any advantage from it.  So what I am proposing here in conjunction with dealing with the top slicing which is being used as an avoidance measure is that where any superannuation benefit falls short of £4,000 the shortfall will be added to the £6,000 exemption figure.  The effect of this is to eliminate any tax charge where the total lump sum compensation and any tax free superannuation benefit do not exceed £10,000.</P>
    <P>That is indeed a major step ahead of what I have already done in raising the limit to £6,000.  The effect is that there will be no tax charge on the total lump sum compensation and any tax free superannuation benefits which do not exceed £10,000.  I would hope that these changes would be welcomed by the House since they improve considerably <Col N="196" /> the tax position of the ordinary worker who receives a lump sum compensation in respect of the loss of his employment and it also ensures that directors and top executives will no longer be able, by means of various artificial arrangements, to escape the tax charge on their golden handshake payments but will have to pay their fair share of tax also on the basis of the average over the previous five years.  There will be a saving to the Exchequer because of the curbing of this avoidance but it is not possible to estimate precisely what that will be. Deputies will appreciate that when one is dealing with avoidance cases one cannot be quite precise as to the consequences to the revenue of coping with the avoidance.  The loss of the revenue resulting from the other leg of the proposal should more or less match the saving to the Exchequer in relation to the top slicing change.  We are talking about a figure of about £500,000 in a full year and probably half of that in 1980.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example.  The provisions relating to the substitution of deductions where superannuation benefits are payable ensures that no tax will be charged where the total of the lump sum compensation and any tax free superannuation benefit does not exceed £10,000.  This means that instead of the basic exemption of £6,000, a person claiming relief under the provisions for the first time would be entitled to receive a minimum of £10,000 tax free.  So if an employee receives an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment of £10,000 but is not entitled to any payment under a superannuation scheme then the entire £10,000 will be exempt from tax.  On the other hand, if he receives an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment of £10,000 and is entitled also to £2,000 under a superannuation scheme, because of the superannuation benefit being exempt anyway this would make a total of £10,000 which would be exempt from tax.  The balance in that case&mdash; £2,000&mdash;would then be chargeable to tax at the average rate on the person's taxable income for the five preceding years.  I hope that is a summary in reasonably plain man's language of what is involved.</P>

      <P>With respect to the Minister, that is as clear as mud though I appreciate that the Minister is trying to explain the situation as simply as possible. Are we to understand that anybody receiving a golden handshake of £10,000, regardless of the source of that money, will not be liable for tax in that respect and also that if the money is composed of two elements, a cash free superannuation allowance of £2,000 plus a golden handshake of £8,000, it will be exempt but that in a case, say, of the golden handshake amounting to £6,000 and a superannuation amounting to more than £4,000 the balance on the £10,000 will be chargeable to tax at the average of the tax paid by the person in the previous five years?  This is most complicated but have I got the position right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision that tax shall not be charged in respect of a payment not exceeding £6,000 seems to me to be the maximum <i>ex gratia</i> payment that a person may receive without being liable to tax.  This confuses me somewhat in the light of what Deputy Barry has said.  He has asked what the situation would be in the case of there being a capital payment of £10,000, irrespective of the source and irrespective of whether the money was made up by way of superannuation and a capital payment. This is something which needs to be clarified.  I understood from what the Minister said that a golden handshake of £10,000 would be tax free but this seems to be at variance with the provision in subsection (3) of the Table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this on which I should like to hear the Minister comment is the question of the tax-free superannuation receivable by an employee on retirement.  For instance, if a person retires and is to benefit from a superannuation scheme by way of monthly payments <Col N="198" /> rather than a capital sum, is the value of the superannuation to be capitalised for the purpose of this section or will the pension be taxed on an on-going basis?  There seems to be a slight divergence here in that the Minister seems to be favouring the payment of a capital sum under the superannuation scheme by not taxing it up to the sum of £4,000 whereas a person retiring from a company and getting his superannuation benefit by way of monthly payments would seem to be discriminated against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision is that superannuation benefit is exempt anyway.  That has been the position for some time.  In addition, the position up to now has been that a lump sum of up to £3,000 in respect of redundancy has been exempt but we have provided for that £3,000 to become £6,000.  That is the figure that is referred to in the Table mentioned by the Deputy.  It is the exemption figure for the lump sum but it is qualified by the Table in Part II of the Schedule which explains that the operation of the provision will be that the difference between that amount and £10,000 will also be covered.  Therefore, the sum of £6,000 is the basic but we are increasing it upwards to £10,000, regardless of whether the £10,000 is made up of a lump sum compensation and tax-free superannuation benefit or otherwise. The reason for this is, first, that the provision in itself is desirable and also because of the change in the provisions in respect of golden handshakes.  This change would not bring about much benefit for the ordinary workers but as we are anxious that such people would benefit and as we have provided that on any amount greater than £10,000 tax would be chargeable as I have indicated, we decided that it would be appropriate to make provision also in this context for applying the benefit of the new exemption to workers who would not be receiving a golden handshake of anything like £10,000.  The important point is that this exemption can apply only once.  In the normal course the exemption on a lump sum payment can apply whenever the situation arises but this particular extension <Col N="199" /> of the exemption can apply once only.  This means that if a person changes jobs a number of times and gets a lump sum on the termination of each employment, the £10,000 exemption will apply only in the first case.  That is why the figure of £6,000 must remain as the basic exemption in respect of the first-time payment.  As I have indicated, it becomes £10,000 in effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding a person who gets a golden handshake of, say, £6,000 on retirement as distinct from somebody who is leaving a company for some other reason, will it not be the position that the only people who will benefit from the new provision will be mainly professional or semi-professional people since by and large manual workers or blue-collar workers do not receive golden handshakes on retirement?  This will mean that a large proportion of our industrial workers, for instance, will be discriminated against.  I say this because they will be subject to income tax on their superannuation payments from the date of retirement, whereas a person in receipt of a lump sum payment will benefit substantially in this regard. Therefore, there should be some provision for a special retirement allowance for workers who are not in receipt of lump sum payments in order to bring equity into the situation.</P>
      <P>The first £6,000 of the taxable income of a person who is retiring from a job and who is not receiving a lump sum should be tax free.  I do not see why workers who do not receive a lump sum payment should be discriminated against.  That is, in effect, the result of the allowance made by the Minister for a situation where a person receives a capital sum.  I am not against the concept of a capital sum payment being tax free; I think it is good.  It is fair recognition that a man on retirement has done his life's work and, certainly, is entitled to a reward.  A figure of £6,000 is specified, although the Minister says, in effect, it is £10,000.</P>

      <P>My contention is that, in order to ensure the continuation of equity a worker who is not in receipt of a tax free capital sum should have full alleviation from tax on the first £6,000 or, as the Minister says, £10,000 of the sum he receives in his pension.  This would be an equitable approach to the matter as the present position is discriminatory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in support of Deputy Collins's suggestion.  There is a lot of complaint at the moment, as the Minister is far too well aware, about people being taxed on their pensions and feeling aggrieved that having paid tax during their lives they should be taxed again on the return from a pension scheme to which they have subscribed.  If the Minister were to consider in his next budget something on the lines of Deputy Collin's suggestion he would be going some way towards meeting this case by at least putting people who do not receive a lump sum on retirement in the same position as those who do, by allowing them to get a large tax free allowance on the first £6,000 or £10,000 of pension payments received, after they have retired initially.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look carefully at this suggestion.  We realise that his room for giving concessions on Report Stage of the Bill is limited, but we would be happy if he were to give an indication that he would be prepared to look at this matter between now and the next budget, if he ever is in the position to introduce another budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has acknowledged&mdash;if not explicitly, implicitly&mdash;that what I am doing here is giving relief, in any event.  Let us be clear on that.  While giving relief to this extent, Deputy Collins asks why we do not move into a new territory altogether. That is, in effect, what he is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton acknowledges, and Deputy Collins might also, that this is, indeed, a new territory and not one which I could contemplate at this stage. Having said that let me nonetheless indicate <Col N="201" /> the extent of the territory about which we are talking.  Most Deputies will appreciate that most pension schemes provide for superannuation benefits.  The amendment deals with a lump sum payment on redundancy or retirement, as the case may be.  Those things which are covered in this part of the Finance Act are, in effect, as a consequence to what I am doing in regard to exemption from tax this year which exemption, before this Finance Bill came in for the first time, was £3,000.  That exemption now becomes £10,000.  Everyone will acknowledge that that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have had representations on this subject, as I have had myself in my capacity as a Deputy, over the years and they have not eased off since I became Minister for Finance.  For instance, of over 200 cases which came under review under the lump sum payment concession last year, 39 were within the range of £3,000 and £5,000&mdash;they will benefit from this Bill in any event, 28 were within the range of £5,000 and £7,000, who will benefit from this extension, 76 were between £7,000 and £10,000 and those over £10,000 were approximately 57. Workers who get lump sum benefits in addition to their ordinary superannuation benefits will benefit considerably from this.  The question of exempting pensions entirely from income tax, as Deputy Collins knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Our giving more is a wider issue altogether and one which can only arise in the course of the normal budgetary considerations.  I might mention that I did make some moves in that direction this year, to say the least of it.  The exemption from tax, for instance, will affect a very considerable number of pensioners&mdash;I cannot recall exactly how many under that section but proportionately very many more pensioners than others.  In addition, I exempted entirely what one might call Old IRA pensions in this legislation this year.  I certainly am moving as fast as one can in a <Col N="202" /> certain direction and what I am doing here is moving far in a consistent direction.</P>
      <P>I take note of Deputy Collins's recommendation. It will be one of the things which will fall for consideration in next year's budget as to what measures of relief, if any, one can give at that time.</P>

      <P>The Minister has disappointed me.  Basically, I am on this point making a plea for equity.  We shall keep this figure at £6,000, ignoring the further £4,000 as a tax free income from a superannuation scheme.  By and large, the person who gets a £6,000 golden handshake is a white collar worker, probably well paid.  I am in favour of paying a person upon retirement and I am speaking about retirement and not about a person leaving a job and getting a redundancy golden handshake.  The person who, at the point of retirement, receives £6,000 is likely to be the white collar worker, probably on a fair income. Very few blue collar workers in manufacturing industries or the service industries receive a lump sum.  They may get a pension from the firm, plus their old age pension which would probably be their income.</P>

      <P>It is not quite popular in industry as yet, to my knowledge.  If it is becoming popular it is more with the better paid than the lower paid.  My point is that when a worker retires the Minister is discriminating against the worker who does not receive a lump sum payment. My contention is that in order to ensure <Col N="203" /> equity in the tax system the first £6,000 of taxable income of the worker who does not receive the £6,000 tax-free grant should be alleviated in the same manner as a person who receives a golden handshake.  I admit that it would be the State that would be financing that but I feel the State has a responsibility to the lower paid workers in society.  What I am suggesting is that in relation to pensioners who do not receive a golden handshake the first £6,000 of their taxable income should be free of tax.</P>

      <P>Possibly the term &ldquo;golden handshake&rdquo; is an unfortunate term to use because they have become associated with generous goodbye gifts to senior, superfluous management personnel on mergers of firms or other changes in the upper echelons of management structure.  The Minister may contend that he has effected an improvement here by conceding a certain non-liability for tax purposes for the so-called gratuity, gift, call it what you will, or golden handshake.  The Minister should seriously look at the extension of the principle here to all categories of employees qualifying for retirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I doubt very much if the 76 cases the Minister referred to would belong to the manual worker categories.  It is more prevalent for a non-manual, non-general worker in industry to receive these <i>ex gratia</i> payments on retirement.  Therefore, in equity, there should be no exception made as between one category and another.  In equity also the pension system applicable to the average general worker on leaving employment should be free of tax to the same value as the maximum suggested here by the Minister in relation to golden handshakes.  In other words, the same generous approach exhibited by the Minister here to a minority of people reaching retirement in industry should be applied to the generality, to all those qualifying for <Col N="204" /> retirement benefits of one kind or another.  The Minister should free these from tax liability also.</P>
      <P>The Minister may contend that this is slightly unfair of Opposition Deputies, when he has effected this improvement, to seek this widespread extension.  On the other hand, if he accepts the principle of freeing from liability the retirement gratuities of a small minority then he should display the same latitude in relation to tax liability to the pensions of general workers throughout industry.  As the Minister knows, in regard to the pension situation in Irish industry, we have been awaiting for quite some time now a general commitment from this administration to a national pension plan. It was the intention of the previous administration to introduce such a plan at the earliest possible opportunity.  In fact there is a discussion paper in this regard at present gathering dust in the archives which sets out the problems in this area and on which we have had no action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister, having given this concession to a relatively small number, and probably not the worst off section of the Irish work force reaching retirement age&mdash;and I am happy for them that they have received this concession at the hands of the Minister&mdash;must not simply confine his generosity to this small number but must, in reviewing the whole area of pensions in industry, concede the very same tax free concessions to the majority of workers attaining retirement age.  God knows, the pension schemes obtaining throughout industry leave a lot to be desired.  Very few of them match the cost of living or keep pace with the rate of inflation from year to year.  Very few of them contain any inflation-proof features; in the public service only do those obtain.  A person retiring this year with a pension will see its value considerably reduced over the next ten years with a rate of inflation, on present expectations, of something like 14 per cent average per annum.  In value the average pension does not withstand the kind of depredations wrought by the current rate of inflation unless the pensioner concerned has been in the public <Col N="205" /> service in which case his pension will be maintained in value to correspond with the rise in inflation.  But, for the generality, their pensions are reduced to the status of paper money after relatively few years.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Minister should seriously consider the idea of assisting, in the absence of any guarantees, that the average man's, or woman's, pension will be protected against the ravages of inflation, at least as an instalment of social justice in this area, the concept of freeing from tax their pensions to the value of the concession he has given here to the categories who obtain lump sum payments on retirement.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the Chair.  I do not know whether this places me at a disadvantage, the debate having been widened already to cope with these matters.  In accordance with the Chair's reminder, let me say briefly that the majority of workers, in the cases to which I have referred&mdash;and I have enumerated some already&mdash;are, in plain man's language, and I will use it when it suits me, ordinary workers, in the sense that many firms making what one might call rationalisation arrangements, some of them quite significant firms in this city, have made provisions of this sort.  The people who will benefit from what I am doing here are manual workers, be they semi-skilled or skilled, in situations of that type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, because I want to get at the avoidance that has been a major problem in relation to the executives who are able to make appropriate arrangements to avoid tax liability on their golden handshakes, it would seem that an appropriate figure beyond which they should be rendered liable to tax was one <Col N="206" /> of the order of £10,000 and that, above that, they would pay tax at the average rate of tax applicable to them in the previous five years.  If you like, that would be the starting point.  But if a figure of £10,000 is taken for that purpose I saw no reason why the exemption extension&mdash;which I have introduced already from £3,000 to £6,000 in this Bill&mdash;should not be brought up to £10,000 which would cover a very considerable number of ordinary workers, although that term is rather easy to say but difficult to define&mdash;whether workers are defined having regard to the clothes they wear or the jobs they do is something open to a lot of analysis and discussion these days.  Nevertheless, ordinary workers, be they manual or otherwise, will benefit to a very considerable extent from what I am doing here.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Chair has reminded us that we are dealing with this provision.  If in dealing with an exemption of this sort I find that I am being asked to deal with the whole spectrum of pension arrangements within the State, which Deputy O'Leary has mentioned, whether or not pensions should be liable to tax, or at what rate they should be liable&mdash;as Deputies O'Leary and Collins mentioned as well&mdash;it broadens it not just beyond the scope of the section but of the Bill, because these are matters that would be appropriate also for discussion with the Minister for Social Welfare in the first instance because of its wideranging implications, possibly with the Minister for Labour, and then back to the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In this Bill, and in the exemptions already provided, 83,000 people who would otherwise be paying tax this year <Col N="207" /> under the first and second sections will be exempt from tax and in addition 12,000 old aged people will benefit, of whom 8,000 will be taken out of the tax net altogether.  We have made good progress in that direction this year.  I have exempted Old IRA military pensions.  I am glad the House welcomed that and agreed that they should be in a special category.  Widows in that sector have also been exempted.  If ever there was a year when we made considerable progress in these matters it is this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister criticised Deputies for seeking to extend benefits conferred under the new section now being inserted.  It is not right to say that the Opposition should not seek to have these things extended if the case is just.  I can understand the Minister saying he cannot afford it, because obviously the Government do not like raising taxes, and if there is an exemption from tax in relation to one sector the money must be raised from taxation.  That was lost on members of the present Government a few years ago when they were over here. The Minister said that these things would balance out.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested a sum of £500,000.  The point I am making is that many more people will come into the £6,000 a year bracket.  At the moment there must be extraordinarily big sums involved in tax avoidance and evasion by a limited number of people.  If they are to subscribe £500,000 in the six months left of the current year because of this section there must be some of them getting away with murder at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give one instance. A company director whose employment was terminated in July 1977 received a cash lump sum of £75,000, and other benefits in kind gave him a total golden handshake of £81,000.  The income tax which would have been paid if total benefits in that year were treated as remuneration would have amounted to £44,000, but as a result of the exploitation of reliefs given in section 115 of the 1967 Income Tax Act, no income tax whatever was borne.  That is a big gap, and this House could not tolerate a situation whereby funds of that sort would not become liable to any tax at all simply because of the manner in which loopholes have been exploited.</P>
      <P>I will illustrate how it would apply in this instance.  If that person had been subject to the provisions we are now introducing, the capital benefit of £81,000, less standard capital superannuation benefit, which was £12,300, would mean that the chargeable benefits would have been £68,700.  The total tax for the previous five years in that case was £24,000.  The total taxable income for that period was £48,000 and therefore the rate of tax on average was 49.9 per cent.  Therefore that golden handshake would have attracted tax of £34,281.  The House will therefore understand the considerable avoidance there has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the budget statement I said I regarded the line between avoidance and evasion as very thin, but when people get advice as to how not to walk through but to run through loopholes in income tax law I feel obliged to ensure that the gaps will be <Col N="209" /> plugged.  I am also trying to ensure that those who get lump sum payments on redundancy will get relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the line between tax evasion and avoidance is very thin. Every Deputy is aware that tax evasion means breaking the law by fraud or by failure to comply with the law.  Tax avoidance is different and I do not agree with the Minister's reference to the line being very thin. There is quite a difference between complying with the law and breaking the law by fraud.  I do not blame the Minister for not knowing what is right and what is wrong.  Fraud is wrong.  An attempt to evade tax is an attempt to perpetrate a fraud.  Everyone knows tax avoidance is a different matter.  Tax avoidance is endeavouring to have accepted for taxation purposes the least possible assessment of income and the greatest amount of claimed expenses.  One is breaking the law and the other is legal.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's thinking when they grant concessions to one section of the taxpayers and not the other? They give concessions for golden handshakes but not for a lump sum paid from a pension fund.  Everybody knows this legislation gives every benefit to the rich because the majority of workers will not get a golden handshake when leaving work.  This principle is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few moments ago the Minister referred to the concessions being given to people in receipt of Old IRA pensions, which are no longer liable for tax.  The Minister can do that quite easily because the men of the Old IRA and the women of Cumann na mBan, who can be described as the unselfish, patriotic, forgotten minority, are growing fewer each year.  These concessions will not make any difference to the Exchequer because each month there are fewer claimants.  When considering Deputy Barry's suggestion the Minister should closely examine the pleas made by the trade union movement calling not for less overall taxation but for a fair spreading of the revenue gathered.  The <Col N="210" /> possibility of increases through catching tax avoiders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He said he had already given concessions by making Old IRA pensions free of tax.

      <P>Deputy Flanagan is only a short time in the House this morning but he has called on his long service and experience here, on which I commend him, not only to broaden but to confuse the issue.  He is making a case in favour of good against evil and with that I totally concur, but I wish to dispel the doubts in the Deputy's mind.  Tax avoidance on golden handshakes has been very significant in some cases and the action now proposed will close that gap.  I do not see how that can be regarded as a concession; it is quite the opposite. It will ease the burden on other taxpayers by about £500,000 in a full year.  Liability to tax will arise on a lump sum or golden handshake over the figure of £10,000 and will be based on the average tax paid over the previous five years.  Tax will be charged at that rate on the amount in excess of £10,000.  In many cases that will mean a considerable contribution on the part of those who hitherto have not been making any contribution at all in some cases. Everyone in the House was in agreement with that.</P>
      <P>Up to this year the lump sum which was free of tax was £3,000.  In an earlier amendment I raised that limit to £6,000.</P>

I should not teach grandmothers to suck eggs but some workers in the Deputy's constituency have written to me, having become redundant in certain activities, and have made that case.  I responded by raising the limit to £6,000.  The amendment with which we are dealing will for the first time raise the limit to £10,000, though this will not be repeated on every other occasion.  This is a concession towards the lower paid rather than the higher paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very thin line between tax avoidance and tax evasion and this amendment is designed to deal with avoidance.  Deputy Flanagan said we should not put these two things in the same category.  I have already made my position quite clear on this matter, as have many others.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions generally would not give the benefit of legal niceties to people who avoid their moral obligations.  I will take every possible action to deal with tax avoidance because I regard it as reprehensible.  I can call on the authority of no less a person than the Professor of Moral Theology at Maynooth to say that it is not only socially reprehensible but morally reprehensible.  People should not think that a technical lacuna is a substitute for conscience and this is in line with some pastoral statements from the bishops in 1977.  I am sure Deputy Flanagan will agree with me now that it is morally and socially reprehensible. The moral judgment will be made by <Col N="214" /> someone else at a later stage.  Let us not allow people the comfort of thinking it is only a question of avoidance, not evasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 42 and 43 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash; For the year 1981-82 and subsequent years of assessment the amounts specified in sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 10 and 11 of this Act shall be increased by the percentage figure as represened by the Consumer Price Index to mid-February of each year.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment despite the fact that he did <Col N="215" /> not have much sympathy with what I had in mind on this matter when we were on Committee Stage.  The purpose of the amendment is to help the Government to avoid getting themselves into the situation that occurred last year when, because of the inequities in the tax system hundreds of thousands of people protested in the streets.</P>
    <P>We have just had two lectures on morals from both sides of the House. Taxpayers last year protested because they regarded as inequitable the tax they were forced to pay.  Because of inflation and wage increases that tended to match that inflation, people whom it was never intended to tax were caught in the tax net and gradually as their allowances and wages increased they moved into higher tax bands.  As a result, wage increases were of little real value to them.</P>
    <P>The threat of revolt on the part of taxpayers has occurred in many parts of the world.  An amendment with regard to tax was defeated in California last week only because the proposers of that amendment were too ambitious in what they were trying to achieve.  If they had been less ambitious the income taxpayers of California would have voted for the proposition and this would have changed matters drastically.  That was the situation with regard to the property tax amendment some 18 months ago.  It changed the attitude towards tax collection throughout the United States.  I do not want an upsurge of such opinion in this country and that is what I am trying to achieve by my amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that automatically in each Finance Bill tax bands and allowances will be indexed according to increases in the consumer price index between mid-February of one year and mid-February of the following year.  The taxpayer would regard himself as being more fairly treated if that were the position. Taxpayers do not see themselves as being fairly treated unless they get all the services they demand but legislators must adopt a different attitude.  We must be conscious of the fact that every week people in the PAYE sector have <Col N="216" /> amounts deducted from their wages and salaries which they sometimes regard as excessive.  If they get wage increases during the year, frequently they are moved into a higher tax band.</P>
    <P>As inflation bites more sharply into wages, people will have less money at the end of the month.  When increases are sought to compensate for inflation they are taxed at the higher rate.  There is always a suspicion that inflation is the friend of governments because automatically it means an increase in income tax.  The Minister has pointed out that he gave generous allowances to taxpayers. However, one of the allowances was forced on him as a result of the Supreme Court decision in the Murphy case.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's claim about the generosity of his tax allowances, in his estimates for receipts for 1980 he expects to get 30 per cent more from the taxpayers than he got last year.  This is a fact.  This is 10 per cent more than the latest figure we have, if the figure to come out at the end of the week is of the order of 20 per cent.  The Minister will get 10 per cent more than the CPI increase in taxation in the current year. The whole field should be opened up so that taxpayers will feel they are being treated generously.  They should know that no matter what happens to the cost of living index figure this year and no matter what wage increase they get, these increases will not be eroded but will be reflected in their allowances for the coming year.  They should know that if they are to be squeezed by the cost of living they will not be squeezed again later in the year by a Minister for Finance who has not allowed for the increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>This should be done particularly in times of high inflation.  Other administrations have resisted this over the years but during our term of office the Fianna Fáil Party moved a Private Members' motion to bring this situation about and everyone of them, including the present Minister for Finance, voted to have tax allowances and tax bands indexed because of the high rate of inflation obtaining <Col N="217" /> then.  We resisted that at the time but I am now asking Fianna Fáil to do what they advocated while in Opposition, now that they have the power to do it.</P>
    <P>One of the elements which contributed to bringing about the huge and rather frightening tax marches last year was the fact that Fianna Fáil had left the taxpayers under the impression that they would index tax bands and allowances when they came to government and they failed to keep that promise.  If they are seen to let down the taxpayers again we could well face the same problem next year no matter who is in government. We are as concerned as the Government when 200,000 or 300,000 of what might be called the normally non-protesting type of people, take to the streets in the angry mood in which they took to the streets on two occasions in 1979.  I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment not just for the sake of equity for the taxpayers, but also to show some recognition of the fact that we are listening to the taxpayers and want to see this reflected in increased allowances no matter what happens to inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This concept of indexation is the minimum requirement in relation to equity in taxation.  The marchers who recently protested about the incidence of taxation on PAYE taxpayers were brought out because the position prior to the last budget had become so blatantly inequitable.  It is only because of the Supreme Court ruling in relation to married couples that the matter has been alleviated somewhat. There are still some anomalies but in relation to the amendment in principle, it is vitally necessary to ensure that benefits and allowances will not be eroded by inflation.  It is vitally important that the allowances given in relation to one parent families, in relation to children, to incapacitated children, allowances in respect of a housekeeper, in respect of blind persons and the personal allowance are not eroded by inflation. This is a minimal amendment if we are to have an equitable tax system.  It <Col N="218" /> would be grossly unfair to use the population as pawns and to allow what was given to them this year in the budget to be taken away by the ravages of inflation. Past administrations were not better in handling this question than the present Government but it is time to take the bull by the horns and agree to the indexation of the allowances and to agree that it is unfair that inflation should erode what has been granted to taxpayers whether they are PAYE taxpayers, farmers or businessmen.  It is very important that allowances are maintained from year to year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputies opposite are seeking to achieve in this amendment has already been more than achieved in the Bill as it stands.  For the sake of principle the Opposition would sacrifice advantage for the taxpayers. Had we had indexation of personal allowances since this Government resumed office taxpayers would be considerably worse off than they are now.  In 1977-78 the single and married allowances were £665 and £1,100 respectively.  The consumer price index for the three years from February 1977 to February 1980 had increased by 39 per cent.  Commensurate increases in the allowances would have meant single and married allowances of £925 and £1,529 had we operated the system being advocated by Deputies opposite.  As Deputies know, the present allowances for single and married people are £1,115 and £2,230 respectively.  It is evident on the face of it, even after the most cursory examination, that what the Deputies suggest would leave taxpayers worse off than they are as a consequence of the provisions of last year but particularly the provisions of this year.  Deputies opposite might say that is if one starts from that date and why start from 1977? Why not start from some other base and make a comparison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position now is very much better than it would have been if one were relying on indexation, say, from 1972 on.  In 1972-1973 the single allowance was £299 and the married allowance was £494.  This is significant.  Saul was converted <Col N="219" /> on the road rather dramatically but it is nothing to the conversion that the Opposition have experienced since they went to those benches.  Over the five years to 1977-1978&mdash;they were responsible for four of them&mdash;the single allowance was raised to £665 and the married allowance to £1,100.  The increase in the single allowance was £366 over the five year period, but one must subtract £100 of that to compensate for the discontinuation of the earned income relief which was discontinued in 1974. The net increase in the single allowance over that time was £266.  The net increase in the married allowance overall in that period was £441, so that it will not surprise anyone to note that in the first two years I am referring to of this Government we increased the single allowance from £665 to £1,115, that is an increase of £450, and the married allowance by £1,130 by comparison with the net increases of £266 and £441 over the five-year period.  Those facts demonstrate more than anything I can say by way of argument exactly what has been achieved in the last few years by comparison with what was achieved in the four years immediately preceding it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two or three facts seem to have been missed.  The Government's decision on income-splitting was announced&mdash;I hope Deputies opposite are aware of this and are listening&mdash;before the Supreme Court decision was announced.  As I have said on many occasions, to implement the Supreme Court decision would have cost the Exchequer £30 million this year. What the Government are doing this year involves income-splitting and the package will cost the Exchequer £135 million this year alone.  How anyone can say in the face of those realities that the Government were simply doing what the Supreme Court required them to do I just cannot understand.  The Supreme Court, even had they extended their judgment to unearned income, which they did not, never hinted that they were <Col N="222" /> suggesting income-splitting, which is way beyond what the plaintiffs in that case were seeking.  I am sure Deputies opposite know this, but in case they do not I will lay it clearly on the line.  They wanted to be taxed as single people.  The Supreme Court held they were entitled to be, in respect of their earned income.  To be taxed as single persons does not give one a right to transfer the allowances one does not use to the other single person, which is what is involved in income-splitting. Sometimes nobody wants to know about that.  They say in a confusing way that the Supreme Court dealt with this and what I did was to follow them.</P>

      <P>It is no wonder that Deputy Collins puts his hands to his face and is not anxious to hear what I have to say.  He introduced the topic but when he is given the facts he does not want to hear the answer.  It is obvious that what I have done is more generous than what was required by the Supreme Court.  The benefit to the taxpayers is better than what is proposed by the Opposition.  If in addition to all that the Opposition want to suggest indexing then the range of options open to any Minister for Finance in any year would be immediately restricted, to say the least of it.  The entire tax arrangement would be already written for him before he looked at the type of <Col N="223" /> allowances he should give.  One of the fundamental responsibilities of a Minister for Finance, and a Government, is to make appropriate tax provisions at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The Opposition have implied that the CPI is the real indication of an increase in the cost of living and against it no other judgment stands.  I do not accept that and my predecessor, Deputy Richie Ryan, did not accept it.  The CPI, as I stressed more than once, is not related to the actual increase in the cost of living, it is related to a basket which does not immediately reflect the actual increase in cost to the consuming public.  For every 2p that is put on the price of a glass of beer the CPI moves exactly in line.  If 4p is put on the price of that item it is double the increase for 2p, 6p of an increase means treble a 2p increase, an increase of 12p means six times what it would be for 2p and an increase of 20p means an increase of ten times what it would be for 2p.  If additional excise duty is put on to that extent the consumption, of course, falls off.  People will not keep following up to that point but although the consumption falls considerably the CPI continues gaily up without any reference to the actual level of consumption. Deputies opposite are aware of that.  In concentrating on the discretionary areas of expenditure of the CPI I was conscious of the fact that for the vast majority of households the real benefits in the budget under the new provisions of income-splitting, increased bands and allowances would certainly match the effect of the increases in drink, cigarettes and petrol.  I acknowledge that petrol is in a different category for a variety of reasons and we are made more conscious of that today because of the meeting of OPEC Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Richie Ryan, tried unsuccessfully to convey to the public, and to the social partners, the anomalies involved in the CPI.  I hope I am more successful in conveying the same.  I do not accept that the CPI is the total final guide even as to the cost of living. It reflects a weighted basket within it <Col N="224" /> but it does not relate entirely to consumption which determines the cost of living.  I do not accept that it should be the thing which should tie my hands, or those of any Minister for Finance, in the future in relation to any arrangements one should make on taxation.  For those reasons I do not accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is considered important and serious as far as the ordinary taxpayers are concerned because we are considering the value of their tax allowances.  One could be forgiven for concluding that the Minister was in a jocose mood earlier when he tried to convey that taxpayers, because of the allowances given to them, were better off than they were in 1976-77. There is no comparison as to the degree of prosperity between these two periods.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister introduced his budget the allowances have been reduced substantially in value.  Deputy Barry is seeking the same concession as the Minister, and Fianna Fáil, sought when in Opposition.  There is a grave danger that the allowances granted to the taxpayers will be eaten up and reduced in real value by inflation and rising prices such as the recent increases in the price of meat, milk, petrol and rents. Taxpayers are entitled to expect that at the end of the financial year the increases in the allowances granted by the Minister will not be eroded or reduced because of rising prices or inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> The amendment seeks to prevent the erosion of those allowances.  The CPI indicates the value of incomes in relation to prices and for that reason the Minister is wrong in suggesting that taxpayers are better off today with the allowances he gave in the budget than in 1976-77. Those allowances are being eaten up weekly and reduced in real value daily. In 1976-77 there was some form of stability in relation to rising prices and the cost of living.  I should like to know why there has been such a turn round in relation to this matter by Fianna Fáil who advocated it when in Opposition but reject it when in Government.  I should like to be in a position to explain that to the taxpayers in my constituency. That is what the Minister has not explained&mdash;why the sudden and extraordinary turnabout in relation to the stabilising of tax allowances so that they will not be eroded or perhaps wiped out by rising prices or inflation.  Why the extraordinary change in policy in relation to this aspect that Deputy Barry has raised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague in urging the Minister to adopt indexation of tax free allowances.  The Minister fairly pointed out that in the recent past the increases that have been given have been greater than would have been given if indexation had been adopted over that period and no other increases were allowed.  That, of course, is not what the amendment proposes.  The amendment proposes that indexation of tax free allowances should be there as a minimum, not as a maximum, and if the Minister of the day wished to give larger increases in allowances over and above indexation there would be no obstacle. The vast bulk of the Minister's speech against the amendment was in the true sense of the word irrelevant: he was not arguing about Deputy Barry's amendment. Deputy Barry was not suggesting, nor does the amendment suggest, that indexation should be the only increase in the allowances granted.  It was suggested that indexation be allowed as a minimum and, if the Minister of the day wished to <Col N="226" /> give more, he should do so.  Therefore, the Minister was not arguing to the point at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that indexation of tax-free allowances is not a usual procedure in most countries and that most Governments retain discretion in any year to give increases in tax-free allowances which are more or less than the cost of living.  In Canada they have adopted indexation of tax-free allowances.  Automatically, every year tax-free allowances will be increased in line with inflation and if the Canadian Government of the day wish to give more they can do so.  I urge the Minister to examine very carefully the way in which this provision operates in Canada. We should have a similar provision here. It is notable that the Government which introduced indexation in Canada, the Government of M. Trudeau, although they lost an election, were very quickly re-elected.  One of the reasons why they were re-elected, I think, was that the Conservative Government wished to remove the indexation provision introduced by the Liberals.  This shows clearly, I think, that indexation of tax-free allowances is a very important political issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have adopted indexation of tax-free allowances as something they would like to see adopted as part of Government policy.  We are concerned at present with obtaining a non-inflationary national understanding and negotiations are now beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, if the Minister were to say he would be prepared to introduce indexation of tax-free allowance hence forth on a statutory basis&mdash;not on the basis of some kind of a political commitment but that he would actually be prepared to write into the Bill a provision to that effect, although that would not cost anything this year, in which, I recognise, he has difficult financial sums to balance&mdash;the making of such a commitment to indexation in the form of an amendment to this year's Finance Bill would go a long way, in my view, <Col N="227" /> towards obtaining the right type of climate for a successful conclusion to the negotiations now beginning for a new national understanding.  That is a very strong argument in favour of it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is only fair, because all indexation would do is guarantee that what people have been given would not be taken from them by increases in prices.  It is not giving anything new.  Indexation of tax-free allowances does not give anybody any additional concession but it ensures that the concessions already obtained cannot be taken away by stealth as a result of the operation of inflation.  If the Government of the day decided to reduce tax-free allowances, even if there was indexation, the Government could not be stopped from doing it&mdash;they need only introduce an amendment. Writing indexation into the tax code would prevent people being deprived of allowances they had already got, not by Government action or passage of a Bill but by stealth, the operation of inflation in reducing the monetary value of the allowances they had been given.  I believe that everything should be indexed, that all cash limits in all legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am never averse to enlightenment.  I feel very strongly that indexation should be introduced in the interest of social harmony in the community. One of the reasons people went on the streets about tax burdens in recent years&mdash;no doubt it was very regrettable that people had to take to the streets over taxation&mdash;was that they felt that what had been given to them in the past by Government decision and decision of the House had been taken from them by prices rising faster than the allowances had risen over a period.  It was nothing that the House had decided; it was just that the legislation had not worked as intended, because inflation had taken place subsequent to the passage of the original legislation.  If one were to go back to, say, 1953, of course it would depend on the period you took, the tax-free allowances that now exist as a result of the concessions made in the past two or three years&mdash;I do not denigrate them; they have been considerable&mdash;would be far far greater than the tax-free allowances that now exist. You would have had to earn four or five times as much in real terms in 1953 to reach the maximum rate of taxation as you now have to earn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A study was done on this subject by the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society, I think by a gentleman named Ó Muircheartaigh, on tax-free allowances and what has happened them since 1953.  He showed quite clearly that if these allowances had been indexed since then the position would be that one would not reach the maximum tax rate until one was earning between four and five times as much as one now earns when reaching the maximum tax rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar situation applies to tax-free allowances.  I am not talking off the top of my head.  I have seen this paper and I would urge the Minister to examine it.  I <Col N="229" /> think it was published about two years ago in the journals of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society.  I think the author is now an official of one of the Government Departments and the Minister will therefore have no difficulty in consulting him about exactly how he made his calculations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is Industry and Commerce.  The Minister should not adopt the stance he has adopted on indexation. It would do a great deal to improve the climate of industrial relations if the Minister, or the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, on his behalf, were to say that the Government will introduce indexation.  It would not cost anything this year but it would give people an assurance that the allowances that they have already given would not be taken from them because of inflation.  It would certainly contribute towards creating a climate in which a national understanding could be successfully negotiated.  I hope the Minister will reconsider his position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting amendment which states:</P>
      <P>For the year 1981-82 and subsequent years of assessment the amounts specified in sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 of this Act shall be increased by the percentage figure as represented by the Consumer Price Index to mid-February of each year.</P>
      <P>It does not say &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; there to which Deputy Bruton referred.  Would the taxpayers agree to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly would not agree to being taxed on that rate.  It says in the amendment that the amount specified &ldquo;shall be increased by the percentage figure as represented by the Consumer Price Index&rdquo;.  During the three-year period we have been in office <Col N="230" /> the increase in personal allowance for a single person has been £850, which is more than three times the increase such a person got in the previous five years. The improvement is even more impressive for the married PAYE taxpayer. His increase in the three year period is £1,530.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt anybody since I came into the House.  I came into the House because I am interested in this matter.  This man received an increase of only £441 over the previous five-year period.  This means that his increase is almost three-and-a-half times the increase he got in the previous five-year period.  Deputy Bruton says that everything should increase in accordance with the CPI.  Does he mean that the banks and all the rest of those people are included in this?  I would not like to see the tax allowances based on the Consumer Price Index because I do not believe that taxpayers would agree to this.  Since Fianna Fáil came back into power we have given increases substantially above the CPI.</P>
      <P>I have grave reservations with regard to Deputy Barry's amendment.  When I was in Opposition I spent a lot of time discussing Finance Bills.  One can be taken up on wording.  Outside the House one can be taken up on the crossing of a &ldquo;t&rdquo;.  There is nothing in the amendment about minimum.  It actually says &ldquo;shall be increased by the percentage figure...&rdquo;  Was Deputy Bruton referring to amendment of the bands also?  This is open to interpretation but I believe that is what he was referring to.  I would not agree with that aspect of it.  The way the Minister is doing this now is the right way.  It is being done in a constructive way.  The people are satisfied with what is being done.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies, including the Ministers who contributed to the debate on my <Col N="231" /> amendment.  It shows what an important amendment it is when for the first time today we have got another member of the Fianna Fáil Party to contribute besides the Minister for Finance.  The Minister of State came in here to find out if there would be a vote or if he could go away for his dinner and he was drawn into speech.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister of State did not interrupt anybody.  He was drawn into the debate to answer some of the points raised by Deputies which the Minister, because he can speak only once on Report Stage, could not answer.  The Minister was very careful when he spoke.  I will confine myself to what he said because it is his reaction to the amendment which is important. He did not refer to indexation of the bands, which is the point which has given rise to much controversy over the last few years.  The allowances are important and the indexation is important. The reason for so much controversy and why people protested in the streets over the last few years is that when one receives any increase in salary one is in danger of moving into the higher tax band.  If the Minister of State feels that the word &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; should be in the amendment I am willing to resubmit this on the Fifth Stage.  Would that satisfy the Minister of State?</P>

      <P>I can see a lot in what the Minister said about the Consumer Price Index, that it may not be a perfect <Col N="232" /> measurement of what exactly the cost of living is.  I would be certainly willing to give any co-operation I can if the Minister wants to restructure it so that it more accurately reflects what is the difference between one period and another in relation to the cost of living for some group or family or whatever unit one chooses to take.  At the moment the only measurement we have as to how much more it costs somebody to live this year as compared with last year or mid-February compared with mid-November, is the Consumer Price Index. That is the only reason why it is in the amendment.  It is nearest to what I am trying to achieve and the only official measurement available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton said that he understood that the Canadian Government lost office because of their threat to remove the facilities existing in the tax code.  That was one of the major elements and the Minister should take note of that, but an even greater contribution to the defeat of the last administration in Canada was putting up the price of petrol, and they did not put it up by as much as the Minister put it up.</P>

      <P>I come to my final point.  The Minister quoted figures back over the last few years showing how much better off we are but I am thinking of the future.  The amendment states 1981-82.  The figures, as Deputy Bruton acknowledged rightly, have been increased generously in some cases in the last year and I am trying to ensure that that is maintained in the future and that will help to defuse any tendency there might be for people to feel that the only way that they will get a positive and helpful reaction from the Government is <Col N="233" /> to take to the streets.  That, we would all agree, is a most undesirable development in any country, particularly a democracy like this, and it is to help to see that that <Col N="234" /> situation does not recur that I have introduced this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I have not got the exact dates available to me now but as soon as I became aware of the situation early this year I undertook immediate action to endeavour to have the college of art premises made available to the Oireachtas.  My understanding of the position is that the college of art premises are presently being examined by the Office of Public Works with a view to bringing forward some plans for alterations.  At the same time efforts are being made to secure alternative accommodation for the college in premises which are, to different degrees, attractive to different elements in the college.</P>

      <P>The House is appreciative of the Taoiseach's efforts to provide additional accommodation for Deputies and Senators and indeed of his efforts generally to improve the facilities here.  I would like to preface anything I say with that.  But there is a problem.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the possibility of the move to Power's distillery is now increasingly remote because the architect's plans are not yet completed and the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland have expressed solidarity with the board in regard to this issue and have laid down certain requirements for the conversion of the distillery which are very unlikely to be fulfilled in the time available?  Whatever the Taoiseach's intentions when he arranged the matter, the failure to carry through at other levels has left a situation where the board is threatened with having to move somewhere which will not be ready and capable of housing the different departments of the college of art.  The House, of course, is correspondingly uncertain as to whether it will have additional accommodation.</P>

      <P>I accept it is not a satisfactory situation, from anybody's point of view.  It is not satisfactory from our point of view here as Members of the Oireachtas.  The existing premises in which the college of art have had to function for so long are totally inadequate and unsuitable and even dangerous to some extent.  The only thing I can assure the House of is that every effort is being made to try to meet the needs of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the college.  Some elements in the National College of Art are, I understand very favourably disposed towards Power's distillery as a permanent home for the college of art for a variety of reasons.  I understand other elements in the college structure are not so enamoured of the Power's distillery premises.  That is something which will have to be resolved at college level.  But so far as we are concerned, we are doing everything possible to facilitate the college in establishing itself in some new suitable premises either on a temporary basis or on a permanent basis.</P>

      <P>We appreciate the dilemma in which the Taoiseach and his <Col N="238" /> Government find themselves.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that the deadline set by the Minister for Education to have the premises next door to us vacated is now totally unrealistic and that there is an unseemly confrontation imminent between the Government and the National College of Art and Design?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly seek to avoid any element of confrontation in this matter because, whilst all of us in the House are very anxious to secure the sort of accommodation we need to enable us to perform efficiently or at least at some level of efficiency, at the same time we recognise the fundamental importance of the college in the cultural scheme of things.  It is a question of trying to reconcile these conflicting interests. I was very encouraged by the preference which was expressed by a number of people in the college for the Power's distillery premises.  It seemed to me that that was a very suitable solution to the problem.  The only difficulty was in getting it effected as quickly as possible and that is under way.  I should remind the House that the Department of Education have been trying to get the college out of its existing premises for 27 years now, so that if we have to take a month or two extra at this stage to make sure that everybody is satisfied in the end, it is worth doing.  I had hoped that we would be able to get into the college of art premises by Easter but that would have seriously disrupted the college's programme of classes and teaching and examinations and so on.  On that basis the move was postponed until July.  I am still hoping that some appropriate solution to these accommodation problems for both the college and ourselves will be found and brought into effect expeditiously.</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The standard of telephone service at this exchange is broadly the same as at other manual exchanges of this same size.  The quality of service there will be improved when additional trunk circuits to Galway, at present in course of installation, are brought into use in the next fortnight or so.  It is planned to convert the exchange at Kinvara to automatic working within the next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard of service in the area at present is broadly the same as in other parts of the country, having been improved over the last year or so by the provision of new exchanges and additional trunk circuits and the introduction of International Subscriber Dialling.  It will be further improved early next year when more trunk circuits to Dublin are installed following the opening of a new trunk exchange in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The 091 telephone area consists of the following exchanges: Galway, Carraroe, Claregalway, Corrandulla, Costelloe, Kilcolgan, Inverin, Loughrea, Maam, Moycullen, Oranmore, Oughterard, Roscahill, Rosmuck, Shantalla, Spiddal, Tourloughmore, Teranee.</P>
      <P>All these exchanges have automatic service with full subscriber trunk dialling (STD).  International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) is also available at all these exchanges except Loughrea which is in a separate charge group.</P>
      <P>The main switching and operator centre is at Galway.</P>
      <P>Congested conditions are sometimes experienced during peak traffic periods. The position has improved over a period and while it is still not as good as one would like it to be it does, at the same time, compare broadly with other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several other schemes to improve service in the area are in progress or planned; these include: (1) a new switchroom which will be opening shortly in Galway; (2) plans are in hand to increase the <Col N="255" /> main trunk route between Galway and Loughrea, Athenry and Gort.  These routes all go via Oranmore and extensive cabling is being undertaken in this area; (3) plans are also in hand to link Tuam to Galway by means of a high capacity microwave link which will later be extended on to Ballinrobe and Castlebar.  This microwave link is expected to be in service around the middle of next year; (4) a new telecommunications complex is under construction at Mervue.  This will house both a trunk and local exchange, a microwave terminal as well as an area engineering headquarters.  The digital electronic exchange to be installed there is on order and it is expected to have this new exchange in use in early 1982; (5) long-term circuit capacity is being catered for by planned routes to Athlone, Dublin and Limerick.  These high capacity microwave routes will ensure that the future needs of the Galway area are well catered for.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (a)  why no reduced charge rate exists for STD calls <Col N="262" /> to European mainland countries made at week-ends, Sundays or generally at times of lesser telephone traffic; (b) if he is aware of any other EEC country in which no reduced charge rates of this sort operates; and (c) whether it is consistent with this State's obligations under EEC membership or otherwise imposed by treaty or agreement, that in this respect there should be a lack of mutuality.</P>

      <P>The information sought is as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  The general position is that reduced telephone rates of the kind mentioned are not offered by European mainland countries either to one another or to this country and Britain. Introduction of such rates here, particularly on a non-reciprocal basis, would be likely to result in loss of revenue as the other countries concerned would claim their full credits in respect of reduced calls made from here.</P>
      <P>(b)  Reduced rates are offered by the British Post Office on calls to other EEC countries but in the reverse direction, reduced rates to Britain do not apply, except from this country.</P>
      <P>(c)  There is no obligation under EEC membership or under any other international treaty or agreement to have reduced rates at off-peak periods for telephone traffic with other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 16 to delete &ldquo;paragraph (a)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;paragraphs (a) and (b)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Up to this Finance Bill people who earned £70 interest on deposits in a number of institutions could claim tax relief on that figure.  There was considerable pressure on the Minister and his predecessor to acknowledge that the figure of £70 was inadequate and was not an encouragement to people to save. Recognising that pressure and the legitimacy of the arguments the Minister increased the sum to £150, but he limited the institutions in which deposites could be placed to trustee saving banks and some other institutions and excluded the commercial banks which had previously been included.  We raised this matter on Committee Stage of the Bill and the Minister's defence was that if he included these banks there would be legitimate representations from other banks.  He would then be under some pressure to include these other financial institutions.  In turn, this could have a damaging effect on Post Office savings and on building societies.  I can see the problem but I cannot understand why the Minister has introduced this differential.  If the Minister had amended the figure of £70 to £150 in respect of all institutions there would have been no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general rule the financial institutions or the trustee savings banks do not have offices outside Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  That means that in areas outside these centres a small depositor has the use of only the Post Office and I am sure I do not have to elaborate on that.  Anybody who lives <Col N="290" /> in rural Ireland will understand the reluctance of ordinary people to deposit their savings with the Post Office.  If the choice were available to them, normally they would choose the commercial banks but because of the limitation proposed by the Minister they will not be able to benefit to the same extent as depositors with trustee savings banks and other financial institutions.  The Minister has burdended himself with unnecessary problems.  Many people in rural areas do not yet realise what is being proposed by the Minister but when they discover what is happening he will be under pressure from these ordinary individuals. They will try to ensure that the same allowance of £150 will be allowed across the board, as was the case with regard to the £70 allowance which applied previouly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this matter in detail on Committee Stage and I do not have very much to add to what I said then.  The position of the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks is well known but perhaps I should repeat some of the points made before.  The two institutions were set up to cater for the small saver and they are in a particularly difficult situation.  An important point and one that the Deputy did not refer to is that their rates of interest are directly controlled by the Government which is not the case with regard to the associated banks and others.  In addition, the bulk of their funds are lodged with the Exchequer and this is not the case with regard to the others.  Because of the fact that they have a lower rate of interest which is directly controlled by the Government, it is reasonable to suggest that we should offer an incentive by way of tax relief which is what we are proposing to do in respect of the Post Office and the trustee savings banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this was introduced it has become clear that there are some anomalies even in applying this to banks at all because there are a number of other banks that were not nominated for this interest exemption.  They could claim quite reasonably that because they were <Col N="291" /> nominated in the past they should not be excluded now and that any benefit being applied should be extended to them. Anybody who looks at this objectively will come to the same conclusion.  I should like to correct slightly what I said on Committee Stage when I said that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, referred to this matter in 1975 or 1976.  In fact, he mentioned it in his budget statement of 1973.  I think I could enlighten the House a little if I quote precisely what he said then, which is at odds with what Deputy Barry is suggesting now.  The then Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>At present interest up to £70 on deposits made by an individual with the Post Office Savings Bank, the trustee savings banks and certain commercial banks is exempt from income tax.  Banking institutions set up since the relief was introduced have sought to be included in the concession. This however would be a costly move for the Exchequer.  On the other hand, the present position is clearly anomalous.  Since the relief was introduced as a measure to promote thrift, I have decided that the best course would be to confine it to deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks which are the main thrift institutions of the State.  The change will come into force with effect from 6 April 1974.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Finance was proposing the abolition of the concession for all the banks and he gave notice that it would take effect from April 1974.  In the event, because of some significant political changes, that did not happen, but the then Minister clearly gave notice of his intention to change the procedure. He mentioned the cost to the Exchequer even of extending the concession to other institutions which is not just what Deputy Barry is proposing here.  What the Deputy is proposing would be even more expensive.</P>
    <P>Let me give an indication of the rates of interest and the differentials between <Col N="292" /> the associated banks and the nominated banks.  In respect of the two main associated banks, the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland, the rate on withdrawal-on-demand deposits is 11.5 per cent.  The rate in Guinness and Mahon is 16.5 per cent, in the Commercial Bank it is 12.5 per cent, and in the City Bank is 17.5 per cent.  The rate in the Post Office and the Trustee Savings Banks is 9.5 per cent.  The rate on deposits in the Post Office or the Trustee Savings Banks is significantly lower than the rates which apply to the other banks nominated for this relief.  In some cases there is a difference of 8 per cent.  For all these reasons it is reasonable to acknowledge the special position of the Post Office and the Trustee Savings Banks by granting the extra exemption to them so as to in some way compensate for the control over interest rates which has meant that their level of interest is lower than that applying to the other banks.</P>
    <P>There is no real substance in the case Deputy Barry is trying to promote that banks are more readily available than the other institutions.  There is a post office in every village but there is not a bank in every village.  To suggest that people living in remote places will start to do what they have not started to do is wrong because contrary to what the Deputy suggests I have not received any representations from people living in remote places.</P>

      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 30 to 55 and in page 18, to delete lines 1 to 10.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to avoid the position whereby people who are self-employed will have to pay what amounts to three lots of tax in the one financial year.  This is particularly unjust at the present time when so many small shopkeepers because of inflation are finding it very difficult to keep the cash flow position correct and are not allowed to borrow increased funds to finance that cash flow because of the credit restrictions.  On top of that the Minister is proposing to take 50 per cent more tax than in the one year.  This will put some small businesses under pretty severe strain at the end of this year.  There is no good time to make adjustments in the tax system whereby the Minister for Finance gets more for the Exchequer in any one year but to do it at a time of high inflation, high bank charges and restricted credit is an indication of the insensitivity of the Minister for Finance to the difficulties being faced by small businessmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barry's <Col N="294" /> amendment.  This provision will hit small businessmen on whom to a large extent the future of our economy depends, when they are already facing great difficulties in having sufficient cash flow. They require but are unable to borrow substantial amounts of money in order to keep their stock levels up.  On the other hand big shopkeepers who are in direct competition with the small shopkeepers, because of their market power, are able to ensure that they get credit to stock their shops.  The result is that they are able, because of their market power, to charge an artificially lower price and do down the small shopkeeper thus adding to the problems of the small shopkeeper. This liability to increased taxation in this year when consumer demand is not as good as it would otherwise be, could lead to the closure of many small shops or could make their business much more difficult to maintain.  I urge the Minister to carefully consider the small business people who will be badly affected by the section as it now stands.</P>

      <P>I dealt with this matter exhaustively on Committee Stage but obviously the Deputies want to raise this matter again.  Deputy Bruton has overstated the case and has given the impression that the consequences will be disastrous.  Deputy Barry has suggested that the high inflation and so on will give rise to crushing problems.  I would remind both Deputies that this is not the first time this issue came up.  It would have been interesting to see Deputy Richie Ryan who was Minister for Finance in the Coalition period, in the House at any stage during this debate. Deputy Ryan would find that almost all of the things that he stated as high principles are now being rejected by the current spokesman for Finance and by Deputy Bruton.  There are at least four or five occasions on which Deputy Richie Ryan spoke in relation to these areas.  It is important to recognise that a certain level of consistency from the party opposite would be a help in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new day means that most of these taxpayers will pay tax in one instalment <Col N="295" /> but not until six months of the year has already passed as distinct from the PAYE taxpayer whose tax is deducted at source.  If we are trying to move towards equality in the tax system and towards justice that can be seen to be done, surely it is reasonable to align the date of payment as much as possible.  I have not brought it right up to date.  It will be payable in one instalment after the first half of the year has passed.  As Deputies know&mdash;we had this yesterday in regard to another aspect of taxation&mdash;you will always have two months' grace after that before interest becomes payable.</P>
    <P>In making this proposal are the Opposition really suggesting that somebody else should pay this tax?  If I were to act on what Deputies opposite are proposing there would be a significant loss to the Exchequer which means a loss to the taxpayer because there is no magic purse as I have said many times. If the kind of money involved here and necessary to give effect to their proposal&mdash;a figure of about £24 million in 1980&mdash;were to be cast aside, I take it that the Opposition recognise this would have to be paid by somebody else.  I want Deputies opposite&mdash;for once Deputy Barry will have an opportunity of replying because he is moving the amendment&mdash;to say if they suggest that perhaps PAYE taxpayers should pay it, paying as they already do in advance or simultaneously?  Do they suggest&mdash;there are very simple choices&mdash;that extra indirect taxation be introduced?  Or that nobody should pay it, that I should go ahead and borrow the money for it?</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to explain consistently and clearly my budget strategy, how it is being implemented in this Finance Bill, the concessions that are being introduced in addition to those announced in the budget and in respect of this issue, I am asking what I submit is a very reasonable question. The whole basis of this is a basis of equity.  It is a basis that has been recognised and stated by Ministers from time to time.  Anybody who has sat in this seat in recent times has said it. Deputy Richie Ryan particularly stressed it.  Now, as we move towards it, Opposition Deputies say: &ldquo;Any other year but this year&rdquo;.  One can say that any time.  They tell me it is not reasonable to bring it forward as I am doing, even though these taxpayers will still not be paying tax simultaneously as the PAYE sector do.  I have mentioned the figure involved and I think it is fair to do so even though Deputy Barry may say that I did not ask that question about anything else.  I have to respond as Minister for Finance.  Whatever about Deputy Bruton who has a different role, Deputy Barry is spokesman on finance for the Opposition and in that capacity he would have the responsibility, if his aims were realised, of managing the public finances.  I think I am entitled to ask him where he would propose to levy the £24 million to meet this amendment the effect of which would be to move away from rather than towards equity.</P>
      <P>Nobody rushes to pay tax but we all have an obligation to pay our share and do so reasonably simultaneously.  I know Deputy Barry will say he is disappointed at my reaction.  I think I have given him both reason and fact as to why this amendment should not be accepted.  I shall now yield to the Deputy and perhaps he will tell me where he will get the £24 million and who will pay for his suggestion if adopted.</P>

No Minister for Finance says precisely where he will get the money for every innovation of the Government.  This Minister was appointed last December.  He is there now for six months.  Within a month of being elected he puts on the backs of the unfortunate taxpayers more taxation than any one of his predecessors ever did.  He comes in here justifying all this, including increasing by 50 per cent the amount the self-employed have to pay in any one year.  Within a fortnight of a new Taoiseach coming into the Cabinet there was an increase of five, 100 per cent more junior Ministers in this Government than in any former administration. They did not say: &ldquo;We will put up the price of the pint to pay for Deputy Killilea&mdash;there is a great bargain we got.  We will put up the price of petrol to pay for Deputy Allen&mdash;there is another bargain.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was quite obvious from the way he spoke on this amendment that he knows there is justification for what we are proposing here.  He knows that small shopkeepers and business people are under considerable strain at present.  He knows, because he has got very lengthy representations from the self-employed and small business people on this matter and he has chosen to ignore them all because far more important to him, as there is far greater pressure on him in that regard, is the financing of the demands of this Government since they came into office. Runaway inflation and borrowing, the runaway spendthrift attitude they have had for the last three years require that he should scrape the bottom of the barrel and get every penny he can lay hands on.  One of the victims&mdash;because he thinks they are least organised and least able to answer back, least hysterical in their demands&mdash;are the small shopkeepers and the self-employed. They are now being asked to pay another 50 per cent tax in the one year, only this one section of the community. The Minister seeks to justify this <Col N="299" /> on the basis of equity.  If I have one leg he must have one of his own cut off&mdash;this is the equity involved.  It will not do.  The Minister is the victim of the mismanagement of the economy for the past three years.  He can do nothing but refuse the amendment but it is most unjust that one small sector who are weak and unorganised and cannot bring political clout to bear to get their demands met will be the Minister's victims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 18, 19 and 20 is to retain the notional system of taxation for farmers for one more year.  There are two basic grounds for this.  The first is that farmers were asked last year to opt to stay on the notional system for three years.  If they went on to the notional system they had to stay on it for three years even if the rate of notional were to be dramatically increased and it was suddenly to become a much less profitable thing for them to stay on it in the second year than it appeared in the first year when they originally made the option.  They were told by the Minister for Finance then that if they went on to the notional system, regardless of what happened to the rate at which it was being assessed, they had to stay on it for three years. The Minister was asking the farmers to make an act of faith in him that the notional system would be maintained at a fair level over the three-year period and that in fact it would remain over the three-year period.  There was no point in a person tying himself to something for three years if it would not remain for three years.</P>
      <P>What happens this year?  The Minister comes along and abolishes the notional system.  He suddenly, having got farmers to commit themselves for three years, in the second year of the three-year period, abolishes it completely.  I believe he broke faith with people whom he asked to make an agreement with him for a three-year period.  That is what is contained in amendment No. 18.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 19 we are seeking to retain the notional system of taxation for one more year.  The Fianna Fáil Party in their election manifesto promised that the notional system would be retained.  They even went so far as to refer to the notional system in part of their manifesto as the &ldquo;Fianna Fáil notional system&rdquo;.  They called it this as if they had invented it.  It had become part of the Fianna Fáil bag of tricks together with the twin national aims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were elected in 1977.  Governments are usually elected for four years so one would expect that if Fianna Fáil entered into a commitment in 1977 they would have the decency to adhere to that commitment for the normal term of a Government, which would be to the end of the 1981 tax year.  After three years, having given this solemn very specific promise in their election manifesto to maintain this system, in the third year they come along and abolish it completely.  We are merely seeking in this amendment to hold Fianna Fáil to the promise they made of their choice in the election manifesto.  We did not make any promise in our election manifesto about retaining the notional system but we are now seeking to get Fianna Fáil to keep the promise they made to the people.  I have a vivid memory of attending a large, packed meeting of farmers two days before the election in an hotel in Navan and Fianna Fáil TDs came in and said: &ldquo;We will keep the notional system.  If we are elected we will hold on to the notional system of taxation&rdquo;.  Now, long before the normal term of the Government who were elected as a result of those promises made in 1977, they propose to go back on the promise they made and abolish the notional system.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil need not have promised to retain the notional system of taxation in their 1977 manifesto.  They probably would have been elected without it but they deliberately chose to keep the notional system of taxation for farmers and they deliberately put it in their manifesto.  The Deputy who is now Minister for Finance was a member of the Fianna Fáil front bench who drafted this manifesto and he cannot walk away from it any more than can any other member of that front bench.  The least Fianna Fáil can do is to keep that promise for the normal term of office of the Government elected in 1977.  We are not asking them to promise to keep it for the rest of the eighties.  We are only asking them to keep it until the end of the 1981 tax year, one further year, in order to keep the promise given in the manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> That is a reasonable request.  If the Government do not adhere to their promise it shows they never meant what they said in their election promises.  Any promises they make to farmers or any other section of the community in the next election campaign can be treated in the same light as we can now see the promise given in relation to the notional system can be treated.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  When the farmers got that promise it had a great bearing on their business.  It is no use now for any Minister for Finance to promise the farming community anything because the Government are no longer taken seriously.</P>
      <P>A farmer I spoke to the other night told me that the promise does not mean anything because in three months' time there will probably be a different Minister for Finance.  It is no use for members of the Government to go down the country and say that it was the fault of Deputy Jim Gibbons and Deputy O'Donoghue.  It is the same Government since 1977, we just have a change of Ministers.  One-third of the Deputies who sit on the other side of the House got in here as a result of false promises given to the agricultural community.  This is an opportunity for the Minister for Finance to redeem the promise made in 1977 and accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>We dealt with this issue in the course of the Committee Stage debate and the same arguments are being advanced now.  People who look at the question of farm taxation or taxation of any other sector have all come to the conclusion, as the farmers and their leaders have also, that they want to pay their fair share of taxation the same as anybody else and they want to be seen to pay it.  They want to have an end to all the bickering going on.  I also want to have an end to this and I want to have an understanding between farmers and every other section of the community because all of them are vital to our economic development.  It is evident that to achieve that one pays what <Col N="303" /> is in reality the appropriate share of tax on the income actually earned after allowance is made for all of the expenditures set down in the Bill and for all of the appropriate claims.</P>

      <P>The need to have tax paid on the basis of what the actual earnings are as distinct from notional earnings is real and is recognised.  I have made it clear in my budget statement and on the Finance Bill that we are talking about the need to demonstrate as much as one possibly can in a Finance Bill that we are dealing with real tax payable on real incomes, not on notional incomes, certainly not opportunities not to pay tax on real incomes. For that reason the notional system was introduced and, incidentally, changed very often.  The first multiplier was 40, the next 65, next 90 and the next 125, all of which demonstrates just how notional it was even at 125.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to deal, not with notions, but <Col N="304" /> with facts, and that is a fact about which I am concerned.  We are trying to move to a situation where farmers will pay on their accounts that will disclose what their income is, the same as anybody else.  While the notional system may have had at least the merit of introducing the farming community to tax-paying when they had not been liable to tax up to then, what struck me in this is that the commitment of the representatives of Fine Gael to the notional system is not, as far as I can see from any discussion I have had, matched by the commitment of those best qualified to represent farmers, namely the farm leaders, but perhaps they understand.  On the last day I touched on some glaring anomalies that existed under the notional system. Apparently I did not succeed then in convincing the Opposition of the anomalies and injustices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that arose under the operation of the notional system. As I did not succeed in doing so the last day, I had better go a little further today. In doing this I want to make it quite clear that I am not implying that the farming community as a whole are not paying an appropriate share of tax or that they do not intend or wish to pay an appropriate share of tax.  However, there are numerous examples, not just a few, of very wealthy farmers who have not paid any tax by virtue of the operation of the notional system.  I had better give those examples and then see whether it is appropriate at this time that this system should be maintained.</P>
      <P>A farmer in Leinster who has over 700 acres of land with ratable valuation over £600 has paid no tax in any year 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 by virtue of the operation of the notional system.</P>

      <P>Over £600, but I have not finished.  I am going to give all the examples now, calmly and dispassionately, <Col N="305" /> because I am not making any implications against the farming community.  Another farmer in the same province who has a valuation of over £575, and I am not sure what the acreage there is, paid £300 in tax in 1974-75, £500 in 1975-76 and in 1976-77 paid no tax.  In respect of 1978-79 and 1979-80 no tax has yet been paid because while electing for the notional basis assessments were still under appeal. The third case is a farmer from the same province with over £540 valuation, acreage again not known: 1974-75 no tax paid; 1975-76, £60; 1976-77, no tax; 1977-78, £10,000; 1978-79 appeal not yet settled.  The fourth case is a farmer with over 530 acres, rateable valuation over £480, no tax paid in any year from 1974-75 to 1978-79.  The fifth case, the same province, over 400 acres, valuation over £360; 1974-75, no tax; 1975-76, nil; 1976-77, nil; 1977-78, £2,000; 1978-79, not settled.  Case six, over £250 valuation, tax position as follows: 1974-75, nil; 1975-76, nil; 1976-77, nil; 1977-78, £1,000; 1978-79, not settled.  Case seven, valuation above £150: 1974-75, nil; 1975-76, nil; 1976-77, nil; 1977-78, under inquiry; 1978-79, under appeal. No tax was paid in any of the periods. Case eight, £130 valuation, no tax paid. I have dealt only with examples from Leinster.  If I have not convinced Deputies so far I can go on to Munster or any other province they like.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In the course of his remarks the Minister stated that the Fine Gael Deputies seemed to regard the manifesto as something of a rattle that they could not go to bed without.  I venture to suggest to the Minister for Finance that if he brought the manifesto to bed with him he would not sleep at all.  It would act as a complete nightmare, a bad dream, something he wants to forget about&mdash;and I can understand that.  The Minister has made a very reasoned case here about the farmers being prepared and anxious to pay income tax on profits.  He went on to say that not only were they anxious that they should pay their fair share but they were anxious that they should be seen to pay their fair share.  He pointed out some cases where farmers, under the notional system, did not pay any income tax.  He regarded those as cases of hardship to the Revenue, cases that should be detected.  I could understand the Minister's argument if he stayed with it right through the farmers' taxation provisions of the Bill but, when he comes to the resource tax, he ignores that logical argument which he appears to be making and says farmers must pay regardless of whether or not they are making a profit.  That is completely inconsistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given examples of people who should be paying tax on the accounts basis but who were getting away with it under the notional system. Yesterday I pointed out to the Minister, when we were discussing the resource tax, a case of extreme hardship where an individual who was in receipt of social assistance from the health board was being asked to pay up to £300 in resource tax.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He is being entirely inconsistent in saying it is reasonable to abolish the notional system in regard to income tax and to introduce it again into another provision of the Bill for the purpose of <Col N="308" /> collecting another type of tax.  Surely that is inconsistent?</P>
    <P>The Minister should abide by the promises he made in his manifesto and retain this tax, because there are marginal cases and cases where farmers are not liable for tax but they have to employ accountants, at a cost of hundreds of pounds, to prepare their accounts to. show that they are not liable. That, in itself, is a tax.  The Minister is being totally inconsistent in his argument. If the arguments he is making here hold good for income tax, they hold good for resource tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a lot of ballyhoo about the notional and accounts systems.  I am a farmer and I would not go on the notional system.  I would be crazy to do so.  I would go on accounts.  My valuation is £60 for about 100 acres.  I have always gone on the accounts system.  Nobody has complained about being taken off the notional system except those with bigger acreages of land.  One farmer told me that when he is switched over to the accounts system he will be caught for £10,000 more.  When he transfers from the notional system to the accounts system he will be paying £20,000 if he is paying £10,000 now.  Small shopkeepers and so on employ accountants.  I see nothing wrong in farmers having to pay accountants. I know some farmers who do not pay accountants.  They do the books themselves.  My experience of the Revenue people is that they are most reasonable.  They have accepted proper accounts showing receipts and expenditure and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a division between certain sections of the farming community and PAYE people because the PAYE people are of the opinion that the larger farmers are not paying their fair share.  This has antagonised them.  A few moments ago the Minister quoted examples.  They were most interesting.  I did not know about them.  Some people in the 500-acre bracket in Leinster did not pay at all. Others paid very little, and some have appealed.  We must be reasonable in this day and age.  I have met the farmers' <Col N="309" /> organisations on a number of occasions. They think it is reasonable that they should pay their fair share.  They are anxious to do so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is not a farmer.  He is a member of the legal profession.  I am talking about farmers in <Col N="310" /> the middle income group.  They were all satisfied to go over to accounts.  If you do not earn the money you do not have to pay the tax.  If you have a bad year and make a loss, if you are in mixed farming and a disease strikes, if you are on the notional system you are in a very serious position.  But if one is on accounts one only pays if one earns the money.  This is my argument.  Deputy Fitzpatrick does not want to hear the truth.</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot have his loaf and eat it.  Let us get one thing clear.  If one earns the money one pays the tax and if one does not earn it one does not pay.  It is most alarming that under the notional system some farmers with a very high acreage and valuation pay very little tax.  We must be fair to everybody, the farmers, the PAYE people and the business community, irrespective of what type of business they are in.  Nobody will dissuade me from the idea that the right way to do this is by taxing farmers on accounts.  I have heard no complaints in my constituency of Laois-Offaly which has mixed farming and some very big farmers.  No farmer can put up an argument to support staying on the notional system.  The only reason any farmer would want to stay on the notional system is so that he can pay less tax.  All the farmers that I met were glad to go on accounts and that is the right way to run a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is my belief that everybody in the farming community should pay tax on accounts.  It is to our party's credit that in the 1977 election when we could have sought to curry favour with the farming community by promising to retain the notional system we did not do so.  It was Fianna Fáil who promised to retain the notional system of taxation.  What I am particularly concerned with here is the fact that this section is institutionalising a breach of faith by the Government <Col N="311" /> with the farming community.  They did not have to promise to retain the notional system but they did and now they are abolishing it and going back on their promise.  That is the point that I am trying to get across, a point conveniently ignored by the Deputies opposite.</P>
      <P>It was very interesting to contrast the speech of the Minister for Finance and that of the Minister of State.  They were two completely contradictory speeches. We had the Minister for Finance trying to give us the impression that everyone who was on the notional system was getting away with paying practically no tax.  Of course one can take exceptions to prove almost any case and the Minister, of course, did not choose typical cases of the notional system; he chose a few cases in order to illustrate his point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What point was the Minister trying to make then?  One can produce an individual case of people in business who are paying no tax at all even though they are making large profits because in a particular year they had been able to off-set large amounts of interest against their tax payments.  But that is no argument for saying that business people are not paying their fair share of tax and that the system of taxation of business is unfair.  It would be no more logical for the Minister to argue that because two or three farmers on the notional system got away with paying tax because of peculiar circumstances in their case that <i>ipso facto</i> the notional system is unfair.  The Minister was arguing from the particular to the general in a most dishonest way while at the same time protesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the notional system was such an easy and happy thing to be on as the HiMinister was trying to say why, I ask Deputy Connolly, were all the farmers getting off it and going on to accounts as he seems to suggest?  Never, in my view, could there have been two speeches from two Members of the House seeking to prove the same thing which were so contradictory  <Col N="313" /> as the speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, notwithstanding that they were both speaking from the same brief.  Although they were speaking from the same brief prepared by the same officials they have succeeded in contradicting one another.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to come in on a point of explanation and I acknowledge the Deputy's generosity.  I quoted nine cases in the province of Leinster.  I indicated that there are an equal number in the province of Munster and not quite as many in Connacht and Ulster which makes, in that bracket, at least 30 cases.  The ones I quoted were all from the top earners in terms of <Col N="314" /> valuation.  They are the very wealthy farmers who did not go off the notional system.  All of those farmers for their own reasons, as I demonstrated very clearly, because they had valuations of about £500, stayed on the notional system as a consequence of which they did not pay tax.  That is not the same as what the Minister of State was saying in respect of the majority of farmers who are entitled to opt for one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister has had the opportunity of satisfying himself that he made himself understood.  It allows me to say to him that, if it were not the notional system that he is now against but simply the abuse of the notional system by a small category of farmers, the solution then would have been not to abolish the notional system and go back on the solemn promise made in the manifesto but to say that over a certain valuation threshold the notional system would not be open to a farmer.  For instance, he could have provided that if a farmer had a valuation of £100 or £150 the notional system would not be open to him but that he would allow the notional system to be retained for the small intensive farmer. The Minister would have had an immediate solution to his problem.  But that is not what he wanted to do.  He did not want to eliminate the abuse of the notional system.  He wanted to do away with it completely and go back on the promise that he made to the people.  We made no such promise.  He did and, in producing cases of that sort, he has produced what I still say is a specious argument, deliberately designed to muddy the water and create an anti-farmer impression.  He took individual cases like this where there was a perfectly easy way out by simply abolishing the notional system for people with very large acreages and making it available only to small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly deplore the situation where large farmers, such as the cases mentioned by the Minister, can use the notional system to avoid paying tax.  I deplore it as much as the Minister and more.  But there was a way of getting <Col N="315" /> around that problem by not allowing the notional system to be available to people over a certain valuation.  However the Minister either did not think of that or shut his mind to it.  There was a substantial case for maintaining the notional system in respect of small farmers for another year.  That is what the amendment seeks to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

I should be happy to amend the amendment to the effect that the notional system be retained only in respect of farmers whose valuations are less than £100.  Such provision would eliminate the abuses of which the Minister has given examples.  As I have allowed the Minister to intervene to explain a point, perhaps he would be prepared to intervene again to say whether he would be prepared to accept an amendment on the lines I am suggesting now, that is, that the notional system be retained in respect of farmers whose valuations are less than £100.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 30, to delete lines 1 to 37.</P>
      <P>As I explained when we were dealing on Committee Stage with the taxation of farmer profits and when we had a similar amendment, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that both business and farming are treated in the same way.  I am sure that this is something with which every section of the community would agree.  If business is allowed 100 per cent depreciation against taxation, the same facility should be available to the farming community.  I think everybody will realise the justice of such a provision especially having regard to the very bad year experienced by farmers last year and to the indications for this year which would seem to be that farmers may not expect to have a very good year either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister introduced an amendment to the effect that anything that was fixed, for example, a milking parlour, would be allowable in terms of depreciation of up to 100 per cent, but the same provision is not to apply in respect of something out on the farm such as a tractor.  The implications of our amendment go beyond merely what happens on the farm, though primarily the beneficiaries would be the people on the farm.  The amendment <Col N="317" /> would extend the provision also to the suppliers of farm machinery, and we all know that those people have not been doing well for the past 12 or 18 months whereas those who supply fixtures within the farmyard will, presumably, continue to get their fair share of business.</P>
    <P>Many farmers will now be receiving advice to the effect that the notional system will not be available to them any longer.  Because of the switch to the accounts system they will have to employ accountants.  Having regard to the importance of farm machinery to the farmer the provision in question should apply in this instance also.  It is vitally important that farmers be encouraged to use the best machinery available, thereby ensuring that their productivity is increased. Therefore, our reasons for tabling this amendment are, first, to put farmers and business people on the same level in regard to this aspect of taxation and also to help stop the redundancies that are occurring within the firms manufacturing machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this matter on Committee Stage.  As I indicated then, I had already made considerable changes in regard to the proposals that were announced last year and which were to be implemented this year in respect of capital allowances generally and not excluding from this limitation farm buildings, farm development and farm plant and machinery.  In respect of farm plant and machinery other than that installed in farm buildings I considered that there was a case for limiting the allowances on the basis of what was announced last year and I conveyed this in the course of discussions with the farm leaders both before and after the budget.  This was on the basis that, first, there was evidence of over-investment in farm plant and machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about last year.  It might at least be argued that in the event it might have been more costly for the farmers concerned that they had paid their tax bill and not subjected <Col N="318" /> themselves to a fairly heavy burden of meeting repayments on farm plant and machinery which would not be utilised fully.  It is evident that this was the gap in the provision which needed to be filled as was announced last year and I am proposing to implement that provision this year.  But in the interest of farm development generally and of promoting real productivity whether in terms of farm buildings, of farm development or of plant and machinery, I have acknowledged the case made to me by the farm leaders.  I think the provision being made will make a significant contribution to the development of farming in the course of this and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Let me, at the same time, make it clear that the restriction on accelerated allowances in respect of plant and machinery &mdash; and this is important &mdash; will apply only after full allowances have been given in respect of the ordinary wear and tear allowance for all plant and machinery.  The restriction on the farm plant and machinery allowances does not come into effect until after free depreciation on fixed plant and machinery used in the farm buildings, the increased allowances in respect of expenditure on farm buildings and free depreciation in respect of expenditure on reclamation, drains, fences, holding yards and roadways have been used.</P>
      <P>After these allowances have been given, if accelerated allowances are also claimed in respect of the ordinary plant and machinery, the amount of such extra allowance &mdash; and it is only the extra allowance which is being dealt with here &mdash; would be restricted to such an amount as will not bring the total amount of the capital allowances granted to more than 30 per cent of the chargeable profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that any such restrictions will apply only to extra allowances claimed on plant and machinery.  In relation to all the other allowances mentioned, there will be no restriction, even where they exceed 30 per cent of the profits.  That, as Deputies will appreciate, is a significant advance on the announced intention last year.  I have given the reason why this is a significant exception from the other areas.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the effect this will have not so much on the farmers but on the agricultural machinery industry. The regrettable reality, which we all hope will change, is that 80 per cent of the machinery in question is imported. This is something of which I am very conscious, having regard to the impact that has on our balance of payments and on the potential for this industry to supply the Irish farmers' needs, so that the industry itself can grow and develop and that that corrective impact will be made on our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>Let me say, in passing, that the impact of the new corporation tax rate of 10 per cent will be very beneficial for this industry, which is almost exclusively engaged in manufacturing for the home market and, therefore, obviously will benefit considerably from the effects of this.  There is a variety of good reasons, which I hope the Deputies opposite will appreciate, for the concessions given already as a consequence of the discussions we have had with the farming organisations and for maintaining the limitations in respect of farm plant and machinery, only after the other allowances have been used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, to the extent that we are dealing with similar situations, at any rate, we are treating farmers here at least as well as any other sector.  I am not saying that we are making fish of one and flesh <Col N="320" /> of another or giving any special privileges.  The same provision which applies in respect of vehicles for industry applies here.  I cannot see how it can be suggested that we are not giving farmers the same treatment as the other sectors of the community.  If there is any distinction &mdash; and I would not want to press this point at this stage &mdash; it would be in favour of the farming community in concessions given already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer, of course, is that there is an intrinsic difference between farming and industry in that industry is carried out usually in one small place, in a factory where one uses machinery fixed in place, whereas on the farm, because of the nature of the activity, it is carried out over a large acreage and one must have mobile rather than fixed machinery.  If one were anxious to treat both in the same way, one would not draw a distinction between fixed machinery which is granted an allowance and mobile machinery which is not.  Because of the nature of the farming industry, the farmer must rely on mobile rather than fixed machinery.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his contribution that there was evidence of over-investment in plant and machinery last year.  That may be so, but there certainly is no evidence of over-investment in respect of farmers this year or, indeed, of anything else.  There is a tremendous amount of not only new machinery lying about, but also second-hand machinery being put up for auction by farmers because they cannot afford to meet their outgoings and have to sell off machinery in order to keep themselves above water. This may prove that, as the Minister says, there was over-investment last year but we are not now talking about last year, we are talking about a tax to apply this year and next year.  Certainly there is no danger of abuse of a concession in relation to the purchase of farm machinery this year, next year, or, indeed, in the next two or three years.  As the Minister is making tax for the future, he should not, perhaps, make his case based on experience of the past which is no longer relevant.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 31, line 8, after &ldquo;made&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;under this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton remembers, particularly, in the course of Committee Stage, a debate on the amendment which introduced this section into the Bill.  He suggested that the inclusion in the section of a reference to fences or other works if made in the section might restrict the allowance to a maximum of 30 per cent, notwithstanding that free depreciation for these items is provided for by section 14 of the Finance Act, 1977.  Section 14 of the 1977 Act provides that where an allowance was due under section 22 of the Finance Act of 1974 in respect of fences or certain other works, that allowance was to be increased by such amount as the farmer specified.  If the reference to fences and so forth is not included in section 22, then there is no allowance to be increased under the 1977 provision.  The reference therefore must remain in section 22, as re-written under this section, so that the allowance to be increased under the 1977 provision can be effective. As I indicated on Committee Stage the 30 per cent restriction applies only to any allowance to be granted under section 22 and does not, as I have said already, affect the free depreciation provisions of section 14 of the 1977 Act, which applies to fences and other works. It does not affect them.  However, because the Deputy felt it would be better to make specific reference to that to make the matter crystal clear, I am now tabling this amendment which <Col N="322" /> specifically limits the 30 per cent restrictions to any allowance granted under section 22.  I would hope there can be no argument after that, that it affects the free depreciation provisions of the 1977 Act.  This has been tabled precisely to meet the point made by the Deputy, so that there could be no question of what was the intention.  This amendment gives effect to both my own intention &mdash; which was covered in the Bill &mdash; and to put it beyond any doubt, what Deputy Bruton brought up on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 31, after line 31 to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a)  In this subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;accounting period&rsquo; has the same meaning as in section 12 of the Finance Act, 1976;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;farming&rsquo; has the same meaning as in Chapter II of Part I of the Finance Act, 1974;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;person&rsquo; has the same meaning as in section 12 of the Finance Act, 1976;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;stock to which this subsection applies' means livestock forming part of the trading stock of a trade of farming which is compulsorily disposed of under any statute relating to the eradication or control of diseases in livestock;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;trading stock&rsquo; has the same meaning as in section 31 of the Finance Act, 1975.</P>
      <P>(b)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  any stock to which this subsection applies is disposed of in an accounting period by a person carrying on a trade of farming, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> (ii)  apart from the provisions of this subsection, the value of the trading stock of the said trade of farming at the beginning of the accounting period exceeds the value of the trading stock at the end of the accounting period, the person may elect, by notice in writing given to the inspector not later than one year after the end of the accounting period, that for the purpose of section 31 of and the Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1975, and section 12 of the Finance Act, 1976&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the value of the trading stock of the trade of farming at the end of the accounting period, and</P>
    <P>(II)  the value of the said trading stock at the beginning of the immediately succeeding accounting period,</P>
    <P>shall be computed as if the said stock to which this subsection applies had not been disposed of:</P>
    <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(A)  this subsection shall not be construed as enabling the value of trading stock at the end of an accounting period or at the beginning of an immediately succeeding accounting period to exceed the value of the trading stock at the beginning of the first mentioned accounting period,</P>
    <P>(B)  nothing in this subsection shall affect the provisions of section 12 (8) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1977) of the Finance Act, 1976, and</P>
    <P>(C)  this subsection shall not have effect in relation to any year of assessment prior to the year 1980-81.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide relief to farmers who &mdash; because of compulsory disposal of livestock due to disease control measures &mdash; might be subjected to a heavier income tax liability than they would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> This situation arises from the operations of the provisions governing stock relief.  As was mentioned on the last occasion, the stock relief takes the form of a deduction allowable in computing trading profits.  If stock relief has been granted and the value of stock on hand decreases subsequently, then the relief is withdrawn to the extent that the value has decreased.  The relief is withdrawn by treating the amount of the decrease in stock value as a trading receipt.  In the ordinary course of events this position would arise, say, where the farmer decided to sell his stock but not to replace them fully.  However, it is considered &mdash; I think this was mentioned on the last occasion when I gave notice of my intention to introduce this amendment &mdash; that this approach is not appropriate in the case of a farmer whose stock values have been reduced, or wiped out for that matter, because of disease eradication or disease control measures. The farmer in that kind of case has no option whatsoever but to dispose of his stock.  It could happen that, at the end of the relevant accounting period, he might not have built up his stock to its original value, in which event his liability to tax would have been reduced.  To cater for this type of situation in effect this amendment will ignore the drop in stock value, due to compulsory disposal of stock in a particular period.</P>

      <P>The subject matter of this amendment also was raised by us during the Committee Stage debate, as I presume it was raised with the Minister by the farming organisations.  We welcome the amendment.  Our only problem is that, having seen it so recently, one is faced with a difficulty in detecting any drafting defects because of the brevity of time available to us for its scrutiny.  That is not to take from my welcome of it.  It is the inevitable result of amendments being introduced on Report Stage anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know if there is any limit on the number of times a farmer can claim this relief.  For instance, could it arise that he might dispose of half of <Col N="325" /> his herd in one year and the other half in the following year.  In those circumstances can he claim mitigation of his tax liability by virtue of having claimed stock relief in earlier years in respect of both disposals of cattle as a result of successive examinations under the disease eradication scheme, or can he merely claim it once?  I notice also that he must claim not later than one year after the end of the accounting period which is probably reasonable.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 9, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, in relation to the farm land so owned,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment makes a further amendment in the new subsection (8) which was inserted in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1974.  Deputies may recall that this section had to do with an anti-avoidance provision designed to prevent farmers avoiding liability to income tax on farming profits by making special arrangements regarding the occupation of the farm.  I am now referring to section 17 of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
      <P>The new subsection (8) was amended on Committee Stage to exclude from the deeming provisions for threshold purposes cases where farmland was owned and occupied by a wife and to bring in cases where farmland was owned jointly by two or more persons.  As Deputies will recall, if I did not make that amendment on Committee Stage, the deeming provisions of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1974 would not have excluded a case where the land was owned and occupied by the wife separately for threshold purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further amendment is required now to ensure that changes made already do not have the effect, in joint ownership <Col N="326" /> cases, of excluding from the total rateable valuation to be taken into account the rateable valuation of farmland which is not jointly owned.  The consequence of the amendment I introduced on the last occasion in case of this situation is that it is important to distinguish between them in the case of farmland which is not jointly owned.  That is the purpose of this present amendment.</P>
    <P>I might mention that subsection (8) introduces a special rule for determining the rateable valuation of the farmland where each joint owner of such land is deemed to occupy.  In the absence of this amendment it might be contended that subsection (8) supersedes the other sub-sections of section 17 and that, therefore, land not jointly owned is to be disregarded in determining total rateable valuation for threshold purposes where some land is jointly owned.  This is not the intention of the subsection and the insertion of the words of the amendment I propose here puts the matter beyond any doubt.</P>

Therefore, it is probably desirable to make this amendment.

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 16, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than a body of persons, or a trust, established for charitable purposes only)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage I indicated I would introduce an amendment in relation to section 30 of the Bill as amended in Committee.  This amendment should commend itself to the House.  If Deputies have any questions I will deal with them.</P>

      <P>This deals with an interpretation of &ldquo;charities&rdquo;.  I suggest the Minister should clarify the position.  I will put a few cases to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these may be more appropriate for judicial determination. I will not try to adjudicate on them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very substantial case law as to what are and what are not charities.  The Minister is not using the phrase &ldquo;for charitable purposes only&rdquo; in the dark: he has a good idea of what is covered in statutes and case law and he should be able to answer some questions to clarify the position.  For instance, will educational institutions be exempt from the resource tax, farms owned by bona fide schools, farms owned by agricultural colleges, farms owned by AI stations?  The Dublin District Milk Board have an AI station with a number of bulls which provide a service to the farming community.  That service is provided by that body for or on behalf of the State on an agency basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Dublin District Milk Board or any other milk board providing a similar service have to pay the resource tax? The Agricultural Institute have substantial parcels of land on which they carry out agricultural research.  Are they charities?  If they are not will they have to pay the resource tax on their farms? <Col N="328" /> The Department of Agriculture own substantial areas of agricultural land, for instance the various cereal stations and other agencies operated by the Department. Will they have to pay the resource tax on land owned by them?</P>
    <P>If a local authority build up a land bank of agricultural land intended to be used later for housing, will they have to pay the resource tax when that land reaches a valuation in excess of £70?  It is quite likely that the land held, for instance, by Dublin County Council would exceed a valuation of £70 because they must have substantial areas of agricultural land.  Will they be bound to pay resource tax on that land?</P>
    <P>I do not think it is the intention of the Minister or the House that the resource tax would be levied on such bodies.  We do not have sufficient information on what constitutes a charitable purpose.  I have serious doubts whether the concept of charity would apply to such bodies, who would therefore be liable.  I am sure other Deputies will think of other examples of land being held by corporate bodies.  For instance, Deputy Taylor, being an ex-Army man will know that the Army have considerable areas of land at the Curragh which is primarily agricultural land.  Will the Army have to pay the resource tax on that land?  The Army are certainly not a charity and apparently charities are the only bodies excluded.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the resource tax will apply to &ldquo;a person&rdquo;.  A body corporate is a person, and I presume that any of the bodies I have mentioned are incorporated. Perhaps the Minister would claim that the Army are not a person. The Agricultural Institute are clearly a legal person because they are incorporated. I presume they would be liable unless a specific exclusion is made.  I would be very much against the Government by administrative action excluding Government sponsored bodies simply by saying &ldquo;We will not ask you for the tax&rdquo;. If anybody is to be excluded it should be by statute.  For instance, I would not be agreeable to the Revenue Commissioners saying to the Army; &ldquo;Really you are liable, but you being who you <Col N="329" /> are we will exclude you, you will not have to pay&rdquo;.  If it is necessary specifically to exclude these bodies the exclusions should be written into the statute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the amendment but we are in some difficulty, as Deputy Bruton has said. Perhaps the Minister could cut short the discussion by explaining what is meant by &ldquo;other than a body of persons, or a trust, established for charitable purposes only&rdquo;.  Is it a definition used in other legislation to cover all these situations? The Minister will agree it would be undesirable if every institution in the country had to go to the courts for a definition.</P>

      <P>What is the position of some of the giant co-operatives in Minister in regard to the resource tax?  I am primarily interested in co-operatives engaged in dairy processing, like Mitchelstown, Ballyclough and so forth. All of them over a period of years have purchased a land bank for the purpose of expansion, to experiment to improve the different breeds of livestock and to supplement the earnings of the societies. These co-operative societies should be exempt from the resource tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very large volume of case law in relation to what are charities and how they are defined. The law on charities is covered as much by case law and the decisions of the court as it is by legislation.  Legislation deals with the application of that legislation to charities.  What is a charity, and <Col N="330" /> the purposes of a charity, are set out very clearly.  That is where one must go for the principles involved.  There are Charitable Donations and Bequests Acts and the Commissioner for Charitable Donations and Bequests who makes some adjudications in this area.</P>
      <P>I could not, nor could anybody else here, attempt to define what charities are at this point.  Organisations deemed to be charities and listed as exempt, are exempt from income tax charged on farming profits if, in the words of section 334, of the 1967 Act which applies to any trade carried on by a charity, &ldquo;that trade is exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of the primary purpose of the charity&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are agricultural co-operatives charities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  To decide if bodies are charitable, one must look at the deeds which set them up to find out if they were set up for charitable purposes.  The purpose for which they were set up will be a better guide than the actual definition of the charity itself as to whether they are charities within the law.</P>
      <P>Another purpose would be if a trade was exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of the primary purpose of the charity.  A typical example would be a school or an agricultural college.  That would be exempt because that is the primary purpose of that charity.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I would deal with each case but, in my opinion, the majority of those the Deputy mentioned would not be considered charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On what grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another criterion under which charities are exempt from the tax on farming profits, that is, if the work in connection with the trade is mainly carried on by the <Col N="331" /> beneficiaries of the charity A good example would be a laundry carried on by a religious community in which girls looked after by the community were employed. They are the beneficiaries of the charity and they are doing the work. This is one of the guiding provisions of the reliefs from income tax liability in respect of trades conducted by charities. There are two main exemptions &mdash; the primary work of the charity or if the trade is mainly carried on by the beneficiaries of the charity.</P>
      <P>As far as the other organisations mentioned by the Deputy are concerned, I can give only a general reaction.  I do not think co-operatives would qualify as charities nor would AI stations.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 32, lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;or any subsequent year of assessment&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;only&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 30 of the Finance Bill, 1980, as amended in committee reads:</P>
      <P>This section applies to any person who at any time during a year of assessment (being the year 1980-81 or any subsequent year of assessment) occupies, or is deemed to occupy, farm land the rateable valuation of which amounts to £70 or more.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton and I propose to delete &ldquo;or any subsequent year of assessment&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;only&rdquo;.  The purpose of this amendment would be to limit the application of the resource tax, which was passed here by a vote during the Committee Stage, for one year.  The reason we wished to do that is to give effect to the promise, and the Minister may dispute this, given by the Taoiseach when he spoke on the budget debate last February.  This resource tax was bound to be, and is, extremely controversial because it affects people who are finding it very difficult to make money.  Even if they have not made profits in the current year they will be asked to pay this tax.  I am sorry the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, has left&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might tell him that we appreciate the points he made earlier today when he spoke about the ability of these people to pay the tax. <Col N="333" /> He said the notional system of taxation bore just as heavily on those who made money as those who did not.  If he was in the House now he would speak against the resource tax and in support of this amendment because the same principle applies in this case.  The resource tax has to be paid by farmers with valuations of £70 or over, even if they have not made a profit this year.</P>
      <P>This tax is a totally new form of taxation. As in the case of rates, which this Government have been so anxious to increase in regard to the farming community, they will have no option but to pay whether they can afford it or not. Following much criticism in the hours following the announcement of this measure in the budget, the Taoiseach told the House the next morning that the tax was intended to be of a temporary nature.  It is to allow the House to give effect to that promise that we have tabled amendment No. 26, which will ensure that the tax will be limited to this year and will not be effective in the year 1980-81.  This additional tax was imposed on the farming community by the action yesterday of the Fianna Fáil Party who walked through the lobbies in support of this resource tax.  Less than an hour ago the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment said that the notional system of taxation was unfair because it did not take account of the ability of people to pay, but yesterday he walked through the lobbies to vote in favour of the imposition of a similar tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this matter on Committee Stage and I put some statements on record, including a clarification of what was being represented as a conflict between the Taoiseach and myself on this issue and on farm taxation generally.  Deputies opposite have referred rather vaguely to my budget statement but none of them has actually quoted from that statement.  My budget statement was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the farming organisations in my consultations with them, the operation of this <Col N="334" /> revised scheme now being introduced will be kept under review in the interest of equity and in the light of experience of its operation.</P>
    <P>This is what I had indicated to the farming organisations before the budget.</P>
    <P>A meeting was held on 14 April between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and myself and leaders of the farming organisations and a statement was issued afterwards, part of which was as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government indicated that it is not their intention that the Resource Tax should be a permanent feature of the tax code.  The termination of this tax will be considered by the Government in the light of the amount of tax paid by farmers in relation to farm income generally in the current year.</P>
    <P>These two statements are entirely consistent and the significant point is that the matter will be reviewed in the light of the operation of the farm taxation package generally.  That has been and remains the position.  It is on the income for last year that tax will be payable, with the exception of those coming into the net for the first time who will have the option of having their assessment based on income for last year or for the current year.  The Taoiseach said it is not intended that this should be a permanent feature and I reiterate that.  The termination of this tax can only be determined in the light of the operation of the system this year.  This is what has been indicated at all times to the farm organisations and their leaders. There is no inconsistency in what was said in my budget speech or by the Taoiseach or in the joint communique issued following our meeting with farm leaders.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite are now asking for quite a dramatic change.  They are saying there should be no question of reviewing this package in the light of its operation and want a statement saying that the tax will definitely and absolutely operate only for this year.  It will come as no surprise to these Deputies that I could not accept that amendment.  Neither will it be a surprise to the farmers or to their <Col N="335" /> leaders because we made our position quite clear.  We will have to see how the whole package operates before coming to a decision regarding termination.  Our hope is that we would be able to terminate it at the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a firm hope, but we must await the operation of the system.  We have conveyed this quite clearly to farmers and they recognise the position.  In reviewing the system we will take account of the fall in incomes last year.  Deputies will already be aware that in the amendments I have introduced and the concessions I have given I have probably reduced the estimate of what can be expected from farm tax generally. The Government will take all these factors into account at the end of the year in reviewing the operation of the system.</P>

It is our firm hope that we will be in a position to terminate it this year.  However, legislation cannot be framed on firm hopes.  It deals only with <Col N="336" /> absolute finality.  I cannot accept the proposal made by the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt about that.  He is an influential man and he has many wise and wonderful things to say.  I should like to quote from what that influential oracle, Deputy Connolly, said earlier today:</P>
      <P>The Deputy cannot have his loaf and eat it.  Let us get one thing clear.  If one earns money one pays tax and if one does not earn it one does not pay.</P>
      <P>In common with Adam Smith who in his time laid down certain canons of taxation, Deputy Connolly has laid down his canons of taxation and I must admit that I agree with what he said in the passage I have quoted.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State is not here to apply to the section his undoubted wisdom in the matter of the principles of equity in taxation. It is unfortunate he is not able to bring his philosophical principles to bear on the resource tax because it is very clear that with regard to that tax it does not matter whether one earns money or not one must still pay that tax.</P>
      <P>The main objection to the resource tax is that it will have to be paid whether people have an income or do not have an income.  As everyone knows, farmers will have little or no income this year but will still have to pay the resource tax and that is inherently objectionable.  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach have said that it is not intended that this tax will be permanent; in the Minister's words, &ldquo;it will be reviewed in the interest of equity and in the light of its operation.&rdquo; Later on he said it would be reviewed &ldquo;in the light of the operation of the farm package generally&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not sure if it will be reviewed in the light of whether the resource tax works out to be fair or in the light of the entire farm package being unfair.  There is a certain confusion here. The matter would be clear if the Minister said that the tax would be removed in the event of the resource tax proving to be unfair but he did not say that.  He is trying to have it both ways.  Even if it is manifestly clear that the resource tax has worked out in the past year as totally unfair, if some other section of farmers who are not liable to resource tax are paying less than their fair share or if the total package does not yield what the Minister considers an adequate share for the farming sector as a whole, then the Minister will consider himself justified in retaining the tax.  There is nothing more liable to tendentious interpretation than the Minister's assurance about the permanency or otherwise of the resource tax.  He has given the assurance in such a form, with such a degree of contradiction and double speak that it is impossible to know what criteria, if any, will be applied in deciding whether the resource tax will remain.</P>
      <P>There is no guarantee in the Bill that the resource tax will not continue for next year and the following years.  The section states that the tax may be levied in the year of assessment, being the year 1980-81, or any subsequent year of assessment.  The resource tax can continue until 2080 without having to be renewed by the House.  When some novel and extraordinary tax is introduced it is usual to say that it will be reviewed annually.  Income tax was introduced in 1814 to pay for the Napoleonic wars.  It was considered to be an exceptional tax and it provided specifically that it would have to be renewed each year in the light of experience of the tax.  One might describe it as a ritual but there was a real opportunity to consider the matter each year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Resource tax bears no relationship to earnings or to the ability to pay but there is no provision in this Bill that it will have to be renewed next year.  If the Minister decides to retain it in the following years he does not have to come to this House for the statutory authority to do so.  Our amendment provides that the Minister would have to come to the House next year if he wanted to renew the tax and that he would have to introduce another section seeking to apply it for a further year. However, the Minister does not want that.  He is telling this House he wants the power to renew this taxation for next year and the following years without seeking the authority of the House.  The Minister's intentions in this area are quite clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We know that when the courts interpret the law they do not pay the slightest attention to what any Minister or Member may say in a speech in this House or outside.  Judges consider the law of the land to be what appears in the statute.  So far as the resource tax is concerned the statute will say that the a tax was introduced this year and can continue indefinitely.  There is nothing in the statute to say that it is a temporary tax that will be subject to review.  All that the statute says is that resource tax is being introduced this year and can continue for as long as the Minister wishes to continue it.  That is what we object to.  We want to change this to ensure that the tax can be levied for one year only.</P>

    <P>Will the Minister say what criterion he intends to use in this alleged review of the continuation or otherwise of the resource tax?  The Minister said in the budget that he expects to get £86 million from the farming community this year. Farmers will not make much money this year and many will not be liable to income tax.  The Minister might discover <Col N="339" /> that instead of getting £86 million he will get only £70 million because the overall income of the farming community for the purpose of statistics includes the income of large numbers of farmers who are not in the tax net and the incomes of part-time farmers.  If the Minister took into account the total agricultural income from all of the various sources and found that he got only £70 million whereas in the budget he expected £86 million, will he consider that that is not sufficient in the light of the operation of the farming tax package generally and will he continue the resource tax even though it is unfair because he has not got enough from the farming sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly open to the Minister, on the basis of the assurances he has given, to do that.  The Minister has not tied himself down to saying that, if the resource tax is unfair, it will be got rid of. All the Minister said is that, if the farm tax package does not give the yield he is hoping for, he can continue resource tax. That is wrong.  Each tax should be taken on its merits, not on the basis of other tax.  Farmers are self-employed and the Minister might as well say that he will continue resource tax if the self-employed sector, including farmers, have not paid enough this year.  A very significant portion of the self-employed are shopkeepers and the Minister could impose a resource tax on shopkeepers.  If the self-employed as a whole, including doctors, lawyers and lots of other people who would not be liable to this resource tax, did not pay their fair share, he could continue this resource tax on shopkeepers.  In imposing this tax the Minister is choosing a small minority of farmers to pay for the sins of the others. They must pay the resource tax in order that the entire sector may be seen to be paying their fair share.  People who are not liable for tax at all will have to pay resource tax.  That is quite unfair.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not clarified the way in which this will operate.  The Minister is unclear as to whom this tax will apply. We asked the Minister if it will apply to <Col N="340" /> co-operatives, AI stations and so on, and the Minister either did not know or would not answer.  Perhaps the Minister can answer now.  If the Minister is going to review this tax and if he is to have sufficient information to decide whether it is fair or not, he will have to know to whom the tax applies.  It appears that the Minister does not even know whether the resource tax will apply to co-operatives, AI stations or to the agricultural institutions.</P>

      <P>This tax should not be allowed to operate for more than one year.  The impression has been created among the farming community that this will operate for one year only.  Most of the farmers I have spoken to are not worried about the resource tax because they think it is only for one year.  The Minister may not be aware that the case is that the vast majority of farmers are under the impression that this will last only for a year.  I was at a fair recently in the company of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and we had a brief discussion about resource tax.  The farmers were not aggrieved simply because they believed it to be of such short duration.  This is the impression that has been created, intentionally or otherwise, by the Taoiseach and the Minister in saying that this is a temporary tax and presumably saying it in the confidential discussions they had with the farming community.  I wonder if in those discussions the Minister told the farming community more than he told us in relation to the application of this tax and if that is why they are not worried.  If that is the case it is very unfair to us and I hope that the Minister will tell us exactly the criterion on which this tax will be renewable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main fear is not that it will cause a huge problem in the first year but that in subsequent years the rate of resource tax could be increased from £5.50 to £7, £8 or £10 per £ of valuation and that more farmers with valuations below £70 would be brought into the tax net.  If the Minister accepted our amendment to ensure that the resource tax would last for only one year, everybody would know that it cannot be introduced at a higher rate.  It is very significant, and we will make it well known to the farming community, that the Government would not accept limitation of this tax and that they deliberately said that they want to adhere to the wording of the Bill which allows them to maintain this tax for future years.  In so doing they are allowing themselves the possibility of extending it and raising it to a higher rate in <Col N="342" /> future years.  If it was merely their intention to raise a certain amount of money for this year only they would have accepted this amendment.  That they have not done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to be brief although that is difficult on this matter.  Last Monday night I met a cross-section of farmers in my constituency and I took great pains to explain to them that I could not find any indication in the Finance Bill on the part of the Minister that the resource tax was temporary and could be removed with a stroke of a pen.  These farmers were absolutely convinced of the contrary.  They said that a delegation from their organisation had discussions with the Minister and that the result of these discussions was doubly reinforced by a pledge or guarantee from the Taoiseach that the resource tax was only temporary and therefore insignificant.  It was the same as if they were to sit only once in the dentist's chair.  I explained clearly to them that I could find nothing in the legislation to indicate that.  Having heard the Minister I am satisfied that the Taoiseach's undertaking and the statement issued by the Government represent a grown-up edition and twin to the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  If Deputy Barry's amendment is not accepted by the Minister it is unlikely to secure a majority in the House when the Fianna Fáil Deputies think so little about this vital matter that there is not a single one of them present with the Minister.  I do not think we have discussed in Parliament anything as vital as this because the section of the Bill that we are now trying to amend and improve is the most poisonous injection administered by Fianna Fáil to Irish agriculture since the State was established.</P>

      <P>This new resource tax imposes a serious handicap on agriculture.  It is extraordinary that it should be introduced at the end of one of the most depressing years in agriculture. The Government statement that was <Col N="343" /> issued was only a lollipop thrown to the farmers after a depressing year in agriculture.  According to the agricultural economists and economic experts we are not facing a brighter prospect for the coming year.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister refuses to accept Deputy Barry's amendment is the Minister really serious about this being only a temporary measure?  In my long experience as a Member of the House I have never seen sections of a Finance Bill, nor any taxation imposed by a Minister for Finance easily removed. Once it was on the Statute Book I did not find any Minister endeavouring to remove it because the departmental advisers, the Revenue Commissioners and others are very slow to advise a Minister for Finance to cancel any section of legislation that will bring in money.  I have heard pledges given here in connection with VAT.  The Minister at the time gave a guarantee that the VAT percentages as first introduced would not, could not and should not be increased. What was the value of that undertaking? On every appropriate occasion when the public till needed a few more coppers to jingle at the expense of the people the percentages were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see grave danger in this section of the Finance Bill because of our concern for farmers and every other section of the community in respect of which similar steps can be taken.  Once the precedent is set by this resource tax there is nothing to prevent the Minister next year or in the future, as Deputy Bruton so wisely said, from extending the provision to other sections of the community, to other trades, businesses or sectors. The farmers are being used as guinea pigs for the first injection by the Government. Are the Minister and the Government serious?  Are they endeavouring to hoodwink farmers?  That may not be very difficult; it has been done on numerous occasions including mid-1977. But because of the lessons learned on that occasion and because of the experience of the Opposition now and because of the valuable experience many <Col N="344" /> Deputies have of verbal undertakings, promises or commitments it has been clearly pointed out that these are not worth a straw unless they are written into legislation.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of farmers feel at the moment that the undertaking given by the Government and by the Taoiseach and the pronouncement within the past hour by the Minister for Finance means that this can be described as a temporary, emergency provision for a very brief period.  I will meet farmers in my constituency during the next weekend.  I know Fianna Fáil and the promises made by various Ministers for Finance from time to time.  How can I give an assurance to those farmers, as a result of the debate taking place at the moment, that this resource tax is only temporary?  It has been pointed out to the Government by farmers organisations and I am sure also it has been pointed out to the Opposition that the resource tax must be paid whether or not farmers are making money.  I do not know of anybody except somebody in Grangegorman who would insert in a Bill a provision to compel farmers to pay this tax, irrespective of whether or not they are making money, especially based on the experience of the past 12 months and of the first six months of this year which has been the most difficult period for farmers since the closing stages of the economic war.  Farmers have had to face double rates, unprecedented bank interest, the refusal of banks to honour their cheques or advance them money, the refusal of traders to supply them with their requirements.  This section will impose a new tax on them.</P>
    <P>The people on this side of the House are aware of the plight of the farming community at the moment.  Why do the people on the other side of the House not show their realisation of the economic plight of farmers?  This resource tax is unjust.  We spoke this morning about the moral responsibilities of the Minister for Finance.  Now we have a new tax which we are told is temporary and which farmers expect to have removed after this year.  There is nothing in this section to say this is a temporary measure.  If it is a <Col N="345" /> temporary measure why not put that into the Bill?  Why not indicate what is meant by a temporary measure?  Is it one year, two years, three years?  The statement by the Minister for Finance a short time ago, which has been published in the papers, and the undertaking given to farmers oragnisations is only chocolate coating on the bitter pill.  The Government, in order to keep farmers calm, are using this statement which was very cutely worded and the pronouncement by the Minister for Finance, delivered with extremely well chosen words, to avoid a clear description of what a temporary measure is in relation to this resource tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this will be kept under review.  What does he mean by that?  Does it mean that if he gets a reasonable rake in this year by farmers selling stock so that they will have nothing to pay for any type of taxation next year or the year after, that he will review the matter?  What form of review is the Minister undertaking from month to month in relation to the resource tax? The slice of the cake from the EEC, as far as farmers are concerned, has not been very tasty this year.  We have been told that the slice of the cake cannot be made any bigger and that the farming community have already got their slice. If the resource tax is still on the books and if the EEC cake cannot be made bigger for farmers what will happen when the Spanish farmers, the Greek farmers and the Portugese farmers have to get a slice of the same cake?  Does it mean that this will be at the expense of the Irish farmers?  I have already indicated to the Minister certain economic articles he should have read in relation to the entry of Greece, Portugal and Spain into the EEC where there is no question of a resource tax.</P>

      <P>I will not go into other matters.  I am quite satisfied it has been fully debated but I am afraid that Deputies do not realise the seriousness of this new tax.  Whatever anxiety farmers may have in relation to this tax at the moment the anxiety can be partly remedied by the acceptance of Deputy Barry's amendment which will ensure that this tax will be for one year only.  I do not believe that if the Minister for Finance is occupying the same seat this time next year he is going to wipe the resource tax off the Statute Book.  In so far as the farmers in my constituency are concerned, I am not prepared to take the risk of accepting what the Taoiseach has said on the terms of the Government's statement about this being only a temporary measure.  This in my opinion is on the Statute Book and it is staying there.  I am not in the least interested in or concerned with any form of verbal undertaking in relation to this resource tax.  Now is the time, and this House will not have an opportunity again.  Once Deputy Barry's amendment is rejected that is the Last Post being sounded clearly and emphatically in relation to this resource tax.  The grave danger I see here is that any Minister for Finance this time 12 months or this time two years can proceed to extend and even expand on the resource tax.  Once it is on the Statute Book the grave danger exists, and it is disastrous.  I am not prepared to accept any verbal undertaking in relation to this matter because it is too serious.  It is vital.  Too many people in rural Ireland are depending on Irish agriculture for their livelihood and this is the death knell to Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand why any half-reasoning or sensible Government, who seriously and honestly believe that this is a measure for one year, will not be prepared to accept the reasonable Opposition amendment which will provide in the legislation for the resource tax as merely a temporary measure.  Fianna Fáil Deputies are parading and masquerading in various parts of the country commenting on this resource tax as being for only a few months.  Here is an opportunity now for them to do something <Col N="347" /> practical for Irish farmers instead of making pious expressions of sympathy and regret at unlit crossroads at midnight. I feel that grave danger exists with this resource tax, and this section is the most disastrous one in the Bill.  I add my voice to those of the Deputies who have spoken before me to ask the Government to come clean on this by way of inserting a provision stipulating one year only.  Then perhaps some farmers may be inclined to put trust and reliance on the statements that have been made already in this connection.  I recommend very strongly that this House view this section and Deputy Barry's amendment with greater interest and concern.  That is vital for Irish farmers and for Irish agriculture in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on taxation in general in the budget I made a special request to the Minister for Finance to withdraw the resource tax because I had in mind that it was the last straw.  I fail to understand why in the second year within which farmers will have to accept reduced incomes, and the effects which follow, all the forces of the Government party and their members will be concentrated in firing the full charge of taxation and have set as their target the farming community.  It is very difficult to understand the mentality of a Government who fire all their taxation on a person who is down &mdash; and the farmer is an ailing man in our economy at present.  We are moving into the second year when farmers will not be making a profit.  They will have to pay taxation on their losses, having had to endure and to pay for inputs at much higher prices.  One could not talk too strongly of this tax because it has failed to give any hope whatsoever to a community who are showing already that they have to restrict their output.  That is quite evident in the dairying areas, where herds are being reduced, and there is no faith among the agricultural community in the Governments approach to the economy.  That is evident in the cattle trade where banks and finance companies are not lending to <Col N="348" /> those who depend on them, such as the traders and the dealers in our marts.  The effect of the policy of taxation on our farmers has brought about a sluggish economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is coming into the second year.  There seems to be very little appreciation of the effect that a buoyant agriculture can have on the whole community.  The Government seem to ignore entirely the fact that an economy which is buoyant because of buoyant agriculture can infiltrate its benefits right through our society.  We know that the fuel costs add in a major way to the costs on the land.  The diesel and petrol costs increase the cost of journeys to creameries and the cost of operating our milk tankers to co-operatives. Therefore, there seems to be a poor appreciation of the present trend in agriculture, especially in remote areas rather than in areas where transport costs are not as high.</P>
      <P>The budget has withdrawn the purchasing power within our economy as a whole particularly because of indirect taxation.  What effect on our economy has combined taxation, including this resource tax?  Our traders, having purchased stocks of machinery, have to endure finding them lying in their yards unsold and this applies particularly to agricultural machinery.  The hardware merchants, those who deal in manure and so on, realise that their trading has dropped to about 25 per cent of what it was last year.</P>
      <P>One finds it very difficult to interpret the mentality of a Government who pursue a policy which will ensure that our economy will be deflated.  We are appealing, even at this eleventh hour, for some gesture which will show that the Government understand we cannot survive unless agriculture prospers.  In years gone by when policies were introduced which deflated farmers' incomes, we know what happened.  Lessons like that should not be forgotten.  Obviously we can make the same mistakes over and over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> There is one aspect of this taxation to which I take particular exception.  The Minister for Finance said he had discussions with farmer groups.  Undoubtedly that is true.  The implication is that there is a silent acceptance by the farming community, and by their spokesman, of the introduction not only of income tax at a valuation of £40 but also resource tax on people with valuations of over £70.  I deny that there is any acceptance by the farming community of any taxation, income tax or resource tax at the levels of £40 and £70 valuation.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, for the first time farmers saw a prospect of having a stable future.  They were encouraged to purchase land for their families.  They went to the banks and the finance companies. The result is that a farmer whose valuation was £35 or £40 now has a valuation of over £70.  He finds it difficult to make his repayments and he is victimised in that he has to pay a resource tax.  The stupidity of a policy which seems to ignore the plight of the farmers in a period when everything should be geared to boosting the economy and creating an atmosphere of confidence is obvious.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that members of the Fianna Fáil Party who own land are continuing to support this policy and are not exercising their influence to see that this tax is withdrawn.  They used their influence when the Minister tried to withdraw the necessary funds to maintain school transport in the rural areas. They were successful in having that policy reversed.  If they pursued the same course now, they would be successful. The people who must be relied upon to support this little State are being steamrolled.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, agriculture will always be our main industry.  If the Government do not accept this amendment, they will do harm to their own party, and this will be reflected at a later stage when they meet the people in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>The case against this tax has been made extremely eloquently. It is notable that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. Deputy Connolly, did not come in &mdash; he was here earlier defending other taxes&mdash;to speak against the amendment.  He knows, and the Minister must accept, that members of his party are saying, &ldquo;Do not worry about this tax; it is only there for a year&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment seeks to allow the Minister to give statutory effect to what members of his own party are saying outside the House.  He says the tax will be reviewed in the light of events to come, that it is of a temporary nature, and that it would be unheard of to write something of a temporary nature into a Bill.  That is not so.  The Minister has not made it clear exactly what form this review will take.  Is it that if the resource tax is not operating satisfactorily it will be discontinued?  Is it the amount of taxation which will be collected in bulk from the farmers?  Is it, as Deputy Bruton said, that if the farmers pay what the Minister considers a sufficient amount of taxation, including the resource tax, he <Col N="352" /> may consider discontinuing it?  Is it that if the whole Exchequer finances will allow it that he may consider discontinuing it.  There is no indication as to what form the review will take, or how he will judge how temporary the tax will be.</P>
    <P>We have no option but to vote for our own amendment and to try to ensure that this tax is for a limited duration.  We object to the tax because, as Deputy Taylor said, this is a tax on losses.  The farmers made losses last year.  They will be making losses this year and, in spite of that, they are now asked to pay a new tax.  In this regard we consider the Minister should write into this legislation provisions to give statutory effect to the indications that have been given directly to farmers' associations, by innuendo by the Taoiseach and the Minister here and, in a much more explicit manner, by members of the Minister's party at meetings with farmers all over the country.</P>

      <P>We have had two weeks now in debating this Private Members' Bill in the name of Deputy Quinn and which is supported by all the other Members of this party.  The two weeks' debate has shown the value of bringing in this Bill, not least in view of the wide range of opinions that have been expressed on the matter in question.  I think, for example, that there has been a distinct difference in tone between the debate last week and the debate this week.  Last week those speakers who were responding to our Bill spoke, by and large, in the terms of people who were speaking from carefully prepared positions, whereas this week we have had more flexibility and both from the Fine Gael and Government benches we have had a greater realisation of the fact that the problem of land prices is a serious problem and one in respect of which some action should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested particularly in the <Col N="355" /> speeches that were made last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Moore, and by Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  The greater part of what Deputy O'Brien had to say might have been said by any speaker in these benches that are occupied by the Labour Party.  The Minister of State's concern was in relation to the degree to which young people in particular are prohibited from buying houses and the reason implied was because of the land price element in the cost of housing &mdash; though, understandably, he criticised the Bill in terms of the type of solution proposed to deal with the problem.  I believe the Minister of State's concern in this area to be genuine.  However, I must ask the House to have regard to the record and the record will show that for very many years in relation to any attempt made to provide housing in the area which the Minister of State has represented in Dublin Corporation, and indeed in this House, very few local authority houses were built and there were not applied any compulsory purchase orders for the purpose of buying land on which to build local authority houses.  At the very least we must point to this as an indication that for all those years the Minister's concern was ineffective.</P>
    <P>I was astounded by Deputy Fox's claim that the introduction of certificates of reasonable valuation have helped in some way to control the price of building land.  The introduction of CRVs was a welcome development in the housing area generally, but this move had no effect in regard to controlling the cost of building land.  All it does is to ensure that the builder cannot add his mark up beyond a certain reasonable degree to the price he has paid for the land on which he builds houses.  In so far as I am familiar with the situation I tend to believe that the profits, and in particular the speculative profits, on building land are not made often by builders but that they are much more likely to be made by developers and that they are made only by builders in situations in which they are also the developers of the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> Deputy Fox chided the Labour Party for doing in opposition what he claimed they would not do in Government.  It would not be any harm that a dose of political honesty be administered here now and again.  In this context Deputy Fox will be aware, as everybody else is aware, that in the last Government Labour held 33? per cent of the Cabinet seats.  To believe and to act as if 33? per cent of the seats in the Cabinet entitled you to 51 per cent of the power in the making of decisions in the Government is to assume on the part of your audience a degree of naivete that is really quite remarkable.  I do not think that anybody inside or outside this House would seriously have accepted the point that Deputy Fox was making in that regard.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about this whole area I am reminded of the, no doubt, apocryphal conversation between two American film stars who were discussing with each other what they proposed to do with the many thousands of dollars they got from their respective studios. One said to the other &ldquo;I am putting my money into land.  They are not making any more of it&rdquo;.  Now, if that was true in the United States, a country &mdash; a continent, almost &mdash; where huge tracts of land are still undeveloped and unreclaimed, how much more true is it of a country like Ireland, where the very finite quality of the amount of land which we have is delimited by the seas around our shores. It is fundamental to the thinking behind our Bill that there is a finite supply of land in general, and of development land in particular, in Ireland, and that people do not make land, nor except in certain circumstances do they add to the value of land.  They buy it in one fashion or another, they inherit it, but they do not make it.  To give people the right to make speculative profits on a commodity which they have not made, do not make, and could not make if they tried, is to fly in the face of every concept of social justice.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the interest in this Bill has been phenomenal.  In so far as the Labour Party are concerned, no single measure which we have advanced in this <Col N="357" /> House or outside it, has attracted as much public interest and public support as this particular legislation.  What I want to do in the time available to me is to talk about the reasons for the Bill, to talk about the options open in relation to the control of the supply of land for building and to deal with some of the arguments which have been made against the Bill by speakers in the House generally.  I must say that I am astonished by some of the reactions of some speakers whose basic line has been to imply that this has never been done before, therefore we should not do it here.  This is the ultimate argument of conservatism, that because something has not been done before or because the mechanism which is proposed for doing something is not absolutely perfect, then we should do nothing at all.  If we were to wait until everybody else had shown us the road to follow and until we had evolved a perfect mechanism for doing what we wanted to do, we would be waiting for ever, and in relation to the control of the price of building land we would be waiting forever and a day.</P>
    <P>The main reason that we put forward this Bill is of course, because of the land price element in the cost of new houses and the degree to which this makes housing less and less accessible to the vast mass of our people.  According to the replies to a couple of parliamentary questions which I have put down and which I have recently analysed, the cost of housing in general has been rising spectacularly over the past few years. There is one very realistic way in which we can measure the cost of housing and that is to ask how long does somebody have to work to pay for the cost of an average mortgage.  In 1977 a person on average wages, buying a house of average price, with, say, two children and a wife who did not work outside the home, had to work for approximately 15½ hours every week to meet the cost of his building society mortgage.  In 1980, if that man were to go onto the housing market, again with his average wage, buy a house of average price with a loan from a building society, he would have to work for over 22 hours to meet the <Col N="358" /> weekly cost of his mortgage repayment. In 1980, to put it another way, at a time when one would hope that we had achieved a 40 hour working week, we have a situation in which the average worker has to devote more than half of his wage-earning capacity simply to put a roof over his head.  It cannot be denied that the increase in the cost of building land has been a major contributory factor to the increase in the cost of housing and the real increase in the cost of housing for young people, and young workers in particular, over the last few years. That is one of the main reasons why we are advancing this measure.</P>
    <P>Another reason why we are advancing this proposal is because the increase that comes in the value of land is almost always an increase which is created, either directly or indirectly, by the community. It is created indirectly in situations in which the physical growth of the community brings into the development zone lands which were previously used only for agricultural purposes.  It happens directly when the local authority, using public money, lays on services to make it possible for certain lands to be developed, particularly for housing.</P>
    <P>Another reason why we are advancing this Bill is because it would give local authorities powers that they do not have in sufficient degree at the moment to plan not just for housing but for all other ancillary developments like school recreational facilities and other aspects of development which are supposed to be built and provided alongside the new houses as they are being built but only too often are not provided until years afterwards, if, indeed, in some cases, they are provided at all.</P>
    <P>Yet another reason is that we believe that the principle of interference or intervention by the State in the capital gains area has long been accepted by successive Governments in this country. That principle has been watered down by the present administration almost to the point of non-existence but it is still there.  We believe it should be applied, above all, to dealings in land.</P>
    <P>There is one particular problem to which I should like to draw the attention <Col N="359" /> of the House, that is, that recent court decision affecting development land has set every local authority in Ireland by the ears because they have implied that if land in any area could be serviced &mdash; whether or not it has actually been serviced &mdash; a developer may apply for compensation out of the public purse to any local authority who refuse him planning permission to build on it.  If the logic of that decision is followed through not only would developers and would be developers be permitted to make enormous fortunes but even the zoning regulations and laws, which are amongst the few real controls local authorities still exercise, would have been rendered almost meaningless.</P>
    <P>In relation to the options which can be discussed in terms of controlling the price of building land there are two main ones about which I should like to talk. The first one is the one in the Bill.  I do not propose to go into that in too much detail because it has been very amply explained by Deputy Quinn and indeed commented on rather acrimoniously from the Government side of the House in particular.  Basically it is a mechanism which allows a local authority to zone land and to acquire it at a certain price related to the pre-existing use of that land plus a figure for compensation.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative mechanism I should like to bring to the attention of the House and which in my view is also a reasonable one.  It is that adopted by the Government of the State of South Australia in the early seventies.  At that time South Australia created a commission who were empowered to control the price of urban land.  The control mechanism they put into that legislation &mdash; which is No. 64 of 1973 of the South Australian Parliament&mdash;was that the consent of the Land Commission was needed before any land could be sold by one person to another.  The Land Commission could refuse that consent if the basis of that sale was such as to create a speculative gain.  The key provision of the Act indicated that the commission's permission for the sale <Col N="360" /> would not have to be sought as long as the consideration being paid for the land amounted to no more than the original purchase price plus costs and fees and a sum equivalent to the interest rate which the seller would have had to pay over the period of his ownership on the original purchase price plus fees and other expenses. In other words the commission said, &ldquo;If you sell your land for what you bought it plus your legal fees and overdraft interest charges we will not interfere but, if you are going to try to make a speculative gain out of it, it will need our consent and we can stop the sale&rdquo;.  As a result of that Act the land authority in South Australia are very active in the whole urban development land market. They buy land on the open market and sell land also on the open market to the State agencies which provide houses and to private builders as well.  They are enabled so to do because the legislation has the effect of controlling the price of building land.  The legislation lays it down effectively that anybody can sell his land for whatever he likes but anybody who buys it from him does so under notice that he may not sell it to anybody else for more than what he paid for it plus a reasonable figure for inflation and interest charges.  That is a sort of rolling provision for compensation which ensures that people who buy and sell land are allowed protect themselves against inflation but not to make speculative gains.  That is another mechanism that might be considered in relation to the Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the arguments which have been made against this Bill.  It was said by one speaker that this Bill would make farmers into public benefactors.  We have not so many public benefactors that we can afford to rely on their generosity for housing land. What is involved here is not a question of benefaction.  It is a question of justice. If it is just and important that a fair supply of building and development land should be available to local authorities, and indeed to private builders as well through the local authorities, at a reasonable price, then what we are talking <Col N="361" /> about is not charity but justice.</P>
    <P>It was argued that the mechanism we have written into this Bill is unconstitutional and that the Bill, as a whole, is unconstitutional.  With all due respect, allegations of unconstitutionality are not worth breath because the ultimate decision on the constitutionality or otherwise of a Bill is not made in this House.  It is made in the courts of the land.  Any Government in this State have, within the terms of the Constitution, and within the terms of the Constitution's praise for the concept of the common good, the right to draft and enact this kind of legislation because the definition of the common good, in the first instance, is a political one to be made by the Government in power.  Only in the second instance and only if challenged is it a matter for definition by the courts.  We believe that the duty of the Government &mdash; and this is why we introduced this Bill &mdash; is to exercise political will in controlling the price of building land and let it go to the courts if any aggrieved party wants to take it to the courts thereafter.  This Government, and any Government, would be failing in their responsibility if they did not at least make the case for a definition of common good that includes adequate control of the price of building land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews was very critical of the Bill in several regards and spoke at considerable length about free enterprise, the process of the market place and so on.  We must contrast what he said with the facts of the matter.  And the facts of the matter are that, for a considerable length of time when Deputy Andrews was a member of Dublin County Council, few, if any, houses were built by that local authority in the local authority area which he and I represent in this House.</P>
    <P>On a recent occasion Deputy Andrews acted at the opening of an estate of new houses costing about £43,000 or £44,000 each.  There is a limit to the degree to which we can accept statements of concern about the cost of housing and the provision of housing from people with track records like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy <Col N="362" /> suggesting that people should not be entitled to purchase houses at prices like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting anything of the sort.  I am making the basic point that concern for the controlling the cost of housing is best shown in ways other than the way in which Deputy Andrews publicly identified himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into an argument with Deputy Andrews. There are few sections of the community who could afford to buy houses in the estate Deputy Andrews opened.  I would not be happy to open an estate of that kind.  Deputy Andrews spoke about confiscation, about dispossession, about minimum compensation and the lack of adequate compensation.  Here again we must face the fact that the question of compensation is fundamentally a political consideration, and the degree to which compensation is regarded as adequate or inadequate, fair or unfair, depends on the political judgment of the person who makes such statements.  We make our statements on the adequacy of compensation from our political standpoint and Deputy Andrews does it from his.  That is his right and we will maintain our position as against his.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews spoke about the shift in the price element in house costs to the purchaser that would take place as a result of this Bill being enacted.  I implore Deputy Andrews to consider what happened to the £1,000 grant introduced by the Government and to consider whether that grant did not find itself miraculously added to the price of all houses eligible, within months of it being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews described the Bill as an attack on the fundamental process of the market place, as if nobody had ever attacked the market place before.  The prices Commission attack the fundamental process of the market place, and if we <Col N="363" /> are entitled to interfere in the free market or what is called the fundamental process of the market place in respect of so many of the essentials of life, such as the food we eat and the fuel we use to heat our houses with, why should not we interfere with the same alleged free process of the market place in the supply of one of the most precious commodities we have, the supply of building land?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that I did not interrupt him, and I have only four minutes left.  All the people can say when they see the unwillingness of Fianna Fáil to interfere in this area of the market place is that there is an obvious link between that and the traditional association of Fianna Fáil with certain powerful sectors in the building industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews spoke about alien ideologies being imposed on us.  Of course, there will not be alien ideologies imposed in this House, which will take its own decision freely, but I never thought I would live to see the day when the philosophy of Tone, of Fintan Lalor who was quoted by Deputy Quinn, would be described in this House by a Member of Fianna Fáil as an alien ideology.  Would Deputy Andrews extend that to the philosophy of Tone, Davitt, Connolly and the many other people who never were able to sit in this House but who would have been proud of the things being done in the name of the Labour Party here today?</P>
      <P>Is it alien to want to own your own house?  Is it alien to want to pay a fair price for it, and no more?  Is it alien to want to control the price of land in order to ensure the first two objectives?  Is it alien to introduce a Bill which would create the mechanism for doing these things?  If that is alien I am a Chinaman. I congratulate Deputy Quinn for the work he has done on this Bill.  I commend it to the House and I believe that whatever its fate it will be seen as a landmark in Irish Social History.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="364" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all let me assure Deputy Quinn that far from being opposed to the main objective of the Bill I am in sympathy with it in so far as it aims to tackle the problem of the high cost of building land, particularly land for housing.  If the Bill also aims at preventing speculators and individual land owners creaming off the value added to land resulting from investment in services such as water, sewerage and roads by local authorities I am indeed in sympathy with that aim.</P>
      <P>But I have very many reservations about the effectiveness of the Bill in meeting and overcoming the problems which it purports to solve.  Deputy Fitzpatrick and the Fine Gael Party apparently share these doubts.  Deputy Fitzpatrick told us that he had studied the Bill carefully, read it a number of times and discussed it with other people. But after all this he said that Fine Gael cannot and will not support this Bill.</P>
      <P>An examination of the Bill shows how it would fail to achieve the aim of its authors &mdash; if indeed the control of land prices to the satisfaction of all concerned is the aim.  Not only would the Bill fail in its objective but it would produce a situation where local authorities would be hesitant about, or even opposed to, the exercise of the powers given to them in the Bill.  And if they exercised these powers the effect would be to bring about a complete standstill in all private dealings in land in the designated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give a picture of what would happen as a consequence.  The building industry would be starved of land in the designated areas and would immediately generate pressure to have planning permissions given for development outside the designated areas.  Such pressure would in turn cause a demand for land outside the designated areas and because there would be a free market there, prices would spiral upwards.  Meanwhile in the designated areas the local authorities would be trying to overcome legal and other difficulties, not the least of which would be financial, in trying to acquire development land either by <Col N="365" /> agreement or compulsorily.  In this situation, areas which properly should be the scene of new development or renewal would be blighted, and developers would be desperately trying to buy land and obtain planning permissions outside the designated areas where local authorities do not wish development to take place because of lack of services or for some other good reason.</P>
    <P>Land prices in the free market area outside the designated areas would climb.  This would mean that the people expropriated at existing use value in the designated areas would find it very hard or even impossible to compete for land in the open market areas with the developers and speculators who would be in competition for any land that might be on the market.</P>
    <P>Thus the Bill would fail to achieve the objective of making land for development available at a reasonable price.  Not only would it have failed in this aim but it would bring about a complete stagnation in private development in the designated areas and a chaotic and artificially inflated property market in the non-designated areas.  Possibly it would end up by causing a collapse of a big section of the building industry, and the price to be paid for this disorder and instability would be met by the many dispossessed former property owners in the designated areas most of whom would not be able to afford to invest in other property in the free market area.  It does not require any stretch of the imagination to be sure that these people will have recourse to the courts to redress their grievances.</P>
    <P>By now it should be clear to the House that the problems to be solved are many and complex.  It is not just simply a matter of control of land prices, difficult as that may be.  Many important factors are linked together and problems cannot be solved by attempting to deal with just one of these factors.</P>
    <P>One of the main aspects of our economy associated with land and its availability and cost is the price of housing. Deputies on the opposite side, during the debate on this Bill have taken it <Col N="366" /> on themselves to criticise the Government in relation to the increasing cost of houses.  Last week, Deputy Fitzpatrick made a number of sweeping statements on housing.  He referred to soaring house prices constituting a serious problem, particularly for young married couples. The purchase of one's own home has generally been the most costly transaction in which one is ever likely to be involved, but when the Deputy refers to &ldquo;soaring&rdquo; house prices he conveniently ignores the facts.  When Fianna Fáil resumed office in July 1977, we discovered that the controls on new house prices, as operated by the certificate of reasonable value system which had been introduced in February 1973, again by a Fianna Fáil Government, had not been strengthened in the interim by the Coalition Government.  This was contrary to what one should have expected after a period of rapid price excalation.  Indeed the controls had been weakened by the drastic curtailment of eligibility for State new house grants by the Coalition in 1976.</P>
    <P>The Minister immediately extended the certificate of reasonable value system to all grant type new houses provided for sale and also to flats.  The effect of this and the liberalisation of the scheme of new house grants was to increase substantially the proportion of new private houses brought within the scope of house price control.  Again, let me say that when positive action by the Government was needed in August 1978 it was taken promptly against a background of house prices rising at an unacceptable rate during the first half of 1978.  Controls over building societies lending for the purchase of new houses were extended in August 1979.  Yet again in 1979, the first housing Act since 1970, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, was passed.  It provides a comprehensive statutory framework for the operation of the CRV system.  All these measures contributed to a drop in house prices in the latter half of 1979.  While prices are now increasing again the rate of increase is broadly in line with increases in earnings and costs over the past year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick also queried the extent of the reductions achieved under the certificate of reasonable value system.  In 1979 the total of all price reductions achieved by the CRV system reached almost £2 million, affecting some 2,200 houses.  The corresponding figures for the first four months of 1980 were over £1.1 million worth of reductions affecting some 530 houses.  In many other cases purchasers benefited by builders opting for fixed prices instead of price variation clauses or by builders deferring the date of operation of price variation clauses.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to houses passing out of reach of more and more people.  He may be forgetting the fact that the number of private houses completed has jumped from 16,700 in the last full year of the Coalition to 18,200 in 1977, 19,400 in 1978 and an all time record of 20,300 last year.  This substantial increase has been due in large measure to Government action in bringing SDA loan and income limits up to realistic levels on three occasions in less than three years &mdash; they had been allowed to remain unchanged between September 1973 and mid 1977 despite increases in house costs, prices and earnings during that period &mdash; and also by the introduction of a subsidy to building societies who are the largest contributors of house purchase finance.  Deputies will recall that the Coalition abolished a building society interest subsidy in 1976.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also said that many local authorities who service land sell it at a big profit.  Because of the context in which he was speaking I assume that he is referring only to building sites for private houses.  The disposal of land by local authorities is governed by the Local Authorities (Borrowing and Management) Regulations.  Generally the local authority are required to dispose of building sites for a price not less than a sum equivalent to the cost to the authority of the acquisition and development of the site, less the value of any Exchequer subsidy payable.  In practice local authorities generally sell building <Col N="368" /> sites, whether subsidisable or not, for a price that will allow them to break even on the operation.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of this Bill says that the compensation shall be the amount which the lands might be expected to realise if sold on the open market and on a date when the question of compensation is referred to.  If I went to any farmer or landowner and offered him that kind of money, I would get a four grain fork very likely.  I have been a member of a local authority for many years and I know that if a local authority wish to acquire land and cannot do so by negotiation they can issue a compulsory purchase order is confirmed by the Minister the owner of the land has the right to go to arbitration regarding the price.  Over the years it has been shown that the amount offered by local authorities has been a lot higher than the figure recommended by the arbitrator. Section 23 of this Bill does not allow for this.  The land in question might be disused or in bad condition and we must consider what the effect of this Bill will be in regard to such land.  I do not believe it would be constitutional to peg the value of the land to existing use value.  I do not wish to get into the legal field but it is my opinion that this Bill is unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>I do not believe in wasting time and money.  If the Bill is contested in court it cannot be implemented. We should examine all aspects to see if we can introduce a Bill which will stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of our way of life associated with the matter is land use planning.  Already other speakers have pointed out how, under this Bill, local elected representatives would be required to mark out the lands which would come within the designated areas.  These lands would, in all probability, be lands already zoned under our planning system for development.  A well established <Col N="369" /> and accepted concept enshrined in our planning code is that a planning authority in refusing planning permission or in revoking or modifying a planning permission already granted are restricted to considering only the proper planning and development of the area. The Bill sets this principle aside and replaces it with a new concept that a planning authority may refuse planning permission for the development of land simply on the grounds that such land is in an area designated under the Bill. Presumably the intention is that normal planning criteria such as those relating to housing density, commercial and industrial needs, amenity and other factors will no longer count in a designated area. What will matter is that the local authority will have power, under the Bill, to expropriate property owners in designated areas and compensate them on the basis of existing use value.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where planning permission is refused for the reason that the development is proposed for land in a designated area, the landowner is not entitled to compensation from the planning authority for the consequent reduction in value of that land.</P>
    <P>Also in the matter of compensation the Bill provides that in a designated area all land would be acquired by the local authority at existing use value.  It is more than likely that such acquisition would be done by compulsion rather than by way of negotiation.  The owners of the land would be compensated not by way of a price that could be obtained for that land on the open market &mdash; and remember I am speaking about land zoned for development by the local authority in their development plan &mdash; and compensation would be on the basis of what would be paid for the land if it could never be used for any purpose other than as at present.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Bill would appear to give local authorities greater powers than they have at present to acquire land banks in designated areas, but unfortunately the Bill does not tell us how and where the local authorities are to get the vast amount of money needed by them <Col N="370" /> to carry out the obligation under the Bill to acquire all land in the designated areas.  The Minister has already referred to the fact that private housing requires an average of 19,000 sites a year. Presumably the intention in the Bill is that most of these sites would be in the designated areas, otherwise the Bill would be absolutely meaningless.  Added to this, the local authorities would have to acquire all the land necessary in designated areas for industrial and commercial development and for urban renewal, as well as for their own housing and other needs such as community amenities.  The Minister has given a figure of £12 million as the cost of local authorities' land requirements for housing sites alone for one year at existing use value.  The amount needed by them for carrying out the obligations of the Bill in respect of overall land purchase for five years would be in the order of £120 million.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill proposes to give responsibility to local elected representatives to decide which lands will come within designated areas and which will not.  It may be suggested that these new proposals would in effect only be an extension of the powers and duties already conferred on elected members under planning legislation.  There is, however, a major difference between designation under this Bill and land use zoning provisions in development plans.  Designation by elected members under this Bill would automatically result in that land being acquired, most likely by compulsion, with compensation, not based on what the land is worth on the open market but on what the Bill calls &ldquo;existing use value&rdquo;.  In other words, the potential of the land is ignored.  In our way of life this would be very unpopular and I cannot see many local authorities adopting such a scheme.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many anomalies in this Bill.  I would like to mention one by way of example.  The Bill provides that local authorities shall have power to designate land and acquire such land which will be used for housing or factories within five years.  It is also <Col N="371" /> proposed to make this a reserved function. The compensation payable will be &ldquo;existing use value&rdquo;.  In formulating the Bill has any thought been given to how this power will be operated in practice? What about the householder in Sandymount who has a large garden attached to his house and who wants to erect another house on it?  What about the person who has an old Victorian house, who wants to knock it down and build two or three houses on the site.  Will he have to sell to Dublin Corporation and buy it back from the corporation, paying them their administrative and legal costs?  What value will a local authority put on a garden?  These are some of the questions that arise.  We are as anxious as any party to overcome the problems that arise in this area but it is not easy. Our party, and most Members of this House, accept that the rights of owners are far-reaching.  This has always been the case under our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday evening in this House Deputy Tully accused the Minister for the Environment of waffling and doing nothing.  The Deputy was not correct. The Minister spoke out against the Bill before the House and he pointed out the provisions he was opposing.  True, he did not go through the Bill section by section; that is not the purpose of a Second Stage debate.  The Minister concluded his remarks by telling the House that the problem was being examined but that there were still complex issues to be solved.</P>
    <P>The Minister also pointed out that any Bill proposing to deal with building land prices would have to be workable and capable of implementation by local authorities.  The necessary finance would have to be found and the Bill would have to be framed within the provisions of the Constitution and existing laws.  Anybody with doubts about the Minister's response to the Bill should read his speech.  He will see that the Minister dealt with the matter in a positive and commonsense fashion and he showed to anybody with an open mind that the Bill would be quite unworkable.  The Minister <Col N="372" /> said enough to show that if the Labour Party were in office they would not bring forward such an unrealistic and unworkable piece of legislation.  We know that their former colleagues in Government would not support such a Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not in the legal profession but I have been a member of a local authority for years.  I am as anxious as anybody to get over the problem with regard to the acquisition of land.  I have yet to see a Bill or any other practical way of acquiring land other than the method we use now.  I admit it is a slow process but it is the law of the land.  I would remind the House that the Minister said the Government are considering the matter to see if something can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me to speak I shall refer to only a few points.  It is agreed in this House that some legislation is necessary to curb the actions of speculators in this area.  I, too, have been a member of a local authority for a long time.  I know that the authority of which I am a member by carrying out water supply and sewerage schemes have made millionaires out of certain people.  Unjust profits have been put into the pockets of such people because the local authority have had to carry out necessary works. Any reasonable person must agree that speculators must not be allowed to continue to make vast profits merely because a local authority have to carry out public works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that he agreed with controlling land prices.  He said something must be done to stop the dreadful speculation that has been taking place.  Yet, the two Ministers who have spoken have not said what they can do; they have spent their time saying what they cannot do.  The major cause for the scandalous increase in the price of housing can be traced back to the price of land.  If this House cannot exercise authority and introduce the necessary legislation it is worthless.  It is preventing ordinary, decent citizens from getting a house of their own.  Everyone knows that in the past few years the increasing cost <Col N="373" /> of houses has put them out of reach for many people.  The Ministers who spoke did not suggest what could be done to rectify the situation.  I do not think there is any dispute that urgent action is needed and I should like to have heard from the Government side what they intend doing.  Apparently they are going to oppose our Bill.  The public are entitled to know what the Government intend doing about this crying scandal in our society today.</P>
    <P>In the northern part of my county there are many examples of situations where the local authority have no real planning power.  All the local authorities throughout the country are reacting to the action of speculators.  We are saying that designated land should be acquired by the local authority so that they may produce a plan for the area that would include provision for factories, schools, community centres and playing areas. The town of Laois increased from a mere village to a town of 8,000 people and there are no facilities necessary for these people to live.  The planning authority responded only to the applications of speculators who were ready to build houses just for profit and did not care whether facilities were provided for these people.  Now there is no land available for these facilities.  This is the kind of thing we want to end in this Bill. The local authority should not be in the position where they have to react to planning applications by speculators who are out to make an easy million.</P>
    <P>The local authority has designated an area adjacent to the town of Naas on which to build a town as big as Naas but if the land is not controlled by the local authority it will be built on by individual builders and in the final analysis the local authority will have no say in the development of that area.  Recreational facilities will not be available in that new town because of people who are only interested in getting rich quick by providing houses at the highest prices and are not interested in providing recreational or other facilities.  The local authority should sell to only genuine builders and should insist on facilities being <Col N="374" /> provided.  They should insist on local authority houses being provided as a first priority.</P>
    <P>Land should be designated for local authority houses as a priority because these houses are for people who are unable to provide their own homes.  After that, the local authority should provide sites for people to build private houses and the remaining land could be given to private builders at a price which they would have to reflect in the price of the houses.  Playing facilities, community centres, churches, schools and so on should also be provided.</P>
    <P>This legislation has been needed over the past few years and it should have been introduced long ago.  From the speeches of the two Ministers I gather that they have no plans in this area as they have not put forward one constructive suggestion.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment said that one would not get away with offering the existing use value for land.  Surely the Minister is not suggesting that a person can treble the value of his land just because it is designated for building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not enough time to respond to all the points but I note from the Minister's speech that the Government are in agreement in principle with the objective of the Bill and that the Government are at present considering possible methods of achieving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke on this debate are not in agreement with the principles of this measure.  The Government speakers have consistently represented the rights of property over the rights of people.  In every instance where there was either a choice between the property <Col N="375" /> provisions of our Constitution and the human rights provisions, the Government speakers did not hesitate to put the rights of property over the rights of people. If the Labour Party are forced to make a choice between the rights of people and the rights of property they will always choose the rights of people without hesitation.  I would like to think that Fianna Fáil Deputies will say in their clinics exactly what they have been saying here to the thousands of people who cannot afford the repayments on their mortgages or cannot get on the housing queues of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that he is in agreement with the provisions of the Bill and is trying to do something with it. The Minister stated that there has been a long search for a solution.  It is like searching for the holy grail and the Government are no nearer a solution than they were seven years ago when the Kenny report was published.  I regret that Deputy O'Donoghue, who was on that committee, did not come in here to contribute on this Bill.  No Bill is prepared as was conceded by the Minister of State in reply to a question by Deputy O'Brien some time ago.  In relation to the Kenny report the Minister stated that the existing use value plus 25 per cent would probably prove inadequate and went on to say that the market value, in other words as much as one can get, is a much fairer system than the system proposed in this Bill.  The Minister is defending the present system which is guaranteed by the Fianna Fáil 1937 Constitution which gives people the right to make money out of the misery of the homeless.  The Minister in his response admits that not only does he not agree with Kenny but that the Fianna Fáil Party believe that the market system is fairer than anything we have proposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister then said that the local councillors have no role.  I agree with that but it is because Fianna Fáil have eroded their authority in so many areas. Fianna Fáil are dismissing the local <Col N="376" /> authorities in relation to their ability to decide which areas require to be developed.  The Minister said that the impact on the building industry could be chaotic.  The Minister had enough private representations from the CIF since he became Minister to know just how chaotic the building industry has been due to the non-operation of the CRV system apart from anything else.  I do not share the Minister's view but would argue it at length with him if I had the time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fox attempted to suggest that because Fine Gael saw fit to abstain on this Bill we were divided on it.  Fine Gael proposed to abstain on this measure but Deputy Moore the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach stated that it is immoral for people to make huge profits from land because it has become a scarce commodity.  I would remind the House that he is Minister of State to the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  The record shows clearly what is implied in that statement.  That is the division in that house.  They are trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  They have no proposals or amendments to make to the principle of the Bill.  They said they were in agreement with the principle of the Bill and then went on to argue about the rights of property.  They spoke in long and defensive terms on a speech written and rewritten and redelivered by the four Fianna Fáil Deputies and two Ministers of State who replied to the debate.</P>
    <P>What is the argument in favour of this Bill?  It seems to have been lost in the rush to defend the rights of property and the rights of a minority of people in the country.  We are simply saying that in the natural growth of an urban community the additional value that is created and placed on adjoining and surrounding land is created in the first instance by the community.  It belongs to the community and the community should not be placed in such a position that a private individual, by virtue of his accidental location on the edge of a town, can capture legally under the provisions of the Constitution and the <Col N="377" /> fair market system to which the Minister referred, that additional community value and sell it back to the community. That is the essence of what we are talking about.  There is no expropriation and no confiscation proposed in the Bill. There is, however, something else: the recapture of community created value which, over the years, has been hived off by accidentally located landowners and not so accidentally placed land speculators.</P>
    <P>There was an attempt by some Members to suggest that the Bill would affect the farming community in the most dramatic way.  I want the House to be clear that that is not so.  The number of farmers directly or indirectly affected by these provisions would be marginal relative to the total number of farmers in the country.  The number of agricultural holdings that would be damaged in terms of their agricultural potential would be very small as a percentage of the total farming community.  In the final analysis the safeguard in terms of democracy, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, is that it would be the local councillors in their own community who would decide on how much land they needed or wanted to acquire over a five-year period. Unlike the Fianna Fáil Party we trust the local councillors and their judgment and recognise that they face a ballot box every five years.  The bureaucrats and county and city managers do not.  We are prepared to place that trust, in the way the Minister is uniquely not prepared to do, in the hands of the local councillors and say: &ldquo;You have the powers.  Exercise them and answer for them in five years' time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The farming community will not be threatened by any of these provisions and there is in the compensating clause adequate provision to enable the replacement or removal of a farmer from affected land to another area with adequate means of compensation &mdash; in the words of the Bill, &ldquo;as the tribunal might consider just&rdquo;.  The composition of the land tribunal will be made up professionally and chaired by a High Court judge.  The attempt to suggest that somehow or <Col N="378" /> other the land of farmers would be endangered by a form of expropriation, confiscation or whatever other scandalous phrase was used by Deputies Fox and Andrews, is an attempt at a political lie.  Let us nail it in the House.</P>
    <P>The only people seriously affected, in negative terms from their point of view, would be the handful that would not fit into the seats and rooms in this building out of the population of over three million people, the few hundred people whose biggest problem when the Coalition were in power was that they might have to pay wealth tax.  They would not fill this room and they, the speculators, are the only people who might be affected. How would they be affected?  They would be getting the value of what they had and not the inflated community created value which they did not turn one sod to create.  Can the Government defend that?  Is this the republican party? Where is the famous phrase of Donogh O'Malley &mdash; if you forget the men with the open-neck shirts?  How many men with open-neck shirts will benefit from the protection of the free market system that everyone over there has consistently argued for in the House?  How many of them are homeless tonight?  How many of them are struggling and have their wives out getting additional wages to pay for mortgages because of the price of land?  How many of their children do not go to a decent school because the cost of acquiring the land cannot be met by the parish in the first place?  How many of their children do not have a decent transport system because CIE have not got out there yet?  How many of their kids are knocked down on roads because there are no decent playing fields or recreational facilities because local authorities are not getting enough money from the Departments of Education and Environment to provide them?  Yet the Government defend a handful of private, anonymous, invisible landowners in the interests of private property and the rights of the Constitution?</P>
    <P>Is this what the whole struggle of the Irish people over the years has been about?  Is this what Tone, Connolly, <Col N="379" /> Lalor, Pearse or anyone of the saints of the republican or socialist movement we so freely invoke were serious about, to give to Irish native born speculators greater security under an Irish republican Constitution than mother England ever gave them?  That is what we are building into the laws of the land if we refuse to respond to the Second Stage call for a vote on this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising the problem of reception of Radio I in west Cork and other areas along the western seaboard.  The background to the situation is that there were considerable difficulties in the past about reception from Radio Éireann in my own area and all along the seaboard.  After considerable pressure and agitation these difficulties were resolved by transmitting programmes on a VHF fréquency.  The problem has reared its head again because of the introduction of Radio 2 on VHF.  This has meant that Radio 1 has been taken off the VHF frequency. When Radio 2 was introduced, RTE decided to allocate the VHF frequency to that new channel.  The result now is that listeners in the remoter parts of the country who have been accustomed to listening to Radio Éireann &mdash; which is now Radio 1 &mdash; are in many cases unable to receive the signal on that channel. This decision was made in Dublin without either a knowledge of or any concern for rural areas.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that this is not just an issue which affects a few cranks.  In west Cork the junior chamber of commerce in Skibbereen conducted a pilot survey recently and of those surveyed they found that well over 90 per cent disagreed with the present policy of RTE in removing Radio 1 from the VHF frequency.  Even though this was not a survey of the entire population of west Cork it involved 3,700 people.  This makes it clear that there is a massive rejection of present RTE policy in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this problem in the Dáil last October and I was then told by the Minister that RTE were considering the <Col N="383" /> question of how to provide reception of Radio 1 on VHF throughout the day. But nothing happened.  The difficulties continue and there has been no change. The matter was referred to by the Minister in the debate on his Estimate on 30 May.  He acknowledged that the decision to allocate the VHF frequency to Radio 2 had drawn much criticism.  He said that from the point of view of a further VHF frequency being available there would be a delay of a least a further five years.  At that stage, therefore, he said that an early solution to the problem would have to be found within the framework of RTE's existing frequency allocation.</P>
    <P>This is the nub of the issue as it now stands.  I want to impress on the Minister and the House that for very many people their only enjoyment in life is to be able to listen to their radio.  many of these people would not have television and live in areas where there is no television reception, another problem in rural areas that I have often referred to as the &ldquo;no-channel areas&rdquo;.  Many of these people would be elderly.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say Radio 1 is available on VHF at certain times of the day but these are people who would not be able to adjust their sets frequently so as to be able to get reception even during those times when it is available on VHF. Common practice with such people would be to have their radios permanently tuned, in the past to Radio Éireann and now to Radio 1 if they could receive it.  In effect, the result now is that these people are being deprived of the radio reception to which they have grown accustomed. Therefore, I demand immediate action in this area.  I know that the Minister is from a rural area and very probably part of his own constituency would be affected by this problem &mdash; I am not too sure of the exact boundaries of his constituency.  But, as somebody from a rural area, I am sure he will appreciate that this is a very small, basic demand for those people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> I ask the Minister to ensure that there will be an immediate change in policy by RTE and that Radio 1 will be restored to VHF.  If this is not done there will be a continuing descrimination against people living in rural areas.  It is not an answer to suggest that they can receive Radio 2. The type of programme transmitted on Radio 2 is not the type of programme they have been used to or the type they wish to hear.  They have their favourite programmes which they have listened to over the years and they are unable to receive those now on any regular basis.  I demand from the Minister that there be an immediate change of policy in this regard and that Radio 1 be restored to VHF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the change of attitude of the Deputy this evening compared with that adopted today at Question Time when I thought I was rather courteous and kind in replying to him at the time.  Obviously, for some unknown reason, it was not acceptable. I would like to start my reply on the notion with which Deputy O'Keeffe finished when he demanded that the Minister ask RTE to change the situation concerning the major problem in West Cork and other rural areas around the country.</P>
      <P>A fortnight ago, when we were discussing the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, most speakers of the Deputy's party told us we had no right to demand anything from RTE, that RTE were an authority on their own and we had no right to make any demand from them &mdash; we have no right to demand anything from them; RTE are an autonomous authority independent of this House.  I am afraid I cannot demand anything from them.  If I did the allegation would be made that we were using our influence to change the situation in RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, for that reason, will understand that I have no right to demand something from them.  As I indicated in my reply today, I looked up the Official Report to find out the exact situation concerning RTE <i>vis-à-vis</i> VHF, particularly <Col N="385" /> with regard to Radio 1.  I know there has been much criticism of this decision.  We are controlled by the Geneva Conference in relation to extra allocations of VHF frequencies and it will be 1985 before we can do anything about that.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a responsibility on RTE to make certain adjustments within the system as it stands.  I would go so far as to say that not alone as a result of the Deputy's question but in response to many other representations, the Minister has courteously asked RTE to look into this problem immediately.</P>
    <P>I will bring the Deputy up to date in relation to the facts.  The problem is that RTE Radio 1 is broadcast on the Tullamore and Cork medium wave transmitters and on the Radio na Gaeltachta VHF network, when that is not being used.  RTE admit that difficulties in providing satisfactory reception on RTE 1 are being experienced in South West Cork, South Kerry and other rural area since the change in the assignment of VHF frequencies took place with the introduction of Radio 2 on 31 May 1979.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said he brought this question up in the Dáil last October.  I wish to refer him back to last July when he asked a question from my predecessor.  I should like to quote part of the reply which is relevant.  It is in Volume 315, column 1797, of the Official Report of 10 July 1979.  The Minister said to Deputy O'Keeffe:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> If the Deputy wishes to supply names and addresses of individual complainants to RTE, they will be happy to investigate their complaints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been sent on to RTE but it certainly was not sent on to us to enable us to help any way we can.  The responsibility for solving this matter rests with RTE and not with the Department or the Minister.  I want to bring this point home clearly to the Deputy.  We will use our influence in whatever way we can and I assume the party opposite will appreciate that we are using our influence for the betterment of the service in RTE 1.  I hope that in future allegations will not be made against us that we were using it for political reasons or any other reason they may deem fit to allege at the appropriate moment &mdash; that we were interfering with the RTE authorities.</P>
      <P>We are seeking the same as the Deputy is seeking.  We want to remedy the problem which, as I said, had already got the attention of the Minister who made certain suggestions to RTE.  I hope this will be appreciated by Deputy O'Keeffe.  I hope in future when he asks a question in the House that he will remember the facts and not get up on his high horse making false allegations against me and the Department about a matter over which we have no control whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus will undoubtedly incur a substantial loss on their North Atlantic service this year but the company are not at this stage in a position to predict the level of losses because of the <Col N="277" /> many unknown factors involved.  These include uncertainty about the economic climate at home and abroad, the possible effect of the international political situation on transatlantic travel, the level of aviation fuel prices and the supply position, currency fluctuations and the trends in transatlantic fares.</P>
      <P>All airlines operating on the North Atlantic have returned losses in recent years and, in the present economic and regulatory environment, the prospects of a return to profit or break-even seem very poor.  The question of measures to reduce losses are matters for Aer Lingus board and management.  I have been advised by the company that they are seeking to minimise those losses by a programme of cost reduction, schedules control with cut-backs where required to optimise use of resources together with an aggressive marketing programme.</P>
      <P>Last year the company withdrew from the Shannon-Montreal route and all routes must obviously be subject to regular review.  In the meantime the company are maximising the use of the Boeing 747 aircraft and phasing out the less economic Boeing 707.  To ensure the highest load factors and the most economic use of aircraft, they have introduced a range of highly competitive promotional fares.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus are continuing to return substantial profits from their ancillary activities, including their North American hotel operations, and the company will be seeking to maintain and increase profit levels on these activities so as to offset losses on the air transport side.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Government is that grants to the universities should be at a level which, together with income from other sources, will be sufficient to enable them to discharge their functions in a fully satisfactory manner.  In this connection discussions in relation to the circumstances of each university institution take place as appropriate with the Higher Education Authority.  The Authority in the discharge of its functions under the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, assesses the amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research at any particular time.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Land Commission in this matter is to let all lands on their hands, which are not ready for allotment, with a view to deriving revenue to meet the expenses of management.  The bulk of lettings are arranged through auctioneers and every effort is made to offer lands in lots of a size suitable to the requirements of local smallholders.  Occasionally exceptional cases may arise when a departure from the foregoing general practice is unavoidable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will make a statement clarifying the position of a person (details supplied) in Dublin, who was made redundant in January 1979, and received unemployment benefit from 29 January to the 28 March 1979 and disability benefit from 29 March 1979 to 28 March 1980, which has now ceased; if he is aware that she has been refused unemployment benefit on the grounds that she was not available for work, despite the fact that she is available for work, and that she has been informed that his Department are now seeking a repayment of £61.71 which is allegedly an excess of unemployment benefit paid to her between 7 March 1979 and the 28 March 1979; and if he will state whether she is entitled to some weekly redundancy payment in respect of the periods in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit during the period 29 January to 28 March 1979 and again on 14 April 1980.  She was paid benefit during the first period but on the second claim she was held by a deciding officer, on the basis of the evidence which she submitted, not to be available for employment. She claimed and was paid disability benefit from 3 March 1979 to 13 April 1980 from which date she was found to be capable of work by a medical referee of the Department.  She has since reclaimed and been paid disability benefit from the 16 May 1980.</P>
      <P>As she had claimed and been paid both unemployment benefit and disability benefit during the period 3 March to 28 March 1979 repayment of the amount of unemployment benefit, £61.71, for that period is due to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> As regards entitlement to redundancy weekly payments, the person concerned claimed these payments when drawing unemployment benefit but no payment was due because her social insurance benefits already exceeded 85 per cent of her previous net earnings.  She did not claim the redundancy weekly payments when she claimed disability benefit.  This aspect is now under examination and it appears that title to the payments will arise.  The exact amount due has yet to be determined but it will be in excess of the overpayment of unemployment benefit.  Arrangements have been made to have the net amount due paid to the person concerned as soon as possible.</P>
