      <P>I met a delegation from the Council for the Status of Women on 1 April.  We discussed a wide range of issues including the level of funds the council would have available to it, the facilities which it would require and its future programme of work.</P>
      <P>I assured the deputation of the importance which the Government attached to the council's work and of our wish to assist the council to the greatest extent possible having regard to the resources available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the absence of any national awards causes problems in that we tend to give directorships of State companies and peace commissioner positions as awards which are entirely inappropriate.  It might be helpful if we had some form of recognised awards and if the other positions I mentioned were given to persons who would be suitable for them.</P>

      <P>The only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration compiled for intercensal periods by relating successive population figures to data for births and deaths in the same periods.  For the intercensal period April 1971 to April 1979 this calculation yielded a net inward migration of 109,000 people.</P>
      <P>Subject to this overall figure, estimates of net migration for individual years of the period have been made using a number of relevant indicators. These estimates, for the years ending in April 1975 to April 1979, are as follows:</P>

      <P>Various sections of the Western Parkway/Southern Cross Route, for which I have allocated road grants, were included as part of Ireland's application to the European Investment Bank for loan facilities in 1979.  Loans approved on foot of this application qualify for EMS interest subsidy.  Further loans attracting EMS interest subsidies will be made available for these schemes in the coming years.  Additional sections of the route will be included in future applications for EEC aid as plans are approved and road grants are made available.

      <P>and <b>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</b><i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for the Environment if vehicular access is a requirement of the planning specification for all public and private housing schemes, either to the back door of the house or an external passageway from the front to the back of the house, to avoid having coal and similar dirty products delivered through the front door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no mandatory specifications or standards in relation to the provision of rear access to dwellings. In granting planning permission for housing it is open to planning authorities to attach such conditions where they considered it necessary to achieve a proper standard of development. Similarly, there is no statutory requirement for such access in local authority housing schemes.  It is a matter for each housing authority to decide whether it is desirable, taking into consideration the problems of security and/or vandalism that may arise to provide for separate rear access when planning new housing schemes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I accept what the Minister has said in regard to private houses, but would he not suggest as a matter of planning policy that there should be access from the rear of these houses for the purpose stated?  In regard to local authority houses does the Minister not agree that he has a control and would he ensure that in future schemes access through the rear of houses be made available for the purpose of taking in coal and other bulky or potentially dirty substances so that they would not have to be taken in through the hall door?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Deputy is making, but the experience in regard to local authorities to date has varied very much.  There have been instances when local authority tenants have requested local authorities to close up rear entrances.  It would seem a practical approach to provide rear entrances for the purposes which the Deputy has outlined but it has been left to local authorities to use their own judgment.  I agree that the practical thing to do would be as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to introduce such a requirement.  In addition to the normal requirement as to publication of notice of intention to make a planning application either in a newspaper circulating in the district or by the erection of a notice on the land or structure, article 24 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 1977 provides by way of supplemental requirements that notice of every planning application and of the date of its receipt shall be published by a planning authority by inclusion in a weekly list of which copies&mdash;(a)  shall be made available to <Col N="759" /> the members of the authority in such manner as they may by resolution direct; (b)  shall be displayed in or at the offices of the planning authority for a period of not less than four weeks in a position convenient for public inspection during normal office hours; and (c) where the planning authority by resolution so decide, may be displayed for public inspection in any other place which the planning authority consider appropriate or published in a newspaper circulating in the district or made available to any body, group or person likely to be interested.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment why he has exempted flats under construction from 1 March 1980 from the provision in part of the requirements of the certificate of reasonable value and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My decision in relation to certificates of reasonable value for flats was that the certificates would not be required for loan purposes in respect of flats which formed part of a block commenced prior to 1 March 1980.  This decision was taken following strong representations made to me on the problems which the decision to make certificates of reasonable value a requirement of loans for all new dwellings had created.  I am satisfied that builders had particular problems associated with flat projects which were either completed or under construction where some flats had been sold and others had not.  One of the main problems was the difficulty in preparing detailed submissions in relation to a part of a development and the time which would be required to prepare applications.  Lengthy delays at that stage could have serious consequences for employment in that sector of the industry. Certificates of reasonable value are, of course, still required for flats for the purpose of eligibility for the £1,000 grant and exemption from stamp duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are at present reviewing the existing legislation governing the acquisition of wayleaves for public water and sewerage schemes in the light of the relevant experience of a number of local authorities including Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  Pending the finalisation of this review, I do not wish to anticipate whether or not I will propose amending legislation in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, due to the delay in the granting of wayleave permission and to the lack of power of the Dublin Corporation to get this permission, there is likely to be a very serious water shortage in Dublin during the summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a possibility.  We are examining the matter.  The main reason for the delay with regard to wayleaves has been the fact that the local authority were not allowed to enter the lands without compensation having been agreed and paid. Another main reason was the fact that the landowner did not have to object until the local council arrived on the scene to enter the lands.  In other words, there was no time limit in regard to the objection period.  These are two very important factors which caused or tended to cause delays.  We are examining the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that this delay is due entirely to the inadequacy of the powers of local authorities?  I understand that the powers of the local authorities to acquire <Col N="771" /> wayleaves are controlled by the Public Health Act, 1878, which is now out of date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the banks the current rate, compared with 14.15 per cent for building societies, is 16½ per cent.  It already went up last June when the bank rate went up and this time it went up by .75 per cent.  The number of loans now being given by banks&mdash;longterm loans&mdash;has decreased in the last 12 months and the big percentage of those who get loans, over 40 per cent, are earning in excess of £9,000.  The average price of a house for a bank loan is around £34,000 as against the building societies average price of £23,000.

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of jobs lost as a result of the cut in finance to local authorities for special employment schemes this year, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to the environmental improvement schemes programme.  This programme since its inception in 1977 has always operated on a year to year basis and was not intended for the provision of permanent employment.  It is misleading to speak of jobs lost when these jobs are of a temporary nature dependent on suitable schemes and the requisite finance being available.</P>
      <P>The amount provided in the Vote for my Department in 1979 for the programme was £4.28 million and this was increased to £4.43 million later in the year.  The amount originally provided under the programme for the current year was £3.2 million&mdash;£1.5 million coming from the Vote for my Department and £1.7 million from the Employment Guarantee Fund.  Recently a further £600,000 has been allocated to Dublin Corporation from the Employment Guarantee Fund and an additional £50,000 has been allocated to them from the Inner City Fund.  The total allocations for schemes this year is, therefore, £3.85 million.  Information as to the overall amount of employment expected to be provided under the programme this year is not yet available from local authorities but it is evident that there will be some reduction on last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the allocation to Dublin Corporation, I may say that of the £3.2 million originally available to <Col N="776" /> me for allocation this year the sum of £680,000 was allocated to that body. This together with the special allocations from the Employment Guarantee Fund and the Inner City Fund now being made provides a total of £1.33 million under the programme in 1980 for the corporation, an increase of £52,000 on the previous year's allocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that question as to whether it will guarantee employment.  A further £52,000 was made available from the Inner City Fund to be utilised for people living in the inner city, but particular projects may not be within the inner city.  They do not have to be, but it is to continue to employ those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the nature of this work as temporary. Having seen and no doubt been made aware of the detailed reports that the Community and Environment Department have made available to his Department, would he consider that Dublin Corporation had assembled a team of very good workers who were doing essential work around the city in terms of tourism and so on?  I know that he is under budget restraints, but would he consider putting this scheme for the capital city at least on a more permanent basis so that the communication of budgetary information would be less haphazard than it has been in the past?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy with regard to the quality and importance and how worthwhile these schemes are.  At the present figures <Col N="777" /> which I have given to the Deputy the total allocation is £52,000 more than last year which by comparison with other local authority areas is a generous sum in this year.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that in the normal way there are exceptionally long delays in dealing with these orders in my Department. The procedures governing compulsory acquisition of land are designed to safeguard the interests of the persons affected, to ensure that they are dealt with fairly and, as far as possible, to avoid unnecessary hardship.  Some delay is inevitable in the case of a compulsory purchase order involving a public inquiry. Objections put forward at the inquiry have to be fully and carefully considered as well as the general purpose of the project involved before a decision on an order can be made.  I must also point out that 1979 was an abnormal year as far as the holding of public local inquiries was concerned due to such factors as the prolonged postal dispute.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a suggestion that might be helpful in the interests of the patients.  Has the Minister considered utilising the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board machinery in relation to this matter as some of the parties involved appear to be unhappy at the way in which the present talks are being conducted?  Why did the Minister not personally intervene before the weekend?  Why did the Minister allow everybody to go away and water their tomatoes, or whatever, over the weekend while patients' lives were at risk?</P>

      <P>I made an appeal on Friday, the day after the talks were adjourned. The Deputy will appreciate that the talks were adjourned by agreement so that consideration could be given to the possibilities which might be taken up when the talks would resume.  I asked that these talks would resume as early as possible.  In relation to the situation with the psychiatric nurses and the method by which the discussions are taking place, the psychiatric nurses are given, by statute, under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act, 1954, the right to direct access to the Labour Court.  It is open to them to move from conciliation to a formal hearing or investigation by <Col N="785" /> the Labour Court, so the procedures are there for any further action.  We have made it clear that we would co-operate in every way with such a step towards a formal hearing or investigation by the Labour Court.  I hope that with such a development the unions would suspend their industrial action pending the findings.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if in view of the deterioration in telephone communications with Britain and the consequent disruption and serious loss caused to Irish business and the inconvenience to the general public, he will, as a matter of urgency, take the necessary measures to rectify this problem and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to express my regret to the public for the inconvenience resulting from inability to make telephone calls to certain parts of Britain requiring the assistance of an operator in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I should explain that there has been a shortage of circuits from this country to Britain for some time.  The capacity to provide all the extra circuits needed will be available following the opening of a new trunk exchange in Dublin and the provision of a new microwave link to Britain later this year.</P>
      <P>Changes were made recently by the British Post Office in the routing through their network of calls made by telephone operating staff in this country to numbers of destinations in Britain.  As a result of these rearrangements, a substantial proportion of manually-operated telephone calls to Britain are now routed through new exchanges in Manchester and Bristol and circuits available on these routes are inadequate to carry traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> The total number of circuits available to Britain at present is being redistributed to provide more of them on the Manchester and Bristol routes.  Some of these will be available today and more tomorrow.  The bulk of the work involved in allocating more circuits to these routes has to be done by the British Post Office.  The British Post Office have been pressed to carry out the work involved as a matter of top priority, and I am assured that it is being treated by them on this basis.  They are also examining urgently whether interim relief measures suggested to them can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that I am taking every action open to me to improve the position to the maximum extent, as quickly as that can be done, and I would appeal to the operators, whose frustration in this matter I can fully appreciate, to resume immediately the handling of this traffic.  I would also appeal to the public to have some understanding of the operators' problems in this regard.  I should add that subscriber dialled trunk calls to Britain and calls via the operator to Britain routed through Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Chester, London and Liverpool exchanges are not affected. Calls from this country to Britain from centres outside Dublin can continue to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply the Deputy will have noted that the bulk of the work to restore the full routing to Britain has to be carried out by the British Post Office.  We have suggested to the British Post Office interim measures to alleviate the situation.  These are, to restore the routes to Britain through the London-Kingsway route which was available before the <Col N="788" /> changeover and also that some of the traffic which used to be routed through Chester to the various parts of England and which was transferred to Manchester exchange recently should be restored in the interim to the Chester route where we have adequate circuits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The convention provides panels of conciliators and arbitrators whose services may be called upon by investors and states.  The basic principle is that investment disputes should be settled by conciliation and arbitration but ratification of the convention by a state does not mean that that state is thereby obliged to submit any dispute with a foreign investor to arbitration. Resort to arbitration in relation to any particular matter is wholly voluntary. <Col N="810" /> However, once consent to arbitration has been given it cannot be withdrawn and a subsequent refusal by one party to co-operate will not prevent the other party from proceeding with the arbitration.</P>
      <P>Most of the provisions of the convention deal with the organisation of the International Centre and the regulation of the conciliation and arbitration proceedings, and do not need implementing legislation.  There are, however, important provisions relating to the effect of an award and the enforcement of monetary obligations imposed by an award which have to be covered in the Bill.  Article 54 provides that each contracting state shall recognise an award as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by an award as if the award were final judgment of a court in that state.  Section 16 of the Bill gives effect to this article by providing that the pecuniary obligations imposed by an award shall, by leave of the High Court, be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or order of the High Court to the same effect. Where leave is so given, judgment may be entered in for the amount due or outstanding under the award.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Article 55 the obligation to enforce an award will not derogate from the law in force in any contracting states relating to immunity of that state or of any foreign state from execution.  In theory, therefore, a state against whom an award has been given could invoke immunity from execution of an award in a country which provided such immunity and the convention provisions have been criticised because of that.  It is, of course, impossible to ensure fully that sovereign states will live up to their obligations and the convention goes as far as is practicably possible to ensure that awards are enforced.  Any refusal by a contracting state to honour an award given against it would, of course, be a breach of its obligation under the convention to treat the award as binding and this could give rise to action on the international plane by the investor's home state on behalf of the investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> While Part III of the Bill contains grounds on which enforcement of a New York Convention award can be refused, there is no provision in Part IV for refusing to enforce a Washington Convention award.  The reason for this is that the New York Convention deals with awards that can arise in any area of dispute and from different arbitration systems&mdash;some of which might have features unacceptable to others.  It is necessary, therefore, to interpose at the enforcing stage a means of ensuring that the basic requirements of justice have been complied with.  The Washington Convention, on the other hand, deals with awards of a strictly limited class.  Moreover, they can arise only from an arbitration process regulated by the convention itself which contains adequate safeguards to ensure compliance with these basic requirements. It is because of this that the convention can provide that an award is to be enforced as if it were an order of a domestic court.</P>
    <P>If any dispute arises as to the validity of an award, that matter must be taken up with the International Centre in accordance with the provisions of the convention. To cover any such case, section 17 of the Bill provides for the adjournment of an application for enforcement pending the settlement of any claim for the revision, interpretation or annulment of an award.</P>
    <P>Article 17 of the convention provides that any deficit incurred in the operations of the international centre shall be borne by the contracting states.  In fact, no such deficit has so far arisen.  The purpose of section 14 is to give authority for the payment of any contribution under Article 17 or for payment of any administrative expenses that might be incurred by the Minister for Finance.  Such administrative expenses, for example, could arise from participation in the activities of the Administrative Council of the international centre, which is representative of all contracting states, or of committees appointed by that council.</P>
    <P>The possibility of a direct charge on <Col N="812" /> public funds under Article 17 of the convention makes section 13 of the Bill necessary.  The Constitution provides in Article 29.5.2º that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement have been approved by Dáil Éireann. Since a charge to public funds will not arise under the New York Convention, a provision similar to section 13 is not required in relation to that convention.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides, in subsection (2), that the 1954 Arbitration Act shall not apply to proceedings under the Washington Convention.  However, subsection (1) (a) allows certain provisions of that Act to be applied by order of the Minister for Justice to proceedings under the convention.  An order of this nature might be made if arbitration proceedings under the convention were to take place here.  The convention provides in Chapter VII that conciliation and arbitration proceedings may be held at the seat of the International Centre, which is at Washington, or elsewhere.  Subsection (1) (b) permits the provisions of the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act, 1856, to be applied by ministerial order to proceedings under the convention.  Such an order would be made if it became necessary to take evidence in this country for the purpose of an arbitration hearing in another country.</P>
    <P>The Washington Convention has been generally regarded internationally as a worthwhile development.  It has been signed by 80 and ratified by 75 states and provision for the use of its facilities has been inserted in an increasing number of bilateral treaties dealing with investment.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the power of a court to stay proceedings in a dispute which was the subject of an arbitration agreement.  Paragraph 3 of Article II of the New York Convention requires a court, at the request of one of the parties, to stay the proceedings and refer the matter to arbitration unless the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.  There is a somewhat similar requirement in the <Col N="813" /> 1923 Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses to which effect was given by section 12 (2) of the Arbitration Act 1954.  Articles 26 of the Washington Convention provides that consent to arbitration shall exclude any other remedy unless otherwise stated.  Part II gives effect to the provisions of both conventions in this regard by requiring a court to stay the proceedings except in the circumstances set out in section 5.</P>
    <P>The scope of Part II is not, however, confined to foreign arbitration agreements. It applies to domestic agreements as well.  At present a court has a discretion under section 12 (1) of the 1954 Act on whether to stay proceedings in a dispute covered by a domestic arbitration agreement whereas in the case of a foreign agreement section 12 (2) of the same Act obliges the court, except in certain circumstances, to stay the proceedings.  Domestic arbitration agreements are therefore being assimilated to foreign agreements in this regard.  I think it is desirable in principle that parties should be held to their agreement.  Of course any party to arbitration proceedings here is entitled to require the arbitrator to state a case on a question of law for the decision of the High Court.  This right is not affected by section 5.</P>
    <P>This is, I think, a non-controversial Bill which will, I hope, commend itself to Deputies on all sides of the House. Because of its technical nature it is, perhaps, more a Committee Stage Bill but if there are any particular aspects on which Deputies would like clarification, I shall endeavour to deal with those aspects in the course of my reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this Bill is largely technical and is, therefore, a Committee Stage Bill but there are certain elements and certain underlying philosophies relevant to the Bill which need attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has as its objective the ratification in this country of two international conventions dealing with arbitration. With dozens of other countries we are co-signatories to those two conventions. <Col N="814" /> One gets the growing impression that a significant amount of our legislation and of our legislative reform is engendered not necessarily so much by what one might call domestic origination as by either pressure from outside or a value system reflected in a set of laws emanating from outside the country or indeed from what I consider to be the weakening ability of our parliament to respond to the need for legislative reform.</P>
    <P>The two conventions concerned were signed some years ago and we are now only enabling them to be ratified here. One of the lessons to be drawn from the evidence that we find increasingly around us is that the whole area of law reform is largely being taken up from outside the House, either through our courts, through the European courts or by way of conventions such as the two in question.  This is a matter to which I should like the Minister to refer when he is concluding.  There is an important point here because this change means that there are major implications, not only for Irish law but also in terms of constitutional matters.  One might ask, for example, to what extent the type of conventions referred to insinuate into our legislation a set of values or an attitude to life which is not necessarily Irish?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we do not have anything to learn from the reactions of outside bodies or organisations or from other cultures or civilisations but in recent times we have had to witness&mdash;and to some extent regrettably&mdash;the reality that either our own courts have told us we must change the law in some areas or that we have been told by the European courts that we must do so.  In some cases we have had to change our law on foot of conventions to which in some cases we have subscribed readily but to which in other cases we have been reluctant subscribers. This means that our Constitution is being rewritten constantly and that we have a body of law resulting from that, and often belatedly, which is changing but not necessarily within our <Col N="815" /> control.  I have certain anxieties about that.  It reflects badly on our own ability to say that we need to change the law in some area and we are seen to be reacting to events that we are either unwilling to face up to or are not in control of.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a basic question which this convention helps us to underscore and that is the degree to which we are masters of our own legislative destiny.  The Bill, in so far as it embodies in this case a relatively non-controversial set of proposals in relation to arbitration, which is a sensible procedure in itself, is not in any way essentially disagreeable to anybody in the House though there are points of difference in relation to the technical aspects of it.  This basic question centres around the degree to which we are being forced increasingly to react to legislative reforms emanating outside the House, usually by non-legislators, by people who do not have a mandate to do that.  I do not wish to decry that in any way.  It is good that we have the courts and also the European courts to tell us where there must be reform.  In that way there is protection for the citizens when in certain regards we are not able to protect them.</P>
    <P>An international convention provides us with a framework in which we can view in a new way the challenge in that convention.  In recent times we have had about half a dozen cases such as the Airey case and the adoption referendum, whereby we were told either by the supreme court or by the European courts that we were not doing our job as it should be done and that, therefore, our law would have to be changed.  This would mean rewriting our Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are serious implications there which we will not go into in very great detail in the context of this Bill.  The same is true of all international conventions to which we are normally very minor contributors, in some cases dragged in perhaps reluctantly in the context of being participants or contributors to agreements made at United <Col N="816" /> Nations or European level.  I wonder what effect this is having on Irish law, Irish attitudes to international and domestic issues and legislation and to what extent it is eroding the primary responsibility of this Parliament to legislate.  In my view, we are ceding to some degree our power and responsibility&mdash;I stress responsibility&mdash;in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this Bill offends massively in that respect but it is appropriate that one should say it is regrettable that we have to be bludgeoned into changing legislation. Fortunately we have the Judiciary and the European and international structures which tell us that what we are doing in our country is not in line with right standards and values and that we should change.  I wish we had the courage and wisdom to do this ourselves.  If we did we would have to be less reliant on being literally reactionary and more innovatory and law reformist.  All laws need to be reformed regularly because they become out of date not long after they are written.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which deals with two international conventions, the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and the Washington Convention, pose a number of questions.  In my opinion arbitration is a sensible approach.  If we can evolve a framework and create a structure whereby people can thrash out their agreements by a process of arbitration, then it is to the good.  The Minister might be good enough to tell me why there has been a delay in the ratification of these conventions.</P>
    <P>We should have a closer look at section 5 which bears on section 12 of the 1954 Act.  The new Bill appears to circumscribe the more generous provisions in section 12 (1) of the Arbitration Act, 1954, which reads:</P>
    <P>If any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming through or under him commences any proceedings in any court against any other party to the agreement or any person claiming through or under him <Col N="817" /> in respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any party to such proceedings may, at any time after appearance and before delivering any pleadings or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings, and that court, if it is satisfied that there is not sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was, at the time when the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, may make an order staying the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the new Bill refers to the staying of court proceedings where party proves arbitration agreement and is almost the same as section 12 of the 1954 Act, but I wonder why there are some differences.  Section 5 reads:</P>
    <P>If any party to an arbitration agreement, or any person claiming through or under him, commences any legal proceedings....</P>
    <P>I find the use of the word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; mysterious because the full phrase is &ldquo;commences any legal proceedings in any court against any other party to such agreement&rdquo;, which is identical with section 12 of the 1954 Arbitration Act.  I do not understand why the word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; was used, because I am not aware of what other proceedings one can introduce in a court.  That small point might be cleared up on Committee Stage.  The section reads on:</P>
    <P>...in any court against any other party to such agreement, or any person claiming through or under him, in respect of any matter agreed to be referred to arbitration, any party to the proceedings may at any time after an appearance has been entered, and before delivering any pleadings...</P>
    <P>Why are there differences in the two pieces of legislation?  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to compare the differences and see if section 5 <Col N="818" /> of the Bill is more restrictive, because it seems to deem relevant only matters agreed to be referred to arbitration. There are a number of minor differences and distinctions I would like the Minister to look at and tell me why the changes were made in that section.</P>
    <P>It appears there might be a weakening of the powers of the courts arising from this and some minor sections of this Bill. I would like to ensure that the courts, which have done and continue to do a great service to this country, particularly in the area of what might be called an inert approach to law reform on occasions, would not be restricted in their powers arising from the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The domestic implications of legislation of largely international origin have never been the subject of serious consideration. In view of the global village&mdash;to use a sociological expression&mdash; in which we live, would it be worth considering what effect the implementation of this convention and other legislation&mdash;which in some cases is almost foisted on us, and certainly insisted upon by agencies, governments or structures outside this country&mdash;would have on our way of life which is vulnerable in some respects, although I think we have a great deal to gain in any such transaction.</P>
    <P>Section 8 reads:</P>
    <P>Any person who seeks to enforce an award shall produce&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the duly authenticated original award or a duly certified copy of that award,...</P>
    <P>What does evidence of a &ldquo;duly authenticated original award&rdquo; mean?  In the context of the principle of private international law, how does one authenticate an original award?  What criteria are acceptable for such an authentication? There is room for confusion here.  We should be very clear what we mean when we say certain authentication is acceptable but others might not be.</P>
    <P>Section 9 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Enforcement of any award shall not be refused otherwise than pursuant <Col N="819" /> to the subsequent provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>We are then given a list, which needs to be scrutinised but need not be discussed in detail at this stage.  In other words, it seems that unless a case comes under a heading outlined in this section it cannot be refused.  There may be some good and valid reasons for this other than those set out in section 9.  It seems that we run the risk of throwing out a lot of case law built up over the years because it will be out of bounds on the basis of this section. I should like to know the reason for limiting the power in section 9.  Why limit the jurisdiction of courts which are our fundamental weapon when it comes to the question of instilling justice into all our systems and permeating all our laws with justice?  There is a big distinction because I often feel that it is not more law we need but more justice in the laws we have.  Why circumscribe and inhibit the prospects of a court being able to act in those areas?  Why lose out on the great benefit and expertise we have built up over decades, perhaps centuries, by a volume of case work to which lawyers regularly refer?  Section 5 omits the words &ldquo;ready, willing and able&rdquo; which are contained in the earlier Act.  Will the Minister explain his thinking for the change in that section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Those two sections are the core of my concern and I have a slight apprehension about them.  Public policy dictates that a person is entitled to seek the aid of a court but this section seeks to limit that right by detailing exceptions to arbitration.  The old section gave the court more discretion.  For example, the old section mentioned &ldquo;sufficient reason&rdquo;.  We should guard against a person using the arbitration clause in the Bill to escape a responsibility, to be able to say that if he goes to court the likelihood is that he will come out worse but he opts for arbitration because of the <Col N="820" /> de-limiting of the Bill under which he has an option which might benefit him.  The potential is there in the arbitration clause to stop another party obtaining his legal rights.  A court can and should be able to force such a person into court but the new provisions reduce the powers of courts to stop a defendant misusing the arbitration clause.  For example, delaying tactics may be adopted.  A person may refuse or fail to agree on arbitration. There may be differences on details of various elements within arbitration, methods by which justice could be delayed indefinitely.  That is added to by the understandably fairly unwieldy intercourse which has to take place between agencies here and in other countries and the various third party agencies which, in the event of a dispute, come into play. There are great grounds for delaying and putting off the day of justice if we are not careful.  In a Bill which was designed to expedite the dealings of various arbitration discussions and procedures we do not wish to introduce a measure which gives people the ability to escape justice.  What we all want and crave for surely is a system to deal more rapidly with such procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can envisage, for example, a failure to agree on a date and other shenanigans that lawyers are familiar with when dealing with defendants. Courts have built up a series of precedents under &ldquo;sufficient reason&rdquo; and &ldquo;ready, willing and able&rdquo; in the previous Act.  Those case laws are directed towards ensuring that justice is achieved between the parties.  Public policy should dictate that justice is seen to be done and I am not so sure that the Bill does this.  It is hard to be definite about that until one sees the provisions of the Bill in action. Accordingly, the Minister should endeavour to embody in the Bill some system of self-monitoring or self-regulation. I do not know why we do not adopt that system more widely.  We get very little chance to discuss any measures and once a provision is on the Statute Book it is almost impossible to change it.  A change takes a major debate, a major provocation and a major lobby.  In Bills like this we should be <Col N="821" /> able, by ministerial order, or by the introduction of a repealing Bill, to make changes if certain provisions do not operate satisfactorily.  I do not know if it is possible to build into a Bill such a system of automatic recall after a period of time to permit an assessment of how it worked and give an opportunity to change it, but such an approach is worth considering.</P>
    <P>Arbitration has its merits which include relative speed, informality and the fairly intimate handling of matters that do not necessarily need a public court system.  However, we must ensure and copperfasten the guarantee to two people on both sides of arbitration hearings that the courts have the power over the proceedings and have the basic responsibility, subject to the Minister for Justice, to ensure that in the event of the proceedings not working out the parties involved will not evade their responsibility. The courts, if necessary, should have the same power they always had to intervene.  I do not understand from what quarter the call came to reduce the powers of our courts under section 4 of the 1954 Act.  I do not believe there was any public demand for it and it is my view that most people are concerned about any suggestion of restricting the power of our courts in this regard.  The Minister should think again about this. This amending section will inevitably strengthen the hands of the strong as opposed to the weak.  Those who will benefit most will be people who will be able to use the weight and the power, financially and otherwise, to make the maximum gain from the arbitration procedure while knowing at the same time that the powers of courts are slightly limited relative to the previous Act. My approach would have been in the contrary direction.</P>
    <P>Unless the defendant is brought within the stated exceptions the amending section may otherwise hold up the arbitration hearing or frustrate it.  The old section gave courts wider power to ensure justice was not frustrated.  I should like to know if consideration was given to the constitutional provision that justice <Col N="822" /> should be administered in courts of law. We do not want a situation such as that which arose in the context of the debate on the adoption issue where doubts about the legality of adoption orders led us to a referendum to clear those doubts. Is there a degree to which the arbitration proceedings and decisions could have constitutional implications?  If the arbitration procedure is interpreted as being a system of dispensing justice that system is enshrined in the Constitution as being in the hands of the courts.  We do not want, even by inference, to imply that that is diluted or subtracted from. Will the Minister tell the House if there is a possibility that such a situation whereby the inference of arbitration is about dispensing justice could weaken the fabric of the court or dilute its power?</P>
    <P>I can see the amending section being availed of by unscrupulous people, usually with economic weight and the power, as it were, to grind their adversaries into the dust, to outstay them, outlast them, out-manoeuvre them, out-buy them in terms of legal weight behind them and so on.  There is a difficulty there that needs to be cleared up.  It is a very fundamental difficulty relating to the more than hint, the strong suggestion, that the change from the 1954 Act to the relevant or comparable section of this Bill has as its net result the weakening of the power of the courts.  That would seem to strike right at the heart of our justice system, would not be to our advantage but indeed would be most unhealthy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to tell us the implications of acceptance of this Bill and the two conventions involved, the New York and Washington Conventions, in regard to our relations with Northern Ireland, whether or not international dealings would be affected and, if so, how, whether or not the situation there is that an analagous Act has already been implemented and what is the impact in that regard.  Are there any specific cases in progress at present that would be affected by this Bill?  If so, is there another legal problem here?  If cases have been <Col N="823" /> embarked on on the understanding that a position obtains&mdash;as it does now in the absence of this Bill&mdash;and if, in the meantime, the legislation is enacted will it apply to these cases?  If so to what extent will the parties involved have a claim that they entered into the proceedings on a very different understanding which has now been changed?</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister spoke about the 56 countries that have ratified the New York Convention and said:</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we should undertake to enforce only awards arising in a country which, in its turn, will enforce Irish awards.</P>
    <P>The enforcing agency and the manner in which that is handled and structured is of interest here.  There are some countries that are co-signatories to these conventions, others that are likely to become such co-signatories where the standards operating, the procedures and structures of justice, the administration of the courts, even the system of government, to put it mildly, may be somewhat different from what we would consider normal or even democratic.  Therefore how will we deal with such a problem? We have a real difficulty here, which is that we have never worked out, as it were, a basic human rights policy in relation to such countries.  For example, how are we to evaluate the enforcement or non-enforcement of these conventions by some other countries whose basic value systems, the very standards of democracy they apply are profoundly different?  In some cases we would consider them to be profoundly wrong, dehumanising and degrading; in other cases they may be just different.</P>
    <P>Is there a difficulty here about not accepting decisions reached in that environment, in that context, and how will we handle that problem?  It seems to me that, in the whole field of international relations, we have a growing difficulty because of the vacuum which exists here in relation to a fully worked out or fully-flushed policy on human rights basically <Col N="824" /> and on the various political and economic attitudes arising therefrom. We have seen evidence of difficulties recently when we have had confusion relating to our political response on major international issues which has left us unhealthily divided as a country because we have never sat down and asked: &ldquo;What do we do about this kind of situation?  What do we work out as criteria for action when there is a denial of human rights internationally?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of a duly authenticated award, or a certified copy of the original arbitration agreement.  I should like to know what are the criteria for acceptance of such.  The Minister referred also to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, and said:</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Convention is to promote the flow of private investment into underdeveloped countries by providing a means of resolving disputes between foreign investors and the countries in which they have invested.</P>
    <P>I have some anxieties about this because the pattern and tradition of activity in this area have been, I think, unhelpful to very many of these underdeveloped countries.  I wonder to what extent&mdash;and this goes back to my basic question about the manner in which law not of our origination is being foisted on us&mdash;is this section being insisted on, or being pressured by what we might call major entrepreneurial agencies whose concern would not be the same as that of the Minister or mine, namely, the welfare of the people of a particular underdeveloped country but rather much more commercial or pragmatic concerns. Basically this convention is about settlement of investment disputes.  In so far as we can influence such matters I should like to be quite certain that it is designed to protect the welfare of people rather than the profits of multi-national companies or agencies of that nature, not that I have any hostility in that direction.  Our concern should be to spend most of our time in the parliamentary <Col N="825" /> system devoted to the welfare of people rather than of commercial enterprises.  I appreciate, as the Minister says:</P>
    <P>It represents the culmination of efforts over previous decades to promote investment in countries needing it and at the same time to ensure protection of such investment. One of the problems was the absence of an international facility specifically designed to resolve disputes between private investors and sovereign States.</P>
    <P>This is where the structure of the arbitration is very important.  A lot of this investment&mdash;and probably the reason for disputes over it&mdash;would arise out of mixed feelings about what the investment should be for, how it should be used and so on.  For example, there has been the experience of the green revolution in undeveloped countries.  Here I can visualise a situation in which a body of commercial attitude would say that investment was necessary in a certain regard, should be orientated in a certain direction and certain conditions laid down for it which are not dictated, even to a small degree, by the people in respect of whose country we were speaking about.  There has been massive exploitation of such countries by what we might loosely term the western section of the northern hemisphere.  I should like assurance that this convention about which we are talking and our contributory support would not be designed to augment such massive exploitation over the years which has deprived people of so much in order to give advantage to, relatively speaking in global terms, the small few.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate the Minister commenting on the basic points about the question of the courts and the degree to which we are increasingly becoming diminished in our status as legislators, having to oblige pressures from outside or from other agencies by unwillingness to be innovative in that area.  That is a trend that should be reversed and it is timely to refer to it in the context of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy <Col N="826" /> Keating for his comments.  I shall endeavour to comment in so far as I can on the various points raised.</P>
      <P>The first point that the Deputy asked a question on was the fact that the conventions had not been ratified.  For the Deputy's information and for the information of the House, Ireland signed the Washington Convention on 30 August 1966 and did not sign the New York Convention, which was open for signature until 31 December 1958. Subsequent to the signature of the Washington Convention it was agreed that the Department of Justice would include provisions to implement the convention in the then proposed Arbitration Bill to give effect to the Council of Europe Convention on Uniform Law on Arbitration and the New York Convention as soon as pressure of more urgent legislation permitted.  Pressure of other work prevented the proposed Bill being proceeded with and after Ireland became a member of the EEC it was decided to proceed with the ratification of the New York Convention, because of the provisions of Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome, when the negotiations of the EEC Judgments Convention were completed. The opportunity was taken to include also the necessary provisions to implement the Washington Convention.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that there is a tendency to assimilate other values from other countries into our society through the legislative process.  This Bill is not a law reform Bill.  It is intended to introduce legislation that will deal with the enforcement of foreign awards against people living here and provides for us a reciprocal or corresponding right for our own citizens and people in other countries.</P>
      <P>In relation to the monitoring of the courts and the reduction of the power of the courts, it is expected that under the convention there will be very few cases.</P>

      <P>I will take some other points raised and then I will deal with the sections as referred to.  The Deputy had a specific interest in the question of Northern Ireland.  I understand that the UK has ratified both conventions and that the provisions of the conventions apply in Northern Ireland as they apply here, so that point is covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I want to ask a question.  On the question of the apparent reduction or inhibition of power of the courts, could the Minister develop that, not necessarily today if he has not got the information immediately available?  What is the basic reason for the relative reduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the use of the word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; in section 5.  In that regard, if Deputy Keating would allow any questions on the textual differences to be examined between now and the Committee Stage, it would give us an oportunity to deal with this in more depth.  In relation to section 5, it is desirable that the party who has formally agreed to refer disputes to arbitration should not be able to go behind the agreement if the agreement is valid and capable of being performed. This is recognised in the Geneva Convention, in the New York Convention and in the Washington Convention. It is equally desirable in relation to domestic agreements that the change is not very great and it is also to be expected that, under the existing section 12 (1) of the 1954 Act, a court faced with a party who has instituted proceedings in breach of arbitration agreement made by him would invariably proceed on the basis that the party should be held to his agreement and that the proceedings should be stayed if the agreement was a valid agreement and capable of being performed.  The purpose of section 5 is twofold in so far as (a) it is to give effect <Col N="828" /> to both conventions by requiring courts to stay proceedings instituted in a matter in which the parties had agreed to refer to arbitration and, (b) to bring the existing provisions of our law dealing with the staying of proceedings in matters subject to domestic arbitration agreements into line with provisions in relation to foreign agreements.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 8, there was mention of a &ldquo;duly authenticated original award&rdquo;.  The question of how an award should be authenticated would be a matter for the court to decide and to be satisfied about.  Eventually there may be rules of court or rules brought about by the court to deal with that aspect. Grounds for refusal of enforcement under section 9 reproduces the conditions under which enforcement may be refused under the convention.  The reasons are largely similar to the reasons for refusal of enforcement under the 1954 Act and we could not ratify the New York Convention unless we inserted the grounds of refusal in section 9.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a useful measure even though its provisions may not be invoked to any great extent here, and it is true to say that foreign arbitration awards rarely, if ever, come before our courts for enforcement.  Be that as it may, foreign businessmen contemplating contracts with Irish interests will be anxious to know whether arbitration awards given against the Irish party will be enforceable here.  Ratification of the New York Convention will guarantee enforcement under internationally accepted rules.  For any Irish interests here who may enter into investment contracts with foreign Governments or foreign State <Col N="829" /> agencies ratification of the Washington Convention will open up the possibility of having any disputes arising resolved by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.  Further, since Ireland is a member of the World Bank, it is appropriate and desirable that we should ratify the Washington Convention, which was sponsored by that body; and, as I have already mentioned, ratification of the New York Convention will enable Ireland to comply with obligations imposed under Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome.  It is also true to say that when we negotiate at international conventions we cannot dictate the final form they may take.  There are inevitably compromises between the widely differing points of view and we have to accept these compromises just as they do in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 42 of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977, provided that 60 per cent of the membership of each county committee of agriculture would comprise county councillors, the remaining members being appointed on the basis of nominations by voluntary rural organisations, to be designated by the Minister for Agriculture.  It was subsequently found, however that section 42 would be unworkable for the reasons already explained to this House during the passage of An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta Act.  The main difficulty was that the lack of advance knowledge of the total number of members on a committee of agriculture&mdash;it could vary between three and four times the number of county electoral areas&mdash;made it impossible to specify in advance how many would be chosen by the voluntary rural <Col N="830" /> organisations.  Accordingly, it was necessary to amend the 1977 Act.  This was done by section 26 of the 1979 Act which determines precisely that the number of members of a committee of agriculture will be four times the number of county electoral areas.  This Act became law on 22 May 1979.</P>
    <P>Because of the late date on which this Act was passed and the then current postal strike, there was not sufficient time to enable implementation of section 26 of that Act before the new county committees were appointed following the local elections of 7 June 1979.  The county committees of agriculture had, therefore, to be appointed in accordance with the old provisions of the Agriculture Act, 1931.  These newly appointed committees would in the normal course continue in existence until the next local elections and in the meantime the intentions of the 1979 Act in regard to representation by local organisations would not be brought into effect.  To rectify this the Minister for Agriculture announced on 15 June that the Government had decided to have amending legislation prepared to provide for the revision of the composition of county committees of agriculture to conform to the requirements of the 1977 and 1979 Acts and that county councils in appointing the new committees in June 1979 would be doing so in the knowledge that once this Bill were enacted the committees would have to be replaced by committees containing the appropriate representation of local organisations.</P>
    <P>With the inception of An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta and as this new body takes over responsibility for agricultural advisory and training services, the functions and orientation of committees of agriculture inevitably will take on a different emphasis.  Committees will retain responsibility for operating livestock improvement and other schemes for the assistance of farmers, but they will now be given the function of drawing up the annual advisory and training programme they consider necessary to meet the needs of <Col N="831" /> the county.  A further task of committees will be to ensure that the new national service is responsive to the needs of the agricultural community at local level.  It is entirely appropriate in this context of altered county committee functions that the membership of committees should be broadened by the inclusion, as originally intended under the 1979 Act, of representatives nominated directly by the local rural organisations in each county.</P>
    <P>Clearly we should not wait a further four-and-a-half years to bring this provision into effect.  I am, therefore, putting before the House this new Bill which provides for early reconstitution of committees of agriculture in accordance with the 60 per cent-40 per cent formula in the 1977 and 1979 Acts.  Specifically the Bill will provide for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the termination of the term of office of existing members of committees of agriculture and</P>
    <P>(2)  the appointment of new committees, the members of which will hold office until after the next local elections.</P>
    <P>These changes in each county would take place on the occasion of the first ordinary meeting of the county council after a date to be designated by me following the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the provisions of this new Bill, which should have been brought before the House at least two years ago.  The Government should be ashamed of the delay in its introduction. Under the National Coalition Government, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, introduced an exceptionally good Bill into which there was considerable input from many interested people.  When the Fianna Fáil Government took office in 1977, Deputy Gibbons, then Minister for Agriculture, scrapped that Bill and it has taken three years to bring this new Bill before the House.

      <P>He is out on the wing. The long delay in the introduction of this Bill has added further to the lack of confidence which has existed for some time in the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>The committees of agriculture play a very important role, a role which cannot be overstressed, and their work in the development of agriculture will never be fully appreciated.  I include both members of councils and non-members. The country owes a debt of gratitude to these people for their dedication and hard work.  The majority of outside people were elected mostly by political parties but through the years good men have been picked and they can feel proud of their contribution to agriculture.</P>
      <P>This Bill tidies up legislation and brings about a change in the composition of committees of agriculture.  I sincerely hope that the committees will not become rubber stamps as a result of these changes and that there will not be a serious diminution of their powers.  If that happens the members will become disinterested and the committees will no longer play such an important role in the development of agriculture.  Committee spokesmen have acted as liaison officers between the committees and the farmers and there was always great co-operation at all levels.  This is essential if progress is to be made and the desired results achieved.  The Minister of State has quite a lot of knowledge of committees of agriculture and their work, as I also have, and I warn that any interference with the powers of the committees will have an adverse effect on the operation of services.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of farming representatives to the committee.  That is something that is long overdue.  Their knowledge and expertise should be of great benefit.  One problem that will arise is how the representations should be worked out.  We tried to get the ideas of the Minister for Agriculture on this aspect but failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> There are many organisations representing agriculture in each county. In my county there is the IFA, Young Farmers' Club, Irish Country Women's Association, Muintir na Tíre, Wexford Liquid Milk Producers, Co-operative Marts and Waterford Co-op to name but a few.  I fail to see how the Minister will work out what organisation should represent them on the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I asked Deputy Hussey the last time if I was correct in interpreting what the Minister of State said to mean that the Minister was prepared to consult the farming organisations in each county in order to determine what percentage each organisation would get.  He answered that the Deputy would understand that the Minister would not leave it to the rural organisations to decide who was to represent the county, or voluntary organisation within a county, on the county committees of agriculture.  He said that there would certainly be consultations. To my knowledge no consultations have taken place with the different rural organisations.  They are very interested in having their members represented on the county committees of agriculture.  I should like to know what system will be used.  In Wexford there will be six places and I could name at least ten organisations that could fill them.  The Minister has taken on himself the responsibility of deciding which of these organisations should get the representation.</P>

      <P>It is relevant to the Bill before the House.  The section states that each person, other than a person chosen by the council appointed to be a member of a committee of agriculture, shall be appointed on the nomination of such voluntary rural organisations active in the county as the Minister may by order designate, either generally or in relation to each county or group of counties, and the number of members to be nominated by each such organisation shall, subject <Col N="834" /> to the provision of these rules, be such as the Minister may by order determine. The Minister is taking responsibility on himself to be the sole arbitrator of what organisation gets a place on the committees of agriculture.  This is a dangerous power.  In political parties there is some discipline but in any one county there could be nine or ten organisations requesting to be given a place on the committee. How will this work out?  Will all organisations be called together and will the Minister say to them that he will only take X organisations or that he will put all the names into a hat and draw them out?  The Minister is doing a dangerous thing by setting himself up as the sole arbitrator. There will be nothing but friction and rows.</P>
      <P>We fought this section with the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, but we could not get any indication of what he had in mind.  Deputy Allen will have to come up with some formula whereby he will be able to work it out in an acceptable way which will not cause friction within each county or organisation.  The councils of some counties picked members of certain organisations after the June county council elections of 1979.  I assume that they will be invalid and we will start afresh as far as people are concerned who were put on by different councils and who are not members of rural organisations.  I should like to have these points cleared up.</P>
      <P>I am sure nobody wants friction within the counties as far as places are concerned.  The Agriculture (An Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Act, 1979, is inadequate because it excludes the Agricultural Institute.  There is an absence of proper educational facilities at residential colleges.  In Wexford we have applications for 75 places but we only have 25 places available in the colleges. It is essential that every young farmer going into the agricultural business should have a minimum of one year in an agricultural college.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting to the new Minister of State that this Bill should be tied up completely with providing education for those who work on the land.  I will spend only two minutes on it.  There is a vacuum in agricultural education which will have to be filled by the county committees of agriculture and it is essential that these committees would have as members the best possible brains in the field of agricultural education, that is, members of the Agricultural Institute.  The county committees could in that way avail of the wealth of information available in the Agricultural Institute.  I did not agree with the severing of this link by Deputy Clinton's Bill and we should fill that vacuum through this Bill.</P>
      <P>Agricultural education is a basic need of our farmers and the committees of agriculture are the bodies to satisfy that need, but they need the co-operation of the Agricultural Institute who have the staff, the facilities and the research necessary.  The Agricultural Institute have at their disposal a wealth of information that should be transmitted to workers of our land through the committees of agriculture.  I cannot foresee that in the next five years the agricultural colleges will be able to make the necessary places available and I make an earnest appeal to the Minister of State to try to make available to farmers, particularly young farmers, the information available in the Agricultural Institute.</P>

I now ask the Minister of State to deal with this specifically when he is replying. I also suggest that he makes provision for greater involvement of the Agricultural Institute in the education of young farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill became necessary because of neglect by the Government to bring forward their proposals on this matter at the proper time.  If they had been doing their business in a proper manner&mdash;they were not because they were thinking of other things&mdash;this Bill would have been ready soon after the election.  People were appointed to the county committees of agriculture statutorily for five years and the purpose of this Bill is to remove them.  Let us be straight, that is the reason for the Bill.</P>
      <P>County committees of agriculture may have been lackadaisical in some areas, they may not have been doing their work as they should have, but in County Kildare they did a job second to none and I defy any Minister to contradict me.  People were appointed to these committees who were interested in the progress of agricultural education. This Bill removes them, completely quashes these committees whose statutory power has been removed completely. In fact they will not have statutory powers any more.  Their only function will be in an advisory capacity and we know what happened when such bodies made suggestions to a higher authority&mdash;they have been pared and cut down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> This position has been allowed to drag on and it would have been better to have left it until after the local elections.  This Bill gets rid of the lot.  The criteria by which the Minister will select the various rural organisations for representation on the country committees, other than members of local authorities, are unusual.</P>
    <P>At the first meeting after the implementation of this Bill the duty of the local authority is to elect 60 per cent of the members of the new committee and that will be done.  The Minister must then name the various rural organisations which are to nominate people for that committee.  As the Minister of State is, I am sure, well aware, there are already in motion all sorts of political manoeuvrings, even so far as naming the people to be put forward by that committee.  Various committees are hoping that by making known now those they wish to represent them and their politics that they will politically influence the decision of the Minister.  That is being done left, right and centre.  These moves are on foot, for various reasons, to influence the kind of people or the kind of organisation to be selected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a serious problem on his hands if he wishes to do his job impartially in the interest of agriculture, which is how it should be done.  He will be open to criticisms if the people selected are of a certain political persuasion, which should not be.  There should be some other way of appointing the best men rather than having a political head of a Department saying who they should be.  The Minister is on very dangerous ground and may be making a mistake.</P>
    <P>There are various people who should have representation on the committee of agriculture&mdash;or the so-called committee of agriculture, because it will have a lot less power than previously.  In effect, its power is well nigh gone.  This change was necessary in some areas, but as far as the Kildare committee of agriculture are concerned, I certainly refute that completely.  Their record shows that they were the most progressive committee down through the years, irrespective of <Col N="838" /> who had political sway on it.  The reason is that they had top officials who had one interest only and that was the advancement of agriculture in the area. They were able to get the message across to the political parties representatives on these committees of agriculture, that agriculture was first and political wrangling or whatever was second.</P>
    <P>The Minister has another difficulty.  I have a great fear that for his own comvenience and as an easy way of performing his duty he will nominate one, two or three organisations all over the country to be members of the committee, without examining the position in detail.  That would be a serious mistake.  I shall give one example.  The committee of agriculture for Kildare have unanimously passed and sent a resolution to the Minister that the horse breeding industry should be represented in Kildare.  This has no political kudos for me but horse breeding is a predominant part of agriculture in Kildare and therefore should be represented on this new committee. Possibly it would not be fair to represent horse breeders in another area. One would have to study all the factors within the area covered by the committee and the representation should reflect the kind of agricultural operation carried out in that area.  The last speaker mentioned a particular interest in Wexford, which is fair enough.</P>
    <P>Many areas have no farm workers and many areas have a lot employed in agriculture.  In the areas which have a lot of workers&mdash;and my own would be one&mdash;there should be a trade union representative or someone to represent the farm workers' organisations.  The Government have professed an interest in this.  When the original mother Bill, if I may call it that, was being discussed, I made the point that on the body of AnCo there should be representation of the various interests, a proportion of the workers.  The same applies to the agricultural committees which should represent all the people in the area interested in agriculture&mdash;people like the small farmers, the Land League, the <Col N="839" /> IFA, the Irish Country Women's Association.</P>
    <P>A lot of investigation must be done before the members for, say, Kildare or Wexford, Donegal or elsewhere can be nominated.  The structure of agriculture is absolutely different in one place from another, the organisations in these areas are also completely different.  It is only natural that if the structure of farming is different the organisations entitled to be represented on the committee should be different.  The Minister has an onerous job on his hands in regard to these appointments. Any political head of a Department would be very foolish to get himself into that kind of situation.  No matter what he does, he will be accused of playing politics.  No matter what kind of criteria he uses, a certain amount of people, probably of his own political persuasion, will be appointed and it will be alleged&mdash;and I am not saying that it will be true&mdash;that there is political influence and it will shake the confidence of the ordinary farmer in the whole operation of this new committee system.</P>
    <P>This amending legislation would not have been necessary at all if no one had been statutorily appointed as a member of a committee of agriculture other than under this Bill.  Now, however, we have a situation where people have been appointed for five years, for the duration of that county council, and this Bill is necessary to throw them out, which throws out the whole lot.  It also, in effect, changes the system of employment of the agricultural advisory body.  This may be a follow-up Bill but it is a serious one. The Minister did not do his work in time and he had plenty of time to do it.  If for some reason, bitterness or otherwise, he wanted to change an Act previously implemented in this House he should have done this in time so that it would be the normal process after the local authority elections.  Failing that, he would be better advised to leave it so, as far as that section of the Act is concerned, until after the next local elections.</P>
    <P>In effect, we are doing a lot more in this very change than just changing the <Col N="840" /> people represented on the committees of agriculture.  We are appointing them to a committee with no power and no income. We will collect a portion of the money from the county council but the local people will not be given the power to spend the money.  They may make recommendations that will be sent to the governing body but ultimately it will be the Department who will make the final decision.  They will decide if a programme is to be carried out.  From my knowledge of any scheme that has to be submitted to a local authority and sent finally to the Department, I must admit that I fear the programmes will not be implemented.  This year a new scheme has been introduced in relation to scholarships.  I am not disagreeing with what is being done.  The scheme is a good one because a full scholarship is given only to people under a certain valuation and that is fair enough.  It cannot be denied that we are cutting back on finances.  Fewer scholarships have been granted this year than previous years.  Daily we are diminishing the power of local authorities.</P>

      <P>This Bill is downgrading the powers of committees of agriculture.  In deference to the Chair I will not pursue the point but it is a fact and it cannot be denied by the Minister. There is provision in the Bill for the abolition of committees of agriculture and the county councils will have to appoint new members.  People will have to be named to contribute the remaining 40 per cent of the committees.  The Minister will be on dangerous ground when he starts to choose people.  He should tell the House what he proposes to do in relation to this matter.  Will he name people from many organisations, will he deal with each county as a unit or will he consider the matter on an overall basis?  If he does it on an overall basis it will be disastrous in almost every county because different interests operate in each county.  Where there is a concentration <Col N="841" /> of agricultural workers they should be represented on the committees.  In my constituency the horse breeding industry is of considerable importance and it should be represented.  If this is done on a county-by-county basis in consultation with the CEO in each area who has worked the system for many years that is fair enough, but if it is done on an overall basis in an arbitrary manner I feel sorry for the Minister who will have to implement it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This is the section which enables the Minister for the Environment <Col N="844" /> to amend local government superannuation schemes.  I was pointing out that it becomes effective by regulations which may be made retrospective.  I was emphasising the point which runs right through the Bill that it is retrospective legislation operated by regulation.  That is even worse and more objectionable than retrospective legislation which spells out what is being done.  This legislation confers on the Minister the right to amend schemes, to make new schemes and to do that by regulations. These regulations have retrospective effect to give legal effect to things that were done as far back as 1969.  I want to put on record that I consider this a most objectionable way of doing things.  I made the point on an earlier section as clearly as I could.  At any time retrospective legislation which ratifies payments made as far back as 1969 and apparently ignored by the local government auditor because presumably he was told that it would be legalised later on, would be highly objectionable, but when it is to be done by regulations it is even worse.</P>
      <P>I know that I shall be told that these regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if a resolution is passed by either House within 21 sitting days annulling them they cease to have effect but we know that with the best opposition in the world these regulations are sometimes not scrutinised as closely as they might be.  We also know that a Minister making these regulations usually, or indeed invariably, has a majority in the House which will enable him to carry them through.  I object in the strongest possible terms to this method of legislation.  We are giving the Minister a blank cheque for the future and giving him power to give general absolution for the past and to do so by regulation.  I object to that procedure and will continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain the reasons for section 3.  The present legal position is that superannuation is regulated almost entirely by statute.  The aim of the Bill is to get to a position where superannuation is <Col N="845" /> regulated entirely by schemes.  In making the change-over two approaches are possible, an instantaneous change-over or a gradual one.  Under the first approach all enactments would be repealed as soon as a comprehensive codified scheme would be brought into operation covering all aspects of superannuation. The disadvantage of this approach would be that nothing could be done until the comprehensive scheme was ready and this would take a considerable time because of the delay involved in any codification process due, for example, to the need to assemble material from many enactments, to identify the spent provisions and the live ones, to iron out anomalies.  This delay would mean that we would have to wait much longer before validating the improvements already made and welcomed by everybody.  It would also raise a problem if any further improvements had to be urgently made.</P>
      <P>Under the second approach of a gradual change-over, which is the course adopted in the Bill, the statutory framework is maintained for the time being and interim schemes can be quickly introduced validating improvements already made as well as providing for any further urgent changes that may be decided on.  Where these involve a departure from statutory provisions, regulations will be made amending the relevant enactments.  Later, when the comprehensive scheme is ready, all the relevant enactments will be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disadvantage of this course is that the amendment of enactments by regulations, although there are numerous precedents, should be avoided where possible.  In this case, however, it was felt that the balance of advantage lay in adopting this approach, having regard to the need to avoid further delay in validating improvements already made or in introducing any further urgent changes that may be found necessary. The enactments which will be subject to amendment are, in any event, due for repeal at a later stage under section 11 or will otherwise become spent.  A similar approach has been adopted for <Col N="846" /> the civil service under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976, and there are advantages in keeping in line with civil service arrangements because of the interaction that exists between the two schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not want to harp on the delay in retrospection, but I want to talk about it now for a few minutes.  I have heard a lot about it but I have not heard one complaint from anyone on any side of this House that we should not do it.  No one has come to me from any side of the House to say that.  Everybody I know was delighted with all the benefits.  Our policy right across the civil service has been to improve superannuation conditions as soon as they are agreed and to seek validation subsequently.  This is to prevent persons who are receiving or about to receive superannuation benefits suffering hardships which could arise from longer delays in promoting legislation. As regards the period of delay in the present case, the reasons for this were explained on this Second Stage. They can be summarised as follows.  A series of changes were introduced in the civil service superannuation system in a period of eight years beginning 1968. These were applied in the local service also but one step behind, so to speak, in three main stages&mdash;(1) the Widows and Orphans Scheme, 1969 (2) miscellaneous improvements mainly in the kind of service to be reckoned, in 1971; (3) the new comprehensive superannuation revision scheme in 1977-78.  The Act to validate the civil service changes was passed in 1976.  At that stage a working party was in being to consider the position in the local service.  When their interim report was implemented in 1977-78 the present Bill was prepared and was introduced in the Dáil in May 1979.  It is, precisely, the granting of improvement in legislation and it is necessary for humanitarian reasons.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the section are welcome and, as I said earlier, I cannot be held in any way responsible for any delays that may occur on the Bill.  We have agreed on the bringing in of all the schemes. People who were entitled to their moneys <Col N="847" /> under the scheme have received them, and they were very welcome to them.  I have not heard anybody on either side of the House saying that that should not be done.  From what I have heard throughout the country everybody is very pleased and most grateful that this Bill was brought into operation and that there was no undue holdup in the benefits.  That is the main thing. Whatever can be said afterwards, I am fully satisfied that it was in the best interest of the people looking for the benefits.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The child he is talking about is the benefits conferred on widows and orphans and on local government employees back as far as 1969.  Of course, like everybody else, I approve of the benefits that were conferred on widows and orphans and local government employees back as far as 1969 and 1971 and whatever dates apply. But it is my duty here, as spokesman on Environment for my party, to say that I disagree entirely with the system that allows bureaucracy to jog along for ten years in anticipation of the authority from Parliament, and that is what has been done here and is continuing to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what I object to, the setting up of a bad precedent assuming authority. One cannot blame the bureaucracy because the bureaucracy would not do it if they had not the say-so of the political head of the Department.  I admit that there has been a number of them since 1969, but this is not good enough.  This is embarking on the slippery slope of assuming that bureaucracy is the all-powerful <Col N="848" /> arm of government and that this House is only a rubber stamp.  This may be said to be a lot of hot air but it is nothing of the sort.  We either confer, without question, authority on permanent heads of Departments and the people under them to act on our behalf, or we say that they cannot act unless they have power to do so.  No amount of talk will put me in the situation of being alleged to have said that these benefits should not have been conferred or these improvements made but at the time when they were being made some enabling Act should have been put on the Statute Book to give authority for what was done.</P>
    <P>The local government auditor had to ignore or approve things for which there was no authority.  If that sort of thing is tolerated the effectiveness of auditing accounts is very small indeed.  It was said here on the last day that the Government made a decision to do this but the Government is not all powerful, they get their authority from this House.  When I raised the question of the local government auditor I was told that no complaint was made by him in regard to any of these things.  If not, why not?  Surely a scheme introduced or a payment made in 1969 or 1971 which is being validated now deserved to have been drawn to the attention of somebody by the local government auditor.  If it is necessary to validate it now there was no legal authority at the time but only assumed authority when it was done.  That is what I am against and what I will continue to be against.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised certain points one of which was to bring in a Bill.  We would have to bring in a whole range of Bills.  What we are doing here is changing over to regulations so that things will be done by regulation in future in the usual way.  I do not apologise to anybody for the improved benefits going back as far as 1969.  We had successive Governments, including a Coalition Government, who did not do anything about it.  Were Deputy Fitzpatrick and his party of the opinion that we should not have paid out the <Col N="849" /> benefits and that we should have waited till now?  I do not know of anybody who wants it that way.  The widows, orphans and others who were entitled to help were very glad of the benefits.  I make no apology now.</P>
      <P>We are now bringing in a system which will update the whole position and which will mean that further improvements will now be made by regulation. Possibly the Bill at that time was not up to the standard desired now but changing circumstances and time have brought about this situation.  This is a step in the right direction and I am satisfied that it is the right thing to do.</P>

That would have made the thing legal.  It would have given the Minister the authority in the interim to do what he is getting the authority to do now.  The Minister would not be doing it nor would civil servants be doing it in anticipation that the House at some future date would march through the lobbies and give authority for what they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last evening I was not able to finish my reply.  When the debate was adjourned I was dealing with the prison system and the fact that some people find it difficult to understand why a prison system which already accommodates 1,200 persons in custody cannot find space for the 27 or so who are now in the Curragh.  I should like to stress that it is not a matter of space alone.  If there were no risks involved in their returning to the civil prison system, the space could be found for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that these prisoners are known trouble-makers and disrupters. They have demonstrated in the past a capacity and a willingness to foment disorder among the general population of prisoners. Some of them have been involved in disturbances in the past even, I gather, as far back as 1972-73.  They are not the only long-term prisoners in custody.  Excluding Portlaoise, there are some 300 prisoners serving sentences of two years or more.  What distinguishes those in the Curragh is that they are not prepared to serve their sentences in peace, or avail themselves of the normal <Col N="852" /> facilities available to prisoners.  On the contrary, they want to create as much trouble as they can and, if possible, prevent others from availing of those facilities.</P>
    <P>The problem is to find accommodation in the civil prisons which is secure enough to hold the Curragh prisoners and, more important, which is so arranged that they are separated from the main body of prisoners.  Separation is imperative if the opportunity of fomenting disorder is not to be given to these prisoners.  I have looked at a number of possibilities and I should like to assure the House that there is no suitable arrangement which can be made to accommodate these prisoners within the present civil prisons system.  That is why work is now going ahead, for the first time since 1972, on a new security prison which can accommodate them.</P>
    <P>There have been many statements about the unsuitability of the Curragh for long term prisoners.  I agree conditions there are not ideal, although I understand improvements are being made. Even now, the conditions there are much better than they are in some areas of the civil prison system.  Mountjoy Prison, which has 150 long term prisoners, is not suitable for them in its present condition. Neither is St. Patrick's Institution suitable for juveniles, nor the existing women's prisons suitable for women.</P>
    <P>Prisoners in the Curragh are eligible for parole just as prisoners elsewhere. The factors taken into account in deciding a prisoner's application for parole include his general behaviour, the likelihood of his returning to prison, and his likely behaviour while at liberty, as well as the safety of the public of course. Prisoners in the Curragh are less likely than most to qualify for parole on an evaluation of such factors and, accordingly, they do not benefit to the same extent as some other prisoners do.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate reference was made to the administration of drugs to prisoners in the Curragh. I understand that five of the 27 prisoners are on drugs prescribed by the consultant psychiatrist.  The health care of persons <Col N="853" /> in custody is in the hands of the professional medical officers, and I am quite satisfied to leave medical treatment in the hands of professionals.  If they prescribe drugs for individuals, I accept that they are prescribed as part of a treatment programme.  Indeed, Deputy Dr. Browne was told in reply to a Parliamentary Question in June 1978 that these drugs are prescribed for medical reasons, and not for the control of prisoners as suggested by him.  That remains the position today.</P>
    <P>Reference was made during the debate to alternatives to custody.  At the moment the courts apply probation on an extensive scale.  There are about 1,600 prisoners on probation, which is more than there are prisoners in custody.  They are supervised in the community by the probation and welfare services of the Department of Justice.  As I have already said, parole is operated on a very extensive scale and this is also an alternative to custody.  Recently I increased the number of welfare officers in the probation and welfare service so that a scheme of intensive supervision in the community for selected prisoners could be introduced as an alternative to custody. By the end of May of this year there will be about 50 offenders under intensive supervision and the aim is to increase this number to about 150 by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice are examining the possibility of introducing legislation to empower the courts to impose community service orders as an alternative.  This proposal, which is an alternative to custody, requires a very detailed analysis and it will take some time yet to formulate a final scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I understand that legislation is necessary.  In dealing with the prisons generally it is fair to say that there are many groups of prisoners&mdash;I want this clearly understood&mdash;in civil prisons who have less congenial conditions than those in the Curragh.  That is a fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the other evening in the Deputy's absence, through no fault of his own, I earnestly asked the support of all Members of all parties in the House for the programme of prison building which I am trying to implement and which I have finances to build, in particular at Wheatfield, Clondalkin, where I hope to provide a new women's prison and 150 places for young offenders under 21 years of age. It is no credit to any of us that the prison system is as it is.  It was starved of capital by successive Governments for a long number of years and the Government the Deputy supported were the greatest offenders for the four-and-a-half years they were in office.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied about the conditions of any of these places.  The extensive building programme that is under way shows that something is being done about that problem, and I earnestly request help there.  Conditions in the Curragh are broadly the same as those in the civil prisons.  The rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, have their parallel in the Prisons Act, 1972, regulations. Thus, for example, allegations of misconduct by prisoners must be dealt with by the governor of the Curragh in precisely the same way as they are dealt with by governors of the civil prisons. The punishments which may be imposed by the governor of the Curragh are exactly the same as those which may be applied elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules and regulations allow variations in regimes as between places to suit the sort of prisoners held in them.  I am satisfied that the regime in the Curragh is as liberal as it can be, given that the maintenance of safe custody and control there demands an appropriate level of discipline from the prisoners.  Decisions about the disposition of prisoners in the Curragh are taken by the Minister for Justice.  Transfers of prisoners into and out of military custody, parole, early releases, and so on, are decided by the Minister for Justice.  The day to day <Col N="855" /> operation of the Curragh is a matter for the Minister for Defence.  There is however continuous consultation about the treatment of prisoners in the Curragh in order to ensure consistency of treatment between military and civil custody. Officers of the Department of Justice have free access to the Curragh.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion about taking over the military detention barracks and operating it under civilian control.  As I have said already, such a take-over would require a diversion of staff from the civil prisons, staff that cannot be spared at present.  However, staffing is not the only problem.  As Members know, the detention barracks is in the middle of an extensive military complex and the Army authorities have serious and understandable objections to the handing over of part of that military complex to civilian control.</P>
    <P>During the course of his intervention, Deputy Browne painted a very emotional picture of prisoners being handed over to the military for the set purpose of being subjected to a harsh regime.  Apart from being unfair to the personnel involved, that picture is fundamentally misconceived.  These prisoners are in military custody simply because it is only in the Curragh that there are facilities for their containment and for their separation from other prisoners.  I can say definitely that the Curragh will not be required for them when the new prison, on which work began on the 28th of last month, at Portlaoise is ready.</P>
    <P>References were made to the legality and to the constitutionality of transferring civilian prisoners to military custody.  The relevant Act has been in operation since 1972 and there is a basic presumption of its constitutionality unless the courts decide otherwise.  I understand that at least one prisoner has failed in the courts in challenging the Act.  The section of that Act under which prisoners are transferred to the Curragh is quite wide and covers fully the circumstances under which prisoners are so transferred now.  There have been <Col N="856" /> powers always regarding the transfer of prisoners from one prison to another and it is not correct to suggest that such transfers are an unwarranted interference in the jurisdiction of the courts.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate and again during Question Time the other day the suggestion was made that there might be a more formal structure for processing parole applications and indeed any form of early release.  Our system of parole is operated on a very generous scale by international comparisons. In 1979, for example, parole was granted on 2,800 occasions and I am not satisfied that a more formal approach, such as the establishment of a parole board, would be seen by prisoners as an improvement; but there is a possibility that such a process would lead to a rigidity which would not be to the advantage of those in custody. Furthermore, it would inhibit the administration in responding quickly to the needs of prisoners and of the prison system.  There may be an assumption that some prisoners who do not benefit now from parole would have a better chance in this regard if there were a parole board, but that is not necessarily the case.  A parole board would have to establish criteria for the assessment of parole applications and those criteria would be unlikely to vary significantly from the criteria applied now.</P>
    <P>In November last, during the debate on a Supplementary Estimate for my Department, I had occasion to refer to the philosophy of imprisonment and I detailed the many improvements made for the benefit of both staff and prisoners.  The objective is to provide prisoners with decent, humane conditions and with assistance, first, to make their imprisonment as tolerable as possible; and, secondly, to help them make the best use of their time so that they may be better equipped to return to society.  I stress again that I must deal with realities.  The simple fact is that the civil prisons cannot function as they should function if a small group of prisoners cause disruption.  I am satisfied that it is in the best interest of the vast <Col N="857" /> majority of prisoners and of the continued smooth running of the civil prisons that the Curragh should continue to be available until a reasonable alternative is available and that alternative is the new high-security prison being built at Portlaoise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my speech, I asked the following question as reported at column 343 of the Official Report of 30 April:</P>
      <P>Can I take it that no jail was built, with work commencing in the Curragh Camp adjacent to the military detention camp on a new 400-cell high security prison?</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>
      <P>No, that is completely incorrect.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that in 1977 he asked a question in precisely the same terms of the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Flanagan, who replied that the prison was started in July, 1974 and was completed in 1976 at an approximate cost of £350,000.  I am concerned with two points in this regard.  The first is that, if the Minister is correct, I would appear to have been attempting to mislead the Dáil and if the Minister is not correct, that he was attempting to mislead the Dáil.  I should like this matter to be cleared up.</P>

      <P>I understand that Plunkett Barracks was an old building, that it was reconstructed by the military authorities as a type of prison but that it is not a prison that would be up to standard in the provision of the security that is required for high-risk prisoners.  These buildings are not the cell-type barracks but a dormitory type and I am not sure that the moneys spent on the reconstruction <Col N="858" /> work were spent to the best advantage if they were meant to improve the prison situation.  I am advised that Plunkett Barracks were built by the Army and planned by them and certainly not by those whose job it is to advise on prisons for the Department of Justice.  Those buildings are of no great value to us in the present problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that my interpretation of a high-security prison differs greatly from the interpretation of such as held by Deputy Flanagan when he was Minister for Defence.  The prison in question is a dormitory-type prison. One would not keep infants in it.  If a prisoner in that prison wished to go to the loo during the night everybody else would have to move to let him through.  I would disagree entirely with Deputy Flanagan's interpretation of what is a high-security prison, but if Deputy Browne wishes to pursue the matter further I suggest that he table questions to the Minister for Defence who has responsibility in that area.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 12, to delete &ldquo;1983&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1981&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to give effect to the concern of all parties in the House to secure that this concept of military custody is terminated at the earliest possible date.  Many of us have great sympathy with the Minister in his efforts to combat crime in the community and to deal with the difficulties arising therefrom.  We regretted, therefore, having to deal with a request for yet another three-year extension. Since 1972 we have had two requests for an extension of these powers.  We were disturbed by the Minister's reference in his opening speech indicating that at the end of the three years he was not optimistic about his capacity to end military custody.  I detected that impression from the Minister although the Minister is correcting me by a shake of his head and I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to allow the briefest possible period within which the Minister will be able to give concrete evidence to the House that there is a real and determined attempt, as opposed to a verbal onslaught, on the concept of military custody.  That would then allow us to look with more sympathy on and give more co-operation to a request by the Government to facilitate such legislation for a brief period.  It is argued that 12 months is adequate to give reality to that hope.  If at the end of that period the <Col N="862" /> Minister is able to say that progress was made over the previous 12 months and he was making a final request for an extension of the powers in this Bill I do not think too many loud voices would be raised.  The Minister, and other Members who have spoken on this Bill since 1972, are on record as having stated that they do not want military custody.  It is there. The Minister in his opening address gave strong voice to his innermost conviction that such a concept should not be retained.  However, the reality is that for better or worse&mdash;he mirrored this fear in his own mind&mdash;we must wait three years and we do not know what change will take place during that time or who will be the Minister for Justice.  The Bill is fundamentally too serious because of its impact on basic concepts of justice to allow such an inordinately long extension.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I would ask the Minister to accept our amendment which in 12 months' time would allow us look at the situation anew, at which time I would hope also, as I am sure would the Minister, that there would be sufficient evidence available to Deputies enabling them to say: at least we are on the eve of getting rid once and for all of a concept of imprisonment and incarceration, fundamentally repugnant to the beliefs of many people in this House and which should be necessary only in times of major civil or military disorder and not be extended beyond the minimum period necessary.  I make this request particularly because this Bill was introduced initially primarily, if not almost exclusively, because of an accommodation problem subsequent to the riot in Mountjoy in 1972.  Since then it has been twisted, turned and used for various purposes. We are now sliding into psychological acceptance of the view that the Bill is a way of keeping difficult prisoners out of our other prisons, that we are not in a position at present to institute the right kind of systems or sufficiently ahead in developing a high security prison to deal with such difficult and incorrigible people within our system.  If concrete evidence to support the Minister's commitment were available in the 12 months to which I <Col N="863" /> refer, then it would be possible for us all to say: in those circumstances we are able now to accept finally that this concept will be removed from our justice system once and for all.  This amendment might be the very prod necessary to us all to see the back of this measure, a measure which I fervently believe nobody in this House wants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We wish to support the amendment.  As the House is aware, our party opposed the very principle of this Bill on Second Stage and, having been defeated on that, come logically to the position of endeavouring to mitigate its worst effects.  On that basis we feel that it should be enacted for the least possible time.</P>
      <P>We feel Deputy Keating's amendment is entirely reasonable, appropriate and places the Bill in a much better position before its enactment.  We fully support this amendment and ask the Minister to concede that it is a reasonable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputies Keating and Desmond, it is possible they failed to understand the problem existing, despite the fact that I spelled it out very clearly in the course of my introductory and concluding remarks on Second Stage.  The reality of the situation is that the Curragh as a prison, as we understand it at present, can be closed only when there is in existence a high security prison to accommodate the type of prisoner at present in the Curragh.  I understand that Deputy Keating wants concrete evidence rather than a verbal onslaught by me on the problem.  Let me say to Deputies that this year the Vote for Prisons in my Department shows clearly that I am, as it were, putting my money where my mouth is, that there are public moneys being spent this year for the first time since 1972.  None of my predecessors&mdash;my immediate predecessor was in office for four and a half years and had to renew this legislation twice on behalf of the then Government&mdash;spent a penny <Col N="864" /> on doing something concrete other than having a verbal onslaught on the problem.  For two years or less I have been dealing with the planning of this prison.  It has been planned, the green light has been given by the Government, by the Department of Finance, to go ahead.  I told the House that work was commenced on the site on 28 April this year.  If that is not concrete evidence that something is happening, I can say no more.</P>
      <P>As I understand the Deputy's amendment, this would be needed on a 12 monthly basis as a prod for whatever Minister for Justice might be here to see to it that the work was carried on and the prison completed.  The Deputy should know that we would not want a repetition of what happened at Plunkett Barracks in building a high security prison.  I am seeing to it that a proper prison is being built, planned and executed. There is no way that it could be built within 12 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been started but there is no way it will be half up or well up within 12 months.  The three-year lease I am seeking is the period of time that will be required at the very minimum&mdash;and I am looking for the minimum&mdash;to get the prison built. Building a prison is not like building a house or other ordinary premises.  That has been tried already and proved to be unsuccessful at expense to taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One should trust everybody until one has occasion not to trust people; it is probably a better way of going through life as a whole.</P>
      <P>If a prod is needed for any Minister for Justice in any Government in the future as far as the progress of this high security prison for Portlaoise is concerned, then there will be an occasion provided annually on the Estimate of the Department, on the Vote for Prisons.  In that Estimate the exact amount of money will be seen, what money was spent the previous year and is being allocated by the Government for this task. I can assure the Deputy that as long as I am here I will fight very hard to ensure that the high security prison I started will be finished, that work will be maintained on it.  I could have come into the House and sought perhaps a four-year term.  I believe the work on the prison can be done within three years.  I want to have this hanging over the heads of all of those who will be involved, whether it be the Board of Works, contractors or anybody else, so that they will know they will be subject to comment, or stronger, if it is felt that the work has not proceeded as rapidly as we would all want.  I want to say to Deputy Keating, with the greatest respect, that there is no way in God's world a prison could be built inside 12 months or two years.  If the purpose of his amendment is to provide the House with an opportunity to discuss the matter, to comment on the progress made, there will be ample opportunity annually on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is strong evidence there that something positive is being done.  I am not blaming my predecessor for not being able to get the money during his term of office.  When money is scarce it is difficult.  It is an experience to which the Deputy can look forward in time: endeavouring to get money for anything when money is scarce.  I have been lucky.  I have been successful.  The Government appreciate the need for doing something positive.  This year, when nobody denies that money is scarce, this new scheme is being financed and got off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> I appreciate the reason Deputy Keating put down this amendment, but the valid right to comment is there even without his amendment.  If we do not have a 12 month Bill that does not mean that the Deputy or the House cannot have a discussion on it at any time. There are no votes in prisons for anybody.  Let me repeat my appeal for help from all sides.  I have asked both Opposition parties and my own party to support me in getting the new prison complex in Wheatfield under way.  There is a lot of confusion.  People have been feeding on rumours and people have been feeding other people with their rumours.  My presentation of the facts in a truthful and forthright way has been misinterpreted.  It is a pity because, while we have the money and the opportunity to do something worthwhile in the prison scene, whoever happens to be Minister for Justice is owed the support of all members of all parties in getting something done.  This is long overdue.  I am not blaming any party for that. There is one way that progress in the prisons area will be restricted and that is if the prospect of doing something now is knocked for any reason.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that when this Bill was introduced in 1972 nobody expected that we would still have the Bill in 1982 because the belief of the Minister for Justice at that time and of subsequent Ministers for Justice was that it would no longer be necessary?  Does the Minister accept that, despite his best efforts, there may be certain circumstances whereby in 1982 or in 1984 or 1986 we will still have this legislation here?  That is the reason why we should force ourselves to face up to this issue more regularly than we have been doing in order to ensure that the problem will be eradicated once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In late 1973 the situation changed drastically for Senator Cooney, the then Minister for Justice, when the type of imprisonment for subversive prisoners had to change.  The Deputy will probably know that at that time the idea of dispersing subversive prisoners around different prisons proved a failure and the subversive prisoners who are high security prisoners had to be brought together.  At that time Portlaoise Prison had to be taken out of the prison system.  That could not then be used for long term prisoners with sentences of three years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because Portlaoise is still there as a high security prison for that type of prisoner.  If Senator Cooney, having successfully devised a system to hold subversive prisoners at the time, had been able to prevail upon the Government of the day to provide money for a new prison for disruptive prisoners, that could have solved the problem.  In saying this I am not scoring political points off him; I have great respect for him, perhaps more than many in this House.  I appreciate the problems he had to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the failure of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to ensure that eligible persons receive their social welfare payments on time, resolves to appoint an all-party Committee of the House to investigate and report on the matter.</P>
      <P>I believe this is a constructive suggestion. The first and most fundamental point when talking about delays in payment of social welfare is that we are talking about a person's right to payment, not merely a charitable hand-out which a person might be fortunate enough to receive whenever it might arrive.  The right of social welfare recipients to receive prompt payment is a key issue worthy of debate in this House and we are not simply attacking the Minister for Social Welfare or saying that he is not doing his job.  Our attitude to this problem of delays in payments is indicative of whether we view social welfare as a legal entitlement or as a charitable hand-out.  It is the latter attitude which I have always maintained supports a negative and complacent view towards the poor in our society.  It is this attitude which must be condemned at each opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second most important point to bear in mind is that while a delay of a week or two in, say, a tax rebate might cause the average middle class household only a minor inconvenience such a delay in payment for an old age pensioner, a deserted wife or a person struggling to eke out an existence on supplementary welfare allowance can mean the difference between having enough food to eat, clothes to wear or coal to light a fire and having to go <Col N="869" /> without these basic necessities of life.  We must appreciate the urgency which should be attached to the payment of these benefits and underscore the point that we cannot tolerate any complacency in the Department of Social Welfare concerning delays in social welfare payments.  Too much hardship has been and is being caused.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Minister's argument when he points to the fact that his Department make weekly payments to 522,000 beneficiaries and monthly payments of children's allowances to 420,000.  This is an extremely large volume of business.  The Minister maintains that delays are in some cases inevitable given such a volume of work and that these delays do not constitute a crisis situation. I should like to caution the Minister with regard to this argument because these delays do constitute a crisis for those who do not receive their payments. The argument fails to take account of the very serious impact these delays have had and are having on the poor and under-privileged and contains within it the seeds of complacency.  It is an attitude which regards such delays as inevitable, given the volume of work, and which looks to what might be called the &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; level of delay in social welfare payments.  People have a right to these payments and, given their vulnerable position, they are very likely to experience hardship if delays occur.  In my opinion there is no acceptable level of delay in payments to social welfare recipients and there is no room for complacency. Our old age pensioners, disabled and unemployed deserve nothing but the best in terms of administrative efficiency and this is what we will continue to demand.</P>
    <P>A delay in payment may not be a crisis within the Department which deals with so many thousands of claims but it is certainly a crisis on the receiving end. It is certainly a crisis for the one person in a hundred or a thousand who falls victim to delay.  For this reason I advise caution regarding the argument that these delays constitute a minor and not a frightening percentage of the total business undertaken by the Department. <Col N="870" /> Another aspect of the problem which must be examined is the link between the Department's information service and these delays in payment.  The Minister said during the debate on the Estimate that his officials understand the importance of being helpful, courteous and considerate in dealing with applications. He said that sometimes they have difficulty in getting full information from applicants, some of whom may be worried, disturbed or agitated.  He also said that the public do not, unfortunately, always realise the service these public servants provide.  While I do not wish in any way to denigrate social welfare officers as a group, I believe there is a minority who continue to view social welfare recipients as &ldquo;chiselers&rdquo; out to defraud the Department.  This prejudice contributes in no small way to a negative, unhelpful attitude among some social welfare officials.  A courteous and efficient information service within the Department is crucial if these delays are to be avoided.  Social welfare recipients are among the most vulnerable sections in the community and patience, tolerance and understanding are called for from officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>It must be asked whether sufficient personnel are employed by the Department in the information field.  They receive on average 46,000 inquiries each month and 56 people are employed in the information section to deal with these queries.  Taking sick leave and holiday leave into account, I am not satisfied that there are a sufficient number of civil servants attached to this vital area and more people must be assigned to it if we are to develop a new, positive policy towards informing people of their rights to social welfare benefits. This policy is crucial to the policy of social welfare as a social right.  I envisage a policy which goes beyond the mere provision of information on request; much more is required.  We need a policy of actively informing social welfare recipients of all their entitlements by means of radio, television, newspapers and leaflets.  There should be well-trained and informed officials who are able to inform people as to their entitlements. <Col N="871" /> The policy on information within the Department is a passive one and a contributing factor to the problem we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention two small changes which the Minister might immediately consider.  First, he might ensure that officials in his Department identify themselves on the telephone at all times and also write legible signatures on all letters.  This not only lends a personal touch to the work but also makes future queries easier to pursue.  This is a small but important point.  Too often we deal with faceless people who will not disclose their identity and this makes work more and more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the delays caused by the postal strike were largely eliminated by the end of 1979 and that social welfare recipients would get all the payments to which they were entitled with the minimum delay.  What constitutes the minimum delay?  The Minister's predecessor indicated that it took six to eight weeks for the payment of unemployment assistance, six weeks for the right to free electricity, six to eight weeks for the payment of non-contributory pension and four weeks for the normal contributory pension.  These are official estimates which indicate delays between application and receipt of various benefits.  In individual cases these official estimates can be stretched by periods of weeks and even months. Even on the official estimates, delays are too long.  I have spoken about the effects of delays on social recipients particularly in cases such as unemployment, deserted wives and so on.  Delays acknowledged by the Department are only half the problem.  There are many reports from Deputies about other delays in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems is with disability benefits.  Officers working for the National Social Service Council stated that 75 per cent of all cases dealt with since the postal strike ended related to the non-payment of disability benefit. This has been the experience of community information services around the <Col N="872" /> country.  When such an officer queries a case with the Department they are told that a cheque will be issued but if they do not query the lack of payment no cheque will arrive.  Are the Department operating a go-slow on the payment of this benefit?  There is something odd going on.</P>
    <P>A person receiving disability benefit is one least likely to fight back over non-payment and the most likely target for delays in the Department.  The non-payment of this benefit has reached epidemic proportions.  In the Cork region over half the cases handled by community welfare officers are cases where disability benefit has not been paid.  We should pause and examine the ramifications of this abominable situation. Health board money and community officers' time is being held up dealing with unnecessary delays.  They are busy handing out money which should come from the Department and then they are busy trying to recoup it when the Department do send it out. This is an unacceptable state of affairs. Health money should not be used to cover up for bureaucratic inadequacies in the Department of Social Welfare. Time, energy and money which should be used to help cases of need outside that sphere are not being applied.  The result is not only deprivation but an inexcusable waste of precious time and resources.  I have been told that when community officers telephone the Department they are held up for hours and are told that files are not available but are somewhere else.  I spoke to one person who was delayed on the telephone for two hours.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister's concern in this area relates to the problem of abuse.  It has been alleged some workers claim benefit in respect of unnecessary frequent short absences from work.  The Minister has decided that in future the first three days of absence from work will not qualify for payment except in a case where a person suffers a relapse within three days of returning to work. There would be a three day waiting period for each application.  What about <Col N="873" /> a person with a chronic illness or asthma and so on?  Will they be punished as well?</P>
    <P>In addition to the restrictions on disability benefit the Department are operating a semi-official go-slow on the payment of social welfare benefit to cut down on the amount spent in this area. There may be a few malingerers in the bunch but there is no excuse for holding up payment for those genuinely in need. Pensioners also experience difficulty and must wait for a long time to get pension books.  They have difficulty in recovering arrears.  Employees made redundant sometimes find themselves paying the price for employers who failed to deduct their social welfare contributions.  When a social welfare insurance number is quoted there should be no question of delay while the Department investigate the employer.  Pay-related benefit is another area where people experience lengthy delays.  There are inordinate delays in the transfer of benefits, from disability to retirement or old age pensions and so on.</P>
    <P>How should the problem of delays be tackled?  The Minister said he would ask the Minister of State to make a special investigation into the cause of the delays. He acknowledged that there were delays and said the Minister of State would make appropriate recommendations for remedying shortcomings in the procedures.  This recommendation does not go far enough and in the light of the urgency associated with the matter, an all-party Committee of the House should be set up to investigate and report on the matter.</P>
    <P>In a recent Parliamentary Question I asked what examination, if any, had been undertaken of the structure of the social welfare system over the last five years.  Although the Minister listed some areas where there had been review the question regarding delays in payment was not among them.  The time is ripe for such a committee to get to grips with the problem, summon the relevant civil servants from the Department and put the operations of the Department under the microscope and make recommendations <Col N="874" /> for improvements.  An internal investigation by the Minister of State will not suffice.  The public and the Department would benefit from the involvement of Deputies from all sides with a knowledge of the working of the Department.</P>
    <P>The National Social Service Council as well as voluntary bodies engaged in social work should be invited to give their views.  These are people who have day to day experience of the problems and are most likely to help with realistic suggestions for reform.  I counsel the Minister against an internal department review where civil servants would be asked to assess the performance of other civil servants.  With that kind of self-policing mechanism at work I would have faint hope for any radical reform of the kind necessary in the Department. An all-party committee, which would hold some sessions in public, would be a more effective means of getting to the root of the problem and could bring all the expertise, experience and ingenuity which exists outside the Department to bear on the problem of delays.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat myself but I must counsel the Minister again about an internal civil service review of civil service procedures.  Naturally, civil servants would lack the objectivity that a fresh view from the outside would bring to bear in an effort to reform the structure of this Department.  I do not wish to be harsh about the civil service.  I know the problems they face, but civil servants in any Department have a vested interest in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  If anybody doubts this let him observe the glacial pace with which reforms outlined in the Devlin Report are being implemented. I do not wish to be critical of officials in the Department, many of whom, as the Minister has rightly pointed out, have worked very hard to clear the backlog of claims after the postal strike last year.  They are labouring under cumbersome structures which must be streamlined for the benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest that an all-party review, with civil service advice and assistance but <Col N="875" /> with a mandate to summon assistance from outside, is the way to deal with the problem.  It is in the interests of all that the Department would function smoothly, efficiently and effectively. These delays cause social welfare recipients to rely more and more on the intercession of TDs to speed claims through the Department.  I daresay that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, have experienced this among your constituents.</P>
    <P>These delays contribute to the mistaken belief that social welfare payments are not a right but rather handouts, available only through the intercession of someone high up in politics, and this is yet another factor serving to undermine the concept that social welfare benefits are a social right, and we must all work against that concept.  We hope that the long awaited ombudsman Bill will serve to eliminate the myth that social welfare benefits are available through TDs and not as a legal entitlement.</P>
    <P>A related point in the matter of delays in payments is that an independent appeals authority is necessary to enforce the rights of social welfare beneficiaries. As I have said, the Department's appeals system is not fulfilling the function of a genuine appeals body, particularly in cases like that involving a woman on unemployment payments.  Such cases should be decided objectively instead of on the present bureaucratic basis where the mere fact of having children seems to disqualify her from eligibility.  God knows, this has happened over and over again.  I have had to raise these matters in the Dáil when a woman who has a child is disqualified automatically because it is said she cannot provide care for the child while she is working. Applicants should be given clear reasons for refusals of benefits which they are not getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>I submit that an independent appeals body with an effective ombudsman would take much of the pressure from TDs and put the system back where it should be.  It is not our duty as legislators to be interceding on behalf of constituents but to undertake an investigation <Col N="876" /> of the whole system to try to find where things have gone wrong and to make realistic helpful suggestions for streamlining.  I have made many such suggestions in letters to the Minister, and I must pay tribute to him because in many cases he has accepted my suggestions and promised that they will be implemented.</P>
    <P>However, a committee of Deputies from all sides of the House would go a long way towards improving the system and ensuring that the delays would be eliminated so that people would not have to be imploring their TDs to make representations on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I learned in an employment exchange today of people coming back from Britain, applying for unemployment benefit, quoting their British social welfare numbers and waiting up to ten weeks before being told they are entitled to benefit.  I am not saying the delay is on this side.  Indeed I am inclined to believe it is more in Britain than here, but I am suggesting ways and means by which we could streamline the system.  For instance, there is no reason on earth why the Department should not have here a telex straight through to the department of social security in Newcastle-on-Tyne so that queries in respect of payments could be sent directly.  There is no reason why officials from here could not go over there to try to eliminate such delays</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Department of Social Welfare are refusing to do their work: this is not a vote of no confidence in the Department.  I should like to see a mature attitude being adopted in this House.  If motions and suggestions come from the Opposition they should not be automatically refused by the Government, no matter which Government. There is an input from both sides and because we make suggestions on this side they should not be rejected automatically.  The Minister should say, for instance, it is a good idea to have a committee to look into these matters. Neither the Minister nor the Department of Social Welfare have the monopoly of wisdom in this respect.  It would be an enlightened approach to the whole <Col N="877" /> problem if the Minister were to accede to our request.  I was disappointed that he put forward an amendment which is in other words saying that any ideas from the Opposition are unacceptable.  I would have thought that the Minister might say there is some merit in what we are saying, let us examine it and try to improve the system.  Perhaps the Minister might reconsider his position in the light of what I have been saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves the efforts, made by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to ensure that eligible persons receive social welfare payments on time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have listened with great attention to Deputy O'Connell.  I always listen with attention to what he has to say.  As he has said, I have corresponded with him on suggestions he has made.</P>
      <P>At the outset he referred to the volume of business and of course I must refer to it because of its substantial nature.  To expect there would not be problems arising from the 522,000 payments that fall to be made would be foolish on my part. I accept the general point the Deputy has made that a person has a serious problem when payments are not made. There should not be any scope for complacency in this regard.  The Deputy mentioned 522,000 beneficiaries.  The Department are paying 330,000 pensions of all kinds, 430,000 children's allowances, 70,000 disability benefits and 100,000 unemployment benefits. This is a big volume of business and it is important that it be so organised that it will be as efficient and effective as it can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to recent times we were affected by last year's postal strike.  That postal dispute left a backlog of work which was almost cleared by about Christmas.  If it was, staff had worked a great deal of overtime and had missed out on their <Col N="878" /> holidays in bringing the service up to date.  That time had to be taken subsequently after Christmas by way of clearing up holiday time, so there was still some carryover from that time.  In addition, the volume of queries and questions about delays which occured also generated an additional volume of business.  We would hope that at this stage we are out of that difficulty and that we shall be able to carry on with a fairly efficient service.  We have, of course, had further difficulties in that respect because, as the Deputies will appreciate, the Budget was somewhat delayed this year and that left a very short time between the budget date and the time for the introduction of the new pension schemes and pension awards. That has caused some difficulty as far as the Department are concerned.</P>
    <P>During the period of the very heavy work load which followed the postal dispute certain more lengthy administrative processes were tidied up and altered to facilitate quicker payments.  Amending regulations were drawn up to enable full payment to be made on those claims received after the end of the dispute which otherwise could have been paid only from the date they were received in the Department.  In addition, the time limit on encashment of pension allowance orders was removed, thus removing the need for separate payments of arrears by payable orders in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned the question of the kinds of delays and the time scale.  Concerning short-term claims, delay is between one and two weeks, provided that the relevant application form containing all the necessary particulars is furnished to the Department at the commencement of the claim.  The Deputy later raised the question of better, more complete and comprehensive information, but the problem is that if the claim forms do not come in with proper information there is no alternative but to request and require this information. There are various ways in which this can be done.  One thing which the Deputy would find quite surprising is <Col N="879" /> that quite often the tax number is given instead of the insurance number and this leads to delays.  This is a natural human thing and I mention it to indicate that there are elements which make difficulties for the Department in handling these cases as quickly as one would like to see.  The delays are not all on the Department's side.</P>
    <P>The time normally taken to process claims under the long-term contributory scheme is four weeks.  Long-term claims under the non-contributory scheme render it necessary to visit the applicants in their homes and to investigate their means before a decision on their entitlement can be made.  This leads to delays of approximately six weeks or even up to eight weeks at present.  The time normally taken in relation to children's allowances is three to four weeks.  The Deputy has made reference to these delays, almost indicating that there should be no gap between the initial application and the payment.  There are situations in which that might be possible but, by and large, on international comparisions these times are quite reasonable.  Nevertheless, there must be a constant effort to try to shorten these times and find administrative means for doing that without making the system so loose that the amount of abuse at any level can increase, whether at the employers level or the employees, or in the welfare assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements have been made in relation to widows.  On the death of the husband who was receiving social welfare type payment which included an increase for an adult dependant, special arrangements are now in operation for the continuation of that payment for six weeks, at the rate in operation at the date of death.  This enables the pension to which the widow is entitled to be processed and ready for payment at the end of the six weeks.  This is a mechanism which was introduced to get over the waiting period problem and it has been very successful.  In addition, if the husband has not been in receipt of any such payment but would have been <Col N="880" /> entitled to such a benefit or pension, payment will be made for six weeks after death.</P>
    <P>The system of paying benefits and pensions normally is an efficient one. The vast majority of payments are made within the time limit which has been mentioned.  Of course, these limits can be met only if the Department get the full co-operation of all those concerned.  For example, the claimant must properly complete whatever application forms are necessary and answer whatever queries are raised to enable the Department to satisfy themselves that there is entitlement. There have been challenges in relation to the Department and their operation. I suppose it is the usual thing here; we like to denigrate ourselves in public, as a nation we seem to enjoy doing that. I have heard various people suggest that the system is archaic and very slow to respond.</P>
    <P>Only last Tuesday I was in London to present the £300,000 which the Government had allocated to the Irish Centre.  I went there to represent the Government at that time.  While there, I inquired about Eugene Lambert, because that was a very lively situation then.  Being over there as a Minister I wished if he had been incarcerated somewhere to call to see him and see if there was anything that I could do.  He had just been released on bail and I was inquiring about his circumstances, to see if there was anything I could do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just as well that he was not dependent on social welfare to provide the bail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested that he had been working in Sligo at the time in question.  I was in the embassy and got on the telephone to the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to make the point.  People can say that they would like to get the same service and perhaps if they were in the same difficulty they would get it.  This does show that where the record is complete and the information is complete, the Department have sophisticated and efficient records.  The problems arise where the information on the record is not complete.  Obviously, in that case it was complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Seriously, unless the information is there, they cannot answer the Minister.  Certainly, the 15 minutes shattered me.  It made me a lot humbler about my complaints, queries and questions inside the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  The claimants are going to ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Only if they are in difficulties in England or somewhere else. In effect, it does indicate that if the information is there, the system is there to operate and in that sense it is a good system.  We depend on the forms being filled in and the numbers put in.  We also depend on the employers.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell raised the question of community welfare officers coming into the picture.  This has been discussed here on a number of occasions and I should be very keen to have this end of the system reviewed.  People still have in their minds that they are going for assistance and in the way it operates at times they feel that this is the case.  I accept that when problems arise arrangements need to be effective, efficient and quick on an interim basis.  I should certainly be keen to follow that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the present position regarding payment of social welfare benefits, apart from payment of the 1980 <Col N="882" /> budget increases to pensioners, generally all social welfare payments are being issued with a minimum of delay against the normal standard, where claims are correctly made and the payment is qualified on the insurance record for payment.  It appears, however, that difficulties are still arising for some claimants because of the failure of a certain number of employers to stamp insurance cards in time, particularly for the 1978-79 year &mdash; that is up to the end of March 1979, when the changeover to pay-related social insurance came into operation.</P>
    <P>It is estimated at the moment that at least 100,000 men's and women's cards for this period are still outstanding.  This will give Deputies an idea of the problem facing the Department.  That is throwing very considerable work on them in that area.  While every effort is being made to have the stamping done, the absence of these cards &mdash; which in some cases govern entitlement to benefit this year &mdash; is a major factor in delays of payment, particularly of disability benefit.</P>
    <P>In 1979 alone a total of more than £13 million was collected by the outdoor staff of my Department in arrears of the social welfare insurance contributions.  I think I told the Deputy previously in relation to abuses of the system by employees that I would not like to overstress the matter.  It is something that must be dealt with.  There were problems on the employers' side also and I admitted that to the Deputy.  It gives some indication of the kind of problems of the Department in that area.  The amount collected in 1979 was more than twice the amount collected in the preceding three years.</P>
    <P>In an effort to modernise the entire system of processing the payment of claims I am pushing ahead rapidly with the computerising of large areas of my Department.  Already the payment of disability benefits and treatment benefits are fully computerised.  At present the computerisation of the records system is under way and plans are well advanced for the payment by computer of unemployed benefit and assistance.  Furthermore, <Col N="883" /> a continuing process of examination of various aspects of the workings of my Department is being pursued by the Department's own team of organisation and methods specialists and imimprovements are being made on an ongoing basis as recommendations become available.</P>
    <P>Various steps are being taken by me in relation to delays.  I am very concerned about this matter.  I should like to assure the Deputy and the House that there is no question whatever of a deliberate go-slow in relation to payment.  This does not arise in connection with my Department or the Department of Finance.  Any of the problems that have occurred have happened in the areas I mentioned.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the rates of all social insurance and social assistance payments were increased substantially in this year's budget.  In the case of long-term payments &mdash; that is, all pensioners &mdash; the rate of increase was 25 per cent and it was 20 per cent in the case of short-term payments.  The increase in respect of children's allowances was 28 per cent.  Because of the short interval between the date of the budget and the dates from which the increases had effect, it would not have been possible to have pension order books at the increased rates printed and issued before the existing pension books expired at the end of March.  In order to avoid a situation where pensioners would have had no books on which to receive payments from the beginning of April, it was necessary for my Department to have two issues of pension books prepared for the 330,000 pensioners in the country. The first issue of books at the previous budget rates was made in March and the books were in the hands of pensioners to enable them to receive payment at these rates from the first week of April.  The second issue which provides for the weekly increases is being made at present. So far approximately 80 per cent of pensioners have received their supplementary pension books and it is expected that the issue of the balance of the books will be completed within the next <Col N="884" /> two or three weeks.  The Deputy may remember that a week ago when we discussed this matter that figure was two-thirds. It is now slightly more than 80 per cent and it will be obvious that the Department are dealing swiftly and efficiently with the matter.  Of course, the supplementary benefits are backdated and, consequently, the Deputy need not worry unduly about the matter.</P>
    <P>One major development that I am anxious to see come into operation as early as possible is the introduction of a second centre in Dublin.  The whole of Dublin is operated through Oisin House and Deputies will be aware that this centre is under great pressure.  We will not be able to cope with everything until there is another centre and that has been recognised for some time.  I am making arrangements to have Gandon House in Amiens Street opened in the near future to serve as a north side centre.  This will have a major effect on the entire delivery of service in Dublin.  I have given special priority to this matter because I realise that we will not improve the situation until more space is provided.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems that has caused delay in implementing this is the problem of providing the telecommunication requirements.  When we speak of difficulty in communicating between Oisin House and Aras Mhic Dhiarmada we are talking about telecommunications. There is a heavy requirement at Gandon House and Aras Mhic Dhiarmada for additional lines.  I am glad to say that the Minister concerned, Deputy Reynolds, is giving this matter special priority.  He is making special arrangements to ensure the necessary cabling is provided.  I expect that within a relatively short time we will be able to open a major north side centre that will provide the entire range of services.  This will be done at Gandon House.  Not only will the services on the north side be improved but it will relieve the pressure on the south side and I expect this to have a major effect.</P>
    <P>The PRSI system has been simplified and we should have more benefits from this as time goes on.  I am especially concerned <Col N="885" /> about stamping the deeds of transfer.  That has been brought to my attention by Deputies where the question of land transfer is involved in qualifying for pensions.  There has been delay on the legal side in having the transfer stamped. I am hoping to have a simplified procedure, to have some certification once the deed is lodged.  This is particularly important to rural Deputies and I am glad to tell them that this matter is being attended to.  I hope to have some information for them soon.  I mentioned previously the O and M studies being undertaken. This is another of the steps being taken to improve the service.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the question of information generally and referred to the links between the Department's information service and the public.  I am particularly pleased that the information will be effective.  I accept that there is need for emphasis on information in terms of conveying to people their absolute right to the services available and their benefits.  As the Deputy may know, in that respect I introduced a number of innovations recently.  We are preparing specific booklets at present &mdash; the Deputy said he would like to see leaflets &mdash; on the different sectors.  For instance, we shall have a booklet dealing specifically with widows which can be handed to people in information offices or to the widow herself or to relatives.  Instead of having to go through the excellent book which has been prepared each year by the Department, which is well indexed but which can be confusing if you are seeking specific information for yourself at a time when you are deeply concerned and worried, to facilitate people we are planning to bring together all information appertaining to widows in one booklet and all that pertains, for instance, to pensioners in another.  I agree information in that respect is particularly important and we have a number of measures under way at the moment in that connection.</P>
    <P>Already the new summary of social insurance and social assistance services produced by the Department of Social Welfare is now available which is not bad, given the timing in relation to the <Col N="886" /> recent budget.  All new measures that have been passed in Bills going through the House since the budget are included in that booklet.  That is currently available; but, in addition, we are working on booklets which will break it down into simpler parts and which will be more specific.</P>
    <P>We also have advertisements in newspapers and these have been simplified. In recent years a marketing job has been done on them and the advertisements made much clearer so that people can read them more easily. Another innovation this year in that respect was to have posters prepared from the information in the newspaper advertisements.  There is a large poster containing the new rates of benefits which is now available and it has been sent out to many information centres and national social services, old folks and meals on wheels centres and other interested centres that will be able to display them for the benefit of eligible persons.</P>
    <P>I agree about the importance of information but I am sorry the Deputy has sort of suggested that we have a passive policy on information.  I do not agree on that &mdash; this is a word that seems to be catching on in the House, or is being suggested as such.  I do not think it is fair in this case.  The policy as regards information is anything but passive.  Even following a predecessor who introduced quite a number of innovations in his own right, we have been going further along the lines of innovation in this area and we intend to continue in that way because I accept the basic premise of the Deputy that the information should be clear, simple and direct.</P>
    <P>I have noted the Deputy's point regarding the identity of officials.  I shall certainly try to ensure that identity is made clear by the most appropriate means.  I shall certainly look into that immediately.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke about an appeals policy and he himself mentioned the Ombudsman Bill currently going through the House.  That will provide for administrative <Col N="887" /> review or an appeal level. He also said that his motion was not a motion of no confidence in the Minister or his Department.  The motion says:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the failure of the Minister of Health and Social Welfare to ensure that....</P>
    <P>I do not know in what other way one could read that.  It does not leave much option but to express confidence in oneself in an amendment.  Nevertheless, I welcome the points made by the Deputy. He referred to women's claims for unemployment benefits.  I would point out that many married women with children are in fact receiving unemployment benefit and that this is just not true.  There may be more difficulty in that area than in other areas, as he has suggested.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned some of the immediate steps being taken.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Nolan, has been given particular responsibility for ensuring the efficient delivery of these services and for pursuing detailed aspects to ensure that the service goes through to eligible persons.  He is at present visiting centres around the country in that connection. While I welcome the views put forward by Deputies I do not at present see the need for an all-party committee of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This subject has been discussed a good deal in recent weeks and even months.  I welcome the Minister's statement that there has been no deliberate go-slow.  He has categorically stated that is not the case. Certainly, the impression was abroad and no matter how the public representative tried to nail it people genuinely were under the impression that there was a deliberate go slow.  In other Departments we had &mdash; I raised this here some weeks ago &mdash; the same suspicion that Departments were deliberately withholding payments of one kind or another.  Whatever about other Departments delaying in paying bills I should hate to think that the Minister's Department would play that game knowing that <Col N="888" /> we were dealing with the very lives of people and in many cases peoples' health.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's denial of that suggestion.</P>
      <P>The complaints regarding delay in payment of social welfare benefits date back as far as last November during the Cork by-election when it first came to notice.  On that occasion many were under the impression that it was deliberate policy then for political reasons.  Now that it has persisted for so long, even up to the present, I think we can discount that suggestion made at that time because the Minister's precedessor may have had a vested interest there.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's statement of the proposed computerising of at least of some of his Department so that many of the claims will now be processed by computer rather than depending on availability of staff and going through the system that has been there to date.  Even though computers can make mistakes we are more likely to get a quicker decision on claims.  I do not mean to cast a reflection in any way on the staff or any member of it dealing with these claims.  The Department's staff, as far as they can go under the system, are doing a good job but there is certainly something wrong with the system.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the statement which the Minister made here this evening in regard to the breaking down of the booklets.  The booklet which was issued in the past gives a pretty comprehensive account of the benefits available, but it was not the easiest booklet for the average person to read.  I welcome the separate booklet for widows, the separate booklet for pensioners and so on.  They will be a vast improvement in helping people to find out what is available to them.  That is about as much as I can say in welcome of the Minister's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While sitting here in the last half-hour I got a definite impression of complacency because the Minister was inclined to discount many of the complaints voiced here by Deputy O'Connell. The Minister gave figures and the <Col N="889" /> number of weeks that it would take to deal with an application for benefit.  In fact what he said is not the case and I am quite sure that he has had constituents coming to him, as all Deputies have, with complaints of delays much greater than those which the Minister speaks about.  Of course, there will always be the odd case of wrong information and in claiming social welfare benefits it will go far beyond the odd one, but cases dealt with in the time that the Minister speaks about are very much in the minority.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke of a committee of the House bringing a fresh view to the thinking of the social welfare system and the running of the Department.  Of course, the Minister is not going to give any consideration to that suggestion because the Taoiseach would feel that he should appoint a separate Minister for Social Welfare rather than have Opposition parties interfering in the running of the Government.  Many of us on this side of the House have been complaining over the last two years with regard to the delays in social welfare payments and it was accepted generally that the Minister for Social Welfare over that period &mdash; now the Taoiseach &mdash; was not very interested in the Department of Social Welfare. This may very well have been the reason for what seemed to be the Department's sliding and not being kept up to date. When the previous Minister became Taoiseach most of us expected that certainly the portfolios of Health and Social Welfare would not be held by the one person again.  All agreed that it was too heavy a load for any one person, but, despite our expectations, we discovered that Deputy Woods was to follow in Deputy Haughey's footsteps in both these Departments.  This was a disappointment to us, not but that we had the greatest of confidence in Deputy Woods and speaking in the House I welcomed his appointment to the Government, but it would have been wise of the Taoiseach to appoint a separate Minister for Social Welfare rather than to have a Minister dividing his day between the Departments of Health and Social Welfare. This move would have been welcomed <Col N="890" /> by the country at large because many people who are depending on the services of the Department of Social Welfare were just not getting the service they deserved.  However, when Deputy Woods was appointed we all thought that that fresh view was coming to the Department of Social Welfare and we hoped for a better service than we had been getting over the last two years.</P>
    <P>In Health particularly the Minister has quite a deal to contend with.  It is not an easy Department to carry.  Having the responsibility of the Department of Health and then having to spend half his time in the Department of Social Welfare must be proving quite a task for him.  I hope that he has that fresh view.  Perhaps we have expected too much in the months that have passed since his appointment late last year, but I do not think so.  The least the social welfare recipients or those entitled to social welfare payments could expect would have been some improvement in the time lag between their application and the receipt of money.  The Minister gave us an example of when he was in London in the Eugene Lambert episode a couple of weeks ago and it took 15 minutes for his call from London to the Department of Social Welfare to extract the information required.  Let us remember that it was a call from the Minister, not from somebody who was ill or out of work. Let us remember that it was only information the Minister was looking for.  He was not looking for the £20,000 bail money or for the £30 or £40 that many of these people who find themselves out of work are entitled to.  He was looking for information only and it is not quite fair of him to compare this swiftness of information coming over the telephone to the boss of the Department of Social Welfare with the delays experienced by people who have been paying in such sums to the Department for long periods and those experiencing at the time of their greatest need this long delay in payments. I hope the comparison the Minister gave does not mean that many of these people will have to find themselves in prison before they get swift action from the Department.</P>

      <P>I only gave the example to show that where the records are correct the Department's system is efficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that where the records are correct the information will flow.  I have many cases, as I am sure have many other public representatives, of people depending on social welfare money where it appears that the information supplied by them was correct but it was not processed in the swift manner the Minister experienced on this occasion.  I know of one case where a person was six weeks out of work and certificates were sent in every week.  This man was eventually notified that the certificates never arrived in the Department.  This is not an unusual complaint and it is happening far too often to blame the postal system.  This person had to get five duplicate certificates and send them on by registered post.  He is now three weeks back at work and to my knowledge he has not to this day received his money.  That is mighty different to the Minister's example.  This is not unusual and in some cases certificates have to be sent in even more than twice.  This is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of these cases because surely as a public representative he comes up against similar cases.  There was another case recently where a person was out of work sick in December 1979 and he was paid only in late February 1980.  This is far too slow.  There was a recent case of a young man with a wife and one child who had just bought a new house and was trying to furnish it when he became ill.  This was a time when he had spent more money than he had ever spent in his life and he had a huge mortgage which he found himself unable to pay. Only three weeks ago this man contemplated having to sell his house as his parents had given him as much money as they could, having previously helped him with the deposit on the house.  He had to turn to his wife's parents who also came to the rescue and gave him as much as they could.  When all sources available to him were exhausted he still <Col N="892" /> could not get the Department of Social Welfare to pay him his entitlements.  He had to borrow and to go further into debt despite the fact that he is entitled to unemployment assistance which was withheld by the Department.  The man got a cheque in October and one in April but he is still owed weeks of unemployment benefit although he is now two or three weeks back at work.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I thought that this motion would prompt the Minister to give greater hope to people depending on social welfare payments.  There have been complaints from personnel departments of some firms who are fed up to the teeth issuing documents certifying a person out of work in many cases long after he has gone back to work.  There is something radically wrong with the Department.  I do not know whether it is because of lack of space to deal with these matters efficiently or whether there is insufficient staff but the Minister is in the position to know what is wrong and I am disappointed that he has not given us the facts The Minister has nothing to lose by telling the truth.  Whether the Minister knows the facts and has withheld them or whether he does not know them, I do not know.  I would hate to think that the Minister knows them and has withheld them.  If the Minister did not know the facts the excuse could be made up to recently that he was carrying too big a load.  While we made excuses for his predecessor we cannot afford to make the same excuses any longer because enough Ministers and junior Ministers were appointed in the last few months to enable changes to be made in this Department so that delays in payments in many instances can be halved.</P>
    <P>The postal strike was mentioned tonight.  Of course there were delays because of the postal strike.  There was a lesson there for the Minister.  He should be prepared to move away from his dependence on the postal service.  We should have regional offices where applications could be processed.  If the Minister is computerising part of his Department he should look at this and <Col N="893" /> ensure that local applications are dealt with locally instead of coming to Dublin, waiting for a reply and being clogged up in the system.  We can refer to the area of County Dublin where the population has increased at such a rate over the past few years.  In my own town of Tallaght, the Minister's Department was dependent on the Garda station down the years when there were only four or five gardaí in the station, a town with a population of 3,000 to 4,000 ten or 12 years ago. That population has increased to almost 60,000 today.  What steps have the Department taken to ensure that the percentage of those 60,000 who are dependent from time to time on them for payments are getting the services to which they are fully entitled?</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department are still dependent on the Garda station.  The information we are getting from the Department of Social Welfare is that they are looking for a suitable premises in Tallaght for an employment exchange. Dozens of shops have opened in Tallaght in the past ten or 12 years. Thousands of houses have been built and people are living there for the past ten or 12 years.  Many factories have been built during that time and when we make inquiries about an employment exchange the Department say they are looking for a suitable premises.  Everyone else can find suitable premises in Tallaght for their businesses but the Minister's Department have been looking for suitable premises for the past six or eight years and cannot find them.</P>
    <P>There is something radically wrong here.  I do not want to cast any reflection on the staff who are dealing with these applications, but I would urge the Minister to devote a little more time to the Department of Social Welfare and root out whatever is wrong with the system or come into this House and tell us frankly what is wrong.  The country will admire the Minister for that.  If the problem is brought into the open them we are half way towards solving it.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a few brief comments on this motion tonight.  Every Deputy is aware that last year there were serious delays in making these payments because of industrial problems.  Lest people might get the wrong idea listening to this debate, it is only fair to say that this year the problem has not been as great as it was last year.  Social workers who deal with these matters on a day to day basis will admit freely that, while the situation is not completely satisfactory, there has been an improvement.  This is not a new problem which cropped up in the Department of Social Welfare last year.  There have been delays in payments, and problems arose because of wrong numbers submitted by applicants. Letters without addresses were submitted and people quoted their pay-related number instead of their insurance number. The staff in the Department who have to deal with a large number of people and a great deal of correspondence cannot be inspired to solve the problem when Mr. X writes in and omits some of the details required.  In a rural town you would know a person's handwriting, but this is not the case in a large Department.</P>
      <P>I know members of the staff in the Department of Social Welfare.  They get correspondence which they cannot deal with easily, and they have to try to trace it back to the writers.  Constituents often admit that they make errors and, when those errors are rectified, the Department do what they can, and the Minister does all he can for Deputies, to rectify these matters as quickly as possible.  In the past few years our social services have grown.  Oisin House has become overcrowded and the staff cannot deal adequately with the number of people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been very positive tonight.  He said that Gandon House will be open in the next few months.  That statement is very welcome.  We all realise this will mean an improvement in the services <Col N="895" /> given to the people of the city.  The Minister has made it clear that he considers it a matter of urgency to rectify this matter which should have been rectified many years ago.  The Minister has given time and commitment to the Department of Social Welfare.  Old age pensions, retirement pensions, unemployment benefit, invalidity benefit and all the other benefits were increased substantially this year.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the fact that all these benefits will be dealt with more speedily in Gandon House on the north side.</P>
    <P>Insinuations have been made that the Minister gives more time to one area of his responsibility than to another.  People have short memories and they do not <Col N="896" /> remember the substantial increases right across the board which the Minister fought for during the budget discussions in a year when it was difficult to get increases. These were the biggest increases ever given in the history of this State.  If a Minister is expected to make sure that Mr. X's cards are correct and properly stamped, and that letters are answered, perhaps we should have a couple of thousand Ministers all round the country. The Minister's job is to formulate policy and to ensure that all the people are cherished equally.</P>

      <P>Capital expenditure for the improvement of the public library service has been sanctioned over the past ten years in the amounts set out in the table beneath.  The loan charges arising from the borrowing involved in these and earlier library projects have been subsidised at the rate of 50 per cent by grants from An Chomhairle Learbharlanna.  The cost of this subsidy, which amounted to £912,178 over the ten years in question, has been recouped to An Chomhairle from my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>Borrowing proposals for library improvements in 1980 will be decided very shortly and the local authorities concerned will be notified as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 216, 217 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>I have stated in reply to previous questions by the Deputy that the chemical 245-T in the formulation in use by my Department poses no threat to man or his environment.  Accordingly in replying to the three questions tabled for written reply I do not accept his description of the herbicide as being hazardous or dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing the following is the information sought: (a) I have requested my Department to make available to the Deputy a copy of existing instructions (including normal safety precautions) covering the use of 245-T and other non-hazardous herbicides; (b) The amount discharged per worker may vary from 10-20 litres <Col N="807" /> (diluted with up to 20 times its volume of water) in one day depending on local conditions; (c) The four hours does not represent a fixed rotation: it is merely indicative of normal maximum period during which a worker might be so employed.  A longer period would not be seen as representing any hazard; (d) No instructions to discontinue the use of 245-T have been issued for the reason given at outset; (e) Last purchase was 6,000 litres in 1977 at a cost of £14,000 approximately to supplement existing stocks.  Stock in hands is not known pending the completion of an inventory now in progress.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to be assured that service will not be interrupted in the future as cables can develop faults unexpectedly.</P>
