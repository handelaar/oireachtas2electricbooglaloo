      <P>The Taoiseach sent word through the whips that the Finance Bill will not be taken until, at the earliest, 6 May.  Does the Taoiseach not consider this unsatisfactory, for a major piece of legislation the Second Stage of which must be finished by 15 May?</P>

      <P>Deputies will appreciate that the interval between the date of the budget and the circulation of the Bill is determined by a number of factors especially by the number of changes that have to be made.  This year the interval will be 68 days.  Deputies opposite will appreciate that this is not unduly long having regard to the intervals that occurred in 1974 and 1977.  If Deputies take into account the significant amendments to the Finance Bill because of the new income tax scheme and the provision for the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing companies this year they will understand that this is far from being unduly long and is reasonable in the circumstances. The House will have a week before the Second Stage is taken and precedents set in previous years show that the time available for discussion on Second Stage is reasonable.</P>

      <P>I assume the Minister is answering on behalf of the Taoiseach. Does the Minister not consider that in this major legislation there are people involved besides Members of the House and that people from various organisations outside of the House will want to see the Bill and make representations to the Minister and Deputies before the Bill is taken?</P>

      <P>Deputies will appreciate that most of these representations would arise on Committee Stage. The limitations relate rather to the circulation of the Bill and the conclusion of the Second Stage.  I am sure Deputies opposite have been getting representations as I have, but these matters can be dealt with satisfactorily on what is after all the major element of the Finance Bill, the discussions on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that when Fianna Fáil took office in 1977 the economic outlook for this country was never better.  In 1977 we had achieved the highest growth rate in the EEC.  In fact we had achieved the second highest growth rate in the OECD countries.  It was an exceptional performance for us.  I <Col N="1801" /> would point out to the House and to the country that the basic groundwork for this performance was laid by the strategy and the work of the National Coalition during their period in office. Confirmation of this situation is to be found in the words of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, in his budget speech in 1978.  Referring to 1977 he said:</P>
      <P>Last year, we achieved the highest growth rate in the EEC and the second highest in the OECD.  The economy expanded by over 5 per cent&mdash;twice the EEC average and well above the OECD average of 3½ per cent.</P>
      <P>The Economic Background to the Budget, which was published on 24 January, gives a detailed review of the economy in 1977....  Growth apart, the most notable development in 1977 was the dramatic fall in inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The healthy state of the economy at that time can be attributed in large measure to the strategy and the management of the Coalition Government.  Now, just two and a half years later, under the present Government, we have an economy that is in a serious state of disarray.  This is evidenced by Government borrowings which have exceeded £1,000 million in 1979.  Inflation is rapidly approaching 20 per cent.  Bank interest rates which, even prior to the last increase were exceptionally high are, following this latest increase, at an unprecedented level.  This has in turn led to major social unrest which is obvious at present in the agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors of our community.  I am sorry to say that the major blame for this situation rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government who, with their election manifesto of 1977, raised the expectations of the people here far beyond what our economy could sustain. I do not need to emphasise that because it has been pointed out often enough, but an example would be the abolition of rates; a further example which has been quoted often is the abolition <Col N="1802" /> of car tax.  The net result of this situation is a frank admission by the new Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, in his budget speech this year:</P>
    <P>The farming community met serious difficulties during the year resulting in an unexpected fall in their incomes.  The pattern of industrial disputes and, in particular, the industrial dispute in the Post Office, which commenced in February and was to last until June, caused disruption of services and interference with private, commercial and industrial life.  A recently published EEC report indicated that, relatively we lost more man-days through industrial stoppages in 1978 than any other EEC country.  Our experience in 1979 can hardly have improved the record.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to state then:</P>
    <P>So what started off as a year with great economic opportunities, eventually deteriorated to the point of serious setback to the targets for growth and financial stability which the Government had set for the year as a whole.</P>
    <P>From the situation in 1977 to that admission by the Minister for Finance at the commencement of this year it is obvious that the management of the country in the hands of the present Government has been of a very poor quality.  Unhappily the country has been badly mismanaged and now faces a serious situation.</P>
    <P>Now, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to deal with some of the proposals that affect my area of responsibility in this House, consumer affairs.  I will deal with the increases in taxation on petrol, road diesel and heating oil.  These increases are based on a premise by the Minister that the public are wasteful in their use of petrol, road diesel and heating oil.  I believe that the Minister's premise is incorrect and inaccurate, The Minister himself must surely be aware that in some parts of rural Ireland there are no alternative forms of transport other than private motor cars for people who have <Col N="1803" /> to travel a distance to work.  Increased costs in the public service in urban areas has resulted, in many instances, in people going back to using private cars.  I doubt if people have been wasteful in their use of energy since the increases in 1973 and 1974.  They have been endeavouring to cut down in their use of it.  However, the result following the budget increases is that a person travelling to work now finds that his petrol bill has increased by £1 or in excess of that. Diesel and petrol increases will lead to rising industrial costs which affect the price of all goods.  These increases will have a significant effect on the consumer price index which will also be affected by the increased taxation on beer and spirits.</P>
    <P>In speeches made by various Ministers external factors have been blamed for the increase in our inflation rate whereas in fact the tax hikes in petrol, diesel, oil, VAT, drink, post office charges and so on will drive up the inflation rate.  As a result of the budget this will be somewhere in excess of 4 per cent.  That increase in the inflation rate is being directly fuelled by the Government's own policies.  All these increases are bound to encourage strong demands from the trade union movement for increases in wages.  The Minister should also bear in mind the fact that the increases will lead to increased costs for the public services.  The situation would appear to be that we will be faced with a supplementary budget in the autumn of this year which will further increase taxation. This is all the responsibility of the Government.  If there is a supplementary budget it will lead to price increases and will drive up inflation even further.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to ask himself exactly what type of scenario he is helping to paint for the economy.  It presents an unhappy picture for the economy to see our inflation rate heading rapidly towards 20 per cent. When the mid-May figures are produced we will have an inflation rate of 19½ per cent to 20 per cent.  It is only right that somebody should shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo; to the Government in regard to this situation. <Col N="1804" /> With inflation of that magnitude every working man who is married with a family is bound to suffer.  His standard of living and that of his wife and children will suffer.  Inflation of that magnitude is forcing up prices and, as food becomes more expensive, it will be more difficult for a working man to feed his family. Clothes and shoes will become more expensive as will all basic household goods.  It will affect the standard of living of old age penisoners, widows and one-income families.</P>
    <P>A further alarming point is that with costs and inflation rising by that amount our competitiveness abroad will be affected. There is a serious danger that this will lead to a reduction in demand for our products and exports with the consequent danger of rising unemployment at home.  Since 1980 dawned we have witnessed an increase in ESB charges of 20.5 per cent and an increase in CIE fares of 20 per cent.  In the budget the Minister announced that post office charges would be increased, some from 1 May and some from 1 July.  The increases will be in the region of 20 per cent to 25 per cent, with 25 per cent being the more likely figure.  Coal, milk, bread, baby food, bottled gas and countless other items have risen rapidly in price since the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>Price increases of this size present a danger to the whole fabric of our society.  They appear to be getting seriously out of control and instead of the Government trying to do something about the position they are helping to worsen it.  They are largely to blame for what is happening to our inflation rate.  I should like to warn them seriously to consider where they are leading the country at this time and to take action to curb inflation and price increases before it is too late.  If not, there will be runaway inflation in the not too distant future.  The people cannot take further price increases of this magnitude.  If such price increases continue they will cause unrest of a serious nature.  Our economy cannot take inflation of this kind.  If it continues it will place a serious strain on the punt to retain its place within the <Col N="1805" /> EMS.  The Government must act immediately before it is too late to stop runaway inflation.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister dealt with food subsidies at length.  He stated that:</P>
    <P>It continues to be the Government's belief that food subsidies applying as they do irrespective of individual needs do not sufficiently discriminate in favour of the less well-off sections of the community.  We gave very full consideration, therefore, to the question of further reducing them in line with our declared intentions.</P>
    <P>It appears as if it is still Government policy, in line with their declared intentions, to dismantle food subsidies further.  When food subsidies were introduced by the Coalition in 1975-76 inflation at that stage on the consumer price index was in the region of 20 per cent.  Once food subsidies were introduced inflation dropped from about 20 per cent to about 10.8 per cent in 1976-77 and 1977-78 it dropped to 7.9 per cent.  One of the major blunders this Government made was the dismantling of food subsidies in 1978.  This led to an increase in the rate of inflation from 7.9 per cent to 16 per cent.  The dismantling of food subsidies directly increased the cost of foodstuffs, triggered off dissatisfaction among the trade unions and created unrest among the workers which resulted in very big wage increases&mdash;far higher than would have been sought if food subsidies had been retained.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious lesson to be learned from just one look at the consumer price index but the Government are considering a further dismantling of food subsidies.  I want to warn them against taking such a step.  I again call on them to restore in full the food subsidies which existed when the Coalition were in power.  This would help to break the upward spiral of inflation and moderate wage demands.  Most important, it will have the effect of helping large families, working families, one income families, old age pensioners and <Col N="1806" /> widows to get food at reduced prices.  A present the majority of these people find food prices excessive.  I do not want to make a political point about this.  The Minister should bring this message to the Government who would immediately set about restoring food subsidies.  This would be for the betterment of all our people.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn my attention to interest rates&mdash;bank interest rates, mortgage rates, post office saving rates and all other interest rates.  Even before the latest bank rate increases, interest rates were excessive.  The latest increases are a major blunder by the associated banks because people in industry, agriculture or borrowing to build houses will find it is beyond their capacity to repay loans at such high interest rates.  Interest rates are at a dangerously high and unprecedented level and will have frightening consequences for the economy.</P>
    <P>After the announcement by the associated banks I warned of the danger that would follow from the increases in bank interest rates.  In a statement I warned the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Government that these increases could have disastrous effects on many sensitive industries and on agriculture.  I pointed out that in some cases they could mean the difference between survival and closure. I was gratified to note that at least one Minister&mdash;Deputy O'Malley&mdash;heard what I had to say and appeared to be about to take some action to remedy the situation.  Unfortunately at the Fianna Fáil Youth Conference what he had to say he said too late and, in my view, it was a case of shadow boxing.  There was a lot of huffing and puffing by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That Minister and the Government must be concerned that they did not call on the banks before the increases were granted or instruct the Central Bank not to grant those increases.  I knew, and everybody who read a newspaper knew two or three weeks before the interest rates were announced that they were to be increased.  I do not know if the <Col N="1807" /> Government knew about that but everybody else did.  They should have told the associated banks not to apply for the increases and the Central Bank should have been instructed not to allow the increases.</P>
    <P>This day last week in this House I said that throughout the world bank interest rates appeared to have reached a peak and to be on a downward trend.  I am not an economist; I read newspapers, booklets and other printed matter. I read in a newspaper the following day that interest rates had reached their peak and in America they appeared to be on the downward trend.  The banks should have been aware of this.  The Central Bank should not have allowed the increase when it was sought by the associated banks because we are now presented with a dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>I understand the Agricultural Credit Corporation are meeting today to consider increasing the rate they will charge to farmers who are now in danger of an imposition of 20 per cent for moneys borrowed from the ACC.  There is not the kind of money in any sector of farming, be it dairying, beef cattle production, cereal or vegetable production, to enable farmers to pay 20 per cent on moneys borrowed either from the banks or the ACC.  Therefore, even a small increase in interest rates will have a detrimental effect on farming.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism said that high interest rates would have a serious effect on many firms, some of whom would be faced with closure.  Was he huffing and puffing, or was he serious?  In a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 April he is reported as having said that he regretted more companies had not availed of the lower interest rates available in other EEC countries.  He said that despite the facilities of the ICC and the ACC, small firms were still running into problems but were unwilling to take the risk of borrowing abroad because of currency fluctuations.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that an Irish firm borrows abroad and that the currency in <Col N="1808" /> which it got the loan increased in value. Will the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism provide the money for that firm to bridge the gap between what it paid for the loan and its repayments in the appreciated currency?  Will he urge the Minister for Finance in the Finance Bill to make arrangements to safeguard such a firm for borrowings in the EMS?  If not, he is not serious in expressing concern for Irish industry or agriculture.  He should make arrangements with the Central Bank, through the Minister for Finance, to give the type of protection I have been asking for.  If he does so I will congratulate him, even shake his hand.  Of course, he may have been bluffing, he may not be as serious as he appeared to be when he spoke about survival or closure for small firms.</P>
    <P>Interest rates throughout the EEC are far lower than ours.  We have one of the highest if not the highest rates in the EMS.  In Germany the rate is less than 10 per cent.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism must make some arrangement with the building societies to keep their interest rates at their present level.</P>
    <P>Regularly, I meet young married couples who at the moment are living in dread of further increases in mortgage repayment rates.  Already they are put to the pins of their collars to try to buy and furnish their houses.  Many of them on the outskirts of Dublin have to drive to work and they are alarmed at the prospect of mortgage rates being increased by another two to two and a half per cent on top of the increased price of petrol.  Are the Government aware of the stress these people are living under? Already they are barely able to meet monthly mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is vital that the Government, by subsidy, should keep the building society rates at their present level.  If they do not do so the Government will be guilty of a serious dereliction of duty because there is a solemn obligation on them to act as we did when in Government to provide a subsidy in respect of mortgage repayments.  I call on them urgently to do so.  Young married <Col N="1809" /> couples on the outskirts of this city are living in dread and fear of an announcement by the building societies in the next few days.  I know young wives who have to attend doctors for nervous complaints and young married men are seriously concerned because their entire lives are occupied not only trying to meet mortgage repayments but increased ESB bills, doctors' bills and food prices.  As I said, the Government have a bounden duty to ensure that building society rates will not be increased.  The Minister for Finance announced an increase to £2,400 in the allowance for income tax.  That suits the better off people very well but it does not make any difference and is not of any advantage to the one income household.</P>
    <P>Reverting to agriculture, I ask the Minister for Finance and the Government to have a further look at the resource tax.  In my view it was misconceived and it will be looked on as the two per cent levy was last year.  Many rural Fianna Fáil Deputies know the situation in agriculture as well as I do. The Minister has admitted that in the year 1979 farm incomes fell by 4 per cent.  In some cases I believe those incomes fell by as much as 15 to 20 per cent.  However the Minister's admission is important&mdash;that farm incomes fell by 4 per cent.  That drop in income of farmers was matched by an inflation rate on average of approximately 15½ per cent, presenting a gloomy picture for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The livestock figures published for December 1979 should be thought about, discussed and dwelt on by the Government.  Those figures show a serious drop in cow numbers, a drop in the number of heifers-in-calf by as much as 17,500, with a drop in under-two-year-old cattle of almost 10,000, again presenting a serious picture.  I admit that there was an increase, I think of .6 per cent, in the overall numbers of cattle. But the figures carrying longer-term effects are those in regard to cows and heifers-in-calf.  Somebody on the Government benches may maintain that the numbers are dropping because of <Col N="1810" /> disease eradication.  I would rebut any such contention by saying that the numbers for sheep and pigs are down also, sheep by 58,000 and pigs by 29,000.  Therefore, we are faced with a situation in which the numbers of cows, heifers-in-calf, sheep and pigs have dropped seriously.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of these figures.  Yet his only response is that he will increase taxation on farmers, that he will introduce a brand new resource tax&mdash;I do not know where he dreamt that one up&mdash;but anyway he will introduce it.  It must be remembered that agricultural exports are of vital importance to our economy and to the general prosperity of the country as a whole.  Yet there is this suggestion of the introduction of a resource tax.  In 1979 when the 2 per cent levy was being introduced I warned that it could have the effect of reducing livestock numbers, that a levy of that nature could have serious reprecussions.  I am again warning the Government&mdash;as I and my party issued a warning when the 2 per cent levy was being introduced&mdash;that there is the danger of serious repercussions in regard to this resource tax also.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture has gone through a very difficult period.  The obvious investment throughout rural areas&mdash;dairy buildings, piggeries, sheds and fences being erected and lands being manured&mdash;is continuing but I regret to say on a drastically reduced scale.  A thriving agricultural community and industry are of great importance to this country.  I would hope that the Minister and the Taoiseach, who have had discussions with the IFA, will see fit to withdraw this resource tax before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I have here the budget speeches of the respective Ministers for Finance for the years 1978 to 1980 inclusive.  I would point out that I live in the heart of rural Ireland where we have a river called the Shannon.  I regret to say that in any of the budget speeches I have read rarely if ever does the Shannon surface.  Indeed, I had reason only last week to visit the Minister of State, Deputy McEllistrim, <Col N="1811" /> in his Department in regard to a river adjoining the Shannon.  In the near future some Minister for Finance will have to incorporate some reference to the river Shannon in his budget speech. Some Government Department will have to take a serious look to ascertain what can be done regarding its drainage. Some Government will have to present a fully documented file to be brought to Brussels outlining our budgetary policy and strategy in an endeavour to prepare plans for the drainage of the Shannon.  In the Shannon basin there are 250,000 acres of land being flooded annually, to which we seem to have no answer. Rather we allow the situation to jog along and do nothing about it.  Many Deputies have longer memories of elections than I but something churned out in the past by all sides of this House was the drainage of the River Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when we handed him a document requesting the final stages of investigation to be carried out. As the House is probably aware, Ridell, the Office of Public Works and the ESB carried out an investigation in the period from 1956 to 1960 which led nowhere.  It is vital that the Government now provide funds to have a final and thorough investigation carried out into this most important matter.  If such were properly undertaken then we could obtain the necessary moneys from the EEC to have this drainage carried out.  This matter affects the counties of Cavan, Westmeath, Longford, Offaly, Galway, Tipperary and Clare where the lands are all flooded and where in many cases <Col N="1812" /> farmers are paying rates on lands flooded for eight months of the year. This country cannot afford the loss of all of these lands.  The Shannon's potential in regard to tourism, industry and so on could be fully developed, whereas at present it is proving to be more of a liability that an asset.  Indeed, people tend to turn their eyes to heaven when the drainage of the Shannon is talked about because of the way this matter has been allowed to drag on in the past.</P>
      <P>I urge that the preparatory work be carried out for a proper case to be brought across to Brussels for EEC aid for this most important work.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously some of the thoughts that I and others on this side of the House have put before him in regard to this budget of 1980.</P>

    <P>Mar sin féin caithfidh mé cúpla focal a rá i dtaobh na cáinaisnéise, Ní mór dom a rá go bhfuil beagnach sé bhliain imithe ó chuaigh Fianna Fáil isteach i gcumhacht agus caithfidh gach duine a admháil gur ag dul in olcas atá staid na Gaeltachta.  Seachtain i ndiaidh seachtain tareis na cáinaisnéise tá buille tubaisteach á thabhairt ag an Rialtas do ansan gur chuir an Rialtas dallamullóg ar na daoine sin.  Cúpla seachtain ó shin chur mé ceist go dtí Aire na Gaeltachta i ansan go chuir an Rialtas dallamullóg ar na daoine sin.  Cúpla seachtain ó shin chur mé ceist go dtí Aire na Gaeltachta i dtaobh an méid ardú airgid a thug an tAire dos na mná tí i gcóir na coláistí samhraidh atá ar siúl sna Gaeltachtaí gach bliain.  Is mór an trua anois go bhfuil scanradh ar chuid des na mná sin nach bhfuil an spriod acu a n-ainm féin a chur go dtí na litreacha atá siad ag seoladh go dtí na Teachtaí Dála atá ag maireachtain san Ghaeltacht.  Níl a fhios <Col N="1813" /> agam cén fáth go bhfuil an scanradh sin ar na mná céanna, mar an chéad rud a thagann isteach sa cheann agam i leith na daoine atá ag rith na colaistí samhraidh, na daoine atá i gceannas orthu, an bhfuil eagla ar na mná tí gearán poiblí a dhéanamh.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, seo ceann des na litreacha a fuair mise, agus fuair mé morán acu ó mnátithe.  Ar dtús tá sean aithne agat ar mo scríobhneoir.  Tá an litir anseo agam.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Márta 22</P>
    <P>Corca Dhúine.</P>
    <P>A Mhichíl a chara,</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ár gcás a chur in úil duit, go bhfuilimíd ana-mhí-shásta mar gheall ar an 10p sa ló árdú as gach scoláire a choimeádaimíd i rith trí mí an tsamhraidh ó Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Bhuail cuid againn le Aire na Gaeltachta nuair a tháinig sí go dtí Liospóil agus cheapamar go ndéanfadh sí i bhfad níos fearr dúinn.  Is trua scaoileadh léi cho bog san ach ní haon chabhair sinne a bheith ag caint.  Ba gheall le magadh é nuair a fuaramar litir uaithe ag cur in úil duinn go deich bpingin sa ló as gach scoláire a bhí le fáil againn.</P>
    <P>Tá i bhfad níos mó sa litir ach an prionsabal atá ag cur isteach orm ná, an bhfuil sort brú ar chuid des na mná siúd. Tá an litir seo sínithe ag mná tí Chorca Dhuíne.  Tá sé le fáil ag gach aoinne atá á lorg.  An rud atá ag cur isteach orm &mdash;an bhfuil brú de shaghas éigin á chur ar na mná tí sin nach bhfuil siad abalta labhairt amach go poiblí.  B'fhéidir an t-aon chúis atá mé féin ábalta cur suas ná go bhfuil cuid des na daoine atá i mo cheann des na colaistí samhraidh i Corca Dhúine b'fhéidir gur muintir Fhianna Fáil iad, agus tá na mná ag cur gearán poiblí nach bhfaighidh siad aon scoláire.  Sin é an chúis atá agam féin ar sin.  Tá a fhios ag gach aoinne cén mhaith 10p sa ló chun páiste a choimead san Ghaeltacht.  Tá im, bainne, feoil arán, gach rud imithe suas, agus tá sé de dhánaíocht ag an Aire 10p a thabhairt i dtaobh na gcostas sin.  Nil bun ná barr leis an scéal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> Tháinig Aire na Gaeltachta isteach anseo cúpla seachtain agus labhair sí ar feadh uair a chloig ar Udarás na Gaeltachta.  An tUdarás céanna, tá sé i gcumhacht anois le beagnach cúig mhí. Níl tada le féachaint ag muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil sé ann in aonchur. Nuair a bhí an Bille ag rith tríd an Dáil, rinne mé féin agus Páirti an Lucht Oibre agus Páirtí Fhine Gael roinnt leasúchán a chur síos chun cumhacht a thabhairt don Údarás céanna, cumhacht a bheadh le feiscint ag gnáth daoine na Gaeltachta.  Níl an tAire céanna ann anois agus caithfidh mé a rá ag an bpointe seo go rabhtas ana-cheanúil ar an Aire sin mar fear a thug cothrom na Féinne agus a rinne a dhóthain an son muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ag dul thar n-ais go dtí an tÚdarás, níl aon chumhacht ag an Udarás faoi bhóithre, iascaireacht, phleanáil nó aon ní ach an t-aon chumhacht atá aige, cumhacht i dtaobh tionsclaíochta.  Ach tá cumhacht aige faoi thionsclaíocht, tá i bhfad níos mó cumhachta ag SFADCo agus ag an IDA atá ag obair, measaim féir anois, i gcoinne Udarás na Gaeltachta.  Is mór an trua é sin freisin go bhfuil an IDA, SFADCo agus Udarás na Gaeltachta ag troid laistiar de na dóirse i dtaobh monarchana éagsúla atá ag dul isteach sna háiteanna iargcúlta go mór mhór sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Measaim go mba cheart d'Aire na Gaeltachta dul isteach arís san argóint atá ar siúl agus an cumhacht céanna atá ag SFADCo agus an IDA a thabhairt do Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a bhí an tAire ag caint faoi dhíospóireacht na cáinaisnéise cheapfá go raibh the sun, moon and stars ag muintir na Gaeltachta toisc go raibh an tÚdarás ann, ach brathann aon chumhacht atá ag an Údarás sin ar ordú an Aire, agus caithfidh an tAire cead a fháil ón Rialtas an t-ordú sin a dhéanamh.  Mar sin, níl san Údarás ach sop in áit na scuaibe.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go mba cheart féachaint géar a dhéanamh go mór mhór ar iarthar na tíre, chun SFADCo, an IDA agus Údarás na Gaeltachta, a thabhairt le chéile faoi bhrat amháin.  Faoi láthair níl <Col N="1815" /> aon dul as ag an Údarás ach bheith ina &ldquo;poor relation&rdquo; ag an IDA agus SFADCo.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length on the state of the Gaeltachts.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht spoke in this House a few weeks ago and one would think from the tone of her remarks that the people of the Gaeltacht were living in Utopia since the coming into existence of the new údarás.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The stark, naked reality of the situation is that the Gaeltachts will be non-existent by the end of the eighties unless something drastic is done.  If the people of the Gaeltacht are to survive and have their own identity, culture, language and music, the Government of the day will have to take care of the needs and anxieties of these people.</P>
    <P>There have been so many reports on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht that they would fill the National Library.  We have had surveys, censuses of population and intellectuals from abroad, even an American expert, to tell us how the Gaeltachts should survive.</P>
    <P>The budget provision of £100,000 is not much use to the people of the Gaeltacht.  There was a failure to recognise that Údarás na Gaeltachta is now in direct competition with SFADCo and the IDA.  The Government must realise that these three bodies should be under one umbrella.  There is no point in three State companies fighting one another to attract an industry to a particular area.  Everybody knows that the big boy will win and the údarás will be relegated to third place.</P>
    <P>In terms of the budget, the Government must consider the whole west of Ireland as a unit.  Local authorities in the west and throughout the whole country no longer have much relevance because they have not the finance to carry out improvements or begin new schemes suggested by local councillors.  The Government have a golden opportunity to do something positive if they have the willpower to change the whole infrastructure of the depressed areas.  An <Col N="1816" /> industrialist will not go to the west or the south when the telephone and road systems are in such an appalling condition. In the competition to attract industry the east and midland counties will win.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has been very mean to the local authorities and has tied their hands completely.  No money has been given to Kerry County Council or to any other county council to start building more houses.  We are now nearly at 1 May and you have no money to start.  Surely the months of November and December are not the time to start?  I take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister of State, if he has any influence at all, to get the Department of the Environment to release immediately block grants to start houses&mdash;whether in the counties of Kerry, Cork, Galway, Donegal or Mayo.</P>

      <P>If this situation continues as it is we shall have massive redundancies in local authorities.  The personnel of local authorities have been built up for years to carry out certain projects.  If the money for the projects is not there, there is no point in keeping on these officials and we shall have massive redundancies. We had last month a local authority meeting to discuss water schemes, to be told that there was no money for water schemes.  The situation is so bad that Ireland has come to a standstill under the Fianna Fáil Government and under the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  This reminds me of the old phrase of the Blasket islandman.  I shall give it in English because the Deputy certainly would not understand the Irish.</P>

He said that the Government at the present <Col N="1818" /> time is like a tinker's mule, one leg up today, the other leg up tomorrow, depending on the boreen they went over. That is very true; this Government is certainly like the tinker's mule.  Nobody knows, particularly from the budget, what crisis is around the corner.  To tell the House how much the Government are out of touch I shall refer to a few items in the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto. I am told that this document is no longer available.  This copy could be a museum item, so I shall have to watch it very closely.</P>

      <P>Someone was looking for a copy lately and could not obtain one.  I am quoting from page 11 of the manifesto:</P>
      <P>We will abolish the seven day rule arising out of the outer UK zone, in respect of fuel price increases, as there is no price control at all under the present system.</P>
      <P>That sounds very hollow today.  I am still quoting.</P>
      <P>The accounting procedures of the ESB will be examined and brought up to date with a view to reducing the price of electricity. </P>
      <P>It is no wonder that the man who wrote this was thrown out of his job by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I understand why the Taoiseach does not want to hear high up or low down about the manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the local authority issue, if money is not made available to the local authorities the Government should have the necessary courage to tell them that they are no longer relevant as far as the structures of local government are concerned and would be advised to liquidate slowly and get out of business.  That is what it amounts to.  The local authorities have not enough money to put up a public light outside a church gate.  A couple of years ago the Deputy's party <Col N="1819" /> were able to put a light outside public houses.  It just goes to show how the position has deteriorated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point on the budget is in relation to agriculture.  Being brought into the income tax net will be very hard, especially on people with £40 valuation. It will be exceedingly difficult for them to pay rates and income tax.  £40 valuation in County Kerry and £40 valuation in other parts of Ireland are two different things altogether.  Some of the £40 valuations in County Kerry were in regard to old estates which were divided up.  Because they were divided up recently, the valuation was extra high.  If they had been divided up 15 to 20 years ago&mdash;and the Minister would possibly agree with this&mdash;the valuation would have been no more than £15 or £20.  The valuation now being put on land which is being divided is excessive in the extreme. <Col N="1820" /> It will be very difficult for farmers to make ends meet.  As long as I am in public life, and I am in it a good many years now, I have never had as many farmers coming to me as I have at the moment, asking for their grants to be expedited, whether it is for farm modernisation, the milk premium scheme, machinery grants scheme or milk products scheme&mdash;no matter what scheme it is.  The situation is becoming chaotic and I do not know the reason for it.  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to take particular note of my comments.  When he spoke on the budget, he did not refer to the delay in payment of grants.  These farmers are now so hard pressed for money that they have to take every bob, no matter where it comes from, because the bank managers are pressing them for the loans that have been given.  I hope that, following on my remarks here today, payment of all outstanding grants due to people&mdash;no matter what part of Ireland they live in&mdash;under the farm modernisation schemes in their various categories will be expedited immediately.</P>
    <P>The resource tax is just not on and the Taoiseach knows that it is not on.  I would prefer him to come out openly and boldly say that it is finished, that the Government thought about it and decided it was a non-runner, not accepted by the farming organisations and that it is finished.  They should not be creating &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; and friction in the farming community because of that tax. It is a bad tax and the Minister of State knows that.  I hope that the Taoiseach will immediately put a stop to the &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; which is going on.</P>
    <P>Another point about agriculture is the question of the EEC grants under the drainage scheme in the west of Ireland. The Minister for Agriculture in his speech on the budget made a passing reference to this.  This scheme has been a non-runner from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; because the Government are not prepared to put up £ for £ with the people in Brussels to implement the scheme.  This is certainly not good enough.  There was no point in raising the hopes of farmers in the west of <Col N="1821" /> Ireland from Donegal down to west Cork and north and south Kerry that this scheme would be the answer to all the drainage and flooding problems that the west of Ireland has suffered from down the centuries.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Government have given no block allocation whatsoever in the budget to get this scheme off the ground.  It is a crazy and ridiculous situation.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Minister for Agriculture in his contribution to the budget debate did not mention the disadvantaged areas.  I should like to remind the Minister of State present in the House of what he said outside church gates in County Kerry some two-and-a-half years ago.  He told the people that, if he were elected and if Fianna Fáil were returned to office, not alone would the parishes of Milltown and Ballymacel-ligott qualify for EEC grants but all of County Kerry would qualify for such grants.  Now the Minister is strangely silent.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture spoke at length on the budget but there were some glaring omissions in his speech.  Fianna Fáil have not given any increases to the disadvantaged areas in County Kerry, they are not paying grants in respect of the farm modernisation scheme and they are threatening a resource tax on farmers in addition to income tax.  In addition, the unfortunate farmers have to pay higher interest rates on money that the Government encouraged them to borrow.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will allocate extra staff to the grants section of the Department of Agriculture.  Speedy payments of grants would help the farmers to repay money that they owe to the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, has not said much about the budget.  That same Minister at the 1977 Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis spoke at length about the unemployed.  As a result of measures in the budget we will have more unemployed in this country at the end of the year than ever before.  I <Col N="1823" /> am told a conservative forecast of unemployed at the end of December is 125,000.  This will happen because the abnormally high interest rates will affect small industries.  Many of them will go into liquidation.  This is a sad state of affairs. I hope the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach will give some relief to small industrialists, especially to those who depend on an overdraft to carry on their business.  There is no doubt that something will be done for mortgage holders.  The Taoiseach is shrewd.  He is a good public relations man and, so far as the ordinary business of this House is concerned, he is a good Taoiseach. Everyone knows he would not have put his head on the block meeting the building societies unless something positive was going to come out of it.  No Taoiseach would risk his reputation by failing in his discussions with the building societies.  It was strongly rumoured in financial circles that an increase of 2 per cent was contemplated by the building societies but this has not been announced.  It is not for me to speculate whether that is true or false.  I hope mortgage holders get some relief; otherwise we will all be in trouble because the national understanding will be as good as finished and there will be no new wage agreement.  Mortgage holders need some cushioning because they cannot afford to carry another increase. I wish the Taoiseach and his Ministers well in their dealings with the building societies.  If they do not come up with something all of us will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Land Commission are purchasing very little land, either by acquiring it voluntarily or compulsorily. Also, it is regrettable that high financiers are moving in and buying tracts of land in the west of Ireland. Some of these people are not Irish.  They may have an Irish front but the majority of shareholders are from a European country.  I do not want to be misinterpreted on this issue.  There is a welcome for some European people. Some of them buy a plot of land for a holiday home and, provided they comply <Col N="1824" /> with local planning conditions, they are welcome.  The money they pay to the landowner is of tremendous help to him in educating his family or in improving his way of life.  I have no objection to such people buying land here; but I have an objection to others who come here, who have an Irish front and who buy tracts of land that should be divided among smallholders.  Money can be made, water can be got from the lakes, but God made land only once.  Once it is gone it is gone forever.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture should keep an eye on this situation because it could blow up.  It can blow up in an old way.  The Irish people got rid of the landlord and they will also get rid of these people, possibly not in a democratic manner.  I am told that some factions of Irish society who have no respect for the institutions of the State are moving in in some areas and are creating the necessary strife and aggression which will affect all of us in the long run.  This could be an explosive situation and democracy will not survive because these people will not take it lying down if the landlord is brought back in another shape.  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to look at the situation again and ask the Cabinet to give them some money to acquire land especially if the land is offered to the Land Commission in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Our fishermen are widely scattered in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Wicklow, Louth and Dublin.  They will not have much of an effect on a general election and therefore they have not a strong lobby.  They are being treated scandalously at the moment. When the cost of fuel oil went up it hit the fishermen harder than other sections.  The 90-foot trawlers used in fishing use about £1,000 worth of fuel oil a week and it is not beyond reason to ask the Government to give a substantial relief to those fishermen by way of a subsidy or tax rebate on fuel oil.  The 50-mile limit which we sought for the fishermen and which was mentioned in the famous manifesto of 1977 was abandoned. <Col N="1825" /> When the 50-mile limit was in operation the catches of fishermen increased substantially.  Now the catches have decreased and the overheads on these boats mean that hundreds of trawler owners have a noose around their necks.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance, even at this late stage to instruct BIM not to confiscate those boats from skippers who cannot meet their repayments because they cannot catch enough fish.  Their overheads are so excessive that they have have no hope of making a profit so the Minister should subsidise fuel oil to help them out of that situation.</P>
    <P>There are so many defects in this budget that one could go on for hours pointing them out.  It is very significant that on the Order of Business this morning Deputy Peter Barry raised the point that the Government are now giving only three days to discuss the Finance Bill which is the follow-up to the budget. The Finance Bill must be passed by 15 May and yet only three days have been given to discuss it although the Bill is not yet published and we do not know when we will get it.  Many sections of the community who will be affected by this Bill will wish to make representations either to the Government or to Opposition Deputies to have amendments made to the Bill.  The indecent haste in relation to the Finance Bill and the way it is being put before us seems to indicate that there is something else at the back of the Taoiseach's mind, that he will guillotine the Bill especially during Committee Stage, at an early stage.  It is not for me to say, but I would appeal to the new Minister, whom I wish well in his appointment, to carry my remarks to the Minister for Finance and to tell him that we are very suspicious of his motives in relation to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I spoke at length on local authorities, land reform, fisheries and agricultural structures and I will wind up with prices. In 1977 anybody who listened to the political broadcasts before the election would have heard Deputy Eileen Lemass say that there would be no more rises in prices.  That was her song, her motto, her <Col N="1826" /> manifesto and the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  Everybody knows that the cost of living has escalated out of all proportion.  The time has come for the Government seriously to reconsider major food subsidies.  Even though there are substantial welcome increases in old age and widows pensions the cost of living has also increased substantially.  These people must be cushioned in some form or another.</P>
    <P>In my county the local authority no longer collect rates on private houses as promised in the manifesto, but lo and behold what did the county manager do? He increased the water rate from £15 to £40 a year.  These old age pensioners cannot afford to pay that kind of money. Commonsense should come to the rescue.  This is rates by stealth.  I put a question to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in relation to the Prices Commission authorising these increases and I was told it was not the function of the Prices Commission.  Yet in 1977 it was said about the Prices Commission that it would be carefully and thoroughly examined and restructured and brought up to date as it was widely believed to be inadvertently protecting inefficient firms and in itself was incapable of proper investigation of many applications made to it which were frequently for far more than the firm needed and the increases granted were often more than the firm expected.  I could go on at length but that summarises the gimmicks that were presented to the people in 1977.  But what has been done about the Prices Commission since?  It was also stated that there would be full dissemination at least once a week to radio, television and newspapers of comparative prices of the most frequently purchased goods in supermarkets and so on in different parts of the country.  Has that happened? I do not know how the Minister and the Taoiseach can ever again go before the people when this was posted into their houses.  Prices have gone out of all proportion and something must be done to halt the spiral.  Otherwise there will be no hope of wage agreements and <Col N="1827" /> there will be no hope of the Government having any credibility.</P>
    <P>Finally I hope that the Government will stop harassing many old age pensioners, widows, poor farmers receiving a bit of farmer's dole, by means of the horde of pension officers who seem to be in every county.  These social welfare officers come into houses and put the fear of God into the old people.  Surely it would not be too much to ask the Minister for Social Welfare, who came in here and waxed lyrically about the budget but never said that he was going to send a squad of wasps from the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will wind up on education. The cutbacks in education are going to be very serious this year.  Rural Deputies cannot speak so much about the national side but we can speak on it as it affects our own constituencies.  It is significant that at the last meeting of the Kerry Vocational Educational Committee on which, incidentally, every seat is held by Fianna Fáil, a new vocational school for Killorglin was mentioned.  It was with the Department for a long time and it still was not sanctioned and yet £40,000 went in fees to architects, quantity surveyors, civil engineers, construction engineers and so on.  Yet the Department of Education were not in a position to build the school this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no extra money given in the budget for school buses.  This is a decrease because costs have gone up by about 25 per cent and the money is the same as last year.  That means there will be a shortfall in school bus services in the coming months.  It is a question of whether we are going to have dangerous buses on the roads.  Is there any money to maintain those buses?  If there is a <Col N="1829" /> serious accident as a result of some mechanical defect the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance will be responsible.</P>
    <P>I will not say any more.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the patience he had with me.  My final remark is that this Government is like a tinker's mule, one leg up today, the other leg up tomorrow, depending on the boreen that the tinker is to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardFilgate" hpid="Mr. Filgate Mr. Filgate">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Filgate</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that my flow of oratory will not be such as to delay it very long.  The debate on the budget has gone on so long that every conceivable argument for and against has already been put.  At the same time perhaps there is always room for a little emphasis on some points raised in the budget.  It is fair to say that in framing the budget the Minister for Finance was faced with perhaps the most difficult situation that any Minister for Finance has had to face in modern times.  The rate of inflation in 1978 had increased from 7.6 per cent to about 13.2 per cent in 1979.  The trade balance had disimproved substantially resulting in a considerable widening of the balance of payments deficit on the current account.  Also the current budget deficit of the Exchequer borrowing requirement had increased as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted by everyone that the level of borrowing here could not go ahead as it had been doing.  In no way could we be expected to borrow over £500 million, a figure in excess of the total amount paid by the PAYE sector for ordinary services in the country. Should the Government allow that situation to continue, in a very short time the country would be in economic ruins.  So, the Minister presented the House with a package designed to correct the situation. In the PAYE sector alone he was faced with an enormous and yet just demand, a demand which in no way was discovered overnight but was built on the frustration of that sector over many years, especially the past six or seven <Col N="1830" /> years.  During the term of office of the Coalition Government very little, if anything, was done.  In fact, the demand was scarcely recognised.  The Government set about rectifying the situation first by ensuring that a fair amount of income tax relief was afforded to this sector. The Minister responded very generously to the dissatisfaction expressed by the PAYE sector at the level of taxation imposed on that sector.  In this regard he has exempted from tax more low income workers and he has widened the income bands so that taxpayers pay tax at a lower rate.  This a real increase in PAYE incomes.  That is not generally accepted perhaps but it has been widely accepted by certain people, especially by the trade union movement who have recognised the Minister's efforts to ensure real, substantial relief for the workers.</P>
    <P>For every married couple whether the wife is earning or not the Minister's proposals mean a substantial increase in take home pay.  These are concrete and worth-while reliefs, reliefs acknowledged by everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about farm taxation and as a rural Deputy I concede that the farmers now as always, and especially in good farming times, are willing to pay their just share of taxation. It is a matter of what is a fair share, what is meant by that.  It is as regards the assessment of what a fair share of taxation is that we differ.  What is a fair amount for one can be an unbearable burden upon another.  The Minister has made strong efforts to meet the farmers' requirements.  If a farmer makes no profit why should he be taxed?  If he makes profit why should he not be taxed to a fair extent?</P>
    <P>In this context of taxation there is a commission sitting at present on the whole question of taxation and I hope this commission will within a reasonable time present a report that will ensure that every sector of the community will pay a fair share, no more and no less.</P>
    <P>In this connection also we must look at what happens to the money collected in taxation.  How do we spend it?  First, <Col N="1831" /> as regards local authorities a situation has now developed in which it appears that no longer, or only for a very short time, will this country be in a position to finance our road network.  Not only have roads been neglected over many years but especially from 1973 through 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 the amount of money allocated for roadwork was consistently cut down.  This is where the real damage was done and this was followed by two very severe winters.  Members of the House who are in the European Parliament must look to the regional fund for an arrangement whereby special moneys will be made available to the Government so that our roads can at least be brought into line with and kept up to the standard of other European countries.</P>
    <P>For the third year running in this budget the Fianna Fáil Government have effected a substantial improvement in the position of the social welfare recipients.  This has been decried or ignored but it cannot be denied that the real income of social welfare recipients has been increased to a point never before reached in this country under any Government.  Whether we like it or not, we have under this heading certain uses or abuses of the social welfare system and no amount of argument of oratory in this House will rectify that situation. Millions of pounds are being absorbed by abuse of social welfare and it is quite right for the Government and the Ministers to come to grips with this vicious problem.</P>
    <P>Never before, I would venture, have we silently paid out so much money in malicious damages.  The smallest county in Ireland has a bill in the current year of well over £1 million for malicious damage.  It is time that everybody took note of this fact and made some effort to ensure that the vandalism and the viciousness of those who perpetrate malicious damage are roundly and soundly condemned and that they be brought to book for it.</P>
    <P>By way of general comment on the taxation imposed in the budget, it is a logical and inescapable fact that the income <Col N="1832" /> tax and social welfare improvements must be financed and the only realistic available source for the vast bulk of this finance is indirect taxation. We can argue about direct and indirect taxation but the latter is the only means available to any Government.  I believe that the Minister wisely concentrated his indirect tax proposals on what we like to call discretionary expenditure in line with the general social tenor of his approach to the budget.  The shift from direct taxation and PAYE taxpayers has a twofold effect; it is not only appropriate in our present economic conditions but it also helps to bring about a better and more desirable balance in the overall burden of taxation.  It has the added bonus of helping to reduce, in accordance with the policy of the Minister, excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco.  I should not like it to be taken that I am against either.  The emphasis must go on the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;.  We are inclined to be excessive in all our demands. Every sector of the community demands more, bigger and better and when they get that they will still go on and on.</P>
    <P>There are other facets of the budget on which I should like to comment but the proposals have already been submitted to the House in such detail that it is almost futile for me to go deeper into them.  I shall confine my remarks to what I see as the general strategy of the budget.  The Taoiseach said that the budget is the first step in a programme designed to achieve economic and social progress based on strong public finances and firm management of the economy. Even the most bitter and irresponsible Opposition Members might agree with us.  Very few of them have been in a position to deny that the budget has tried to fulfil most of these requirements. They have given scant attention to the fact that during 1979 the employment figure rose rapidly.  Unemployment fell significantly and the rate of investment growth remained in double figures.  They have deliberately ignored these matters. Perhaps that is their policy.  It is my job and that of others on this side of the House to highlight that in case it would <Col N="1833" /> be lost.  These are positive developments which emphasise the wisdom of Fianna Fáil policies and of designing the budget in such a way as to ensure that these positive aspects will not be eroded but maintained and enhanced in 1980.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to ensure that there will be a continued increase in growth, output and employment. The budget marks a significant and concrete contribution to these objectives. We have always been concerned with social progress.  It is now widely accepted that the social awareness of the first Fianna Fáil Government under de Valera was imaginative and ahead of its time.  We are determined to ensure that the principles of justice, equality and of cherishing all the children of the nation equally, which were an inherent part of the Government's programme, will prevail and be part and parcel of Fianna Fáil's continued success.</P>

      <P>This budget, taken in conjunction with the Book of Estimates, can be summed up by saying that in 1980 we are being asked to contribute to the coffers of the Exchequer to the tune of £292 million in additional taxation. The people who have been asked to contribute are also being asked to be content with a lower level of Government services than they had in 1979.  Indirect taxation has been substantially increased over a wide range of items.  In some areas such as beer and spirits the increases have been massive and will have great repercussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am engaged in the licenced trade and I have never heard as many complaints as regards a drop-off in sales from publicans as I did since the budget. There is such a discrepancy in the price of beer and spirits between the public pubs in the Border towns in my constituency and the neighbouring Border towns in Armagh, Fermanagh and Tyrone that instead of people coming from the North into the towns in my constituency the movement is in the other direction.  This may be good for relations between North and South but it <Col N="1834" /> is not of much benefit to the publicans in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I was told recently that on account of the big discrepancy in price the shebeen business is beginning to prosper in Border areas and can be quite lucrative for unlicensed people to purchase beer and spirits in supermarkets in Northern Ireland.  They can make a fair profit by selling these in shebeens in rural areas.  If one looks at the discrepancy in price one can understand why the movement should be away from Border towns in my constituency towards Border towns in Northern Ireland.  Some examples of the discrepancy in price are: a half glass of spirits in Castleblayney as a result of this budget is being sold at 57p, in the village of Crossmaglen it is 50p; half glass of brandy in Castleblayney 82p, in Crossmaglen, 65p; pint of Guinness, manufactured in Dublin, in Castleblayney, 59p, in Crossmaglen, 48p; pint of lager, manufactured in Dundalk, in Castleblayney, 65p, in Crossmaglen, 48p; a bottle of club orange in Crossmaglen, 15p, in Castleblayney, 25p.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about encouraging people in Northern Ireland to join us in a united Ireland.  People in Northern Ireland are also &ldquo;fond of their jar&rdquo; and the workers in the shipyard in Belfast are as fond of it as any workers here.  These prices would not entice them to come in here.  The carry-out business, as it is known, the off-licences, used to be substantial at certain times of the year such as at Christmas and Easter.  Recently that business has been eroded because of the discrepancy in prices between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  With this massive increase in the budget that business will be killed off altogether because many people in the Border areas will buy their spirits and beer in Armagh at Christmas or Easter.</P>
    <P>The increase in the price of petrol will have serious repercussions.  This is one of the most glaring examples of people being asked to pay additional taxation while being expected to be content with a lower standard of public service.  The motoring public are being asked to pay huge petrol increases while there is a <Col N="1835" /> very big cut-back in real terms in the amounts being provided for the maintenance and improvement of roads.</P>
    <P>The money being provided for my county leaves no room for any road reconstruction or road improvement.  At a recent county council meeting the county engineer said the best he could hope to do this year would be to keep the potholes filled and to do a holding job.  This does not encourage the people in the North to want to join a united Ireland.  A person travelling from Belfast to Dublin drives on roads of very high standard until he reaches the Border.  In the Republic he travels on roads of a much lower standard.  His car cost him at least £1,000 less than it would in the Republic and his petrol cost about 20p a gallon less than here.</P>
    <P>Last week some Deputies and councillors met their Northern Ireland counterparts at a cross-Border meeting in Dundalk.  The British Minister for Northern Ireland Affairs, Mr. Giles Shaw, told us that £10 million had been earmarked for a by-pass for Newry.  The only thing delaying the project was that the consultants had to make a report because there were some objections as to where it should go.  He said the money was waiting to be spent as soon as the report was presented.  In comparison the Minister for Defence representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs was present but he could not say that we had even £1 to spend on building a by-pass around Dundalk.  When we talk about a united Ireland we should do everything we can to make it pleasing for the Northern population to join us.  If we cannot have better conditions here, they should be on a par with those in the North.</P>
    <P>I noticed that there is a cutback of £750,000 in the amount provided for local improvements schemes.  There appear to be some people in the Department of Finance who do not like providing money for these schemes. When the Coalition were in power efforts were made to abolish this scheme but because of the opposition within the Coalition backbenches the scheme was <Col N="1836" /> retained.  Last month my county council were notified that our allocation for these schemes would be £75,000, against last year's allocation of £106,000. Because of inflation and from the figures given by our county engineer, it appears that road improvements this year will cost from 20 to 25 per cent more than last year because of increases in wages and in the cost of materials.  The allocation to my county is generally spent on the improvement of lanes leading to two or three houses.  At the moment we have approximately 400 applications for this kind of work.  With an allocation of £75,000 and at the present rate of progress the people at the lower end of the list have very little hope of getting these jobs done under this scheme in my lifetime.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan we do not have a railway. We always felt we were entitled to a greater allocation from central funds for the upkeep and improvement of our roads.  We pay taxes to subsidise CIE and we are entitled to better treatment by the provision of extra money for roads.  When Deputy Blaney was Minister for Local Government, for five years he gave the three Border counties additional allocations to compensate for the closure of the railways.  That money was quickly eaten up.  As there are no railways in those counties the roads have to carry very heavy traffic.  Because of the juggernauts using our roads the cost of maintaining and improving them is very high.</P>
    <P>Before the last general election I listened to a Fianna Fáil speaker at a church gate.  He said that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would remove motor tax from cars up to and including 16 hp.  He said Fine Gael speakers were saying that if this were done by Fianna Fáil the tax on petrol would be greatly increased.  He said he wanted to assure the people that that would not be so, that it was their intention to remove the tax and that they had no intention of increasing the tax on petrol.  He said that Fianna Fáil had <Col N="1837" /> some inside information that ample funds would be provided by the EEC for the upkeep and improvement of our roads.  Today there is a flat rate of £10 tax on cars of less than 16 hp, there are increased prices for petrol, but our roads are in a very bad condition.  During the next election campaign that Deputy will have a hard time explaining to the people how the massive increase in taxation has taken place in the interval since he last spoke to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Filgate made reference to the bad condition of our roads and implied that they had go into that state since the Coalition period in office.  He forgot to explain that the EEC Regional Fund was non-existent in those days and that most of the money for our roads comes from that fund nowadays.</P>
    <P>After the Minister's budget statement many people thought they would receive large benefits by way of relief from income tax, particularly those in the PAYE bracket.  However, when the figures given in the hand-out accompanying the budget statement were examined it was found that those who would benefit most are in the higher income sector, with very little for those on lower incomes.  It can be seen that a married man with two children earning £5,000 a year will benefit by £200 and that the same man on £15,000 a year will get £1,750 relief.  The ordinary working man earning between £80 and £100 a week will have any relief due to him eroded by the further inflation caused by the budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Filgate referred to the Minister's budget speech and said that any increased taxation was in regard to discretionary expenditure.  I should like him to explain how a working man in rural Ireland who has to use a car to get to work can be said to have any discretion in regard to the increased price of petrol.  His only discretion is whether he will stay at home and go on the dole or drive to work and pay the increased price for petrol.  In fact he has not got any discretion in regard to going on the dole because when he applies for it he <Col N="1838" /> will be told he left the job of his own volition.</P>
    <P>In farming it will be accepted generally that 1979 was a bad year, no matter which branch of farming one thinks of. It is accepted that profit margins last year were far less than in previous years. In my part of the country a farmer who bought store cattle in March and April, fed them early and grazed them throughout the summer was very lucky if he got his money for them in November, and all his work during the summer in feeding and grazing them went for nothing.</P>
    <P>In recent years farmers have been changing over to milk production in which costs have increased greatly since 1978 while prices remained static with a consequent decrease in profit margins. Many people engaged in milk production had committed themselves heavily to bank loans and loans from other lending agencies.  The recent increase in bank interest rates will bear heavily on them.  In addition the price those people receive for their dropped calves has fallen by half in recent times.  Taking all those things into consideration the profit margin of people engaged in milk production&mdash;the most profitable section of farming&mdash;has dropped considerably over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people in my constituency engaged in intensive pig production who experienced a very bad year last year.  I had occasion to meet a deputation from them in recent weeks when they told me they had lost substntial money over the past 12 months and that, if something was not done quickly, they would soon be out of business.  Apparently one of the reasons is that since the partial folding-up of the Pigs and Bacon Commission there has been carried on a very erratic type of sales campaign by the bacon factories who are competing with one another and cutting prices.  Additionally the quality control has not been what it should be.  The result of this is that on the British market&mdash;where at one time our bacon fetched almost the same price as Danish bacon&mdash;our bacon has been selling from <Col N="1839" /> £400 to £500 a tonne less than Danish bacon.  It is claimed that this is caused by the partial folding up of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the erratic type of sales campaign being conducted by bacon curers and the lack of quality control. I was glad to note that the Minister for Agriculture met these people last week.  I only hope he will be in a position to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>Thirty to 40 per cent of the poultry produced in this country emanates from my constituency.  These producers contend that they have been experiencing very difficult times in recent months. They say they are now facing competition on the home market of imports from Denmark, that the Danes are in a position to send in frozen poultry here more cheaply because their costs of production are much lower.  Additionally it is claimed that the water content of the packed Danish chicken is higher than that of the home-produced counterpart. These producers have said&mdash;I do not know how true it is&mdash;that certain distributors have received grants from the IDA with which to build stores and provide refrigeration and accommodation for these imports from Denmark. That is the allegation they have made and I have not had an opportunity of checking on it.  While realising that it is difficult, under EEC regulations, to prevent the importation of frozen chickens and, indeed, turkeys from Denmark at least I would hope the IDA would not provide grants to people to set up distribution centres here, thereby robbing our producers of their livelihood on the home market.</P>
    <P>This was a very bad year to choose to impose further taxation on the farming community, following the bad year they experienced last year.  The reduction of the threshold of £40 PLV on land for income tax liability effected in this year's budget is to be deplored because the income of the farming community was much reduced last year and this constitutes a further hardship on them.  As I see it very few medium-sized farmers with valuations between, say, £40 and £60, will be liable to income tax when allowances <Col N="1840" /> are taken into account.  The worst blow to them has been the withdrawal of the agricultural grant which means that those people not liable to income tax will have to pay the full rate in the £ which in turn means a doubling of their rates.  This constitutes an additional unfair tax on these people while it can be shown that they are not liable to income tax.</P>
    <P>Of all the carrots dangled by Fianna Fáil at the last general election the withdrawal of the agricultural grant was the most deceitful.  In their manifesto they promised to allow the payment of rates as an instalment of income tax due. However, people did not anticipate the withdrawal of the agricultural grant and that any benefit the farmer would derive from the payment of rates as an instalment of income tax would be negatived completely by its withdrawal.  The Minister said that the cut-off point for rates relief would remain at £40 PLV for a period of three years.  Having regard to previous commitments by this Government one cannot place very much credence in that.  The poor law valuation was a most unfair and inequitable yardstick by which to measure farmers' incomes particularly the more one sees of the discrepancies between valuations of land in different parts of the country, say, as between land in Cork, Monaghan, Cavan and Tipperary.</P>
    <P>One wonders how the Griffith Commission arrived at their valuation of agricultural land.  In many counties where the land is of the poorest quality valuations seem to be high.  In some cases 50 statute acres of good land might not have a valuation of £40 and in other cases a lesser acreage of inferior land might have a valuation of much more than £40.  This was brought home to me very forcibly in recent weeks when a woman who lost her husband last November and was left with two small children came to see me.  She had a rate demand which showed that her acreage of 36 statute acres of very poor land in County Monaghan had £41.50 valuation. By no stretch of imagination could that woman make an income from that farm which would render her liable for <Col N="1841" /> income tax.  Because of the withdrawal of the agricultural grant she will have to pay over twice the amount she paid last year since when she has lost her husband and is much worse off than she was.</P>
    <P>We all agree that farmers should pay their fair share of income tax.  However, a look at what this budget has done reveals that a farmer whose income is similar to that of a person paying tax on the PAYE system is now paying much more than the PAYE taxpayer in rates and income tax.  The resource tax is another unjust and unfair imposition and it has to be paid irrespective of whether a farmer makes a profit.  While it does not affect many farmers in my constituency, it does in effect hit a certain type of farmer very hard.  It hits the young, progressive farmer who possibly had a valuation of £50 and who set out to increase the size of his holding, his productivity and his income.  He went to the bank and borrowed heavily to purchase another 20 or 25 acres and this has put him over the £70 valuation.  That man will be asked to pay the resource tax on a farm for part of which he is indebted deeply to the lending agency and has to pay heavy repayments and interest on his loan.</P>
    <P>Listening to the speakers on the opposite side one would get the impression that the Government have been overgenerous in their treatment of people under social welfare.  Any increases which have been given will soon be eaten up by the increased costs of what these people will have to purchase.  The cost of living has been increasing so rapidly in recent times that any increase which these people have got does not go very far to compensate them for the increase in the cost of living.  In January 1978 the old age pension was at the rate of £10.75 and the 2 lb. loaf was quoted as worth 19.5p. In January of this year the 2 lb. loaf was worth 37.5p and the old age pension was £16.80.  Between January 1978 and January 1980 the price of the loaf went up far more than did the increase which the old age pensioner got.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that legislation is not a deterrent to the provision of services needed by the handicapped.  The greatest needs are being identified.  A working group of health board representatives in consultation with the Department of Health, the National Rehabilitation Board and the Medico-Social Research Board have considered arrangements for the introduction of a common form of registration of physically handicapped persons.  This committee have just completed their work and it is hoped to get the new form of registration under way in the coming months.  The Eastern Health Board have already undertaken a special survey of the physically handicapped in their own area to ascertain the nature and extent of their needs and this survey will be completed within two to three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, various other steps are currently being taken.  In relation to the International Year of the Disabled it is intended to establish a national steering committee to promote the concept of the year and to focus attention on the needs of the disabled.  This will be a special opportunity to review our policies and programmes and to propose improvements <Col N="1844" /> in services.  I have recently made arrangements for the strengthening of the National Rehabilitation Board.  This has been done in conjunction with the board and has been particularly well received by them.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that next year is the International Year of the Disabled, would the Minister consider Deputy O'Connell's suggestion and also consider that such a Bill should have a much wider content than has so far been intimated?  It should include especially the design and accessibility of public buildings and the placing of such things as street furniture which can add to the disadvantages of the disabled.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, an adult person is entitled to a medical card if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the health <Col N="1845" /> board, it would be an undue hardship on him to provide general practitioner service for himself and his dependants.  If the degree of handicap or disability results in such hardship the person is already eligible for a medical card, and may qualify for further assistance.</P>

One patient was almost killed by a fall of four stone of plaster when the ceiling collapsed two days ago.  I was up looking at the hospital and the whole situation there is now very dangerous.  I appeal to the Minister&mdash;and I know the many demands made on him&mdash;to avert a tragedy and to do something very urgently and very definitely to save these patients who are at present in grave danger of their lives.</P>

I have also spoken to the senior officer of my Department who is tomorrow to visit the hospital and has arranged for the programme manager of the Eastern Health Board to make alternative accommodation arrangements for 140 patients who are currently being evacuated.  I agree with the Deputy that <Col N="1851" /> the situation in that particular area is very serious and we are treating it as such.</P>
      <P>Portion of the ceiling ten to 12 feet in diameter, has fallen away.  There is no case, fortunately, of anyone being seriously injured.  Nevertheless, steps are being taken, and not only in regards to that unit.  All patients from ward 8 were immediately evacuated and the programme manager has ordered the evacuation of patients from wards 8, 7, 4 and 2 which are in the block known as the North House which houses 140 patients.  Immediate and urgent action is being taken in relation to that situation. These patients will temporarily be housed in unit 22, which is a completely renovated unit consisting of wards O, P, Q and R.  The engineer who was sent to examine the section considers that it is unsafe for patient accommodation.  I agree with his view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept these recommendations regarding the scale of units as a general principle, I would not agree that they should be the sole criterion in deciding on the future of smaller maternity <Col N="1852" /> units.  Social factors such as tradition, convenience for mothers and visiting relatives, local travel conditions and so on may have to be weighed with medical considerations in taking such decisions.  In any event the phasing out of a maternity unit would be a matter for the hospital authority, generally the local health board in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total number of medical card holders and their dependants at present awaiting dental treatment and the measures he proposes for immediate improvement of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards do not maintain separate records identifying children receiving dental treatment whose parents are medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The number of other persons covered by medical cards who were awaiting dental treatment on 31 January 1980 was 27,911.  This is substantially less than the corresponding figure of 35,675 for 1 January 1979 and this reflects the fact that an increasing proportion of adult patients are being catered for by dentists in private practice.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were introduced last year to this end.  Under these arrangements, health boards engaged private dentists on the terms which had been negotiated under the Social Welfare (Dental Benefit) Scheme to treat medical card holders.  The dentists told me they were withdrawing from this arrangement at the end of March because of their dissatisfaction with some aspects of the structure of fees under the social welfare scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two main improvements had been requested by the profession&mdash;the introduction of a separate fee for dental examination and general consultation and restructuring of the scale of fees for extractions. I was disappointed that the profession should have thought it necessary to withdraw from the scheme for medical card holders seeing that I had arranged for discussions on these and <Col N="1853" /> other aspects of the social welfare scheme to commence on 10 April.</P>
    <P>I have told the Irish Dental Association that I agree in principle with the changes which they have asked for in the fees structure.  I intend that the Department of Social Welfare will now press on with negotiations with the association aimed at agreeing on a new scale of fees.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I have asked the dentists to resume the arrangements for the extended application of this scheme to medical card holders, with a view to the further reduction of the waiting list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will be in a position towards the end of the year to bring forward the new Bill.  I should like to emphasise the two improvements that I mentioned and which could go by unnoticed very easily.  They are two major improvements, and this is particularly the case with regard to the first one.  The other improvement is one the dentists have been looking for for quite some time.  I believe the introduction of a separate fee for examination and general consultation will be a major step forward in dental hygiene, medicine and care generally.  I am particularly pleased I have been able to introduce this improvement.  It indicates the direction in which dental care is going and I am glad I was able to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention this major step forward in dental care.  Is he satisfied <Col N="1854" /> that the dental care available to medical card holders is satisfactory when, as Members of this House, we know of cases where there are delays of up to five or six years in some health board areas? Further, will he state if the agreement reached some time ago where medical card holders could go to private dentists for dental care has been terminated? Will he tell the House the present position with regard to this agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent the confusion arises from the time at which negotiations with regard to the new scale of fees normally takes place each year and the fact that this other short-term, temporary scheme which was introduced and which it was hoped would continue was tied in with those discussions. The discussions were scheduled to start at the end of March but, in effect, they began on 10 April by agreement and arrangement with the Irish Dental Association.  Meanwhile before the discussions took place the association decided to withdraw from the scheme. Part of the discussions dealt with the question whether the examination fee could be introduced and also the changed method of payment for extractions. These were two problems in principle. They have been granted and I hope the dentists will continue to operate this scheme.  It has been a valuable one and we welcome it.  As I mentioned, it has led to a substantial reduction in the number of people on the waiting lists.  I hope the discussions will be concluded shortly and that the scheme will continue. Present commitments will be honoured by the Department and presumably by the dentists also.  We have really only been informed that the association is to withdraw from the scheme and the extent to which this happens remains to be seen.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Debendox is at present available without prescription in this country.  The <Col N="1858" /> National Drugs Advisory Board review periodically the safety of drugs marketed here.  Debendox was included in a group of products to be reviewed at April 1979 and the board have been in correspondence with the manufacturers on it since.  I understand the board are considering new recommendations on the availability of the drug and I expect its advice in the matter very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the controversial nature of this drug and the fact that it is only taken by women in the early stages of pregnancy when the baby is most at risk of deformity, would the Minister not consider that a special publicity campaign should be launched against the use of drugs in early pregnancy because of the danger of mentally and physically handicapped children being born and also in view of the fact that there was such controversial evidence in the case in Florida?  It is a very serious matter and the National Drugs Advisory Board should not be too willing to say that they are satisfied that this is a safe drug because nobody can be satisfied that it is safe.  This drug can cause serious congenital defects in babies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every confidence in the board and they will give their report in the matter shortly.  On the basis of the various sources available short term to the board, the board is in a position to say that there is no significant evidence that Debendox has produced any adverse effects.  It is of interest to note that, according to press reports of 2 April 1980, the British Committee on Safety of Medicines, which corresponds to our National Drugs Advisory Board, have reported to the Health Minister that &ldquo;it could find no scientific evidence to show that Debendox was the cause of congenital abnormalcies and saw no reason to revoke or suspend the drug's licence or to restrict its availability&rdquo;.  At this stage I shall await the recommendations of our board.  I am certain that if they felt there was an immediate, urgent need they would have communicated that to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the reason a person (name supplied) in Dublin has not been granted full fees and maintenance to attend a school for the disabled by the Eastern Health Board while a similar case in similar circumstances was granted full <Col N="1862" /> fees and maintenance for the same school by the Midland Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances were, in fact, different although in neither case was the relevant health board liable for the costs as the original arrangements had not been entered into with the board's consent.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin case, application was made to the Eastern Health Board in the first place for a contribution towards the costs on the understanding that the balance would be met by private fund-raising. The health board agreed to make a contribution equivalent to what it would have paid in respect of the handicapped person's maintenance in an appropriate institution in Ireland.  This amounted to £1,373.40 in 1979.</P>
      <P>In the Midland case there were exceptional factors relating to the well-being of the whole family which, the health board felt, justified the payment of the full cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the father of the disabled person in the Midland Health Board area is a medical doctor whereas the similarly if not more gravely disabled person in the Eastern Health Board area has no means, and has no opportunity of getting the fees either privately or otherwise?  Having regard to the fact that the person in the Eastern Health Board area is not in financial circumstances as good as those of the person in the Midland Health Board area, does the Minister think it just that we should discriminate against the person in the Eastern Health Board area?  Two people who are similarly disabled have been given an opportunity to avail of special services in the school but one health board are willing to pay and the other board are not.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in trying to get the health board to do something about it but because this is such a serious problem which affects the future welfare of this person will the Minister consider trying to force the Eastern Health Board to help this person?  I am sorry about the long question but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do what I can by contacting the Eastern Health Board to see if there can be any improvement in that case.  As far as the other case is concerned there were particularly difficult circumstances.  The family had sold their house to make arrangements and the man concerned had given up his post at the time.  It is not quite as the Deputy understood it.  The man then suffered a serious coronary and it was in those circumstances that the health board in that case made their decision.  If the Deputy wishes me to pursue the Eastern Health Board to see if anything further can be done I will do that.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the delays which people have recently experienced in gaining admission to the office of the superintendent registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages in Pearse Street, Dublin.  This <Col N="1865" /> has been caused by an unprecedented increase in the last few months in the demand for birth and marriage certificates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two steps here, the first is the immediate alleviation of the situation and the second relates to future demands and needs.  It is interesting to note the changes which are taking place which indicate a greater future demand.  There has been a great increase in the demand for birth certificates for passports for large groups of school children going abroad on educational tours and for more people holidaying abroad in the winter.  There has been an increased demand for marriage certificates in connection with the purchase or sale of houses by married couples required because of the provisions of the Family Homes (Protection) Act, 1976.  There are also continuing social and community developments which keep demand at a high level.  In the light of this I have made arrangements to have a study carried out at the Pearse Street office to determine what more long-term changes may be required.</P>

All pupils of second level schools are, of course, exposed to general measures adopted on a national or local basis to prevent dental disease and promote dental hygiene.</P>
    <P>I might add that, as soon as dental services for existing eligible groups reach an acceptable level, consideration will be given to extending eligibility in their own right to adolescents as a group.</P>

I appreciate the position the Deputy raises in that people may have been waiting and if the service had been available they would have availed of it and would have been able to continue that treatment under the regulations as they exist.  I will certainly look into that to see if there is any way any definition can be given to such people.</P>

      <P>The social welfare system is constantly under scrutiny with a view to its extension and improvement.  Changes in the system usually involve additional cost and are dealt with in connection with the budget.  From time to time, particular aspects of the system may be subjected to special examination as part of the general policy of development.  Instances where such action was taken during the past five years were (a) the financing of social insurance leading to the introduction of the fully pay-related social insurance contributions system; (b) the question of a national income-related pension scheme; (c) the question of social insurance for the self-employed; (d) the removal of anomalies in the means test; (e) the development of the heating services; (f) measures to eliminate discrimination against women; (g) general improvements such as, in the current year, the reduction of the qualifying age for blind pension from 21 to 18 years, the extension of the definition of orphan in cases of desertion and the extension of the provision for payment of adult dependant allowances in respect of women having the care of children of persons receiving sickness or unemployment payments.</P>

    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister for Finance). </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress I was dealing with the budget and social welfare recipients.  There is one category of old age pensioner who should get better treatment and more generous consideration and that is the old age pensioners who live alone.  At present they receive £1.30 per week over and above the amount paid to an ordinary pensioner.  An old age pensioner residing with relatives does not have to buy everything but one living alone does. Many of these would find it hard to survive if it were not for the help and assistance they receive from voluntary and charitable organisations.</P>
      <P>Another allowance is the care allowance which is paid to certain categories of relatives of old age pensioners. One category of relative who should get special treatment is a daughter-in-law who cares for her husband's parents.  When a girl marries into a house in rural Ireland where the parents of her husband are alive she does not have the same responsibility to them as she would to her own.  If an allowance could be paid to such a person irrespective of whether she is supported by her husband it would help to keep many old people out of institutions.</P>
      <P>In the three budgets introduced by the Government since they came to power in 1977 they made no attempt to reduce the qualifying age for receipt of old age pensions.  The National Coalition in five budgets reduced the qualifying age by four years from 70 years of age to 66 years of age bringing many thousands of people into the social welfare code and enabling them to receive old age pensions. If the Government intend to reduce the qualifying age they would need to move quickly because time is running out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the field of health it would appear that the amount of money being provided to health boards this year will barely keep the services ticking over.  It was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning that the health boards have decided to come together and form a national organisation to seek sufficient funds to keep their services going.  I am a member of the North Eastern Health Board.  We had our budget meeting recently and the finance officer informed us that no money had been made available this year for what is known as minor capital allocation which means <Col N="1887" /> that we cannot start any minor improvements in any of our institutions.  We have had funds made available in the nature of a major capital allocation to start the rebuilding of an old people's home in Dundalk.  The money which is being made available for the day to day running costs of the health boards will barely see us through the year.</P>
    <P>In presenting the budget to the board the finance officer said that provided the budget was conscientiously operated we would survive this year but that if inflation continued we might have problems before the end of the year.  The finance officer was trying to make the best of a bad job.  One of the members of the board in a jocose remark said to the chairman, Deputy Farrell, that by the case the finance officer was making the Deputy might think of getting him onto the committee of 15.</P>
    <P>As regards home help services, health boards are, by Government regulation, not allowed to pay more than 60p an hour to people giving this kind of assistance. It is impossible for the health boards to get people to do this kind of work for 60p an hour.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the figure to £1 an hour.  If that were done it would help to keep many old people out of institutions.</P>
    <P>As regards education, since the Book of Estimates appeared the amount provided for school transport has been cut back from £16½ million last year to £16 million.  No account has been taken of inflation and the increased cost of running the service this year.  This has caused concern in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In September or October when the Dáil is in recess we may be told that there will be a cutback in school transport or that the people who avail of school transport may have to pay.  That should be deplored because we all know when parents were asked to agree to the closure of small rural schools and to agree to the centralisation of primary schools the carrot dangled in front of them was free school transport.  The Minister should make a statement to clear the air and allay the suspicions of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> The VAT rate of 20 per cent has been increased to 25 per cent.  This covers a wide range of items, such as furniture, a great deal of which is manufactured in my county by medium and small manufacturers who give very useful employment.  Time and again these businessmen have made the case that the VAT rate of 20 per cent on furniture, as against a rate of 8 per cent in the North, was having a very adverse effect on employment.  The 25 per cent rate will have a much more serious effect and I hope it will not be the cause of more unemployment in the furniture manufacturing industry in my area.  As I said, that industry gives useful and very lucrative employment to many people in my county.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this budget increases indirect taxation by a considerable amount.  People are being asked to pay more while they are expected to be content with worse services than they had in 1979.  This will increase inflation.  It will not increase employment and I hope it will not create further unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget contains what one might describe as a reasonable application of the available resources in an equitable way.  The main feature of this budget as far as I am concerned, is the increases in social welfare allowances.  The social welfare payments were increased by 25 per cent across the board.  This should be done on an annual basis.  People do not mind paying taxes as long as they are used to help the less well-off sections of the community.  I do not consider all social welfare recipients to be in the category of the less well-off sections of the community because the people in receipt of social welfare payments paid their hard earned money over the years for the benefits they receive on retirement age.  In other words, they are getting a return on their payments of social welfare stamps and insurance.  One might argue with the amount they are receiving weekly in return for the amount of insurance they paid over the years, but that is a matter for another day's debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> I consider the less well-off sections of the community to be widows or widowers living alone, the handicapped and the disabled members of our society. The general community want to ensure that these people have a minimum standard of living and they do not begrudge paying taxes to provide it.  One can only shudder at the present spiral of price increases in relation to social welfare payments, good as they are.  I do not know how some of these people survive the winter when one considers the savage increases in the cost of energy.  I am not talking about oil because that is outside the reach of the average social welfare recipient; I am talking about coal and turf.  We want to ensure that our senior citizens, people who for one reason or another cannot look after themselves, are properly helped through properly administered State aids.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Government collectively produced this budget. No one individual must take credit for it and no one individual must take the blame for it&mdash;over the past number of weeks there has been a lot of criticism of it from the Opposition.  Any fair-minded person will agree that the social welfare increases represent a fair application of available State resources.  There are no new schemes under the heading of social welfare.  Perhaps our civil servants, bureaucrats, call them what you will&mdash;I am not being critical of them because I have the greatest respect for them; there is one thing in favour of the Irish civil servant that is that he or she has never been found wanting in the service of the State&mdash;would look at the possibility of introducing new schemes under the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago when I first came into the House I suggested a deserted wives' allowance and after two or three years&mdash;my campaign was taken up by others&mdash;the Government accepted the need to introduce a social welfare provision for deserted wives.  I went on a campaign on behalf of the illegitimate child.  It was frowned on at the time but it was later accepted.  These are the type <Col N="1890" /> of things we should be looking at&mdash;we should be adding new elements of this nature to our social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty attached to the social welfare scheme which exists in all democracies.  I refer to representations made by public representatives for social welfare applicants.  Though one receives an acknowledgment in due course.  I dislike the time lag between the date on which representations were made and a decision on the individual claims.  This should be narrowed.  I make quite a number of representations in this respect, although people regard my constituency as affluent.  In Dún Laoghaire there are many needy people and this trend has increased.</P>
    <P>I have been talking generally about the need for new schemes under the social welfare system.  There has been growing concern among people, particularly among social workers, about waifs, young boys and girls living rough. This State has an obligation to take care of such children, no matter how they have come to be living rough.  Usually these children are between the ages of ten and 14 years.  They may be the product of broken homes.  They have drifted to the Dún Laoghaire area.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are a number of excellent social societies, like the society who keep open the Boylan Community Centre between 10 p.m. and one o'clock in the morning to give these people some place of refuge.  Such societies should be provided for under the social welfare code because we have an absolute, unequivocal obligation to look after these children.  There should be an arm in the Department who deal with this problem, or who should be dealing with it, to look after this problem specifically.  This growing and serious problem is not being dealt with.  It appears the more affluent our society becomes the more material it becomes, and the result is greater human casualty.  We have an obligation to look after the societies who take care of these social drop-outs.  They may be the victims of broken homes, they may be criminal residivists for all we know, they may have individual <Col N="1891" /> emotional problems which have not been dealt with by psychiatrists.  They are the people I should like to see catered for as a matter of urgency in the next budget.</P>
    <P>In regard to the mentally handicapped, Fianna Fáil's record has been good but I should like to see more tax revenue going in that direction.  There are institutions which do excellent work for the mentally handicapped and the physically disabled. For instance there is the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I accept that our social welfare system has served the country well in the last 20 years but we must take a new look at its operations.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the increased price of petrol as a result of the budget and to say that I do not consider a car to be a luxury any more.  It has become an essential piece of equipment in modern life.  It is not a great thing to own a car, and effectively it has replaced the bicycle as a means of transport.  I think the increase in petrol duty was unnecessarily severe, but I think the reason for the increase has been accepted.  I have explained to my constituents that the reason for the increase was to encourage an effort at energy conservation.  If that was the reason for it I do not think it has succeeded, but that is the main reason I gave for the big hike in the price of petrol. Another reason would be to collect more revenue to pay to social welfare recipients, particularly the non-contributory class.</P>
    <P>The price of the pint of stout and ale has also been referred to.  Too much drink is an evil thing and too little drink might be described as evil but I do not regard a medium intake of drink as being evil.  I do not intend to moralise on the evils of drink but I should like to appeal to the Government party, particularly those in the back benches, to go on a campaign against that evil system of rounds.  In my opinion that habit is insidious and should be discouraged.  There seems to be an element in our Celtic makeup which demands that we must prove ourselves by buying a round when we go into a pub, a round which many people cannot afford.  Apparently if you <Col N="1892" /> do not buy a round you are a mean man. I suggest there should be a notice in every pub in the country indicating the Government's anxiety about this matter of round buying.  It is a mean evil system which I believe to have been the cause of much of the over-drinking in our society.  It has been responsible to a great degree for our high incidence of alcoholism.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government to launch a campaign against round buying similar to the successful campaign against smoking.</P>

      <P>The budget is now a matter of recent memory.  Its effects are with us.  We have now reached the winding up stages of the budget debate but the real verdict on the effectiveness or otherwise of the budget for our economy will be delivered outside the House by the electorate.  It has been the essential case of those of us who have been critical of the budget that it did not face up squarely to some of the demands for fundamental reform in regard to taxation and that its reliance in the main on higher indirect taxation would put in peril the jobs of many in industry.  Another criticism was what the higher indirect taxation would be conducive to increasing the rate of inflation in 1980.  These were the serious charges made against the budget provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see little reason to alter my first reaction when the Minister had finished his budget speech.  My immediate reaction was to predict a rate of inflation this year in the region of 20 per cent and to criticise the very large increase in the price of petrol.  I am not laying the entire blame for this price increase at the Minister's door, but world events and the revenue which the Minister seeks from petrol will cause a very steep increase in the price of a gallon of petrol by the end of this year. On the evening of the budget I predicted that the price would be about £2 per gallon.  I also foresaw an increase in unemployment as a result of the budget provisions.  Those initial charges have been substantiated elsewhere since then as people began to examine in more <Col N="1893" /> depth the provisions of the budget.  The verdict of other interest groups has been delivered.  By their behaviour and the reluctance with which they have taken up gilts, the financial institutions have shown they are not convinced that the Government have the determination to put public finances in order and that the disarray which has characterised Government mismanagement of finances shows no sign of changing in the near future.</P>
    <P>We had a highly publicised meeting earlier this week between the Taoiseach, flanked by other Ministers, and the building societies.  When bank interest rates were increased recently the building societies indicated that they would be forced to follow suit.  An increase in mortgage rates would spell hardship for many thousands of householders throughout the country.  I understand that an interdepartmental committee has now been established and that is almost a recipe for procrastination.  All the Government Departments are meeting to consider the problem.  The Minister for Finance indicated during a radio interview that something might be done by way of a tax exemption measure when the Finance Bill comes before the House, but according to the building societies what is needed in the short term is a subsidisation of the kind which was implemented by the National Coalition Government when faced with a similar situation during a very difficult period.  Of course it would cost money, but the point has been made by a trade union source and also by the Director General of the Construction Industry Federation that, if we take into account the unemployment levels which may be reached this year in the building sector, finances used to subsidise the building societies would not be mis-spent and would not cost as much as some people imagine.</P>
    <P>The argument for some assistance to keep down mortgage interest rates is that an increase would cause grave hardship and would have a grave impact on the building industry, the biggest provider of employment.  During a year in which we <Col N="1894" /> must worry very much about our balance of payments situation, it must be said that the building and construction industry is not one which adds appreciably to our balance of payments problems.  We should try to maintain this industry in as healthy a state as possible so that it can provide the maximum number of jobs. There can be no doubt that if building society interest rates are increased unemployment will follow in the building industry.  We await the work of this interdepartmental committee and hope for some concrete results rather than head lines regarding urgent meetings.</P>
    <P>The building societies maintain that from the moment bank interest rates rose they were left with no choice but to make similar rearrangements regarding their own interest rates.  They explain that their deposits were attacked in January and February and they must alter their interest rates in order to maintain the inflow of funds, I hold no brief for the building societies and feel that a good deal of sensible reform is required in the way they manage their affairs, but as long as they are the chief repositories of housing finance their ability to provide finance must be protected by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we are asking for aid from a Government who have with heavy hand at times when it was not required spent taxpayers' money in a flagrantly profligate way.  A good deal of the difficulties now being faced arise from the earlier ill-considered election largesse of this Government.  They will not be doing anything odd or out of character if in this pressing case they meet, for reasons of social justice, the problems of householders and, for sound economic reasons, assist the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The increase in interest rates certainly endangers jobs and, whatever remedial action is taken regarding building society interest rates, the budget has pointed the economy in the direction of a high increase in inflation.  There is no doubt that throughout the year more jobs will be lost.  The budget has no <Col N="1895" /> altered the dismal destination of recession towards which the economy is heading.  The Taoiseach concedes that a growth rate of less than 1 per cent will be attained this year and that inevitably means the loss of jobs.  This autumn some 50,000 school leavers will be seeking jobs and we can visualise the difficulty of that search in an economy which is winding down.</P>
    <P>The next big test for the Government will be their ability to get another instalment or extension of the present national understanding.  This is a very important test on which a great deal hangs.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that he is very anxious to preserve industrial peace.  It is generally conceded that the series of the national wage agreements achieved throughout the seventies&mdash;four of them by the Government of which I was a member&mdash;and the present national understanding have contributed to improving the industrial relations picture.</P>
    <P>The recent agreement had even more ambitious targets for employment and for taxation reform.  Discussions have taken place on a tripartite basis between the Government, employers and unions. There has been a great deal of complaint from the union side that the undertakings given by the Government have not been fully lived up to&mdash;presumably, the Government representatives will hear much more of this in the forthcoming talks.  It is arguable that the budget about which we are talking here has an important bearing on what happens with regard to inflation and a bearing on the way financial institutions look at Government performances.  Arguably, on a similar level of importance is the ability of a Government to negotiate a national understanding or wage agreement, whichever term is preferred, with which the economy can live for the year ahead.  There is a very big test of this Government coming up now on the national understanding.  One wonders whether the budget has contributed to success on the part of the Government in getting a reasonable extension of the present national understanding, one <Col N="1896" /> which will give wage increases consonant with an expansion in economic opportunities by more jobs.  One wonders whether they have brought that prospect nearer, or have made it more difficult to obtain.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred recently in Limerick to the dream of young people for unity of the country.  He may well be right, that that is the dominant dream of young people of this country.  Certainly I can say, with some sureness, that there is no doubt that the quest of young people for jobs or their quest for housing and accommodation throughout this year of 1980 will certainly acquire the immateriality of a dream.  The Taoiseach may be right that they will be dreaming about unity throughout 1980 but the dream of a house and a job will certainly become very illusive indeed.  These quests will acquire dreamlike dimensions, because the jobs will not be there and certainly, if the building societies go ahead, the houses will not be there and the ability to get a house of one's own will not be there.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism from the trade union movement was related to the fact that the budget had done very little, or that the Government had not done sufficient last year and coming up to this year on the whole case of tax reform. Undoubtedly in the budget some attempt was made to deal with some of the demands in the tax reform area.  This, of course, makes sense from the Government's point of view.  Undoubtedly one of the major contributions to turbulent industrial relations at the tail end of each year has been the frustration felt by many PAYE people throughout the country.  That frustration has taken effect in higher wage claims.  It makes sense, therefore, that any Government which wishes to have peace in industrial relations should try to gain that peace by fundamental reform of the tax system, especially as it bore on the PAYE wage and salary earners.</P>
    <P>We had the mammoth marches of last year.  One does not wish to predict like demonstrations in the future but by the end of this year we may find similar discontent <Col N="1897" /> to that of the past year, despite the changes made in the budget on the tax front.  Of course, the effect of these changes is uneven, to say the least, in the taxation area.  It cannot be forgotten that the combined effect of income splitting and the increasing of the tax bands does little more than restore the real value of the 1974 budget in tax terms to the taxpayers. A married couple now, for example, will be able to earn the same amount of taxable income in real terms as they had in 1974, before going above the standard 35 per cent rate of taxation. In his budget speech the Minister referred to this fact by saying that the tax burden on married people would now&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;be less than at any time&rdquo; since 1974 or 1975.  He made no similar statement about the position of single people since 1974, except to say that 90 per cent of them would benefit by comparison with their position in 1977 to 1978.  He made no mention of the fact that their tax burden has increased since 1974.  It is also forgotten that single people form about two-fifths of all PAYE wage earners.  Single people make up a very large category indeed.</P>
    <P>The budget recognises that PAYE taxpayers are at a disadvantage by comparison with the self-employed because they pay tax on an on-going rather than a previous year basis and, more important, the biggest single distinction between the PAYE wage and salary earner and the self-employed person is that the former is unable to escape the payment of tax.  To take account of this the Minister introduced a special schedule E employee allowance of £400. Welcome though that concession might be and leaving aside the fact that, intentionally or otherwise, on the Minister's behalf the claim was made in his budget speech that this was the allowance introduced, apparently he forgot to mention that part of that £400 allowance was already conceded from the end of last year as part of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>In relation to that £400 allowance granted to all PAYE workers there was <Col N="1898" /> a failure on the part of the Minister to index this allowance or, indeed, any of the other tax free allowances.  As a result of this failure the real value of these tax free allowances will be eroded as we go through the year.  The actual reforms in this PAYE area will mean less as wage increases move up during the year and by the autumn we may be back to a level of simmering discontent similar to what we had last autumn.  There are implications outside the economic sphere for that possible scenario for the Government in their term of office.  This is something that I referred to a year ago.</P>
    <P>It must be granted that the Government did not carry out the threats of certain of the papers in 1978 and 1979 of those people who are now gone to the backbenches.  However, the present Minister was a member of the Cabinet which probably approved of them. Remember the threat in these papers to tax social welfare benefits and children's allowances.  To remove food subsidies was another option to raise additional revenue.  There has not been any recent indication that it is their intention to take that road.  If there is any flirtation with that possible set of options, I would advise the Government to forget that if they are trying to get an extension of the national understanding.  As I said at the start, if the Government are to get an extension of the present national understanding&mdash;something of the same sort as we had this year&mdash;union leaders, for their part, will look very carefully indeed at the non-wage elements of that agreement. The Minister and his fellow negotiators should note in any eventual talks with the unions that there is wide disenchantment throughout the trade union movement with the failure of the Government to live up to the employment targets and other matters relating to the national understanding.</P>
    <P>Employment has been the chief casualty in the recent budget.  We all know that employment will suffer during this year of 1980 as a result of the high inflationary economy that the Government are prepared to live with.  The increases in indirect taxation will obviously <Col N="1899" /> increase this year's rate of inflation &mdash; some people argue to over 20 per cent, but annualised it will be somewhere around 20 per cent.  This will have a severe effect on living standards of social welfare recipients.  The increases which have been given will not in any way make up for the inflation now in prospect.  It cannot be forgotten that when the unions looked for certain increases in welfare benefits they assumed that the rate of inflation this year would be 15 per cent. It is now way ahead of that.  The welfare increases come into effect from April onwards and will just about keep the most defenceless section of our community in line with the cost of living taking into account this year's rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>I believe it will be the Government's continued treatment of the PAYE sector that will ensure the continuation of national wage agreements and an understanding with trade unions.  If the Government fail they will be faced with a trade union movement that will engage in plant-by-plant bargaining throughout the economy with possible disruption in the improving industrial relations position. A point not dealt with by the Government was that trade union spokesmen had looked for a special tax free allowance for expenses related to travelling costs incurred by employees in connection with their work.  Our ramshackle public transport system makes it vital in many parts of the country for employees to provide their own transport.  It is to be regretted the Government did not see fit to deal with the problem.  The tax treatment of travelling expenses of employees by comparison with expenses of the self-employed has been highly discriminatory. The self-employed can claim in relation to travelling to their work but the same is not true in relation to the PAYE sector.  The increased petrol duty imposed by the Government magnifies the problem.  Despite the fact that employees will have to pay more to get to work they will not be able to claim tax relief on the additional costs.  At the same time the self-employed will continue to <Col N="1900" /> receive favourable tax treatment in this matter.  This is a small but important injustice in the context of the higher costs for petrol and I suggest that the Minister for Finance should consider the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to company taxation, the budget was not very acceptable.  There is a very low rate of tax on the profits of banking and financial companies as well as on many manufacturing companies.  In the current year corporation tax will yield about 6 per cent of tax revenue.  This is quite unfair when compared with the contribution of the PAYE sector.  No major changes were made in this area and from what one can gather it does not appear to be the Minister's intention to undertake any changes here.  He made a change in relation to entertainment expenses for tax purposes but it was a minor one.  He evaded the main question of how we bring the corporate sector fairly into the tax net like other elements in the economy. I am not talking of penal taxation on production &mdash; I am talking of a fair return to the Exchequer from these companies in accordance with their ability to pay.  It need not endanger jobs.  Other economies tax in this area and there is no reason we should not do the same.  The omnibus plea that employment would be threatened no longer carries conviction. I know a commission has been set up to consider the matter.  I hope it will not be like other commissions and that progress will be made.  The annoyance engendered by the feeling of being discriminated against, of others getting off scot-free or of receiving more favourable treatment, is a real part of the discontent felt by the PAYE sector.  If the Government are anxious for good industrial relations, they should deal with this matter and not run away from it.  Above all, they should not think that setting up a commission will be mistaken for action by those who are looking for reform.</P>
    <P>The budget was highly unsatisfactory with regard to capital taxation.  Wealth tax was abolished from 1977 and that left us with only two capital taxes &mdash; the capital gains tax which has been emasculated <Col N="1901" /> and the capital acquisitions tax which has been substantially modified.  It is interesting to note that if the pre-1975 death duties legislation was still in force, the yield from estate duty last year would have been £44 million whereas the capital gains tax and the capital acquisitions tax will yield only £10,500,000 this year. There has been no change in this area and that has been a disappointing reaction from the Government.  Any Government who refuse to tackle the question of capital payments either by way of capital gains or wealth tax, cannot expect the PAYE sector to take them seriously.  Any attempt by them to evade reform in this area will not be borne by those concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government failed to lower the threshold for liability to capital acquisitions tax; in fact, they increased the threshold for farmers by raising the upper limits in respect of special agricultural relief.  The fine print of all these matters will be pored over by those who are serious about taxation reform and if there is no action in areas like this the campaign for wider tax reform will continue and become stronger.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the budget he made much play about the fact that he had been fair and just in the social welfare area.  The budget increased the short-term social welfare benefits by 20 per cent and the longer-term benefits by 25 per cent.  At first glance these might appear to be reasonably generous but when we take into account the inflation expected this year it will be seen they just about keep the unfortunate recipients level with the price increases expected, In percentage terms it must not be forgotten that the social welfare increases apply only from April.  One part of the increases in the social welfare area that I shall have to refer to critically is the new found distinction between short-term and long-term benefits and the lower rate of increase for the former. Why should recipients of unemployment assistance benefits or disability benefit or supplementary welfare allowances be <Col N="1902" /> penalised in this way?  No satisfactory answer was given when this question was raised before in the House.  This is the second year running in which this has happened.  I do not see anything from the Minister or his colleague in Social Welfare to indicate that it will not happen again next year if they are around.</P>
    <P>The Minister conceded that children's allowances are an important element in the range of social benefits.  He said it had never been the Government's intention to cut back on these allowances &mdash; shades of the Green Paper because obviously that was one of the options mentioned in 1978.  The present rates of children's allowances are £3.50 per month for the first child and £5.50 for the second and subsequent children.  These are being increased by the budget to £4.50 and £7 from July.  Before saying that is a good improvement we should recall that children's allowances were last increased in 1974.  I do not know what the consumer price index was in that year but since then it has risen by about 135 per cent.  One could say, being strictly accurate and abiding by the real value of money and what these increases really amount to against the background of the increased cost of living, that if the present children's allowances were truly meant to compensate for the increase in the cost of living since 1974 the kind of increase we would have been looking for would give £5.50 for the first child, £7.75 for the second and something in excess of £9 for the third.  Such increases would be needed if we wanted to keep up with cost of living changes since 1974.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by a trade union spokesman that the dropping of the third and higher rate of children's allowance in 1979 for which the Minister argued &mdash; but his arguments might be more acceptable if there had been a levelling upwards of the other allowances rather than a levelling downward &mdash; has meant that the larger family has lost out as a result of the changes made.</P>
    <P>One makes these points because the electorate we are dealing with is no <Col N="1903" /> longer one that can be bamboozled by a budget day speech.  We are now dealing with a very sophisticated electorate when it comes to allowances and what they are entitled to.  The remarks I am making here are being made elsewhere in the country.  Certainly, one hears them in trade union negotiating circles and they will be heard when the Government meet in tripartite sessions in the national understanding discussions.  Arguments and points like these will be made.  It is regrettable that in a budget which it was proclaimed should be regarded as one which tried to tackle social problems so little was done in the case of one parent families.  No special concessions were made in this area.  The increased allowances for child dependants being brought in line with other benefits was the only change.  The only specific recognition given to one parent families was in the taxation area.  While that may seem a great concession it would be interesting to know how many one parent families are in the taxation area.  I suggest there are very few.  One suspects that the actual benefit to one parent families arising from taxation changes is minimal because the parent of such families is usually not employed.</P>
    <P>There is no change in pensionable age. During the seventies we had a gradual reduction from 69 as the old age pension qualification age in 1973, to 66 in October 1977.  We had given an undertaking of a continued reduction on an annual basis.  Obviously, that has been forgotten.  In an economy where we are looking for job opportunities for young people, the more we can encourage people voluntarily to resign from work at a certain age, say in their early fifties, the more it would be beneficial if financial help could be given to such people so that they did not have to go on working beyond a certain age and could devote themselves to the leisure which the Taoiseach was so anxious that the young people in Limerick should discuss at their recent Fianna Fáil Youth ArdFheis. Unfortunately, we know that other effects of the budget will mean that too many young people this year will be <Col N="1904" /> victims of enforced leisure, arising as a result of growing unemployment.  It is regrettable that we had no action on the matter of pensionable age and also regrettable that we had no indication of any early Government commitment to continue the policy of reducing the old age qualification introduced by the Coalition Government.  I think the cost to the Exchequer as a result of the gradual reduction was not as large as some criticis would maintain and in the context of opening up more job opportunities it was very necessary.</P>
    <P>On the matter of discrimination against women in the budget it is fair to say it contained no indication of any commitment by the Government fully to implement the European Community directive on equality between men and women in social security matters.  We still have no progress in this area, no progress on such outstanding anomalies as unemployment benefit which is still payable to married women for 42 weeks only compared to 65 weeks for any other qualified person.  That is discrimination and there is no indication of any action.  There is no action about the fact that married women still receive a lower personal rate of unemployment benefit, injury benefit and invalidity pension. Married women will still not qualify for unemployment assistance except in very special and limited circumstances. These are not extraordinary demands; they are cases where we should be complying with or making haste to comply with the relevant EEC directive.</P>
    <P>On the general economic front the budget has not assisted in the winding down of inflation but has contributed to inflation with the obviously bad consequences for the economy that the high inflation rate will have throughout this year.  It will adversely affect employment. On the other ground on which the Government sought our support, its advances in the social area, the budget could not be considered as an honest attempt to meet some of the anomalies and injustices that still exist.  It did not even begin the work in many areas of ridding us of these differences and injustices. The budget raised benefits but not sufficiently <Col N="1905" /> to keep pace with the kind of inflation we expect this year.  The budget has perpetuated an unacceptable distinction between long-term and short-term social welfare recipients.  It increased children's allowances but not enough to compensate for the recent increases in prices.  For the larger family, as a result of changes in the third child allowance, these families must lose out.</P>
    <P>It gave no special recognition to one-parent families, recognition which could have been given by an increase in the allowance for child dependants.  The budget did not give any recognition to the plight of elderly workers because it did not reduce the pension qualifying age.  It also failed to meet many of the anomalies which married women still suffer from at work and failed to eliminate the remaining aspects of discrimination against them as laid down in the EEC directive.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that employment remains the chief casualty of this year's budget.  The implications of the Government's White Paper on the economy are that we can expect little or no growth in employment in the next few years. Without overstating the problem, it is obvious that we are facing nothing short of a crisis on the employment front in the next few years.  We will have a continuing increase in the country's labour force but a decrease in our capacity to provide the requisite number of new jobs.  Budgetary policy can only make matters worse.  The ESRI, in their commentary earlier this year, estimated that investment in 1980 would fall by 3 per cent.  They made that prediction in January but I believe they could record an even together verdict now.  The January forecast represents a massive turn-around on the 16 per cent increase in investment experienced last year.  Of course, we must remember that preceding the budget, but as part of the budget package, were the Government cut-backs announced in the Book of Estimates.  Those cuts will accentuate the deflationary impact of the cut-back in investment predicted by the ESRI.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> The Book of Estimates, which outlines the Government's plans for current expenditure, and the public capital programme, were published a few days preceding budget day.  We learned from those that when the public sector pay rises are excluded the Government intend spending only 5 per cent more on current goods and services this year. When that intention of the Government is set against inflation, which is expected to be about 20 per cent this year, we can see that there will be a severe reduction in investment in real terms.  The sequel is inevitable, higher unemployment and less recruitment to the public service thereby reversing the trend of recent years.  This adds force to what a colleague of the Minister was saying recently, that the higher interest rates make sensitive many industries.  That was a euphemism for saying that there will be bankruptcies in many Irish firms.</P>
    <P>In a television broadcast before Christmas the Taoiseach asked us to make 1980 the year of good industrial relations and industrial peace.  So effective has that message been that he has persuaded some of his Cabinet colleagues that good industrial relations have come about as a result of that broadcast.  The Minister for Labour has been telling us that quite frequently of late.  Retention of one's post in the Government can bring about this kind of zeal which we see on the part of the Minister for Labour.  That zeal is the chief characteristic of the survivors in the Cabinet at present.  Who is to blame them if they look and see some supernatural power in the Taoiseach's appeal for good industrial relations?  There are other reasons which suggest why we had less strikes in the economy so far this year.  To put it at a very cynical level, it would be difficult to have more than we had last year.  The year 1980 is more likely to go down as the year of bankruptcies as a result of the economic decisions adopted in the budget.  The cost of money is rocketing and the ill-effects of such happenings cannot be avoided by those running small industries. Commentators have recognised that small firms provide most of the new <Col N="1907" /> jobs throughout the country but those firms will suffer as a result of the budget. One of the greatest faults of Governments in recent times has been their proneness to consider large firms to be the main providers of jobs in our economy. Small firms have provided most of the new jobs and may be relied upon to do so in the future but that will not happen this year.  Those firms will be so busy trying to avoid bankruptcy that they will not be in a position to create new jobs.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme shows an increase of 15 per cent.  At first glance that appears to be a bright picture but on examination one can see that that increase in real terms represents a standstill rather than an increase when one takes into account the expected rate of inflation.  Only in the areas of telecommunication and energy is any substantial increase in expenditure projected in real terms.  Expenditure on building and construction will experience a minimal real increase but within this category the real outlay on house building will actually decline.  When one considers the implications of those facts one can see that it is not simply doom-boding on the part of the Opposition when they say that 1980 will be the year of increased unemployment and the year of bankruptcy problems in many industries.  With the completion of the NET project real spending on industry will also fall substantially.  If one excludes the NET project from the reckoning one will see that the increased expenditure on industry in real terms will be minimal.  Real capital expenditure on hospitals has been frozen.  There is also a reduction in the amount for the roads programme.  Mike Murphy will have plenty of material for his radio programme and his pothole competition. The road at Westland Row daily becomes more like what I imagine the side roads in the capital of the Congo to have been, a pothole from one end to the other.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that the fall in educational investment will be greater than the rate of inflation.  That cut has <Col N="1908" /> been made by a Government which welcomes the challenge of young people. What kind of challenge is it to cut down on the rate of investment in education? It is no wonder that the Taoiseach in Limerick wanted the afternoon to be devoted to an anodyne discussion on leisure.  There are so many real problems stalking the land for young people, no jobs, cut-backs in education and a high rate of inflation.  What a land of promise the Government are creating for our young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has preserved an almost ominous silence on the question of employment, as well he might. Looking at the Government's plans for this year the most honest thing for them to do is to preserve silence on the matter. It would be dishonest to be sanguine about employment prospects for this year in the light of these expenditure charts. When the Minister and his colleagues meet the trade unions they will face questions from the trade union leaders on the commitment in the national understanding to an average increase in employment of 25,000 a year.  The Minister did not avail of the opportunity provided in his budget speech to say what concrete plans he has in mind to underwrite the shortfall of 10,000 in the jobs target in the national understanding.  I am talking about specific undertakings, apart from windy rhetorical commitments to provide employment.  The Government are heavy on rhetoric but what are the specific plans?</P>
    <P>The Minister may evade these questions today, but they will be asked and they will be a necessary prelude to any extension of the national understanding the Government hope to get in the next few weeks.  In the past, I worked with employers and unions to achieve national agreements and I believe the system has worked reasonably well.  It had its faults and imperfections but, until someone comes along with a better system, I do not know of any better in our situation. If it is important to get an extension of the present one, then it will be necessary <Col N="1909" /> for the Minister to come forward with specific proposals on the employment front.  Otherwise he will face the prospect of what is called euphemistically a free for all, that is, plant by plant industrial bargaining which means a very rough ride for industrial relations for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>The opportunities open to the Government for Fundamental reform in this budget were closed off to a great extent by the Government's earlier behaviour. The days of wine and roses of 1977 have been replaced by statements about wage moderation and cutbacks in 1980, but that is the kind of country we now live in.  People are impatient for reform and are looking for the elimination of injustice. Their attention is focussed very closely on the taxation system.  If the Government have cut off the possibility of widespread reform in many areas, they have plenty of room to manoeuvre and sufficient scope for action is still open to them.  I and others have referred to their failure to act in the whole area of capital taxation.  Of course a committee is looking into that, but it would be a mistake for the Government to think reform in this area can be postponed indefinitely by the stratagem of appointing committees.</P>
    <P>All in all, my disappointment with the budget arises from the fact that the Government were elected in 1977 &mdash; and what could be referred to as their change in management occurred before Christmas &mdash; with the announced prospect of more competent handling of our economic problems.  We have not seen that in this budget which has been described as a high risk strategy by one respected firm of brokers in Britain.  The term &ldquo;high risk strategy&rdquo; was given by that firm specifically to the strategy adopted by the British Prime Minister, and we know the reactions of the British trade unions to that strategy, its effects on wage bargaining in Britain, and the chaos and mayhem which have occurred in British industry. I would not be over-confident that a similar result can be avoided here because of the high risk strategy we have adopted.</P>
    <P>With a high rate of inflation and growing unemployment, I see little reason to <Col N="1910" /> amend my first reaction to this budget that the rate of inflation will be of the order of 20 per cent.  From the point of view of democracy it is good to note that it does not matter what majority the Government have in this House.  The real verdict on the effectiveness of the Budget will come from outside this House.  The people will form their verdict as the time approaches inevitably when the Government will go before the people once more for approval or otherwise.  I speak for a selection of the elected.  I represent the city and county of Dublin in the European Parliament and I can say there is widespread disillusionment with the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up where Deputy O'Leary left off and refer to the attitude outside the House to this budget.  It is not true to say that the budget is introduced by the Minister and <Col N="1911" /> debated by Deputies and then has no bearing on the economy or on the people. Criticism or praise of the budget will come from the public perception of its effects.  The public will judge whether it is suitable for the economy in 1980 and whether it will deal with the problems facing us.  One of the problems is to try to bring order and balance into our public finances.  Another is how it deals with inflation as a consequence of the tax revolt last year and the feeling of many people that they are being treated unfairly under the present tax system as opposed to other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number one enemy in trying to bring order into finances or taxation is inflation.  I did not hear any speaker refer specifically to the problem of energy and its effects on the economies of the world. Admittedly I did not hear all the speeches or read all the contributions. Bringing order and balance into public finances is stated as one of the aims of the Government and one of the objectives of the 1980 budget.  Any Martian who descended into this country after 27 February last who heard the ringing phrases of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach about bringing order and balance into our public finances would be forgiven for thinking that that was something that would occur only from 27 February on and for thinking that before that nobody was responsible for the disorder in our public finances.  That can be directly traced to the policies pursued by Fianna Fáil since they came to office in 1977, policies of deliberate budget deficits on the current side which had to be financed by borrowing.  There seems to be an impression among some Deputies and among some people outside the House that a deficit is something that goes away at the end of the year. This is not true, a deficit is like an albatross around the necks of the taxpayers where as long as the capital remains unpaid and as long as interest remains to be paid we must borrow to finance that deficit.  This budget might mean that there is more realisation about <Col N="1912" /> the sophistication of public finances.  The people are, hopefully, beginning to realise the connection between the taxes they pay, the policies pursued by Governments, the balancing of a budget in any one year and the requirement in succeeding years to pay for the shortfall in previous years.  The consequences of borrowing in any year will be felt as long as the capital remains unpaid and interest has to be paid on the borrowing.</P>
    <P>In relation to deficits in budgets, they have been with us now for about ten years.  At the start of the oil crisis early in the seventies we pursued a policy of having a deficit budget in order to maintain employment because we felt that this was the way to cushion the inflationary effects of the oil crisis on the economy.  That was a successful policy. The <i>Irish Banking Review</i> issued last month is the latest independent report published on the economy and in relation to current budget deficits it says:</P>
    <P>The stated purpose of these deficits has been to protect living standards and employment through a period of high inflation and pressure on employment growth.</P>
    <P>Such a policy is subject to strict limitations and it can be operated for only a limited period. </P>
    <P>It is precisely for those reasons that we operated such a policy.  Having come through that period it was obvious to the Government of which I was a member that that policy had to be wound down. We lost office in 1977.  Fianna Fáil introduced budgets in 1978, 1979 and 1980 and the same copy of that review said that:</P>
    <P>In January, 1978 a deficit budget was introduced (the current deficit in the year 1978 was £398 million) but the economy was not in the grip of a recession at that time.  Indeed throughout 1976 and 1977 activity in industry, and particularly in industrial exports, had been at very high levels following the recovery which emerged in the latter part of 1975. </P>
    <P>If there is any vindication of the policies we pursued or any criticism of the <Col N="1913" /> policies pursued by this Government that is not politically biased it is this report.  Reasonably enough, people outside the House would say that any criticism of the present Government from this side would contain an element of bias and <i>vice versa</i> but this independent body produced a review which endeavours to look coldly at the economy and the policies being pursued and they came up with the finding that the Fianna Fáil budgets of 1978 and 1979 were unnecessary.  They are not sure yet but the broad hint in the balance of the argument is that the 1980 budget will not be of benefit to the economy. That is because of the budgets of 1978 and 1979.  The effects of one budget dictate policies and make decisions necessary in succeeding years.  These decisions might be different if the difficulties brought forward from preceding years were not there.  There is no doubt that the loose spending policies pursued by Fianna Fáil in 1978 and 1979 have made the present budget necessary.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister say on a number of occasions that the problems facing the economy in 1979 were not obvious until the budget had been introduced that year.  That is not so, the problems facing the economy and the economies of all the oil dependent world were quite obvious from the time of the general strike in Iran at the oil refineries in the middle of 1978 although they were not taken into account by the Government in framing their budget for 1979. The deficit in the 1979 budget was £521 million although the deficit budgeted for was £289 million.  It was almost twice the amount budgeted for and this year the budget is £353 million.  Can we hope that the figures for this year's budget will not be as much astray at the end of this year as were the figures for 1979 having regard to the budget projections of February 1979?  This bringing of order and balance into our public finances is to a large extent cosmetic in this budget because the Minister is bringing from last year and deducting from the amount of money that will be necessary for him to borrow, the sums that were unpaid <Col N="1914" /> because of the postal strike in 1979.  The Minister will also bring forward from 1981 and this is why people should be nervous about what 1981 has in store for us.  To bring the budget as near balancing as possible this year, the Minister has brought forward from 1979 a sum of £80 million or £100 million and from 1981 the Minister has brought forward payment of £24 million approximately from the self-employed who have been asked to make an earlier payment, and there is a further £8 million or £9 million in duty on spirits which will be paid in December of 1980 rather than in March of 1981.  Taking these three figures into account the real deficit is much higher and the real borrowing requirement for 1980 is much higher than the Minister stated in the budget.  Of course only for the very hefty indirect taxation imposed, that borrowing requirement would be very much higher.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word about the taxation elements in the budget.  The readjustment of the tax bands has been of benefit to people at a salary level which tended to remove the incentive from them to earn and to work; I refer to people earning over £10,000.  Some people might hold that these were the more wealthy members of our community and that they were less deserving and less in need of relief in their taxation bill than others.  But there are real reliefs being given to them and that is reasonable because, compared to many other countries where these people might be tempted to go to earn their living, these people were more heavily taxed here than was good for the economy and it certainly did not provide them with any incentive to work.  But it is a pity that it would not have been possible to extend that downwards to those less well off, those earning under £8,000 or £9,000, so that a proportionately equal relief would be granted to all.</P>
    <P>Let us take the budget as a whole. Taking the payments in indirect taxation, the increase in petrol and oil, the increase on beer and spirits, car tax and VAT as against the relief given in taxation,  <Col N="1915" /> it would appear that the charge made that there is no benefit in the budget to anybody earning less than £8,000 or £9,000 a year is well founded. That applies particularly to single people. I am sure that after the marches of last year the Minister recognised the necessity for granting some relief to help to damp down the anger of the taxpayers. But it is also fair to say that the budget made a virtue out of the necessity that was imposed by the Supreme Court decision. The Government had no real alternative but to introduce new bands and new rates of tax as a result of that decision and we are all grateful for it.</P>
    <P>The Government took another decision referred to by the Minister in his speech.  That was to set up the Commission on Taxation.  It is unclear what the purpose of this commission was.  The Minister in his budget speech said that it was to assist the Government to provide an adequate tax system.  That is a laudable aim and we would all subscribe to it provided that the findings of the commission would be brought forward very quickly and that they would be accepted. Of course the history of commissions on taxation here is that the findings have not come forward quickly and when they have they were of a nature that had only a marginal influence on the tax burden on the public.  On 15 April Deputy Horgan asked the Minister:</P>
    <P>Is it correct to say that the commission's terms of reference include a request from the Government for an early report on the question of taxation of banking profits...? </P>
    <P>The Minister said that he had attended the inaugural meeting of the commission the previous day.  In reply to the question the Minister said:</P>
    <P>... at the inaugural meeting of the commission yesterday I did refer the question of profits and tax on profits of the financial institutions and others to them for urgent consideration for interim reports. </P>
    <P>Yet, on the following day, 16 April, in <Col N="1916" /> the debate on interest rates when Deputy FitzGerald said that the Minister has said that he was referring the question of the banks' profits to the commission, the Minister denied it.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The commission are not being asked to look at bank profits but to look at the question of taxation on those profits, and that is a rather different matter. </P>
    <P>Obviously some of us are confused as to exactly what the commission are looking at in this regard.  If the commission are being asked to look at bank profits then it would appear that the Government are under the impression that bank profits are something that can be further taxed. Indeed the speech by one of the Ministers of State at the weekend would make it appear that the Government was running up a flag and signalling the banks that they were dissatisfied with their performance and intended looking into their profits. On two days running the Minister made two different statements so I am not sure what the position is.  But, taking the Minister's statements with the statement of the Minister of State at the weekend it appeared to me and to many people outside to be quite obviously put together by somebody else and given to the Minister of State to deliver as an attack on the banks but that it came from either the Minister for Finance or somebody else. I cannot prove that but this is how it appeared to me and to many other people.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that he had no function or say over the rates of interest charged by banks, that he was informed and that the Central Bank was the pricing authority for commercial banks.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has no say over the rates charged by banks but if he is dissatisfied with their profits and if the speech by the Minister of State last weekend attacking the banks is in the Cabinet's mind at present then the Government have a duty to do something about it.  It is not good enough to send out a Minister of State to make a speech attacking the banks if there is no follow-up to it.  The Minister concerned is Minister of State in the <Col N="1917" /> Department of Justice.  He is a man who is new in his job and whose brief encompasses law reform vaguely and there are many other things he could talk about in his own Department as a Minister holding a new portfolio and a new set of instructions that would be of interest. Why was he chosen to deliver this speech which is an attack on the banks?  This is a cowardly way to go about it by the Government.</P>
    <P>If the Government are dissatisfied with the way the banks are behaving, as the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism appears to be, they should come out as he did and attack them frontally. If a section of the Government feel as that Minister does, they should say so and not use a Minister of State to throw the mud they have made into balls.  It is not fair to the Minister concerned nor does it help to inspire confidence by the financial institutions in the Government. No doubt the Minister will say that my interpretation of this is not correct and that the Minister of State decided to make this speech, that it was his own personal feeling and that he had nothing else to talk about in his Department and decided to attack the banks.  If the Minister for Finance says that I will have to accept it because I would not know any better.</P>
    <P>The financial institutions are entitled to know whether the Government have confidence in them or not because there are contradictory sounds coming from the Government about the banks.  The public are entitled to know whether the Government have any authority over the banks and, if they have, if they intend using it.  If the Minister for Finance whose job it is, and not that of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, says that he has no intention of interfering with the pricing mechanism of the commercial banks that might be the right decision.  It is obviously the advice he got from those who are advising him in this regard, the Central Bank.  If there is such a thing as Cabinet responsibility and united Government, the Minister for Finance, for the sake of his pride if not for the sake of the unity of the Government, <Col N="1918" /> should not allow himself to be humiliated by speeches such as those made over last weekend by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Doherty.  If there are two Ministers attacking the banks while at the same time he is saying that he has confidence in them and that they are doing the right thing according to the advice he is getting, he should go to the Taoiseach and ask to have them removed from office or to shut up.  It may appear politically clever for the Government to be speaking out of both sides of their mouths at this time.  That is the kind of chicken that comes home to roost and the kind of trickery that can only damage the very sensitive set of balances that keep an economy moving forward.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister, and say this without any political partisanship, that if he does not establish that he is the one dealing with the financial institutions and ensure that his Cabinet colleagues and junior Ministers shut up about matters that are purely in his area of responsibility, then we will all suffer from that in the future.  There must be confidence and an element of trust between the financial institutions and the Government of the day.  That is essential.  If the financial institutions feel that what the Minister for Finance says does not really matter because there are people sniping away at him in the background for other reasons, that will damage the economy in as much as it will be another straw in the wind of damage being done by the Government. What the Government do affects the country and if the country is damaged everyone suffers.</P>
    <P>A savage battery of indirect taxations were imposed in the budget.  They will have a serious and damaging effect on the economy because of their effect on inflation which is the number one enemy not just in this country but in others as well.  If we do not bring our level of inflation down to the same rate as that of our main competitors in external markets we cannot survive as a nation.  Jobs will be lost as sure as God made little apples.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> The country can only expand its work force by expanding industry and can only expand industry by finding new export markets.  That is a truism.  If we do anything that damages&mdash;there is a lot in the budget that does&mdash;that prospect of remaining competitive on our home markets with imported goods or on our export markets with the people we have to compete against, then the prospects for the economy and employment are not good.</P>
    <P>There have been many assessments as to the effect on the cost of living of the measures introduced in the budget.  If we take the most favourable one, that produced by the Government, at 3.8 per cent which is just the effect of the increased prices as a result of the tax imposed by the budget, that still means that the year-on-year inflation rate by mid-May will be coming up towards 20 per cent.  This is at a time when our trading partners in the EMS have inflation rates in some cases of only one-third of that. That does not take into account the effect the 3.8 per cent increase in the budget will have on other costs and the snowball effect it will have on the inflation figure as it works its way through the economy for the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Michael O'Leary said, with the rates of CPI increases already forecast, the negotiation of a national understanding will be extremely difficult. That is probably true.  People genuinely fear that whatever wage increase they get when the agreement ends they will be financially worse off than they were earlier.  This fear exists because the trade unions and workers do not have faith that the Government will keep inflation within reasonable bounds.  This tends to make the negotiators look for increases to cover what they think will be the rate of inflation for the next 12 months.  This affects our costs.  If our costs are wrong we cannot sell our goods; if we cannot sell our goods, not alone will it not be possible to expand employment, but we will not be able to retain our present rate of employment.</P>
    <P>Thankfully many of our larger new industries <Col N="1920" /> can survive and hold their own, if not expand, within the present inflation figures, with the present high bank rates and the higher energy cost that will result from this budget, because they are modern, well-equipped, adequately financed, and in many instances, are selling in markets where there is little or no competition, or they are selling products of which there is not an over-supply.  But many of our older, traditional industries are in very serious trouble.  I cannot emphasise that fact often enough.  I know it is a fact from talking to people working in some of the older, labour-intensive industries.  They should be given some hope for the future.  I do not want to prophesy a bleak 1980 for some people in jobs, but I would not be doing my duty if I did not keep emphasising this fact to the Minister.  I know the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is getting this advice from the directors of Fóir Teoranta.  Last year the Minister allocated £6 million to Fóir Teoranta and £3.1 million was spent; on that basis, this year he allocated £3 million to them.  I have no doubt he will be back here later in the year with a Supplementary Estimate for an increased allocation to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Inflation has affected small traditional businesses by making it necessary for them to invest extra money in stock. They get this money by borrowing from the banks.  This means they must provide extra money to repay interest charges. The interest rate for their total borrowing increases because interest rates will match inflation rates and <i>vice versa.</i> These companies are now facing a national understanding that will also reflect the rate of inflation.  That may be regrettable, but the Government should not say that the indirect taxes in the budget should be discounted as far as negotiations for a new national understanding are concerned.</P>
    <P>Many small vulnerable industries are faced with a free-for-all.  They can be very quickly put out of business because many of them are not efficient exporters. They do not have a tradition of exporting in spite of the help given them by <Col N="1921" /> CTT.  They have no confidence in selling on the export market.  On the home market, they are consistently facing increased competition from goods imported from countries where the cost difference, if it exists at all, is being whittled away by internal costs.</P>
    <P>The Government should have seen the knock-on effect of these indirect taxes when they were being introduced.  It could be said that the indirect taxes on beer, spirits, wines and cigarettes had not kept pace with inflation over the years and it may be possible to make a case for taxing them, but not to the extent that beer, spirits and particularly mineral waters were taxed.  It is extraordinary that a pint of lemonade costs more than a pint of beer.  Three bottles of coca cola cost almost £1.  I do not know what madness got into the Minister to make him decide to savagely increase the price of minerals which are consumed mostly by our youth in whom the Minister and the Government profess to have such interest.  Ironically, this will get into the Guinness Book of Records as the greatest imposition of taxation anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Before imposing taxes the Minister should ensure that they will not damage employment in the industries concerned. I am not sure that that is the case here.  I understand from a limited survey of public houses carried out in the last month that trade is down.  While they are taking in roughly the same amount of money as they did 12 months ago, the quantity they are selling is significantly less.  Hopefully, that situation will recover during the summer with the coming of our tourists, but unless the producers of beer and spirits can expand their export markets that will affect employment in those industries.</P>
    <P>The most damaging of all the indirect taxes was that on diesel, petrol and LPG.  The most talked of was the increase to £1.50 for a gallon of petrol. The Minister may try to sell it as an energy conservation measure, and I agree that if that is why he imposed this massive duty increase on petrol he has <Col N="1922" /> succeeded, because it is physically obvious that there are fewer cars on the road.  I do not have this information from garage owners but visually it would seem there are fewer people driving.</P>
    <P>A further major charge on industry has been the huge increase in the duty on what are called &ldquo;other oils&rdquo;.  Public transport is exempt but the ESB are not, and the extra duty this year would cost the ESB £11 million.  Already £4.6 million was being collected in tax from ESB oil usage.  This new taxation on the ESB can be recovered from one source only, because under the Act setting up the ESB they are bound to balance their books every year.  When the ESB go to the NPC later in the year for another increase to balance their books, it will add to the vicious inflationary spiral because every industry in the country will be affected and they, in turn, will put up their prices and this will whittle away their competitiveness in home and foreign markets.  I would add that the amount currently being collected from the ESB in oil duties is approximately 20 per cent of their total fuel bill.</P>
    <P>When we talk about an energy policy here we should not be asking whether we can get the amount of fuel we want but the amount that is needed.  It is unlikely that there will be more oil available ever again than there was in 1978.  Other oil producing countries will be unlikely to be able or willing to make up the loss of Iranian oil.  The Saudi Arabians have increased their production from 8½ million barrels to 9½ million barrels but we do not know how long they will maintain that production because they know that the longer they leave the oil in the ground the more valuable it will become. It is unlikely that other oil producing countries will be inclined to increase the amount they extract, for the same reasons.</P>
    <P>We are such small oil users in world terms that we will always find it possible to get not all we want but sufficient to meet our needs, which should be the main consideration in any energy policy here.  Our concern should be to offset as far as possible the effects of the increased <Col N="1923" /> price of oil on our economy.  We are a trading nation, we buy and sell, and we can only sell in home and foreign markets if we are competitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> the price of goods produced by our competitors. If we are not competitive we will lose, and <i>vice versa</i>.  In any energy conservation policy it is the Government's duty to maintain our competitiveness by minimising the effects on our industry of the cost of imported oil. In that way we will be more likely to be able to sell our goods abroad.</P>
    <P>In the last few years the Americans have managed to lower their energy dependence in each unit of production by 20 per cent against a world figure of 7 per cent.  In other words, they have been nearly three times as effective in their energy policy.  Therefore, if we have not a proper energy policy, if we have to put extra duties on oil and consequent extra taxes on electricity generating, obviously our goods will not be competitive in the markets in which we and the Americans compete against each other. We have far too high a dependence on oil for the generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>The price of oil is very important to us and there is no prospect of a drop in oil prices in the foreseeable future.  Of the 30 major oil fields, none has been discovered within the past ten years and these fields supply over 50 per cent of total world needs.  There are 30,000 other fields, including most of those in the North Sea plus the show we have in the Atlantic.  Many of these latter oil fields have come on stream because they have become economic since the oil crisis of 1973.  That will be the pattern in the future.  As the price of oil goes up more and more of the smaller fields will become economically viable.</P>
    <P>We can, of course, expand our coal burning stations, but from the point of view of the balance of payments that is not a solution because the coal must be imported.  It will probably be two years before a decision can be made whether it would be economic to bring oil ashore from the Porcupine Bank and process it here.  The alternative energy sources will all play their part in lowering our <Col N="1924" /> dependence on oil, but we are faced with the prospect of nuclear energy before the end of the century unless a renewable source of energy can be discovered.  As the Tánaiste has said, that seems to be pushed forward a little because of the downturn in the demand for oil due to recession.  Conservation has also helped, but no Government or political party who are serious about the future should say that never in any circumstances will we have nuclear energy here.  It may be a reality which we will have to face.</P>
    <P>This budget will be judged more importantly outside this House than inside it.  It will certainly damage our export prospects because it will make it more difficult to remain competitive.  The tax reliefs to those earning between £7,000 and £9,000 will be more than eaten away by the indirect taxation imposed in the budget.  That indirect taxation, particularly in its effect on energy costs, will damage our competitive position in external markets.  It will be very difficult to extend the national understanding or negotiate a wage agreement which will not in itself be inflationary as a result of this budget, which will be a major contributor during 1980 to the inflation spiral.</P>

      <P>At this remove from the budget statement one has an opportunity of having a much more objective analysis of the budget than could be expected in the immediate aftermath of the statement. The House has also had the benefit of judging reactions outside.  This will be of more considerable consequence as we see trends during the course of the year.  In introducing the budget I said that it should be seen as a package and that it was directed not only towards ordering public finances in a period of great international disorder but also towards getting a cohesive response from the various elements in our community.  For that reason the budget should be judged in its totality and also by the response we get here to enable us to cope with problems forced upon us from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> Since I have the responsibility to be consistent both in formulating the budget and in dealing with responses externally and internally, I can reasonably ask that those who would criticise it should also be consistent.  Judging from my study of many of the speeches made by the Opposition, I have been criticised in conflicting ways.  Some would suggest that I did not achieve enough in reducing the borrowing requirement and others suggest that we should have provided more for employment and education. Some expected even greater income tax concessions and a lesser imposition of indirect taxation.  These conflicting statements cannot be reconciled, and I will not attempt to do so.  I am much more concerned with the reaction from the community, particularly from the productive sectors, at a time of very difficult and disordered international activity.</P>
    <P>The budget is all about striking a balance between the multiplicity of competing needs and opportunities and, at the same time, maintaining the economic ship on a clear course through turbulent waters.  I had to achieve a greater balance in public finances and, on the other hand, I had to avoid compounding substantially the inevitable external influences which would have driven the economy into a very considerable recession. While I do not want to stress the obvious, we face a very difficult and uncertain external economic outlook.  Oil developments have almost stopped in its tracks the growth of the world economy. It is going through a painful transition from an era of cheap energy to very expensive energy, and the implications for this country are direct and powerful.</P>
    <P>Export markets, because of the international recession, will grow only slowly this year and competition internationally will be very intense.  These are realities which I did not try to hide at the time of the budget and would not want to hide now.  I said that in coping with this I was not prepared to run the risk of moving the economy into a marked recession; and I am quite satisfied, having seen reactions and developments since the <Col N="1926" /> budget both internationally and at home, that this was the right course.  Nothing that has happened since has suggested to me that I should change that view.</P>
    <P>We would all accept that to be successful nowadays an economic policy must have at least a minimum degree of consensus and community response and this must be balanced with the need to deal with the ordering of public finances. If we were to get a rejection from the community overall of what we were doing in these difficult times, our capacity to cope with these unwelcome external impacts would be very considerably diminished.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, as I say, that the balance in the budget was right and the reactions, in so far as one can judge them either from direct contact or from surveys or otherwise, would demonstrate that very fully.  For instance, there has been some suggestion during the course of this debate of the undermining of business confidence. One of the journals most directly representative of business opinion, namely, <i>Business and Finance,</i> did a survey of businessmen in relation to their response and their attitude to the budget.  Three out of four felt that the budget proposals were largely correct. Businessmen are pretty well qualified to make their own judgments in respect of their own interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That was prior to the interest rates rising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall probably be told it was prior to further developments in Iran, for which I do not claim any special responsibility.  I am talking about the reaction to the budget as a budget, as an instrument of Government policy.  The majority of businessmen felt that the budget would improve the nation's finances, which is a matter of some encouragement to me.  They were not alone in that.  As we have seen <Col N="1927" /> recently, another poll which was conducted by <i>The Irish Times,</i> the IMS Poll, showed a substantial balance of opinion favourable to the budget, with something of the order of 36 per cent being dissatisfied with the budget. Nevertheless, a Minister of Finance cannot say he is quite happy and that everything is wonderful with the budget. This is evidence, nonetheless, of public reaction at this moment.  As I indicated, the response at this time is perhaps more important than ever because of the need of cohesion and common determination to overcome the problems which we will continue to face this year in view of the very significant international economic disorder which exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I refer to one point which the leader of Fine Gael has mentioned on occasions&mdash;perhaps not in the course of his budget contribution but in the House&mdash;and Deputy O'Leary also referred to it this evening, which concerned what they saw as the reaction of the gilt market to the budget?  For the sake of a political point, we should maintain a very balanced and responsible approach. The fact is that the aggregate sales of the gilts on the day I introduced the budget were of the order of £100 million.  As I address this House today, they are of precisely the same order, give or take £1 million.  That is a measure of the reaction of the market to the budget.  On the day after the budget one might have had, for one reason or another, people justifiably engaged in certain speculation or whatever else; but the Opposition should know that if that happened on the day after a budget it was not the first time it happened.  They should have known at least from their experience that to imply there that the informed economists and investors are losing confidence in the Government economy and Government securities is just not correct.  The important thing is that, as I address this House, the position is exactly as when I addressed the House on the budget statement over two months ago.  Let that be the answer to those who try to imply that we have moved into an era of lack of confidence.  I hope that we shall not <Col N="1928" /> hear that particular tune, much as he might like to whistle it, from Deputy FitzGerald again.  Experience will show that he will not have much opportunity for doing so, in any event.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised and I feel an obligation to reply to some of the broad points raised during this budget debate while at the same time, trying to keep them in the context of the direction in which the Government will be proceeding to develop budget strategy in the course of economic planning, the budget being a very important element in that strategy.  One of the areas, in terms of ordering the public financing, is the question of the borrowing requirement.  I said in my Financial Statement that initial progress must be made this year towards reducing the borrowing requirement. We have taken very clear and obvious steps to do that and have shown discipline in relation to public expenditure. Here this afternoon even at his stage of the debate I heard suggestions from Deputy O'Leary that we were cutting back rather ruthlessly on public expenditure. On the other hand he said previously that we spent recklessly.  Opposition Deputies and everyone else had better take their choice.  They cannot complain about a cut-back on services or a 5 per cent only increase, as was said this afternoon, in current services.  I could respond and say make it 15 per cent increase in current services, but if I did I would have to be honest enough to say &ldquo;I can do that on two conditions, either by increasing taxation or increasing borrowing&rdquo;.  I was not prepared to do either.  We very clearly and consistently picked our priorities in the current services and we equally clearly demonstrated our priorities in applying very much more than that in the increase in the capital programme.</P>
    <P>To come back to what Deputy FitzGerald said about the borrowing requirement, he suggested that we were making no progress towards reducing our borrowing requirements because the borrowing requirement last year, as stated in the budget, was about the same as stated this year.  If we reduce it from <Col N="1929" /> 13.7 per cent of GNP, which it was as I faced the budget statement, to 10.4 per cent as we propose&mdash;and are determined to adhere to that despite conflicting claims that might come from the Opposition&mdash;if a reduction of that order of almost 3½ per cent of GNP is not a real reduction, only someone with a capacity to interpret, represent, or confuse, such as Deputy FitzGerald may well have, could suggest that that would not be a significant downward trend.  One can juggle figures any way one likes.  To me, with my rather simple basic approach, even juggling figures would not allow one to ignore that reality, which he suggested was not a reality at all.</P>
    <P>One can be very selective, but I am putting facts before the House at this stage.  I recall the leader of Fine Gael saying that this does not tell the true story of Government borrowing because there is also over and above that the level of borrowing in the State bodies outside the Exchequer and that we should also have included that in relation to the figure for borrowing in the Government.  If Deputy FitzGerald does not know by now&mdash;and I suspect he should&mdash;that that has been the criterion applied at all times here in relation to our borrowing requirements, namely, that of the direct Exchequer borrowing requirement, nothing that I can do will clear that doubt or, indeed, that cloud of ignorance from his mind.  We must compare like with like each year.  Our approach always has been that it is our direct borrowing requirements that are looked upon not just by us but by those who look upon this economy.  It is that criterion of direct Exchequer borrowing requirement that has always been the test by which our movement towards progress in this area has been judged.</P>
    <P>A little consistency here would be welcome.  Selective interpretations from one year, as if that year were different from all the others, is not what one is entitled to expect from a leader of the main Opposition party.  On that confused basis one could say that the budget is not making much progress towards <Col N="1930" /> bringing our public finances into order. However, the fact is that it has and will.</P>
    <P>However, I must honestly say at the same time, in relation to another major element&mdash;the balance of payments &mdash;that the higher oil prices which have taken place, even in some instances since the budget, will have the obvious effect of tending to increase the deficit in the balance of payments.  This is a fact which all of us would ignore at our peril.  There is no self-correcting mechanism in the balance of payments and for that reason a marked improvement in the deficit cannot be expected this year.  That would be to expect the impossible at a time when the impact of last year's increases will continue to bite. We are bringing the deficit nearer to acceptable proportions and the budget is an earnest of my resolve and that of the Government to do that.</P>
    <P>Some people have criticised the increase in the price of oil products.  I shall not dwell on the fact that the real level of taxation on petrol and oil is less than it was in 1975.  We must look at the developing energy situation throughout the world.  To those who seem to think that the balance of payments will come right on its own, to those who think the measures we have taken in this area are not enough, who think we should have a magic wand in our hand, I would remind them we would need some magic wand to cope with the situation where the estimated value of our oil imports for 1980 will be of the order of £750 million.  That is 9 per cent of our GNP.  It is a frightening figure to have to face at this stage.  In the context of the demands we make with regard to our incomes and expectations, it is well that we recognise that very unwelcome reality.  We must bring down the figure to acceptable proportions and we can only do that by our own response to these external and unwelcome developments.</P>
    <P>The days are gone when the taxation of energy could be approached on the same basis as the taxation of other goods.  Energy has a major impact on any economy and the taxation of energy <Col N="1931" /> has a role to play in conservation and in the national use of energy.  It must also lay the basis for an ordered economic development.  We cannot adopt an attitude of &ldquo;not yet&rdquo; towards the conservation of energy.  For that reason the tax increases on oil products in the budget were formulated deliberately by myself and by the Government as a step along the road towards a more realistic level and structure of energy taxation overall. I am satisfied that it accords with the trends in international developments to which I have referred.  Even if some people here do not recognise the reality of the situation, the rest of the world does recognise it.</P>
    <P>Some speakers approached the budget on a selective basis and concentrated on the increase in petrol or on some other indirect taxation.  They suggested that these increases would drive up wages. That is not taking a comprehensive view of the budget package against the background that I have presented.  If people want to engage in that exercise they are free to do so but it is not the response I had hoped we would get to such a comprehensive economic paskage.  In the last analysis increases in indirect taxation finance public services for the community as a whole.  When relief with regard to direct taxation has been granted as happened this year, apart from the matter of the energy situation to which I have referred, there must be increases in indirect taxation.  If we grant ourselves income increases to offset the impact of increases in indirect taxation we will be taking a short cut to serious economic trouble and particularly so this year when our economic competitiveness will be vital.  I ask that the tax concessions and the other benefits in the budget be seen for what they are. Some Deputies on the other side have concentrated on one element and have said that that alone will increase inflation without recognising the major real increase in spending power that will derive from the increased allowances in income tax.</P>
    <P>In commenting on the £100 million provided in the budget for public service <Col N="1932" /> pay, the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy FitzGerald deduced very neatly that I would be providing for a 20 per cent increase in public service pay.  He said I was acknowledging there was going to be 20 per cent inflation right through the public service, that there would be a spiralling inflation and so on.  Probably the Deputy is a little wiser now because he will have seen that one element that arises this year, namely, nurses' pay, will account for a considerable amount of the £100 million.  Before he works out an easy, quick calculation in future he should look at the reality.  Obviously I have no expectation of anything like 20 per cent in public service pay.  I do not contemplate anything remotely like that. A general increase anywhere near that region would be a certain recipe for lost jobs and other economic problems in 1981.</P>
    <P>Today Deputy O'Leary said there was nothing in the budget to provide for employment in the public service.  He said also that the Government in previous budgets had been spendthrift. One of his criticisms with regard to this budget was that he did not see any injection in it for employment creation but apparently he was not happy with a similar provision in previous budgets.  I want to make it clear that the Government place an important emphasis on employment.  The Public Capital Programme and the various measures in the budget provide incentives for productivity and employment.  Even at a difficult time in our public finances this will remain a major priority, which is clearly demonstrated by the composition of this year's Public Capital Programme. The growth of public expenditure has been sharply curtailed.  That is a responsibility which the Government and I face.  Had we not faced it, I think we would be clearly seen to be ignoring our obligation to the State.</P>
    <P>Allocations for agencies such as the IDA and Coras Tráchtála whose activities are so important for the development of job creation show very sizeable increases over last year and demonstrate clearly the Government's priorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> They are well above the provision for other areas.  Provision for infrastructural development in the Public Capital Programme is 32 per cent up on last year because the Government recognise this as a very important element in and foundation for our continuing employment development programme.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle Oiliúna get a 25 per cent increase in their allocation which will enable them to maintain the impetus of their training activity directed towards equipping and training a labour force with the skills required in high technology modern industrial employment, a matter that this country will not only face but I confidently believe will cope with successfully as a changing pattern in the international economic world at present.  These are some elements&mdash;I cannot go through all of them in this reply&mdash;which show not only the Government commitment to maintaining the level of employment but also the base on which further growth in employment will take place even this year so that we will be much better prepared to move on further when we get some degree of certainty in the international climate.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear at the same time that of itself increased Government spending cannot guarantee the attainment of full employment and I never suggested it could.  The external trading environment and domestic competitiveness have a great deal to do with it.  In fact unbridled Government spending could generate a growing tax burden or else an increased borrowing requirement, either of which would hamper the productive sector of the economy and reduce its ability to create employment.  I recognise that in this budget.</P>
    <P>We believe that Government spending can provide a direct but not a permanent commitment to being the agency through which the job creation programme can be maintained.  If you have unemployment at a peak, as it was when Fianna Fáil came back to government, obviously Government spending does <Col N="1934" /> provide a direct agency through which to tackle unemployment, and we did so successfully.  I shall not go back over arguments I already referred to, comparisons with what the experience had been in 1974 and 1975 when we were out of line with the experience in Europe. We had the highest unemployment in Europe by far&mdash;I am talking about the EEC.  That has not been the case here. That is what you do in the short term but you do not make a commitment to maintain that policy indefinitely when the level of unemployment has been reduced to more tolerable levels than when this Government came into office. For that reason I reject any suggestion that there has been, at any time since Fianna Fáil came back, a reckless expansion of public expenditure or employment in the public service.  I am saying that it must now be regulated in the light of developments as we face them.  Deputy Kelly, I believe, made the assertion that there had been a reckless expansion of employment in the public service.  Would he suggest, for instance, that creation of teaching posts or the provision of extra gardaí or recruitment of staff for the modernisation of our telecommunications system is reckless expansion?  What has been done before and is being continued now will be evidence of our commitment to maintain the right balance at this stage in our development.</P>
    <P>There have not been cut-backs, as suggested by some Deputies, in things like the youth employment schemes.  The allocation this year is £1.8 million, over £220,000 more than was spent on the programme last year.  There is an increased allocation to AnCO which will enable them to maintain activity for the community youth training programme. There is also provision in the Book of Estimates for environmental improvement schemes and the Department of Education temporary grants scheme, to be supplemented by special additional allocations of £1.7 million and £1 million respectively from the employment guarantee fund.  In addition, the Government were able to agree with the partners in the tripartite committee on <Col N="1935" /> special assistance of £5 million from the employment guarantee fund towards the employment maintenance scheme.</P>
    <P>It is very evident from those examples that we are using all agencies with judgment and effectiveness to ensure that our employment programmes will be maintained and that the level of employment will be maintained.  There is a tendency to think of employment policy solely in terms of new jobs created but it is equally important to recognise that the maintenance of vital jobs is an essential element of that policy.  When our partners, whether it be Belgium, France, Britain or anywhere else are experiencing a level of unemployment that they have not known for a very considerable time, are we to take our employment policy as being a measure of whether or not we create 25,000 extra jobs?  Is it not reasonable to suggest that, in the light of developments last year, maintaining jobs that would otherwise have been lost, judged by the experience others are having, is also a measure of effective employment policy?</P>
    <P>I suppose nobody will deny that we are really in the middle of a second oil crisis.  Nobody can yet say with certainty whether its economic effects will be the same as they were the last time. Deputy FitzGerald suggested that the crisis was not nearly as bad as the previous one and used very selective arguments to support that suggestion. When we spoke about interest rates here Deputy FitzGerald did not accept that talk in terms of proportionate increases was a valid approach to the level of interest rates.  He said we should talk in real, absolute terms but, apparently, he has no reservation in trying to establish his point when it comes to oil prices because he suggested that on the previous occasion oil prices quadrupled&mdash;I suppose one could say a 400 per cent increase&mdash;but that this time they only doubled.  That was a nice, selective approach ignoring the fact that the increase was from a much higher base this time.</P>
    <P>Again, let us see if the impact on our <Col N="1936" /> economy has been more severe this time than last.  Between 1973 and 1974 crude oil prices rose by 7 or 8 dollars a barrel in that 12 months.  In the year from January 1979 the increase was 13 dollars a barrel and, allowing for inflation since, I think it is reasonable to acknowledge&mdash;as well as from the figures I have already given about the increases this will mean in our balance of payment&mdash;that the impact on this economy is at least as severe now as it was before.  What is different is our capacity to cope with it and the actions taken by the Government to ensure that we do it more successfully than last time. We can also say that previously the price increase of 7 and 8 dollars a barrel was followed by a period in which the price of oil fell sharply thus easing the adjustment process for the international economy.  Very few commentators now expect a sharp drop or an easing of the price of oil such as we experienced then. If the previous crisis led to a serious recession, we are determined that the actions taken by the Government now in an even more critical international economic situation will not have the same effect.  Otherwise, we would be in for a re-run of the 1974-76 experience. By tackling those matters on a broad and comprehensive front in the budget, the balance of payments deficit and strengthening of the public finances, I am determined to provide a greater incentive to effort through the income tax allowances and other agencies so that we can strengthen our economy and lessen the risk of the impact of these events on us.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the actions of the social partners and their response to the budget is of considerable importance.  Last week I stated that the Government were pleased with the general level of industrial peace since the beginning of this year.  That is one important element, and obviously the level of incomes and wages is another important factor.  The Government value very much the relations and discussions with the social partners and the understanding they have between themselves.  I cannot understand how Deputy Cluskey could put <Col N="1937" /> an interpretation on a passage in my speech to the effect that, if it suited us politically, we would go for confrontation with the social partners.  That was never the intention.  It is a misrepresentation. The consultations we have had with the trade union movement at various levels demonstrate that, far from looking for an opportunity for confrontation, we are very conscious of the need for communication, understanding and a cohesive reaction.</P>
    <P>We have had very useful discussions at every level with the trade union movement since the budget and I hope to continue these discussions on a regular basis as part of a planned approach to the economic development of our resources and the welfare of our people.  The trade union movement are the best judges of the attitude and consistency of the Government in this direction, as distinct from what Deputies Cluskey and O'Leary would try to represent as their reaction to the budget or the Government's actions.  We need a cohesive response from the various interest groups.  That is of vital importance in coping with the impact of what, I regret to say, will be continuing unwelcome events from outside affecting our economy in the course of the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>Some misguided statements were made during the course of the debate about the state of our currency within the EMS.  Despite the impact of external events on us&mdash;as an open economy we are 50 per cent dependent on exports and have an 80 per cent level of imports&mdash;our currency has performed very satisfactorily and consistently at the centre of the EMS band.  That is where it is now and where it has been for some time.  Those who would suggest that our currency is at risk by comparison with the performance of sterling are ignoring reality.  If sterling, which is outside the EMS band, fluctuates against the currencies within the band that is no reflection on any of the currencies, much less ours, within the band.  It is a measure of the level of speculation in sterling.  If one <Col N="1938" /> reads the morning reports, without judging our performance against the lira or the krone, in relation to sterling one obviously gets a distorted impression because it is sterling that is fluctuating outside the band in which we are performing satisfactorily.  We have maintained unchanged our bilateral central rates against the currencies in that band.  The German Deutschemark has been revalued while the Danish krone was devalued against the other currencies in the band but that has not had anything to do with the performance of the punt. The level of confidence in our currency among our European partners and agencies of the European Community, such as the European Investment Bank, is as high as we would wish it to be.  If sterling fluctuates further, that should not be seen as a reflection on our currency.  The fluctuation of sterling in this area is a matter of more serious concern for the British Government than it is for ours having regard to the effect it has on its competitiveness with its trading partners in Europe and the effect it has in relation to imports.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the effect of the indirect tax measures on tourism. The increase in the price of petrol in the budget has meant that the price of our petrol is the third lowest in the EEC.  The difference between the price here and that prevailing in the UK is not sufficient to deter tourists from that country who have an overall advantage in relation to sterling.  It is important when we look at the developing trends of tourism in relation to Europe that we recognise that what we have experienced is in line with that of our partners in the EEC.  None of our European customers will be deterred from coming here because of the price of petrol when it is lower than most European countries.  As far as drink is concerned it is not easy to make reliable comparisons because of the different measures and alcoholic strengths in other countries.  When people mention the effect of drink prices on tourism they are thinking of tourists from the UK only.  I should like to point out that a recent survey carried out by <i>The Financial Times</i> of living costs for businessmen, an <Col N="1939" /> important element in tourism here, placed London at the top of a list of 66 cities as the dearest.  In that survey Dublin was placed 45th.  The drink price element in that survey showed us in a very favourable light.  I do not think those matters should be overstated in a way which would tend to undermine confidence in the tourism industry in a year in which prospects look encouraging.</P>
    <P>Now I come to some other inconsistencies which can be perceived between the leader of Fine Gael and Deputy Barry, who referred to the income tax system fairly and objectively this afternoon. Deputy Barry recognised that it was time to have the incentive restored to those who found that, as they moved into high levels of incomes, the reward for their work was expressed in terms of higher tax.  He recognised very fairly that this was an important contribution in the budget.  That is not what Deputy FitzGerald said.  He concluded that in this area the budget represented a transfer of wealth, as he called it, from lower income persons to higher income persons.  Deputy Barry expressed some concern about them.  I am not saying he was concerned only about them.  I do not want to misrepresent him.  I reject Deputy FitzGerald's statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but, in fairness, the Deputy said he recognised that the rates were much higher than in other countries and that it was only fair to redress the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Deputy mentions other countries I can say that as a consequence of the income tax package this year the rates here are very much lower.  The provisions in relation to income splitting are much more advanced than they are in Belgium and the Netherlands and in many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald said that prior to the budget the rates here were out of line and that taxation was much higher for a certain level of income <Col N="1940" /> than it was in other countries.  He recognised the fairness of redressing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the exact reference but somewhere around columns 942/3, Volume 318 of the Official Report he concluded that the budget represented a transfer of wealth from lower income persons to higher income persons.  That is plain enough language for me, and it was said with a great degree of confidence by Deputy FitzGerald.  I am trying to demonstrate that it is not the case.</P>
      <P>Equally this seems to be implied criticism of tax distribution inherent in income splitting.  It has to be seen for what it is, a criticism of the practicalities of applying income splitting.  You cannot be for the principle of income splitting and at the same time against its central and inevitable consequence, that is, that at a certain level as you move into a higher margin, it takes full effect.  You are either for income splitting or you are not.  It is not good enough to express support for the principle and then reject the consequences of that principle.  That is an inconsistency.</P>
      <P>The other action I took in arranging the income tax scheme under the budget ensured that in many cases young people being taxed for the first time would be exempt.  For example, a single person earning £2,000 per annum will now have a reduction of over 45 per cent in his income tax liability.  If the earnings are £3,000 the reduction will be over 23 per cent.  I will not go back over all this now. It is fair to suggest that, when you introduce tax exemptions for a married couple earning below £3,400, you cannot be accused of transferring wealth to the rich at the expense of the poor. When you make provisions of the kind I have mentioned, you cannot be accused of making transfers to the rich at the expense of the poor.  If one wants to represent it or misrepresent it in that way, one is free to do so.  I will stand on the judgment of the public on that scheme as distinct from misrepresentations of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> The net result of the budget proposals is that the burden of income tax for 90 per cent of single people on PAYE will now be less than it was in 1977.  That can be noted as some considerable achievement towards tax equity.  I want to mention the reaction of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Cluskey suggested that the proposals had not met the demands of the PAYE sector for tax reform and that we would hear more from the trade unions about this.  We have heard more about it from the trade unions, and from the Government's point of view, their response has been very encouraging and reassuring, and not surprisingly so.  What we produced in the budget was in advance even of the schemes suggested by ICTU in their prebudget proposals.  It would be rather strange if, having had their suggestions met, by way of encouragement to Deputy Cluskey and Deputy O'Leary they were to come back and reject as unacceptable the provisions we made.</P>
    <P>We are concerned to move continuously towards a balance in contributions in taxation.  It was for that reason that the commission were established and that we appointed a full time chairman in the person of Mrs. Miriam Hederman O'Brien.  I should like to express my appreciation to the members of the commission, and particularly to Mrs. O'Brien for her readiness to serve in that capacity.  With a full time chairman I have no doubt that reports will be issued as a matter of urgency.  They have already been in communication with me to clarify the order in which they might approach their various tasks, although that is a matter for them to determine and not for me.  I am quite satisfied there will be no undue delay and that there will be every degree of expedition in their approach to this matter.  I cannot put a deadline on their work.  It will not be, as some Deputies suggested today, an ongoing process leading to no particular conclusion at the end of the day.  It will indeed, and in the forseeable future.</P>
    <P>I referred a number of matters to <Col N="1942" /> them for consideration for interim reports&mdash;I say for consideration&mdash;farm taxation, corporation profits tax and taxation of financial institutions.  I want to clarify that point in relation to what Deputy Barry said.  It is the taxation of financial institutions.  This is a commission on taxation and they have been asked to look at the taxation of financial institutions.  There has been a degree of confusion about the profits of financial institutions and the taxation they pay on those profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I am grateful for the opportunity of doing so.  Very complex issues are involved here.  For instance, the provisions which are made available through the leasing arrangements which may have an effect on banking profits are of considerable benefit to industry, as most Deputies will recognise, and to those who are anxious to attract industry here.  If one of the consequences might be some increase in banking profits&mdash;and a small increase it has to be said by comparison with what is passed on to industry&mdash;that has to be recognised as a reality.  There are complex issues involved which I have asked the commission to look at.  It is not simply a matter of having a go at the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the taxation <Col N="1943" /> paid on profits as distinct from the profits themselves which are required by the Central Bank to be maintained at a reasonable reserve having regard to the amount of capital involved and the amount of confidence which must be generated in the banking system.  I recognise that a healthy banking system, sensitive to public needs and economic development, is a vitally important element in our community subject to normal procedures and controls effected by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I can tell Deputy Barry quite clearly that the statement made by the Minister of State over the weekend was not on behalf of the Government and it did not represent the consequence of Government consultations.  It was a personal statement by the Minister of State and does not represent the attitude of the Government.  It is important to recognise that it is easy to attack an immediate target when the public mood is affected by matters like interest rate increases.</P>

      <P>In relation to interest rates, as I indicated when this was discussed in the House, this unfortunately is in character with what is happening amongst all of our partners in view of the competitively high interest rates we are seeing at the moment.  We cannot look at the symptom as we see it here and attack it.  The real place to get at this is in the international monetary sphere.  For that reason I raised this as a priority with my colleague, the Minister for Finance in the European Economic Community over the last weekend.  I was very pleased and assured by their response in tackling this as a matter of urgent priority for all of us on the basis that competitive high interest rates of the kind we are seeing now will contribute to distortions in capital flow and will also have unwelcome effects particularly on economies which are at our stage of development.  My colleagues in the European Community, particularly Commissioner Ortoli, who is specifically responsible in the economic and monetary area, have agreed to look at this matter during the next month and will come back to us with a further analysis in May.  In the meantime they have agreed that this matter should also be expressed on our behalf at the IMF conference in Hamburg which I will attend this weekend.  While we recognise that inflation may be the real enemy we cannot accept that that inevitably means higher interest rates as an instrument of reducing the impact of inflation.  I hope we will be able to make a real contribution in those consultations to ensuring that this soaring graph will not be maintained in that pattern.  We will also be in consultation with the Central Bank and the building societies.  This is not just an interdepartmental committee as Deputy O'Leary suggests.  It is a representative <Col N="1945" /> committee representing the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and the building societies.  At the end of this week the consultations will have concluded and this will enable the Government to come to a decision as to how we can cope with the reaction to these events in so far as they affect building societies.</P>
      <P>In relation to farm taxation I can say with some degree of satisfaction that we have had very satisfactory discussions with the farm organisations since the budget.  As I have already said the Government believe in consultations at every level.  We have had those consultations in relation to the farm package in the budget and they have proved very successful.  For that reason I hope to be able to indicate shortly new agreed measures concerning matters such as stock relief and capital allowances in respect of farm building expenditure in relation to the implementation of the package which I announced in the budget.  Many people wish to present a picture of doom and gloom in relation to trade unions and farmers, but I am sorry to have to tell them that our experience since the budget tends the other way. For further information those people had better consult the people directly involved, the farm organisations and the trade union leaders.  This package was meant to be an instrument of cohesion, a comprehensive package seeking a cohesive response.  Because of the level of our consultations we are pleased with the response to our approach.</P>

The budget is only one instrument of the Government's overall strategy and the rest must be a matter for deliberate and consistent Government planning.  There is a difference between our approach and that of our predecessors.  I recall my counterpart saying that there is no time for planning in a hazardous international economic environment.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Civil Legal Aid Scheme: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved on Tuesday 22 April by Deputy E. Desmond:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann rejects the administrative scheme for Civil Legal Aid which the Government is seeking to implement because</P>
    <P> (i)  it has no basis in legislation and therefore cannot create a  right to legal aid and establish an independent Legal Aid Board to administer it,</P>
    <P>(ii)  it is not a comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>(iii)  it is not a free scheme.</P>
    <P>(iv)  it would deny a choice of solicitor to those seeking legal aid and introduce a dispensary system of legal services for them.</P>
    <P>(v)  it would discriminate against rural Ireland and those living in small towns   </P>
    <P>and calls upon the Government to introduce immediately the necessary <Col N="1951" /> legislation to establish a comprehensive scheme of legal aid along the lines recommended by the Pringle Committee.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;&ldquo;expresses its confidence in the Minister for Justice in relation to the exercise by him of his functions in regard to the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and advice.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was trying to make the point that the impression Deputy O'Keeffe's contribution gave was that he was primarily concerned for the legal profession rather than the people who will benefit under the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  People know that there must be some kind of control over expenditure.  If free legal aid is to be given to almost every cause and if it is to be under a free choice of solicitor scheme there will be many people who will be advised on very flimsy grounds to seek free legal aid.  In every profession there are a certain number of people that the profession would sooner be without and that includes the legal profession. The Incorporated Law Society have a job to do every year in bringing to task certain members of that profession who go outside the balance of what might be called professional standards.  There may be members of the profession newly qualified and struggling to get on their feet who might be tempted to take on flimsy cases which, in the normal way, any seasoned lawyer, solicitor or barrister would not take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the criticisms levelled was the lack of activity since 1977 in providing this scheme.  The history of the scheme begins with the 1977 pre-election manifesto in which it was stated that a scheme of civil legal aid, to cover initially family law cases, would be provided by a Fianna Fáil Government.  It is fair and interesting to note that the scheme introduced goes beyond what was <Col N="1952" /> promised as a first step in that manifesto.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice received the Pringle Report in December 1977 and announced its receipt in a press release from the Government Information Bureau on 15 December 1977.  It should be clear to any reasonable person that examination of that extensive report would take sometime to complete.  It is fair to say that the Government have not been slow in coming forward with their proposals.  We know substantial sums of money are involved in the recommendations, and we must know what kind of control we can exercise over the expenditure of such sums.  Different options and approaches were considered in the report and policy decisions had to be reached in selecting among those options. The service which a scheme of civil legal aid would provide would be completely new.  In other words, there were no real precedents or models on which to base assessments of the various options.  There again we did not have a similar scheme in operation which we were updating or improving upon.  We had something which was completely new and tailored for the way we conduct our affairs.  Many other Government Departments had to be consulted since many of the matters raised in the Pringle Report came within their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been in Government knows it takes time to get back questionnaires or submissions which have been circulated in order to get the fullest information possible to prepare a report.  In just over two-and-a-half years the Government have done very well to bring forward their scheme which will be monitored very carefully before the legislation is brought into formal law. The fact that they will be agreed practices of legal aid gives them the recognition from a legal point of view that they require.</P>
    <P>From the Minister's point of view it is fair to say it was not simply a matter of taking the Pringle Report and accepting it.  As I explained there were many other aspects.  A lot of work had to be done <Col N="1953" /> during 1978 and the early part of 1979 before a decision could be taken by the Government on their recommendations. In fact during that period an intensive study of the contents and recommendations of the Pringle Report was taking place throughout most of the central organs of administration in the State. The Minister for Justice told Deputy O'Keeffe as much on 8 March 1979 in answer to a question and on that occasion he indicated the Government's commitment to introducing civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>I think he has done well to fulfil that promise in the time available.  From time to time the Opposition say we have not fulfilled our election promises but in my view we have done extremely well in that area, not least in presenting this piece of good news.  We have experienced many difficulties in curtailing expenses generally but this scheme is still going ahead.</P>
    <P>On 2 May 1979 the Government announced that they had approved the features of a civil legal aid scheme to be introduced by the Minister for Justice. The statement from the Government Information Bureau outlined the principal features of the scheme.  In one important respect the Government in their scheme were able to improve upon the expectations of many of those who had been agitating for an immediate introduction of a scheme based on the Pringle Report by promising to deliver a comprehensive scheme rather than the interim one which had been suggested as an alternative in that report.  Even those people responsible for drafting the Pringle Report did not expect so many of their recommendations to be brought in so speedily but because of the speedy manner in which the Minister got to work on this it was not necessary to introduce the interim one only.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision in principle which led to that statement&mdash;that the Government would have the scheme ready by the end of 1979&mdash;the Minister and his Department had to embark on the task of preparing the scheme itself based on the Government <Col N="1954" /> decision and designed&mdash;for the record again I would like to remind Deputy O'Keeffe&mdash; to provide a totally new, comprehensive and relatively complex service.  The detailed scheme itself was approved by the Government and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in December 1979.  About the same time the Minister for Justice appointed the legal aid board to administer the scheme. The board have made giant progress in recruiting staff, obtaining accommodation and completing the many essential administrative jobs which have to be done before they can open the doors of their law centres to the public.  That work is almost completed and we do not expect that it will be very long before the first legal aid centre will be open to the public.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms of the scheme is that it gives the Minister too much control over the Legal Aid Board and, in particular, that the power to remove a member if it &ldquo;appeared to be necessary for the effective performance by the board of its functions&rdquo; was extreme and unique.  That is not accurate because the powers given to the Minister are the same as those given to the Minister for the Environment over An Bord Pleanála. The relevant part of the legislation relating to the powers of the Department of the Environment over An Bord Pleanála says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may remove from office an ordinary member of the Board who has become incapable through ill-health of effectively performing his duties, or who has committed stated misbehaviour, or whose removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Board of its functions, and in case a member of the Board is removed from office under this Article, the Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for removal. </P>
    <P>Obviously the Minister has to have some control over a board which will be spending vast sums of public money.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Pringle Committee recommended legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> That is not correct.  It does not say anywhere in that report that in the view of the committee the scheme should be put on a statutory basis from the beginning. The committee envisaged that there would be legislation in due course, but so did the Minister, as he made clear last night.  The Pringle Committee did point to the need for flexibility in the approach to the development of the service&mdash;page 29 of the report&mdash;and this is precisely what can be achieved by having a non-statutory scheme for an initial period during which operational experience can be obtained before the necessary rigidity of a statute is imposed upon the scheme.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House will accept that at some time in the foreseeable future legislation will be introduced on this matter.  It can only benefit the Minister's scheme to give it a fair chance in operation rather than to introduce a Bill containing numerous items which later on would be seen to be unwieldy and which would have to be deleted in a new Bill which, due to pressure of work, might take years to be enacted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe last night spoke at considerable length of the possible difficulty people who could not afford to travel would have in getting to the centres and that therefore they would be denied service under the scheme.  I argue there is not a basis for that contention. As the Minister said, his scheme is designed to enable any person, no matter where he lives, to obtain legal services if he qualifies.  The Deputy's point is aimed really at the feature of the scheme under which services are to be provided in centres to the exclusion of solicitors in private practice.  It is true that persons who wish to attend in person may have to travel to a centre, but what about persons who would have to travel to see a solicitor in private practice?</P>
    <P>The Pringle Report dealt with the inaccessibility of solicitors' offices.  It is fair to point out that many of the services to be provided will not necessarily involve attendance at a centre.  The postal service can be availed of.  I do know what that would involve but I feel sure an adequate service could be <Col N="1956" /> provided by the post office.  Moreover, there is not any reason why the board in due course should not make suitable arrangements for the provision of services at comparatively remote places as the scheme would progress.</P>
    <P>The Pringle Report recommended that part-time services would be made available which would include some arrangement such as attendance by a legal aid solicitor, say for half a day per week, in small places.  That would be an operational matter to be decided by the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said he was not attacking the concept of legal aid centres&mdash;indeed he approved of them&mdash; but he went on to say that they would not provide the applicant with a choice of lawyer if private practice solicitors were not in the scheme.  This lacks logic because if a sufficient number of centres become operational to meet all demand then clearly there would not be a need for private practitioners.  Choice of solicitor and counsel within the centres is provided for in the Minister's scheme.</P>
    <P>In other words, a person might go to a centre in which there would be half a dozen solicitors or a certain number of counsel to choose from.  If they are not satisfied with the solicitors or barristers, they could go to another centre where they might find a solicitor or barrister whom they might wish to consult. Therefore, there is a reasonably wide range.  We must remember that we are providing a service for the first time in this country.  It is very important that the scheme will get off to a good start.  It is welcomed even if it does not go as far as some people would like it to go, and it should be encouraged.  There should not be attempts to denigrate it in the way that Deputy O'Keeffe appeared to do last night.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said that private practitioners had been excluded because the Government could not find money to fund a scheme with them included.  That is only partially true because a wide open scheme would undoubtedly create a risk of far greater expenditure in the <Col N="1957" /> long term than is either needed or justified.  However, it is not so much a question of finding the money as drawing up a scheme which could be controlled properly, one which as the Minister said last night, would not take off on its own.  The scheme does this and I think the taxpayer will be duly grateful for it. It does it without denying services to any person who qualifies for them.</P>
    <P>A point was made that exclusions from the scheme amount to a defect in it. I have a few notes on that, which may be of interest to the House.  The Opposition seem to be making the point that there should not be any exceptions and there should not be limitations.  They object to all the exclusions, and they mentioned defamation and small civil bill claims of less than £20 for advice and £150 for legal aid.  Deputy Desmond also complained that the services should not be confined to &ldquo;natural persons&rdquo; and that they should be available to groups for test actions.</P>
    <P>These views are typical of a doctrinaire, extreme and indeed irresponsible approach to the subject.  Our experience in Dublin has been that with even the slightest encouragement certain people seem to want to go to law over anything.  If given <i>carte blanche</i> by the State it could cost the State enormous sums of money for people taking, for instance, Dublin Corporation to court or the Government to court.  Perhaps some fellow might think he had a great case and might take to court every piece of legislation ever enacted here.  That may be extreme, but there are people and groups who would try to break the back of the scheme and the taxpayers' backs. Consequently, we must proceed reasonably carefully in our approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>Most reasonable people will agree that there must be limits.  As I said, it sometimes suits Deputy Desmond to quote from the Pringle Report and to ask why it should not be implemented in its entirety.  What about paragraph 2.10 of the report which comes down definitely against giving legal aid to groups and <Col N="1958" /> organisations for test actions?  Although not favouring exclusions the Pringle Committee referred to that exclusion.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is obviously sensible to have some monetary limit to the size of civil bills for which advice or aid would be sought.  Otherwise there would be a situation in which the State would have to meet heavy legal expense in a case where a person might recover only an infinitesmal sum in a frivolous suit.  It is a matter of drawing the line, and it seems to me the scheme draws the line justly and realistically.</P>
    <P>Neither Deputy Desmond nor Deputy O'Keeffe offered an alternative scheme and I should like to hear Deputy Desmond on this point when she is replying. I know the Minister would respond favourably to any positive suggestions which would not result in certain groups having free access to the scheme.</P>
    <P>It has to be remembered that legal advice where the limit is only £20 is the important thing in this context because this would include writing a solicitor's letter on behalf of the potential plaintiff or giving other assistance to enable him or her to obtain rights.  It would also be clear from the advice in a case between £20 and £150 if there was a good case.  In this event there would be no difficulty in the ordinary way in having the case taken by another solicitor since costs would be recoverable.</P>
    <P>Regarding the exclusion of defamation, it has to be remembered that in the English scheme introduced over 30 years ago the same category has been excluded and in the light of their experience they have seen no reason to include it.  Also it is fair to say that the Dublin Solicitor's Bar Association urged on the Pringle Commission such an exclusion. The exclusion was not recommended purely on the grounds recommended elsewhere that no case should be legally aided unless clearly meritorious.</P>
    <P>I have dealt as constructively as possible with the criticisms of the scheme made by Deputy O'Keeffe and certain points made by Deputy Desmond.  One thing we must guard against is that the <Col N="1959" /> solicitor who would not stand on his own feet should not suddenly find that he is being spoonfed by the State and have easy access to funds.  There are instances in many countries of certain unscrupulous people of various professions cornering an easy market without any care as to the cost to the taxpayer.  We have seen instances of that and I am not sure whether I should specify to what I am referring in talking about certain abuses under the present system.  I feel there are abuses under the criminal legal aid system and most people in the legal profession connected with that system would be among the first to admit this fact.  They deplore these abuses because they bring down their own profession.</P>
    <P>We can be very pleased with this scheme and the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated for the speedy manner in which they have gone ahead with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am lost in admiration at the ability of this administration to devise schemes which in their intention have the maximum possible publicity value at the minimum cost to the State and the taxpayer.  This scheme, which we in the Labour Party reject as wholly inadequate, is a classic example of a scheme which has been devised under duress and whose main objective is to conceal from the general public, as much as from the person who might be expected to avail of it, the intensely strict limitations on its use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme of civil legal aid and advice&mdash;I like the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo; and will come back to that later&mdash;has two progenitors.  The first of its parents was the Pringle Report on civil legal aid, a worthy report as far as it went, but we would quarrel with some of its aspects and might think that it does not necessarily meet the criteria we would advance for a reasonable, decent, properly funded legal aid scheme.  The other parent of this unfortunate piece of paper was the decision in the Airey case in Europe.  One does not have to be familiar with the inner workings of Government to know that if the Airey <Col N="1960" /> decision had not been handed down in Europe we might not be discussing this motion tonight.  The Pringle Report, if we were to judge the present by the past, would still be on the shelf, to emerge finally and definitively as part of an election commitment by the outgoing administration in 1981 or 1982.  Decently and logically they could not push it beyond that but in view of their other commitments and decisions and in view of the resource implications of their other decisions, it is fairly obvious that unpushed by the Airey decision we would not even be discussing today this inadequate and partial measure.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge&mdash;and I stand open to correction&mdash;there has been no indication from the Government side as to precisely how much the implementation of this measure will cost. Governments are great at costing measures put forward by the Opposition but they are altogether more reticent when it comes to costing measures put forward by themselves if such costings reveal the fundamentally inadequate nature of their proposals or provisions. If the Government implemented the Pringle Report in full it would cost about £2 million, according to the Pringle Report's own costings.  Doubtless that scheme would cost more nowadays, not least because of the Government's splendid record in the field of inflation.  We would like an indication as to what the Government expect the implementation of this scheme to cost and I would be glad to give a Government Minister three or four minutes at the end of my speech in order to reply, if he has that information.</P>
    <P>In an area like this costs, while important, must be balanced against rights. The sum of £2 million, the Pringle Report estimation of costs, balanced against the expenditure of this State in all sorts of areas, not least the area of law and order, is a comparatively small amount.  It is a function and characteristic of far too many modern States&mdash;no matter how democratic their constitution, no matter how open their <Col N="1961" /> mechanisms and no matter how much they wish their citizens to participate to the full in the life of their country&mdash;that they tend to spend far more money on protecting property than on establishing the rights of individuals.  In the Consitiution, the rights of the family are actually given pre-eminence over those of the individual. However, neither the rights of the family nor the rights of the individual are given anything like reasonable recognition in this puny scheme.</P>
    <P>We of the Labour Party accept that an adequate scheme would probably cost even more than the £2 million assessed by the Pringle Commission as the probable cost for the implementation of their recommendations.  We are under no illusions about the difficulty that any Minister of Justice would have, in any administration, to get even this paltry amount out of the Minister for Finance for such a purpose, however worthy.  We suspect, however, that the glaring absence of the Government costing on this scheme of theirs indicates certainly to us, and probably also to the man and the woman in the street, that this is undeniably a scheme on the cheap.  It is a scheme which is being introduced because the Government have no option but to introduce a scheme.  What they have done therefore is to introduce a scheme which will meet the demands which have been made on them by the Airey case, although even here there are problems to which I will refer later and which have restricted availability of the same kind of remedy to applicants whose circumstances are not the same as Josephine Airey's to the point at which the scheme becomes almost laughable.</P>
    <P>There is another fundamental point of principle which we should look at here and which bears on everything I have to say about this scheme.  The Government's scheme sets up a legal aid board. I have no quarrel with its decision to set up a legal aid board but if you set up a board you should give them reasonable responsibility and discretion.  In the fine print of this scheme, the legal aid board <Col N="1962" /> are pinioned hand and foot.  They have discretion to decide whether they will blow their collective nose at half past five or twenty to six, but very little more than that.</P>
    <P>I am astonished, not just at this Government but at all Government &mdash;and I would include, in certain respects, the preceding Government&mdash; for the way in which they give with one hand and take away with the other&mdash;set up a board to administer a scheme but impose such conditions on that board that effectively they are a rubber stamp for the decisions of the Cabinet, the Minister for Justice and the Department of Justice.  If I may draw an analogy very briefly, and I think it is relevant, I would like to mention the question of the RTE Authority.  When I was in another place and not a member of this party I argued against the introduction of certain legislation governing what might or might not be broadcast by RTE.  I did so fundamentally on the grounds that if the Government appoint an authority or a board as they are appointing here, they should leave to the competence of the board, within very broad limits, the decision or series of decisions about the area under discussion.  To carry the parallel further, I would argue in the case of the RTE Authority that that authority should have total editorial control over the station and that Government legislation should be, by and large, unnecessary, just as I would argue that in the case of a legal aid board the Government should have the guts to give that board a reasonable discretion in the exercise of their function.  In either case, the Government are not without a sanction. They can sack, as they did sack, on one occasion, the RTE Authority.  They can sack, as they could sack, under this instrument here, the legal aid board if, in the opinion of the Government, that board are fundamentally and basically not doing the job that they were set up to do.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those people who believe that Governments should set up boards, give them their head and never come back to them again&mdash;legal aid <Col N="1963" /> board, RTE Authority or whatever.  I believe that democratically elected Governments are entitled to the final sanction but&mdash;and I would emphasise this&mdash;that is the only sanction that they should have.  If they want to exercise that sanction, they do it and stand over that decision in this House, rather than interfere in a pettifogging way in the activities of the institution they set up, whether by legislation such as the Broadcasting Act or by regulations such as the ones which are advanced for our consideration in this legal aid advice scheme.</P>
    <P>I now turn to some of the more detailed provisions of the scheme and to express criticisms which may have been made before but which I believe deserve and need to be made again.  In the first case, as has already been mentioned, the scheme covers individuals only.  It does not cover community groups such as residents' associations and tenants' associations and although I am very well aware of the fact that some residents' associations are fairly well-heeled and can well afford to pay their own solicitor and counsel and even though I am also aware that many lawyers are justifiably apprehensive about taking group action because of the possibility that the interests of all the members of these groups do not necessarily coincide and that they may find their client splitting into its component parts before their very eyes, I nevertheless would argue that the failure even to allow the legal aid board to consider such applications for legal advice is tying its hands in quite an unrealistic way and one which might ultimately waste money rather than save it.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a concrete example of this.  Some time ago&mdash;I believe it was last December&mdash;a tenant called Siney took a case against Dublin Corporation in relation to the maintenance of his flat.  If it were not for the fact that the judge, at the beginning of the hearing, stated very positively that the case was of such importance as a test case that he thought the corporation should pay the plantiff's costs in any case, <Col N="1964" /> regardless of the outcome, that particular tenant might have been very seriously out of pocket as a result.  As it happened, he won his case.  As it happened he has established now a statutory right, as a tenant of Dublin Corporation, to have his premises maintained and repaired in a reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>We are now to be asked to bring in and endorse a legal advice and legal aid scheme which will not only make it difficult for people like Mr. Siney to bring a test case as he brought it but in situations in which other tenants would like to bring similar cases based on the precedent established by Mr. Siney and on which they may be entitled to legal aid, but will mean that each of them have to obtain from the legal aid board a subsidised in getting legal aid, when a single group action in relation to the entire group of tenants might be achieved at half the cost and with half the trouble. I must ask the Government whether they have considered this possibility.  By tying the hands of the legal aid and advice board in this respect, as they have done in so many other cases, are they not making a mockery of the thing?</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to appoint a legal aid board the sensible thing is to allow then to apply a merit test which they have to do in many of the areas and allow them to decide whether an applicant has a reasonable case for civil legal aid. For the purposes of this argument I am not even querying a means test.  I am assuming the obligations of such a test are met.  If the board are given the authority to be a real board and to decide whether an applicant is eligible for legal aid, in very broad terms&mdash;much broader than in this measure&mdash;that should be left to the board.</P>
    <P>I do not know who the Minister plans to appoint to the board.  They will not all be subversives.  Not all of them will be red-haired revolutionaries, they will not be despoilers of society who want to tear down our institutions, to run away with our wives and children and sell them in the slave auctions in the Middle East. They will be sober, responsible, concerned <Col N="1965" /> citizens&mdash;just as concerned as the Minister to uphold the rule of law and the right of access to the law.  If I were Minister I would not mind within very broad guidelines leaving the decisions on questions concerning group actions and so on to the group of citizens appointed by him and who can be removed from the board by him.  The Minister must have the final sanction.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the fact that group actions are excluded.  We have heard already from Deputy Desmond and Deputy Briscoe that test cases are excluded.  Deputy Briscoe's argument seem to be that such cases must be excluded because wastrels, agitators and so on will bring test cases, morning, noon and night.  All that has to be done to stop that happening is to give the board wide powers to dismiss, regardless of the means test, any application for a matter that they consider vexatious.</P>
    <P>The concept of vexatious litigation is a very old one in law and I have no doubt that some of the members appointed to the legal aid board will be familiar with it.  I would be happy to leave it to the general competence of such a board to decide whether a test case was vexatious.  In passing, it is worth while nothing there is no appeal from the decision of the legal advice and aid board.  Probably that is as it should be because we could not have appeals from everything all of the time.  It makes sense to give the board broad powers and to allow them to dismiss vexatious appeals.  The decision on what is vexatious will be made by the board and the character of their decisions will be influenced by the character of the members of the board and ultimately by the character of the Government who appoint them.  I cannot see any Government appointing a board that would allow vexatious causes of action to be financed out of public funds.  What I would like to see, and I make no apology for saying it, is a Government who would appoint a legal aid and advice board that would be rather more open to allocating public money to pay for legal <Col N="1966" /> argument in the cause of establishing important human and democratic rights than is the case with the Government now in office.  In the past 15 years anybody who reads the newspapers can see that some of the most exciting, innovative and challenging developments in Irish law have been made not in this House but in the High Court and in the Supreme Court.  Effectively we are denying to the ordinary citizen the right to climb that ladder in the pursuit of rights that he considers reasonable, whether or not the court finally decide that they are reasonable.</P>
    <P>Another point is the fact that legal aid is not to be provided for cases in front of any tribunals.  The importance of this for workers, and particularly for workers in dispute with their employers, cannot be emphasised enough.  At the moment there is a laudable emphasis on the part of the Government and in the practices of the Department of Labour for tribunals to be as free as possible from legal jargon and argument, to be more accessible and to be more domestic in character.  However, we must face the facts.  When an employer feels at risk because of any action brought before a tribunal by an employee, the first thing he will do will be to hire an expensive lawyer or else to send one of his senior management staff who has a law degree or has legal training to confront the unfortunate worker who is attempting to argue the rights of his case.  Not even the most sympathetic tribunal can be expected to offset this advantage to the employer&mdash;who has an advantage from the point of view of money, class, background, upbringing and who has access to resources of all kind.</P>
    <P>Within this category of worker who is being discriminated against by this scheme there is another category of worker to whom I should refer.  A very high proportion of workers in this country are unionised but there are also non-unionised workers and they have every right to remain as such.  The unionised worker will be entitled to expert representation at the tribunal, at the very least by an official from his union.  The <Col N="1967" /> worker who does not belong to a trade union is entitled to no such representation and his position is ten times worse because of that.  If we are to be serious about safeguarding the rights of people, what area could be more important than the defence and protection of a person's employment?  If we rule out these areas we might as well admit that the scheme is a shambles.</P>
    <P>The scheme probably excludes planning as well.  I would argue that it would be quite possible to include planning if there was a provision that allowed the board to dismiss what they considered to be vexatious requests for financial assistance.</P>
    <P>There is another point in relation to the choice of solicitor&mdash;let us remember that the Airey case was a matrimonial matter.  Let us remember also that we have not been told precisely how many legal aid centres there will be, that in certain cases the plaintiff, if he cannot get legal aid in his own town may visit a legal aid centre in another town.  Consider a matrimonial case in a small country town where there may be only four or five solicitors, many of them overworked and where, even if somebody could be found to take a case for both parties, both eligible under the means test, the difficulty of confidentiality remains extraordinarily high.  In this kind of situation, where a matrimonial case in a small town is being brought in a small understaffed legal aid centre with small resources, one of the partners, in order to maintain confidentiality, will have to travel 40 or 50 miles to get his or her free legal aid. What kind of legal aid scheme is that? What kind of choice does that give to anybody involved in such a situation?</P>
    <P>Indeed, in relation to the supposed confidentiality between lawyer and client which the scheme purports to uphold there is another aspect which I feel I should bring to the attention of the House.  When the solicitor who is acting on behalf of a legal aid client sends in the application for legal aid to the legal aid board he is required under the terms of this extraordinary instrument to tell the <Col N="1968" /> other party to the case, his client's opponent in this case, and to ask his client's opponent's solicitors whether they have any comments to make on the entitlement of his client to free legal aid and invite them to send any such comment to the legal aid board.  In common with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, I am not slow to criticise the practices of the legal profession and in particular their restrictive practices but I believe that the concept of the privilege that attaches to information and communication between solicitors and clients is most gravely infringed by this peeping-tom provision.  If I mention this at the end of my speech it is only because it is a symbol of the arbitrary, mean-minded and totally inadequate spirit in which this piece of legislation or instrument has been drafted. There is a saver in one paragraph.  Legal aid is to be granted under certain circumstances; legal advice is to be given free.  When you work out the small print there the only legal advice a person will get for free is the advice he will get as to which solicitor he can go to with his money in his hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The debate has proved conclusively that this scheme is hopelessly inadequate to meet even existing needs of which we are aware much less identifying and seeking to redress the hidden needs which must exist in a society which has confined the process of the law to those who can afford it up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal mainly in the limited time available with the response to or indeed the rejection by the Minister of the arguments made in this debate. His contribution was disappointing in the extreme.  First, he chose to challenge with a considerable display of indignation our assertion, the assertion of this party, that this scheme would not create a right to legal aid in the same way as would one based on an Act of the Oireachtas.  We must assume that the Minister knows there is a fundamental <Col N="1969" /> difference.  A scheme such as the Minister's, not based on an Act of the Oireachtas could&mdash; and I am not being unduly suspicious or pessimistic or unduly sensitive in saying this&mdash;if the Minister and Government so decided be discontinued and dismantled as no scheme based on legislation could.  It is not stretching the imagination too far to suggest that budget difficulties may arise.  There are budgetary difficulties at present, difficulties not likely to improve in the next year or so and they could result in this scheme not expanding to the extent to which we are led to believe it could and should.  We do not think this scheme is capable of expansion or of providing legal aid on the basis we require.</P>
    <P>Given the Government's reluctance to introduce a scheme at all, their lack of commitment to justice for the financially deprived which is evident from the scheme itself and even more evident in the Minister's speech last night and evident also from many actions of the Government since they came into office, and given the absolutely minimal response which this scheme represents to the findings in the Airey case one cannot be over-confident, if not about its continuation, about its expansion and development into anything like an adequate scheme of legal aid for the people it purports to serve.</P>
    <P>The main brake on that would be the Airey case itself in so far as if the scheme were discontinued another litigant such as Mrs. Airey could bring another case.  The Minister must know that it has not the safeguards of a scheme based on legislation and it does not inspire the confidence that such a scheme would inspire.</P>
    <P>Finally, one might also say that it is relegating to the Government a function which many feel should properly be exercised by the House as a whole.  If we refer to the Pringle Report we find as regards other schemes in other countries which were examined by that committee, all such schemes are in fact based on legislation.  The Minister in his speech, I <Col N="1970" /> think, concedes the point when he said that in due course he contemplated bringing in legislation.  We believe that the scheme should initially have been based on an Act of this House and we stand firm on that.</P>
    <P>I do not know how he could have done so but the Minister also made the case that the scheme is not confined to particular cases.  One has only to refer to his scheme to find that tribunals are excluded, that social welfare appeals are excluded, that planning cases are excluded, that advice on civil bills under £20 is excluded, and that legal aid in the case of civil bills amounting to less than £150 is excluded.  The Minister must concede that these matters are all in the areas most relevant to the underprivileged section of the community. They are all areas that were recommended strongly by the Pringle Committee, by FLAC who are possibly best equipped to advise in this area and by the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he thought the scheme more generous than the scheme outlined in the Pringle Report.  In support of that contention the Minister said that the spouse's income is excluded in family law cases, but the Minister has only to look at page 140 of the Pringle Report to find that they recommended that the spouse's income should be disregarded in family law cases.  There were very strong recommendations from women's rights groups that this should be the case.  So, the Minister is not doing anything extraordinary or generous or thinking of something not already thought of and strongly advocated when he includes in his scheme provision for the exclusion of a spouse's income in family law cases.</P>
    <P>I have a query in relation to family law&mdash;it will be raised by way of Parliamentary Question by Deputy Barry Desmond&mdash;which concerns the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  It is that there is no clear indication to us that actions under this legislation are covered in the Minister's scheme.  It is vitally important that they should be covered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> The Minister stated that the aspects we said were omitted from the scheme were inherently unimportant.  That does not say much for the Minister's understanding of the needs of the underprivileged in our community.  The people concerned consider those matters very relevant to their needs.  The Minister also challenged our claim that a choice of solicitor would not be made available under this scheme.  That matter was dealt with adequately by Deputies Horgan and O'Keeffe.  Coming from a rural area and being aware of the needs of people in rural Ireland I am inclined to agree with what Deputy O'Keeffe said in relation to distance from the proposed law centres rather than what Deputy Horgan stated.  It should be remembered that clients may have to travel up to 100 miles to a law centre to avail of a choice of solicitor.  In areas where only one law centre exists only one of the parties to a dispute can avail of the services there with the result that the other party must make a journey of up to 50 miles to another centre.  That puts the services of a law centre in rural areas outside the capacity of many people.  Deputy Briscoe gave me the impression that his understanding of the scheme was that there would be a law centre in every major town and that these centres would be staffed by five or six solicitors.  Such a choice will not exist under the Minister's scheme.  With the constraints on money and the lack of commitment in this area by the Government we cannot see centres being established on the lines suggested by Deputy Briscoe.  For some time there will be no effective choice for those who must rely on the legal aid scheme to bring cases to court.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought to imply that the Labour Party were opposed to the establishment of law centres and gave the impression that we wanted this matter handed over to a panel of private lawyers.  That is deliberately misleading. We are the first political party to place on record our concern and appreciation of the role of law centres.  We have expressed our appreciation of the work done at the Coolock law centre and we <Col N="1972" /> were the first to make the case that law centres were essential for people in deprived areas.  We also felt that law centres should be able to direct individual cases to solicitors on a panel. We expressed the view that such centres should have more freedom to concentrate on cases which have been excluded from the measures outlined by the Minister.  They should be able to examine and organise with local people issues arising from the work carried out at such centres and make suggestions for law reform.</P>
    <P>It is vital that properly equipped law centres should be available free to people in deprived areas.  Those centres should be in a position to promote a knowledge of the law and an awareness of legal rights within the community.  They should be able to give information on law relating to social welfare and give support at meetings of groups such as those concerned with deserted and battered wives.  They should provide courses on labour and family law and social welfare entitlements.  Those aspects have been covered at the Coolock Law Centre and the people in that area get an excellent service from those in charge of that centre.  Such centres should be free from the day-to-day work load of giving a client a choice of solicitor because that is not available to a client under this meagre scheme.  As I said, law centres are vital but they cannot reach their potential under the Minister's scheme as placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They cannot provide a choice to which the legal aided client is entitled.</P>
    <P>I and my party are convinced that this is a miserable, inadequate scheme. Nobody knows the extent to which it will expand, because it has not been costed, and there has not been any projection as to what the cost will be.  It is a bureaucratic scheme.  It gives no real choice to the people who will have to depend on it for redress before the law.  It invades the privacy of the needy client to an outrageous extent.  That case was made by Deputy Horgan this evening.  I made it last evening.  The need to notify the other side that you are applying for <Col N="1973" /> legal aid, and that legal aid has been granted, is an invasion of the client's privacy.  As it stands, the scheme is geared more to prevent than to assist a client in getting legal aid.  The whole emphasis is punitive.  It is designed to make it as difficult as possible for a person who has not the means to have recourse to law himself to avail of its services.</P>
    <P>The scheme is meant to cost as little as possible.  In so far as it will cost <Col N="1974" /> money, that money will be spent on bureaucracy rather than to meet the actual needs of clients.  In all respects it is a second-rate scheme.  That is not good enough for the people who have been denied justice for so long.  I have no hesitation in asking the House to reject it and to bring in a proper scheme of legal aid based roughly on the lines outlined in the Pringle Report.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I can and may not go the full 11 minutes.  I want to raise a matter that concerns every Deputy in this House and every public representative.  It has a certain degree of delicacy about it because it could be inferred that by coming to a public representative, such as a Member of the Seanad or Dáil, an individual is trying to exercise undue influence.  I want to raise with the Minister in question the position of people who have attempted to exercise their democratic rights by going to a public representative in relation to requests made by them to a Department of the Civil Service and being told when subsequently they went to the Department that because they had gone to a TD their application had been put back and instead of improving their circumstances they had damaged them.</P>
      <P>I have three cases and, obviously, I am not going to raise the names of the individuals involved.  In all three cases I was attempting to help people, two of whom are in business and one who had moved from one side of the city to the other in order to live with an elderly relative, to have an existing telephone connection transferred from one side of the city to another.  In all three cases I had made representations on behalf of these people in the normal way and in accordance with a practice that had been established long before I became a Member of this or the other House.  The constituents on whose behalf those representations were made by me were informed subsequently by anonymous officials in the Department that because I had made those representations the file of the application was now out of their hands, it was somehow or other attached to the Department of the Minister or the Minister of State and consequently there was an indefinite delay.  When one of these people asked, &ldquo;Does that mean that I have done myself more harm than good by going to a TD?&rdquo; I was named. The réply was not &ldquo;Because political representations have been made on your behalf&rdquo;; it was, &ldquo;Because you have gone to TD X the matter now is delayed indefinitely and we cannot tell you when it is likely to be effected&rdquo;.  In all three cases I was not asking for somebody to jump the queue of telephone applications.  I am raising three cases in relation to the transfer of existing telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter.  I know that the Minister of State is not responsible for the exasperating replies that come over the counter from officials of his Department who are subject to a lot of harassment from the public because of the difficult state of the telecommunications industry, or Department as it is at <Col N="1977" /> the moment.  I am quite prepared to make all the excuses and to understand all the reasons why these things happen. I want to raise a very clear point here. Either public representatives&mdash;all of them, not the ones who happen for the time being to be on this side of the House&mdash;of all parties and persuasions are told, as are the Civil Service Commission and certain semi-State bodies, that canvassing not only is of no help but is emphatically a negative factor, or you clear the ground and sort out this kind of bureaucratic guerrilla warfare from below.  The first of these two alternatives will make my week's workload easier.  I say that with a knowledge that over the last 18 months personnel relations with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have not been as good as everybody would like them to be, and I am not suggesting that any Minister is responsible for that.</P>
    <P>However, someone who moves house from the north side of the city to the south side in order to live with an elderly mother, who is himself a commercial traveller and out of the city four or five nights a week and is already a telephone subscriber is entitled to some degree of accommodation in terms of transfer. Somebody who is running a bed and breakfast business, who takes the overflow of guests of established hoteliers and who needs a telephone is entitled to some degree of consideration when he or she is already subscribing. Finally, somebody running a straightforward business enterprise who moves from one street to another literally within the same exchange code is entitled to the same kind of courtesy.</P>
    <P>I said that I would be very brief.  I am trying to make a simple point and I sought an adjournment debate deliberately on a night when we would have a vote because this matter does not need to take a lot of time.  I make the point on behalf of all public representatives in the context of telecommunications, which will be undertaken by a semi-State body shortly, that the response that came back over the counter, authorised or unauthorised, is <Col N="1978" /> damaging to the democratic process in this country.  It is a response that puts the unanswerable and unsackable bureaucracy above and beyond the pale in relation to private citizens.  The Minister should at least be aware that this is what is happening to me as an Opposition TD and I have reason to believe that it has happened to Government backbenchers and indeed even some Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>That is the case I make, and I make it on behalf of public representatives.  We should be told either not to write in at all or, alternatively, the position should be clarified.  But the present situation means that I have been represented over the counter as having done more damage than good to my constituents because I made a legitimate request on their behalf to the Minister in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea) Mark (Jnr.) Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the basic question posed by Deputy Quinn&mdash;and I am sure on behalf of other Deputies in this House and Senators in the other House&mdash;is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; that can happen.  But let me endeavour to prove that there is a specific reason that abnormalities occur in a Department operating under the conditions imposed on it.  Basically the problems concerning representations by Deputies and Senators to the Department can be illustrated by the fact that in one week of last month requests into the Department peaked at a figure of 2,100.  We estimate that in any given year, taking into account that there are in excess of 80,000 applicants awaiting installations&mdash;without taking into account those who may apply in the meantime&mdash;there are something in the region of between 55,000 and 80,000 representations received.  Those in themselves take up an enormous amount of manpower, very scarce in the Department. At this point in time there are being processed in the Department approximately 6,000 representations.  In that quantity there is bound to be error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's allegations <Col N="1979" /> that remarks have been made to him across the counter that, by his making representations on behalf of a constituent to the Department, he is delaying the installation of a telephone for that applicant, I should like to know where the Deputy got that information. He may give the Minister or myself that information at any time&mdash;indeed the same goes for any other Deputy in this House&mdash;and we shall deal very quickly with any such allegation.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of saying that in regard to the process of application for a telephone it must be understood that the people dealing with it are the engineers, inspectors, technicians, the contract managers and the telephone officers. Indeed I take this opportunity of complimenting them on the way they carry out their onerous task.  Particularly I should like to compliment the telephone officers, the people at the counter dealing with the public, who have suffered quite severely from some members of the public, something which has frustrated their work, even to the extent that the Minister himself last Saturday went to their union meeting to discuss the problems of representations and others with them, he had a very sucessful meeting with them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are working hard at it. We would love to have the situation obtaining in which, if any public represntative or member of the public made a representation regarding an application, to be able to reply spontaneously that the relevant telephone would be installed in 1980, 1981, 1982 or whenever.  This is something to which the Minister and I have turned our attention in recent months.  The system at present operating is archaic and is absorbing the valuable time of people who could better devote time to other aspects, such as contracting, calling on people for the payment of deposits and so on.  I would dearly love to have a situation in which we could render the public better service in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have now turned our attention to the possibility of forecasting for public representatives and indeed individual applicants. <Col N="1980" /> However, this is a slow process in planning.  I can assure the House and the public at large that we shall do our utmost to implement a system of forecasting by which people will know to within as close a time limit as possible when their applications will be dealt with, their telephone installed and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State think that Deputies and Senators should make representations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, why not?  But we must reverse the system we had in the Department for dealing with representations so that the funnels will not become choked, and we shall do so through a process of forecasting.  This is a big change, which will take some time so that eventually we will be able to forecast for everybody&mdash;perhaps not to the specific hour of day, but at least give a genuine time limit within which applications will be dealt with.  It must be remembered that we are in the process of change, the results of which we hope will be far better than those of the existing archaic system.</P>
      <P>With regard to all the talk about certain allegations having been made, I am always wary of anonymous allegations, made by people who will not come forward and give their names to back them up.  On occasion it may be true that five were taken out on Ministerial request on foot of representations made but, as far as I am aware, they are few and far between.</P>
      <P>That is the situation in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, a very progressive Department, one in which we are bringing about rapid changes. This year we are committed to the installation of up to 60,000 telephones.  We hope we will be able to achieve that goal, not for the sake of the political parties in this House but for the sake of our telecommunications system generally.</P>

      <P>Since the amount spent privately is not known accurately, it is not possible to give a firm figure for the amount spent annually on drugs and medicines in this country.  It is estimated, however, that the total expenditure is of the order of £70 million a year.</P>
      <P>A number of steps are being taken to stem the growth of drug costs.  The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the campaign launched by the Health Education Bureau urging a more rational approach to drugs and medicines.  It emphasises especially that a visit to the doctor need not necessarily mean that drugs are required.  This campaign is directed towards the population generally.</P>
      <P>There are other, more specialised, approaches such as those directed towards doctors.  Under the general medical service scheme participating doctors are provided with drug cost charts showing the comparative cost of a range of drugs in common use.</P>
      <P>Another development is the growing practice of instituting committees in hospitals to review drug usage.  This is particularly welcome since a doctor's prescribing pattern is first established during his hospital training period.  In addition to these measures I shall be giving further consideration during the coming months to the question of drug costs in the health services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> A committee representative of the statutory and voluntary bodies with responsibility for travelling children in the Dublin area have been meeting regularly under the chairmanship of an officer of my Department.

A meeting between representatives of this committee and representatives of the county and city managers will be held shortly to ensure a co-ordinated approach among all statutory agencies and to agree on the priority areas for attention.</P>
    <P>My predecessor as Minister for Health invited the National Council for Travelling People to undertake a review of existing policies and services for travellers, including travelling children.

    <P>At present health boards support 83 such centres, catering for over 2,500 children.

Accordingly, health boards support the provision of nursery and day care facilities for children of these families.  The categories normally provided for are children of single parent families; children whose mothers have been deserted or widowed and have to find employment because of economic necessity; and children of parents who, <Col N="1876" /> because of illness or similar circumstances, are not able to cope with the children at home without special support.</P>
    <P>The policy of encouraging and supporting voluntary groups to provide day care facilities for these children will continue.

    <P>While the hospital in-patient inquiry does not yet cover all hospitals, it is likely that the great majority of cases of children suffering from adverse effects of medicines are included in these figures because the principal hospitals dealing with such cases are covered by the inquiry. Figures for the years prior to 1973 are not included because of inadequate coverage of hospitals in the in-patient inquiry in that period.  Figures for 1979 are not yet available.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy appreciates there is not a simple answer to this problem.</P>
      <P>I think we must develop a comprehensive national policy in regard to the use and abuse of alcohol.  I am considering how this might be done and much of the preparatory work has been completed in my Department.  It will, of course, involve other Departments as well as my own.  In the meantime a number of interim measures have been undertaken.</P>
      <P>A pilot course to train selected personnel from the health services in the counselling of alcoholics and their families is now coming to an end.  As the trainees return to their posts and apply their new skills an evaluation will be carried out into the effectiveness of the training.  In the light of that evaluation a decision will be taken later this year as to whether further training courses will be held.</P>
      <P>The Rutland Centre, Clondalkin, a new centre for the treatment of alcoholics operated by a voluntary group, will continue to be supported from public funds for a further year so that its treatment programme can be more fully evaluated.</P>
      <P>Campaigns to encourage moderation in the use of alcohol remain a high priority with the Health Education Bureau.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the short interval between the date of this year's budget and the dates from which the increases in the rates of pension had effect, it would not have been possible to have pension order books at the increased rates printed and issued to the pensioners before their existing pension books expired at the end of March.  In order to avoid a situation where the pensioners would have had no books on which to receive payment from the beginning of this month it was necessary <Col N="1884" /> this year to have two issues of pension books prepared for the 330,000 pensioners in the country.</P>
      <P>The first issue of books, at the prebudget rates, was made in March and the books were in the hands of the pensioners to enable them to receive payment at these rates from the first week of this month.  The second issue which provides for the weekly increases is being made at present.  So far approximately two-thirds of pensioners have received their supplementary pension books and it is anticipated that the issue of the balance of the books will be completed next month.  These books contain orders from the first week in April in all cases, with the result that no pensioner will suffer any loss arising from the delay in their issue.</P>
      <P>An advertisement advising pensioners of the arrangements for the issue of the two sets of books was inserted in all the main daily and evening newspapers on Monday 31 March 1980 and in the Sunday newspapers on 6 April 1980.</P>
      <P>The delay in the issue of the supplementary pension books containing the increases in the rates is regretted but every effort is being made by my Department to ensure that the remainder of the books will be issued to the pensioners as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>As payments such as of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and other short-term payments are made by cheque or by cash as appropriate the increases in the rates of those payments were made from the operative date in each case.</P>
