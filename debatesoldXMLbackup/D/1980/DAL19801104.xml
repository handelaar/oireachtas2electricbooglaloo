New warning notices have been placed at appropriate locations, and the area is patrolled at weekends by military personnel.</P>
      <P>Before each bank holiday weekend, members of the public are advised, by notices in the press and on television, as well as by radio announcements, not to enter the lands.  A permanent military staff at Coolmoney Camp is being established which will include among its responsibilities the implementation of safety measures in the Glen of Imaal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the reason a temporary position of stoker at the Curragh Camp was not given to a person (details supplied) who has four year's experience of the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: Vacancies for temporary stokers employed each year at the Curragh Camp for the heating season are filled through the National Manpower Service.  The person concerned was one of a large number of persons nominated by that service for a limited number of posts in September 1980.  He was interviewed by a selection board but was not successful in obtaining an appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  There were 40 applicants for 10 positions this year.  It is not correct to say he had been in the job for the past four years.  He did not present himself for this type of employment in 1979-80.  He had previous experience <Col N="1280" /> prior to that.  He was interviewed by the selection board but was not successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister have another look at his information because my information is that he was in the temporary position for the last four years, that he applied again and was given to understand there would be no reason for not employing him.  When the Minister is checking would he find out how many applicants there were in the previous years?  If he was able to be appointed out of a field of 40 applicants in other years surely there would have been nothing unusual in appointing him again if there was no need to appoint somebody else who was better placed in the organisation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will approach AnCO in relation to their proposed new centre in Loughlinstown to suggest that full-time and part-time training and retraining courses for women be provided there in view of the considerable demand from women workers who are anxious for such part-time retraining to enable them to reenter the labour force, and to enable such persons who are registered for, and seeking, full-time employment to participate in such part-time training courses.</P>

      <P>: It is the intention of AnCO to provide a comprehensive range <Col N="1283" /> of adult and apprentice training courses to cater for the training needs of both women and men at the Loughlinstown training centre.  Courses will also be provided to cater specifically for women who have been out of the labour force for some time and are anxious to return to paid employment.  In addition AnCO has the flexibility to respond to the particular training-retraining requirements of local communities through providing instruction in external facilities where spare capacity exists.  Part-time return to work courses are already being provided by AnCO in certain locations; the demand for these training services is being carefully analysed at present and the level of resources currently allocated to them will, if necessary, be reviewed as a result of this analysis.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the amount of money lost to (i) State and (ii) semi-State bodies each year from 1970 to the latest available date through (a) official strikes and (b) unofficial strikes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the total loss to the country, including all State and semi-State bodies, industry, agriculture, etc. through strikes each year from 1970 to date.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together. The information requested is not available to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>: Why is the information not available in regard to the loss <Col N="1284" /> through official and non-official strikes over the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: To supply the information requested by the Deputy would necessitate asking all Department and State bodies for particulars of relevant strikes occurring over the past ten years and even if that were done, it is extremely unlikely that one could get a complete and accurate picture.  For example, in trying to assess the cost of any dispute account would have to be taken of estimated losses to the company concerned together with the estimated repercussive effect on other companies and on the Exchequer at large.  Such effects could be beneficial as well as detrimental.  For instance, in the recent oil dispute CIE could be said to have benefited by having their transport and passenger services used more fully.  In the same way a strike affecting coal deliveries, it would be reasonable to assume, could have a beneficial repercussive effect on the consumption of turf and oil.  The Deputy must realise that to endeavour to answer the type of question he has put down is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister saying then that a strike, unofficial or otherwise, is better for this country than having our people working?  Is he not aware that there have been huge losses over the past few years and that the nation seems to be about to commit hara-kiri?  Does he not think that in the interest of the nation and the Government he should have some figures as regards the losses?  If he cannot get them for the last ten years, could the Minister supply them for even the last one or two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: My comments are well known.  Of course strikes are injurious and harmful to a company and, as I have said, they have repercussive effects on other companies and on the Exchequer. But the Deputy must appreciate that to compile the kind of information he is asking for in that question would be an absolute impossibility.  If the Deputy wishes for information in regard to any specific strike, and if he wishes to put <Col N="1285" /> down a question, one would endeavour in that situation to meet the Deputy's requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that last December the Taoiseach, after being elected, said that the Government intended to introduce legislation to deal with unofficial strikes and that the Minister had information prepared and a Bill almost ready?  Does the Minister mean to tell me that he had not any of those statistics ready when he was preparing that Bill?  What has happened to it since?</P>

      <P>The maintenance of industrial peace in the insurance industry, as indeed in other industries, is primarily a matter for employers and workers.  It is of vital importance that both sides of industry should establish and develop agreed procedures for the negotiation of claims and for the resolution of grievances.  In the event of disputes arising the institutions established by the State, such as the Labour Court and its industrial relations service, are there to assist the parties to achieve a settlement.</P>

I am advised that these regulations are being implemented.</P>
      <P>However I have requested CIE to make by-laws in respect of the transportation of dangerous substances by rail and the matter is receiving the urgent attention of CIE.</P>
      <P>On 22 July last I made an order entitled Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 (Part IV Declaration) Order, 1980, declaring 25 substances to be dangerous for the purposes of the Act.  On the same date I made regulations entitled Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) Regulations, 1980.  The order and regulations came into operation on the 15 September last.  In the short time since then CIE are fully implementing the conveyance by road regulations apart from those which require the modification of vehicles and trailers.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) that a CIE train carrying 270 tons of liquid ammonia from Cork to the Nítrigin Éireann plant in Arklow, County Wicklow, was stopped and attacked by persons unknown in Dublin during August; and if any contingency plans have been devised under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, to deal with such occurrences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: My attention has been drawn to the report referred to by the Deputy.  Ammonia is a scheduled dangerous substance under the Dangerous Substances Acts and I have recently made comprehensive regulations controlling its conveyance by road.  In so far as the conveyance by rail is concerned, CIE have made their own internal arrangements.  These are in accordance with the procedures set out in the RID Agreement &mdash; the United Nations agreement covering the international carriage of dangerous goods by rail.</P>
      <P>The arrangements which CIE have made for the transportation of dangerous substances by rail incorporate emergency plans to deal with accidents.  Comprehensive schemes have been drawn up, following inter-departmental consultation, for the co-ordination of emergency services should such accidents occur.  A separate scheme exists in relation to the transportation of liquid ammonia from Cork to Arklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, section 62(3) of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, gives me, as Minister for Labour, power to request CIE to make by-laws governing the conveyance, loading and unloading of scheduled dangerous substances.  I have written to CIE requesting the submission of <Col N="1296" /> such by-laws and as soon as I receive their proposals I shall give the matter immediate attention.</P>
    <P>In the case of the particular incident referred to in the question, I understand from CIE that the vandalism to the train consisted of the draining off of the water from the barrier wagon.  The matter was reported immediately to the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of the extra cost which will fall on each petrol pump owner as a result of the request by the licensing authorities for plans of their pumps, storage, etc.; and the reason it is necessary to get such details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The cost which may fall on each petrol pump owner in relation to the request for plans depends on the extent and nature of the information required by the licensing authority in connection with the application by the owner for a petroleum-spirit licence under the requirements of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, and regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Such details as may be required by the licensing authority are necessary for the purpose of making a proper appraisal of the structural integrity, soundness of design, layout and overall suitability of the storage and dispensing pump installation. The details enable the licensing authority to process the application for the licence with due regard to the protection of life and property against risk of injury from spillage, escape, ignition, explosion or fire which can arise from the improper keeping, storage, conveying or dispensing of petroleum-spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister not agree that before the original licences were issued to the people concerned, the information which is now being sought would have been supplied?  Therefore, can he explain why it is considered necessary now to ask petrol pump operators after they have experienced a disastrous strike, to expend substantial sums of money in having plans prepared for the <Col N="1297" /> purpose of arranging a renewal of their licences?  Is there any explanation for this situation having regard to the fact that plans in this regard which are in the archives of the local authorities are being ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is being done mainly in the interest of safety as I have tried to explain.  The position is that because of the regulations that have been introduced relating to petroleum &mdash; to insulations, jetties, conveyancing and so on &mdash; these new plans are being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister not agree that if a petrol station operator was given a licence under the old regulations he would have supplied the necessary details and, that, consequently, it is ridiculous that those operators should now be asked to expend substantial sums of money for the purpose of having their licences renewed?  There is no question of safety involved because if these people had not complied with the regulations, they would not have been licensed in the first instance.  Is this not another example of bureaucracy gone mad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would not agree with the Deputy and I must insist that the new regulations are in the interest of safety.  While licences may have been granted in the past, and rightly so, I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is in the interest, not only of all of us here but of all our people, that we strive in so far as possible to prevent serious accidents.  In some instances, the operators concerned will be involved in additional costs but this will only be in instances in which the conditions do not comply with the requirements of the Act.  Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that people should be put at risk because of inadequate or improperly-fitted stations.</P>

There is no guarantee that, say, in 12 months' time the Minister will not decide that anyone in receipt of an existing petrol station licence need not apply for another licence.  We recall what happened in the case of driving licences. What is the point in asking people to provide information that they have provided already?  It appears that this new situation is the result of a decision reached in a hurry.  What is the difference regarding the regulations applying to petrol-filling stations now and those which will apply in the new situation?</P>

      <P>: There was no question of a hasty decision.  I would suggest that the exact opposite was the case and that were it not for my advent to the Department, the matter would not be dealt with yet.  The Act was passed in 1972.  Certain problems arose thereafter but these were not related to what we are discussing here.  They related to explosive substances.  Action was not taken on the matter until I introduced an amendment to the Act to enable us to bring in regulations dealing specifically with petroleum products.  The House must realise that we are dealing with explosive substances, with dangerous substances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Might it not be timely to consider the possibility of introducing such proposals since such action might prove an incentive to people who advise Ministers and Ministers of State, who accept responsibility in public, to be somewhat more publicly accountable, along the lines of other open democracies in which it is possible during discussion to tease out the thinking behind decisions instead of having to accept the bland type of reply that one is given often in a parliament like this?

      <P>: Perhaps the Deputy is aware that there is considerable discussion in progress in this area in the light of the Devlin Report.  It was recognised in the Devlin Report that the volume of public business had grown well beyond the point where a Minister could exercise personal detailed supervision of every decision of his Department.  A good deal of work has been done in this area and both the Department of Health and the Department of Transport have been reorganised on the lines suggested by Devlin.  That has been done on a nonstatutory basis.  The present programme of restructuring is not directed at producing any statutory change at this time but in any further discussions that take place I will keep in mind what the Deputy says.</P>

Waterford city is one of the centres to which part of the Government service will be transferred and it is envisaged that part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will move to the city.  Since staff interests have to be consulted over the move and arrangements made to provide office accommodation and infrastructural servces, it is clearly not possible at the present stage to give any firm date for the transfer.

      <P>: A primary objective of this phase of the decentralisation programme was to make a contribution across the board to the development of the less well-off regions, and I feel that this is reflected fairly in the broad geographical spread.  Every medium-sized town in Ireland was considered, and full and sympathetic consideration was given to the claims of the South Tipperary region.  It would not be practicable to extend the present phase any further; as it is, the transfer of over 3,000 civil servants to the provincial centres named is clearly a sizeable and complex task.  I regret therefore that it was just not possible within the limits of the present programme for the Government to satisfy the claims of many centres, including South Tipperary, to participate in the programme.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the 1972 Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the London Convention of the same year on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter.</P>
      <P>In recent years international concern has been growing in regard to the risk of pollution of the sea through the deliberate dumping of noxious substances from ships, where the ship's voyage is undertaken for the specific purpose of getting rid of some hazardous substance.  The first incident of this kind to attract widespread international attention occurred in 1970, when an attempt was made to dump a cargo of poisonous chemical waste in the Atlantic.  Representations by a number of West European countries, including Ireland, led to the cancellation of the attempted dumping, but the incident served to focus attention on the growing practice of disposing of harmful substances by dumping them at sea and on the need for concerted action to prevent and combat marine pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International action was taken by way of the two conventions I have already <Col N="1403" /> mentioned.  The Oslo Convention, which came into force in April 1974 and has been ratified by 12 countries, applies, broadly speaking, to the sea areas northwards of Gibraltar and eastwards of Greenland, including the North Sea, but excluding the Mediterranean and the Baltic, to which separate regional dumping conventions apply.</P>
    <P>The Oslo Convention provides principally that contracting States shall ensure that, within the sea areas covered by the convention.</P>
    <P>(a)  the dumping of certain specified highly toxic substances shall be prohibited as well as other substances listed in Annex I to the convention;</P>
    <P>(b)  the dumping in significant quantities of other less toxic substances or other substances and materials which may present a serious obstacle to fishing or navigation or seriously reduce amenities shall require for each occasion of dumping a specific permit from the national authority concerned; these substances and materials are listed in Annex II of the convention;</P>
    <P>(c)  the dumping of any other substance or material shall require the approval of the national authority concerned; and</P>
    <P>(d)  each national authority shall, in issuing permits or approvals for dumping at sea, take into account certain specified factors listed in Annex III to the convention for example, characteristics of waste, dumping site, method of deposit and do on.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the Oslo Convention, dumping is defined as the deliberate disposal of substances and materials into the sea from ships, including fixed or floating platforms, or aircraft, other than any discharge incidental to the normal operation of a ship or aircraft or the placing of substances or materials for a purpose other than the mere disposal thereof, provided that this is not contrary <Col N="1404" /> to the aim of the convention.  The latter exception would, for example, cover the use of dispersants at sea to deal with an oil spillage.</P>
    <P>Each state ratifying the Oslo Convention undertakes to ensure compliance by its own ships and aircraft, by ships and aircraft of any country loading in its territory substances and materials with a view to dumping, and by ships and aircraft of any country dumping within its territorial seas, and to take appropriate measures to prevent and punish conduct in contravention of the convention.  Vessels entitled to sovereign immunity under international law such as naval vessels are exempted from the terms of the convention, although states are expected to ensure that in practice they comply as far as possible.  Contracting states also agree to assist one another as appropriate in dealing with dumping incidents and to exchange information on methods of dealing with such incidents.</P>
    <P>The London Convention, which came into force in August 1975, and has been ratified by 44 countries, is in substance and form generally similar in most respects to the Oslo Convention.  Its scope is much wider, however, in that it applies to all the seas and oceans of the world.  It has a number of other differences and variations of emphasis.  For example, it specifically prohibits the dumping of high level radio-active waste declared by the International Atomic Energy Agency as unsuitable for dumping at sea and also the dumping of mineral oils taken on board for the purpose of dumping.  Incineration at sea as a means of waste disposal is also controlled by the convention.</P>
    <P>The prohibitions on dumping at sea imposed by the Oslo and London Conventions are specially expressed in the conventions not to apply in case of <i>force majeure</i> due to stress of weather or any other cause, when safety of human life or of a ship, aircraft or marine structure is threatened, if dumping appears to be the only way of averting the threat, but full details of the occurrence are required to be reported to the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO), which administers the London <Col N="1405" /> Convention, and, as appropriate, to the Oslo Commission.  If, in an emergency, a state considers that a prohibited substance cannot be disposed of on land without unacceptable danger or damage, it is obliged under the conventions to consult with IMCO and, where appropriate, the Oslo Commission, which shall recommend the most satisfactory methods of storage, destruction or disposal in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>As an island nation we have a particular interest in preventing pollution of the sea and in the general protection of the marine environment, in the interests of human health, marine life and amenities. Ireland's geographical position, in conjunction with the pattern of prevailing winds and currents, renders it particularly vulnerable to the effects of dumping of harmful substances in the North Atlantic. The danger of our situation is accentuated by the natural tendency of vessels engaged in dumping, on economic grounds, to choose a dumping site no further west into the Atlantic than is absolutely necessary.  By joining with other nations in taking measures for the strict control of dumping at sea of toxic, noxious and other objectionable materials, we will be protecting our own interests and, at the same time, contributing to international efforts to improve protection of the marine environment generally for the benefit of all humanity.</P>
    <P>As an indication of support for the international objectives in this area, Ireland is already a signatory to both the Oslo and London Conventions.  However, it is only by ratification of the conventions and enforcement of their provisions that we can demonstrate our full commitment to them.  I can tell you that it is the Government's intention to ratify both conventions as soon as possible after the Dumping at Sea Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Basically, the Bill is a very simple one. In accordance with the provisions of the conventions, it prohibits dumping at sea or loading at a place within the state or in its territorial seas for dumping at sea, from any vessel, aircraft or marine structure, of any substance or material, unless such dumping or loading takes place under and in accordance with a permit <Col N="1406" /> granted under section 3 of the Bill or under an authorisation granted by another state that is party to either convention. This prohibition on dumping will apply, firstly, to all sea areas under our jurisdiction, including tidal waters, and secondly, anywhere at sea where the vessel, aircraft or marine structure concerned in the dumping is Irish.</P>
    <P>As in the conventions, provision is made in the Bill whereby the restrictions on dumping will not apply in certain emergency situations, but the Bill also provides that any such dumping must be reported to the Minister not later than seven days after it takes place.  For the purposes of the Bill, dumping means deliberate disposal at sea, including disposal by incineration, of any substance or material from a vessel, aircraft or marine structure.  It includes disposal of material from dredgers or other such vessels specially constructed for the disposal of materials at sea but excludes disposal incidental to the normal operation of the vessel, aircraft or marine structure.  Disposal of materials directly into the sea from a land based source is not comprehended by the Bill&mdash;this is controlled by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, which also controls dumping into rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>In so far as oil pollution is concerned, the Bill applies to deliberate dumping of oil but does not apply to the accidental discharge of oil from ships such as spills arising from a maritime casualty.  The Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977, cover such incidents and provide for heavy penalties for pollution damage, even where spills are accidental.</P>
    <P>Dispersants used for combating oil pollution are likewise excluded from the scope of the Bill.  A strict licensing requirement on the lines envisaged in the Bill would not be appropriate for such substances which have to be used at short notice.  The use of these substances is already subject to control by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the grant or refusal of permits for dumping or for loading for the purpose of dumping. Before taking a decision on any <Col N="1407" /> application for permits, the Minister will have to consult with the Ministers for the Environment, Fisheries and Forestry, Industry, Commerce and Tourism and Energy and he will also have to take into consideration the provisions of Annex III of both the Oslo and London Conventions, which are set out in the table to section 3 of the Bill.  Provision is being made for charging a fee in respect of an application for a permit and for an additional fee related to the cost of any monitoring, surveys and examinations necessary in any case in which it is proposed to grant a permit.</P>
    <P>To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of the Bill, it is proposed under section 4 that authorised officers may be appointed by the Minister and, specifically in respect of the harbours under their control, by the various harbour authorities, the Commissioners of Public Works and Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is intended that an authorised officer will have wide powers enabling him, <i>inter alia</i>, to enter any vehicle, place or premises, to board any vessel, aircraft or marine structure and to carry out any inspection and examination which he considers reasonably necessary.  He will be empowered to detain a vessel, aircraft or marine structure if he suspects that a contravention of the Act is taking place or has already taken place.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the prosecution of offences and specifies the penalties for such offences.  In particular, it provides for substantial penalties, including imprisonment in certain cases, for contraventions of the restrictions on dumping imposed by section 2.  It is the Minister's hope that the possibility of substantial penalties on conviction will be an effective deterrent to would-be offenders.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, dumping at sea originating from Irish ports has not constituted a problem.  Some treated sewage sludge is dumped in Dublin Bay by Dublin Corporation and material dredged by harbour authorities in connection with harbour maintenance or improvement works is dumped at various places around the Irish coast.  I am advised that these <Col N="1408" /> materials do not contain any harmful substance and I do not anticipate that any problem will arise in regard to authorising continued dumping of such material under the terms of the Bill.  Some industrial wastes are dumped off the south coast in accordance with licences issued by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry under the Fisheries Consolidation Act, 1959.  Dumping of this nature will also be comprehended by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The spirit of the Oslo and London Conventions is that harmful dumping at sea should be prevented as far as possible and it is the Minister's intention that the Bill will be administered in the same spirit.  Applicants for permits will have to satisfy him that there is no suitable alternative means of disposal of the substance for which they seek a permit and, where necessary, before any permit is granted special tests and investigations will be carried out to assess the possible effects of the proposed dumping.</P>
    <P>I should mention that I will be circulating a number of amendments for discussion on Committee Stage, most of which are of a drafting nature.  One of the amendments will provide that, in the case of radioactive substances and materials, the powers under this Bill will be vested in the Minister for Energy and the Nuclear Energy Board rather than in the Minister for Transport.  This will avoid a duality of responsibility in relation to those substances and materials.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the Bill but in doing so I wish to express some reservations because I do not see how it is to be implemented.  Even if it were implemented within the narrow confines set out today it would be relatively ineffective. The pollution which worries us does not primarily emanate from this country and we feel there should be some international agency set up to monitor and examine all types of dumping at sea, not just within a three-mile limit as provided for in the Bill.  As I understand it, our territorial waters to which reference is made in the Bill extend merely three <Col N="1409" /> miles from our coastline and the serious dumping at sea is taking place further out.</P>
      <P>The Oslo Convention was introduced in 1974 and the London Convention in 1975, but I have yet to see one case where a firm or an individual has been prosecuted for contravening either of these conventions.  We must seriously question the usefulness of these conventions in view of the fact that action has not been taken to implement them.</P>
      <P>We listened during the Minister's statement to a lot of rhetoric and I believe we will not see any follow-up.  I would ask the Minister to spell out how many officers from his Department will be involved in operating the provisions of the Bill before us.  It is obvious from replies to previous questions that the Department are seriously understaffed in this regard, incapable of monitoring the dumping which is taking place and taking preventive action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of dumping which is dangerous is primarily of the nuclear waste variety and great concern has been expressed about our lack of knowledge of exactly what substances are being dumped and where dumping is taking place.  We are told that the dumping of nuclear waste material is going on somewhere off the south-west coast and we should like the Minister to be somewhat more specific.  Can he assure us that the waste is relatively harmless and, if so, will it be harmless for ever?  Is it just an educated guess that the waste will be harmless in the immediate future?  We should like the Minister to state categorically exactly what is happening because the public constantly express concern about this matter.  It is quite possible that containers of nuclear waste will erode over the years and waste matter could be released.  We wish to know whether the depth of water is sufficient to ensure that such erosion will not take place and whether the dumping is monitored by officials from the Department.  There is a tendency for people to dump waste anywhere once they are out of sight and we see problems caused by dumping of domestic refuse.  I would ask for a reassurance from the Minister that he will <Col N="1410" /> find out exactly what substance is being dumped and that he will ensure it is being dumped in the stated area.  He should also state whether senior officials of his Department are actually on the spot to see that everything is being done properly.</P>
    <P>Another cause of concern is the emission of nuclear waste from the Windscale nuclear reactor in Britain which is obviously causing a certain amount of nuclear pollution in the Irish Sea.  There have been allegations that this emission is creating a danger to fish life and consequently to human life.  Again I would ask for an assurance that this emission is being monitored by officials from the Department or by the IIRS who are the experts in this field.  How many people are employed in this type of investigation and what are their findings?  It is very disturbing that such dumping is occurring both off the south-west coast and into the Irish Sea and the possible effects, if any, have not been spelled out.  Public concern has been expressed and a reassurance is needed because we all suspect that the Minister's Department are not sufficiently staffed to deal with such matters. We should also like to know what equipment is at the disposal of the Department. Have we research boats and ships capable of monitoring such dumping which are at the disposal of the Department? Alternatively, is it a hocus-pocus affair whereby we rely on reports from countries which are carrying on dumping or from industrial concerns engaged in dumping?  Have we any first-hand information on the type of industrial or nuclear waste which is being dumped and where it is being dumped?  Are we accepting what we are being told without seeing at first hand what is being done?</P>
    <P>One of the greatest problems is that the Bill is confined to the three-mile limit. I know it refers to Irish ships no matter how far they travel as long as the waste is loaded in this country.  However, that is not of much benefit to us.  We now have a fisheries zone extending up to 200 miles and, as a result of the Law of the Sea Conference at present taking place, it is more than likely that we will get an economic zone extending much further, possibly <Col N="1411" /> as far as 500 or 600 miles.  It seems rather silly that our influence over dumping at sea should not extend out to the limits of our economic zone or at least as far as the limit of our fisheries zone.</P>
    <P>To put a limit of three miles seems particularly lacking in foresight.  Who is actually doing the monitoring beyond the three miles? What can we do to prevent some foreign industrialist from dumping waste three-and-a-half or four miles off our coast?  This Bill does not do anything to prevent it.  We are depending on other countries who may be negligent in this regard and our experience in the past has been that some countries are extremely negligent.  There are only 12 signatories to the Oslo Convention, and to the London Convention which is worldwide there are only 44 signatories.  Surely there are over 200 countries in the world and hardly more than 30 or 40 of those are landlocked.  Therefore there are obviously 100 or more maritime countries which are not signatories of either of these two conventions.  There can be haphazard and irresponsible dumping off our coast over which we have no control and over which there is no control because it is not taken into account and is not covered by the Oslo Convention or by the London Convention.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is as good as it can be in the circumstances the whole situation is still highly unsatisfactory.  The Minister owes it to the House to circulate each Member with a list of the countries involved so that we can see for ourselves what countries produce nuclear waste and which of those countries have not signed either or both of those conventions. That is very important.  What we are doing at the moment is depending on a Bill of bits and pieces which depends on people's word and on people's honour and if people take shortcuts for financial reasons or for expediency we could well be the victims.</P>
    <P>As the Minister states in the latter part of his statement we are a maritime nation.  We are probably one of the countries most open to abuse by this type of irresponsible dumping.  The likelihood of <Col N="1412" /> abuse is there; otherwise the conventions would not be there and we would not be asked to ratify the conventions and this Bill would not be before us today.  If disposal firms here can dump toxic waste in the streams, rivers and lakes, as has been done in recent months on a large scale, what are the international disposers of waste doing?  We are told by the IDA that some of their waste has to be disposed of abroad.  I am convinced, and it is only commonsense to assume, that there are large quantities of toxic waste being dumped at sea and, likely, being dumped quite close to our shores, That is merely commonsense because it is good economics for the various disposal firms to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have seen press reports as late as two months ago about a ship with highly toxic waste that sailed from Holland and was going to dump somewhere off the Irish coast and were it not for the fact that an international newsagency got hold of this information it is quite likely that that dumping would have taken place without being monitored. This is why I am asking the Minister is he sure that his Department have the precise details of what is being done and where it is being done.  If something happens there will be a national outcry. If there is a case of people being affected by toxic waste which has drifted ashore, or nuclear waste, or people eating contaminated fish and dying or becoming seriously ill then an outcry will occur. That day is approaching.  We must see that every step is taken to prevent any such disaster taking place.</P>
    <P>The natural way to do it and the proper way to monitor what is happening around our coast is to provide a coast guard service.  I have brought this matter up in the House previously.  We are very deficient in regard to protecting our coastline. We have a naval protection service which is an outstanding service and is primarily protecting our fishery limits. But other than that we have no ships or boats whatever available to monitor or examine or observe what is happening. The observation which is going on is taking place on the shoreline.  There is nothing in the Minister's Department.  I would <Col N="1413" /> vouch that there not one craft in the Minister's Department which is doing such surveillance or observation.  So how can we implement the Bill when we are not in a position to enforce the law?  It looks lovely.  The Minister's speech was very fine but in fact it is hardly worth the paper it is written on.  It cannot be effective unless we have some seagoing service which can apprehend the offenders and bring them to justice.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that toxic waste is being dumped indiscriminately around our coast.  If people can do it on land without being observed what are they doing outside? They must be dumping on a vast scale.  I would ask the Minister to let us know what finance he has available, what craft he has available and what trained personnel if any he has available in his Department.  I hope he has personnel available in his Department who can examine this waste as it is being loaded on the quayside.  But I would like to hear the specific details because in answer to a question that I put down here three or four months ago the Ceann Comhairle, who was then the Minister for Defence, told me that under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 not one prosecution had been brought in something like 86 years for not observing regulations aboard ship and the obvious reason is because the personnel are not available in the Department and we have no means of training such personnel.</P>
    <P>This whole aspect of dumping at sea is exteremly important.  It is a matter of grave concern to the public.  We have no means of preventing it because we have not got the personnel or the means or the craft to examine it.  Therefore, how can we apprehend people who are dumping or prevent them from dumping?  Perhaps the Minister would answer some of those questions.  As a matter of information he might tell us whether or not anybody has been prosecuted to date for dumping at sea and whether the existing laws &mdash; which are obviously inadequate &mdash; have been such that they have not enabled his Department to do anything about dumping whether it be half a mile or three-and-a-half miles out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> This Bill can be regarded only as a stop gap approach.  I do not blame the Minister. Obviously he has not got the money to provide the necessary personnel.  If an emergency occurs I do not know what will happen; it will be chaotic.  When the Bantry Bay disaster occurred last year the cleaning up of the oil which had leaked from the hull of the <i>Betelgeuse</i> took months and months.  If a major dumping took place, whether deliberate or accidental, what would we do?  In the case of the Whiddy Bay disaster I was told there was more damage done by the dispersants used to clear up the oil than by the oil itself and that fish life in the greater Bantry Bay area was almost wiped out.  We are not sufficiently experienced in this field.  We have not put enough thought or finance into it.  We have not the trained personnel.  It is bad enough for people to engage in indiscriminate dumping &mdash; whether deliberate or accidental &mdash; but at least we should be prepared to mop it up before it does any serious damage.  Obviously there would be a certain amount of damage done.  I do not feel we are equipped to deal with any such emergency.</P>
    <P>In replying the Minister should tell us what contingency measures his Department have, together with the Defence Forces, local authorities and other bodies for dealing with such emergencies.  For instance in his speech he referred to authorised officers.  Who are these officers, how many of them are there, what training have they got?  Perhaps the Minister can reassure us that there are such people available, that he will get the necessary finance for vessels, dumping monitors, when we would all be quite happy.  The Minister is not such a bad fellow at all.  He is willing but being willing is not sufficient if one has not got the means and we are afraid that the means are not available.</P>

If we have not I should like the Minister present to put pressure on the Minister for Transport to get the means with which this type of dumping can be prohibited.</P>
      <P>There is widespread concern at present that there is indiscriminate dumping of nuclear waste.  We do not seem to know what is happening.  I should like the Minister to spell it out clearly here today.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>: I join Deputy Deasy in welcoming the Bill but with some reservations. We cannot regard this Bill as an absolute cure for dumping but rather as an effort and the Government have shown that they are sincere in tackling this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how effective the provisions of this Bill will be.  We are all well aware of the pollution of our seas and, may I say, our beaches as well.  While we are legislating as a follow-up to the signing of the two conventions it should be said that we need the agreement and co-operation of many other countries.  The Minister has said that there were 44 signatories to the London Convention and 12 in the case of the Oslo Convention.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to inform the House whether or not all the countries signatories to the conventions have introduced legislation in their own parliaments. It is all right to sign conventions but this must be followed up by legislation. Perhaps the Minister would let us know also the names of the various signatories. He mentioned a broad area from north of Gibraltar to Greenland in <Col N="1416" /> respect of one of the conventions but the House should be told exactly what countries have been signatories, secondly, whether or not legislation is needed in those countries and, if so, whether they have introduced such in their own parliaments.</P>
    <P>We are all painfully aware of the effects of the dumping of toxic waste and particularly the spillage of oil over a long period.  The Minister has said that we are subject to this type of illegal dumping because we are an island country.  The inland counties do not have the experience we in the maritime counties have had particularly insofar as our beaches are concerned where the greatest polluter is oil.  Of course there are very many forms of pollution.  Deputy Deasy spent some time talking about toxic waste.  The Minister said there would be an amendment introduced on Committee Stage giving the Minister for Energy responsibility for that type of pollution.  Why that responsibility should be taken from the Minister for Transport I do not know. Perhaps there is a good reason but I should be glad to hear it when he is replying or, alternatively, when we come to the amendment he mentioned.</P>
    <P>I mentioned oil spillage because we in the maritime counties have had particularly bad experiences in this respect.  We have seen fish life damaged, the awful spectacle of very many sea birds lying dead on our beaches or being unable to fly away because they have been enveloped by oil from the sea.  We have seen also the effect of oil spillage on our beaches to the detriment of the tourist industry.  For some reason or another it has not been as bad in the south east in recent years, but there still remains an element of it which tends to turn people away from such beaches.  Also there is the effect of oil spillage on seaweed and on fish and bird life.  If this Bill does something to prevent that sort of pollution of our beaches it will have been worth while.  The Government would not have the facilities or the scope to put an end to it entirely.  This can be done only by effective co-operation between all countries and not necessarily just those <Col N="1417" /> signatories to the London and Oslo conventions.</P>
    <P>What about the dumping of nuclear waste?  In response to what Deputy Deasy said the Minister must tell us the extent, if any, of the dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.  This is a very emotive question not alone here but all over the world.  In regard to the granting of permits, what will be the attitude of the Minister for Energy?  Will permits be given for the dumping of waste, not alone in the Irish Sea but in the Atlantic, North Sea and so forth?  We do not oppose the Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as section 1, the definition section, is concerned, could the Minister define &ldquo;prohibited substances&rdquo;?  He has told us that a list of these is contained in annex I to the Oslo Convention.  We have no details of these prohibited substances, the main ones being oil spillage and toxic waste.  There are, however, other causes of pollution of our coastline.  Certainly on the south-east coast there are many forms of pollution, particularly refuse from ships.  I do not suggest that we can cure this by legislation but our beaches are despoiled by plastic bags and plastic papers dumped from ships and making our seasides very ugly.  This is, indeed, another form of pollution.  Is the definition &ldquo;prohibited substances&rdquo; confined to certain substances or does it relate to every substance dumped by, in the main, ships at sea?</P>
    <P>In section 2 (a), concerning restriction on dumping at sea, the Minister must tell us something about our territorial seas. These can be within three miles, six miles and 50 miles of the coast, according to which Government are in and who wants to outdo the other.  Deputy Deasy has suggested three miles as the territorial area so far as Ireland is concerned.  How about other signatories to the convention? Have they the same limit to their territorial waters?</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b), which deals with dumping outside territorial seas, states that if such dumping has been committed outside the territorial seas by an Irish ship or other type of conveyor, the Irish authorities can apprehend and prosecute. Deputy Deasy went into this point in <Col N="1418" /> great detail so I shall not pursue the subject to any great length, but what happens where dumping is committed outside territorial waters?  I do not suggest that we could police the mid-Atlantic, Pacific of other great oceans of the world, but I support Deputy Deasy's allegation that the greatest amount of dumping occurs beyond the territorial seas of this and many other countries.  How are the people illegally dumping to be identified and apprehended?  This would be impossible by way of our present protection for our fisheries.  There is no policing of the open seas, which would be a fairly impossible task.</P>
    <P>Even as regards illegal dumping in our territorial waters, how can we police that area?  Many Deputies have complained about this and the Minister now present remembers discussions and questions in this House as to the effectiveness or otherwise of the Irish Navy in protecting our fisheries.  The plain fact is that we cannot protect them to the extent which we would like, by reason of financial limitations and limitations on the provision of boats.  We will find it fairly impossible to guard against illegal dumping in our territorial waters, not being able to do half the job, let alone the complete job. I am quite sure the Government have no intention at present of increasing the strength of our Navy but very many more protection vessels would be needed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) defines defences for persons charged with dumping.  In paragraph (a) it would be a defence if the dumping were done on the instructions of employers. I would presume in that case that the employer would be prosecuted.  However, it did not appear from my reading of the Bill that the employer who had given the instruction would be prosecuted where it was alleged that there was dumping of prohibited substances.  In paragraph (b), reasonably enough, a defence would be if the dumping were done through error or accident.  Who is to prove that fact, I do not know; probably it would be the courts at which the offender might be charged.  Another defence given is if the captain of a ship had a permit to dump.  A very small point on paragraph (d) in regard to the defence <Col N="1419" /> where a prohibited substance is dumped for the safety of a vessel or life.  There is an addendum that such dumping must be reported to the Minister within seven days.  It may not be possible, for example, for a stranded boat to report within seven days.  The Minister might put down an amendment changing &ldquo;within seven days&rdquo; to &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fairly important section 3 concerns the issue of permits and I have no objections to the proposals in section 3.  It is quite logical and sensible that the Minister, before he issue a permit, should consult with other Ministers concerned; the Ministers for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, for Fisheries, for Energy, for the Environment, particularly the latter. All these Ministers should be consulted before a permit is issued.  It appears from the Bill that permits will not be given lightly.  Many conditions and qualifications must be met before a permit may be given by the Minister for Transport. The applicant must specify the type of vessel, aircraft or marine structure involved, the type of substance involved, the quantity, the specified place and the specified time.  These are good safeguards against the granting of a permit to someone engaged in illegal dumping contrary to the London and Oslo conventions.  The Bill says that, as far as permits are concerned, consideration must be given to the annexes in these two conventions, which are set out in the Bill itself.  I am satisfied that these permits will not be granted without full consideration of all the conditions involved.  It is reasonable that the applicant should pay a fee for the permit, and also for any test or investigation.</P>
    <P>I return to the subject of nuclear waste and ask the Minister to ensure that no permits will be granted to those who wish to dump toxic waste particularly into the Irish Sea, but also into our seas on the west or south coasts.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the appointment of authorised officers.  These can be officers appointed by the Minister for Transport, a harbour master, somebody nominated by the Office of Public Works or somebody nominated by CIE.  Will the <Col N="1420" /> Minister go into more detail as to the functions of these officers?  I feel they will be restricted and that they can only operate from the land.  What is the position if information is received that somebody is dumping oil or toxic waste even within three miles of the State?  The officers have certain powers with which I agree in relation to searching a boat on landing and so on, but there in no provision to arrest anybody outside or within the three-mile limit.  As far as I can see they can interview those who are accused of dumping only when the vessel comes back to port. They cannot investigate on the high seas because they have no way of getting out. If there is dumping it would take a while to notify the navy and arrange transport even to within three miles of our coast. Their functions are confined to the land and what they can do, being land bound, I cannot imagine.</P>
    <P>Section 5 and 6 deal with proceedings against offenders, the collection of fines and so on.  There is nothing objectionable in that.  Section 8 deals with penalties. The penalty of a maximum of £500 is too small when one considers the damage that could be done to a single beach, to bird life, to fish life and to seaweed.  The provision for a five-year term of imprisonment is a little more reasonable but there is no relationship between £500 and five years in gaol.  The fine should be about £50,000.</P>
    <P>Section 9 suggests that the Bill should not apply to a State ship or aircraft.  I presume that is the navy or the airforce. Why does it not apply to them?  I have the greatest respect for these institutions but the people in charge of boats and so on are not angels and why they should be exempted I cannot imagine.  I trust the Minister will find himself in a position to answer some of my queries when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support my colleagues, Deputy Deasy and Deputy Corish.  This Bill is timely but I am disappointed at its obvious limitation which will probably make it ineffectual.  I am principally concerned about the dumping of nuclear waste but many types of toxic waste are presently being dumped.  These seem to <Col N="1421" /> be increasing in quantity and degenerating in quality and this Bill will be ineffective in coping with them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the dumping of nuclear waste a serious situation exists in the Irish sea where it has been proved that there is a high element of radioactivity in the fish life because of the Windscale Plant on the coast of Cumbria.  There is a constant leakage of radioactivity into the Irish sea and this saucer-shaped sea is unable to disgorge this dangerous effluent throughout the oceans of the world.  This means that inevitably there is a concentration of radioactivity in the fish life particularly off the East coast. That should not be tolerated by the Government. I am further alarmed by the recently announced programme of proliferation of nuclear energy plants by the British Government&mdash;up to 30 in all.  The reprocessing of the waste from these plants will take place at Windscale.  At the Windscale plant there is a leak which cannot be contained and it has been leaking consistently for the last two-and-a-half years.  That does not augur well for the ability of an independent small country like ourselves to manage our ecological and environmental sovereignty.  This Bill will have no impact on that type of thing because it is clearly designed for individual ship managers or owners who might take the occasional run on dumping wastes in the sea.  In reply to a parliamentary question the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, in the Official Report of 17 July 1979, at column 2623, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contamination of fish results from the discharge of liquid low radioactive effluents from the Windscale Works and is most noticeable in the vicinity of Windscale.  It has been estimated that a small number of people eating the fish caught in the area of Windscale might receive a radiation exposure of about 30 per cent of the dose limit established by the International Commission for Radiological Protection for members of the public and adopted in the EEC Directive on the health protection of members of the public and workers against ionizing radiation and <Col N="1422" /> in corresponding UK regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister then added some details about the whole question of the method of disposal of solidified low level waste in the deep sea and so on.  I do not consider that an acceptable practice but for the purposes of discussion I will allow it as acceptable to dump these wastes in the seas.  I put it to the Minister that this country has been deliberately chosen by the Governments of the continent as the dumping grounds of Europe.  I refer particularly to an area off the south-west coast of Ireland where there is a disposal site some 370 miles south-west of Ireland, about 280 miles outside the continental shelf and where the depth of water is allegedly 2.8 miles.  Of course we have the usual bland assurances from the Nuclear Energy Board, about which I have deep reservations, that that is not a matter for concern.  Anybody who knows even a little about the tidal currents off our coasts will realise that there are dangers from continued dumping of nuclear waste even if they are contained in concrete vaults.  I do not see any reason why we should accept the nuclear wastes from other countries.  I know of the problems being experienced by the nuclear energy industry in countries like France where there appears to be a cavalier approach to nuclear generation and where serious problems have occurred in some of the plants and in countries like Germany in trying to store the wastes and where the massive output of dangerous and toxic wastes is simply not being dealt with. Many people feel that if this whole area is to be safe it is not economic and if it is economic it is not safe.  This Bill allows us an opportunity to do something concrete about this and to try to stop the utilisation of our coasts and off-shore waters-a fundamentally important natural resource for a country like ours which needs it badly&mdash;in this way.  I do not accept that that should be tolerated and I hope the Government adopt a similar attitude.  That has not been evident so far.  A former Minister for Tourism and Transport accepted with, metaphorically speaking, a gun to his head, a dictate from the British Government that a cargo <Col N="1423" /> vessel which was foundering should be dumped off the south-east coast.  On that occasion inevitably there was spillage as we all expected.</P>
    <P>It appears that we are too ready to accept that kind of treatment and it is time we stood up to it.  We deserve better and we should not tolerate it any longer. We need the kind of spirit which motivated the Icelandic fishermen in defence of their natural resources.  That type of spirit should permeate the Government backbenches.  Unfortunately, all the evidence&mdash;particularly the instantaneous sell out of the 50-mile limit&mdash;is to the contrary.  It is not too late to appeal to the Government to adopt all possible measures here and at European level to ensure that we are no longer seen as a safe dumping ground for the trash of industry and commerce of Europe.</P>
    <P>I would be heartened in my view that the Bill was meant to be effective if section 2(2) was either removed or amended.  That subsection states that it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under the section to prove that the act constituting the offence was carried out by him in pursuance of instructions given to him by his employer. That evocative phrase has been utilised by many over the years for getting out of the most heinous crimes.  I do not accept that anybody has the responsibility to pass off to somebody else the moral or statutory responsibility for conforming with the law.  It is a very unsound principle. More alarmingly, the subsection states that it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence to prove that the commission of the offence was due to a mistake or to the act or default of another person or to an accident or some other cause beyond his control and that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence by himself or any person under his control. That catch-all clause allows an easy way out.  I do not know how anybody can be convicted assuming, as has been pointed out, that they can be apprehended.  I wonder how offenders will be apprehended. Will the growing use by Government <Col N="1424" /> of helicopters be expanded? Assuming that the Government can devise a proper system of detection and apprehension the section is too anaemic and bows the knee too much to obvious pressures on the Government to ease off in this way.</P>
    <P>There should not be any opportunity for people to get out of their responsibility by pleading a mistake, by pleading a directive from an employer or that some other person was responsible.  Those aspects of law could, in the normal course of events, be taken into account in assessing the degree of guilt.  There should not be a basis for eluding completely the impact and intended scope of the Bill. The inclusion of those aspects in my view makes the Bill somewhat redundant.  I wish the Bill every success.  Is the Minister open to receiving the amendments mentioned during the course of the debate?  There is a natural desire and concern that the waters off our coast&mdash;some sort of co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland would be needed in this regard&mdash;should be protected effectively.  There is a serious and unique difficulty in view of tidal and current patterns which in some cases would mean that if dumping takes place even some hundreds of miles off our coast our people would suffer.  I do not know to what extent we can ensure that dumping is limited to the minimum degree but the craven and cowardly approach we have adopted up to now in accepting whatever flows in with the tide is an indication of an attitude that is most unhelpful to the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister should put backbone into this Bill to make it meaningful.  He should provide the staff to monitor it and give them the resources they need.  He should ensure that our seas do not become like others have, dead seas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to thank Deputies Deasy, Corish and Keating for their contributions.  It is heartening to know that they welcomed the provisions of the Bill as a serious step by the Government to deal with a matter which has been a cause of considerable concern. <Col N="1425" /> The Deputies may rest assured that it is the view of the Government that there is a need to deal with this matter now.  It is hoped that the Bill will prove a worthwhile vehicle and give a good return as far as control is concerned.  No Bill has been passed that does not have weaknesses, inherent or supposed, but this legislation is a conscious effort by the Department to cover all known possibilities as far as dumping is concerned.  I join with Opposition Deputies in announcing to all and sundry that it is the desire of the Government to do something worthwhile to control dumping.  At present there is not a significant danger as far as we are concerned but it is because dumping is increasing that we have introduced this legislation.  We are prepared before any real damage is done to the environment.</P>
      <P>It is heartening to know that those who contributed are concerned about the environment, our fish stock and pollution. Deputy Deasy had some reservations about the ability of the Government to implement the provisions of the Bill. One may be inclined to think that there are weaknesses but I shall endeavour to indicate to the Deputy that all the matters he is concerned about are covered.  I will make available to the Deputy copies of the conventions which may help to dispel any fears he has.  The Deputy was concerned about the source of toxic waste, pointing out that it came from foreign countries.  We have not got a great deal of toxic waste.  The tonnage from our industries is reasonably limited and most of the toxic waste dumped outside our territorial waters is the result of operations in other countries.  It is increasing here because of new technologies and new industries.  Fundamentally that is why this Bill is introduced at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 12 signatory countries to the Oslo Convention and 44 to the London Convention.  The 12 cover all the EEC countries except Ireland, and Ireland will be included when this Bill is enacted.  The other outstanding ones are Finland, Iceland and Spain who will be included in the 12.  I have a list of the 44 countries and they include all the major <Col N="1426" /> industrialised countries of the world and all the maritime nations.  I accept that every nation in the world is not included. I intend to ask the Department to provide Deputies with a list of the 44 countries to give them an idea of the global cover the 44 signatories give to that convention.  As Deputies know, the London Convention covers all the seas of the world, whereas the Oslo Convention has the limiting factor of excluding the Mediterranean.  By and large, it covers all the other seas from Gibraltar to Greenland and all the EEC countries are involved in and are actively promoting the convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.  A question was asked about dumping far out at sea and whether we had any way of controlling that.  A question was also asked about the officers and their technical competence and whether they would be available to deal with this type of situation.  Apart from the officers of the Department of Transport we have the assistance of the technical experts in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  We will have experts available to us from all the Departments I have listed and they will have to be consulted before any licences will be granted, including the Nuclear Energy Board.  They will provide excellent monitoring cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major matter raised by the three speakers was the nuclear energy situation. Many questions dealing with nuclear waste disposal included in this Bill will be the subject of major amendments on Committee Stage.  I feel I should take this opportunity to refer to it briefly because Deputies referred to nuclear waste.  This is a matter of considerable concern to us as a maritime nation and a close neighbour of a nuclear power state.  Deputy Keating is quite right in saying that the major dumping site is <Col N="1427" /> about 370 miles off Mizen Head.  It is important to understand that all nuclear waste disposal is very tightly controlled internationally.  That site is in an area of about 2.8 miles of water depth.  It is interesting to note that that site is equidistant from Ireland, France, Spain and Britain and in a very suitable location according to the international experts.</P>
    <P>The top layer of water to a depth of about 360 feet has a mixing situation applied to it.  There is no mix below that. It is in an area below a considerable shelf which drops from a much higher level to the 2.8 miles.  A considerable amount of time and expertise was devoted to picking that site.  I am not saying it should continue to be the site for all time for the disposal of nuclear waste.  At present for solidified nuclear waste disposal &mdash; and that is the only kind that can be dumped there under very stringent regulations &mdash; technically it is the best available.</P>
    <P>There is regular monitoring of the site. I can understand the suggestion that it is cheaper to dump nearer than that particular site.  I presume every mile out into the ocean makes it more expensive to dump because dumping at sea is the most expensive way of dumping any kind of waste.  Every single dumping ship at that site has on board a regulating officer from the regulating body.  The characteristics of the canisters used are put through the most rigid tests before they are utilised, and there is regular monitoring of the floor of the ocean at that level to see if there has been any shift or movement of the existing waste in the area.  To date the answer has been no.  As I say, that site is used only for solidified nuclear waste disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is any member of the Irish Government associated with that monitoring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.  One of our officers has been on the ships on a rota basis.  All dumpings of that kind of waste in that site are notified to the Department well in advance.  The dumping to which Deputy Deasy referred was known to the Department six weeks before it appeared in the press.  The co-operation is so close <Col N="1428" /> on the question of nuclear waste disposal that the Department were aware of it long before it appeared in the press.  It is important to remember that low-level radioactive waste can be dumped there but high level radioactive waste may not be dumped there and, in fact, may not be dumped at sea at all, and is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister sure of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is the only kind allowed under the international regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister said &ldquo;is not&rdquo;.  Is he talking about what should or should not be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am talking about the law as it exists and as it is applied internationally. High level radioactive waste is not dumped at sea, and low level solidified waste is.  Somebody mentioned the Irish Sea as a location for this kind of dumping.  No radioactive waste can be dumped in water less than 4,000 metres deep.  The Irish Sea has not got a water level of anything like that and consequently it is not acceptable as a location for dumping low level radioactive waste in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about Windscale and what happens there.  The discharge from Windscale does not come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is the point we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Disposals at sea from land based sources are covered by a different set of regulations under a different convention.  The Nuclear Energy Board in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry monitor disposal conditions in the Irish Sea.  I can assure Deputies that discharges into the Irish Sea do not represent a hazard according to the best technical advice, and it is important that our people understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1429" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is there more radioactive discharge in that area than off the Minister's county?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand that a study has been carried out in all these areas and the level of radioactive pollution does not reach anything above the acceptable standards.  The best advice states that there is not a health hazard because of discharges.  It is important to remember that the most stringent regulations are applied by the IAEA.  The dumping of solidified low level radioactive waste in the Atlantic is under the multilateral consultation and surveillance mechanism which was established by the IAEA to look after these things.  There are 18 signatories to the convention and Ireland is involved in the mechanism which controls the release of certain ships for that kind of dumping.  The whole thing is monitored very closely.</P>
      <P>Getting away altogether from the nuclear thing, how can we monitor the dumping of other kinds of waste?  We have power to put appliances on ships used for such disposal to enable us to track them.  They are trackable no matter where they go.  However, we should remember that this method of disposal of such waste is very expensive and it is not being used except where necessary because of its sophistication and its cost. It is not done in a haphazard way.  The licences are carefully scrutinised and all the regulations under the international convention are applied to the issuing of permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: How do you track those ships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will come to that in a moment and I will then deal with any other questions Deputies may put.  We are trying to cover every aspect of dumping. The issuing of these permits can be co-ordinated.  Deputy Corish mentioned the three miles.  We have power only in regard to the seas in our jurisdiction, our territorial waters, and this Bill covers all aircraft, ships, platforms carrying the Irish flag whether inside our territorial waters or on the high seas outside.  Offences <Col N="1430" /> committed outside or inside our jurisdiction can be subject to prosecution. The Bill gives wide ranging powers within the Constitution.  Our jurisdiction includes tidal waters and estuaries.  These provisions apply in other countries.  The best way to have effective control is to have as many countries as possible ratifying the convention.  We are in constant consultation with countries involved in this and consequently signatories to the convention are aware of every ship dumping in the locations referred to.  I am satisfied there is excellent international co-operation as far as notification of dumping or proposed dumping is concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish mentioned one or two cases of licences issued in this country.  It is right that people should be made aware that any dumping at present being undertaken here is done under licence issued by the Departments of Fisheries, and Forestry, Transport and so forth.  Therefore, the issuing of such licences is controlled stringently.</P>
      <P>It has been said that there is some dumping in the Shannon Estuary, off Roche's Point in Cork, off County Wexford. Certain types of caustic waste dumping were mentioned in connection with the Irish Mining Company, about 35 miles out.  There has been sewage sludge disposal by Dublin Corporation.  Apart from dredging and sewage disposal there are no other dumping authorisations in this country.  Even though there is not a great amount of this type of waste disposal emanating from this country, I thought it might be on the increase because of increased industrialisation and so forth.  Because we had not ratified the convention, it occurred to me that other countries might take the opportunity, as Deputies Keating and Corish suggested, to use Ireland for dumping matter which they would not like to dump off their own shores.  That is why the Bill is necessary, and I was glad to see the general welcome for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is our first step to control the situation so that we will not have Ireland used as suggested by Deputy Keating.  I refute Deputy Keating's suggestion that there has been wholesale dumping off the <Col N="1431" /> Irish coast.  The dumping now being done is under strict licence issued under the Local Government (Confirmation of Order) Act, under other Local Government Acts and under section 71 of the Fisheries Conservation Act.  They are the two instruments used to license dumping off our shores.  However, in case there should be trans-shipment, changing of loads at sea from one ship to another to evade the provisions of existing regulations, this Bill became necessary.  If there are methods which might be used to evade these regulations Deputies are free to make suggestions to me so that we can get unanimity in putting on the Statute Book a provision that will be of benefit to the nation.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about dispersants and their use and I have some sympathy with that point of view.  It is the lesser of two evils to my mind: there must be some environmental damage if dispersants are widely used to control accidental spills but until technology has been developed to allow some other mopping-up method to be used after serious spills, we cannot completely eliminate environmental damage by dispersants.  With the availability of new forms of pollution control, hopefully we will reach a situation where we will have less damage done to the environment, fish life and tourist potential because of spillages.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to hear Deputy Corish's remark that there has been a slackening off of this.  I take it that it is because of stricter provisions and international concern at the fact that oil pollution has seriously damaged major tourist resorts, beaches, bird life sanctuaries and so on. Thankfully it has not reached any kind of crisis point as far as we are concerned. Any time it has occurred here it has been quickly and efficiently dealt with by agencies under our control.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy's concern about our ability to oversee, control and monitor operations that might take place off our coast.  It is interesting to note that the National Board for Science and Technology have a vessel called <i>Lough Beltra</i> which they use for monitoring Irish dumping sites.  In instances where wastes <Col N="1432" /> are loaded, moved through our waters or from our shores or in our ports that vessel is used by the Department of Fisheries for monitoring this.  It is available to do that whether it is within the three-mile limit or outside of it.  A new vessel is being built by the Department of Fisheries and it will extend the range of the Department's operations.  The Department have a major involvement in this question.</P>
    <P>As far as the nuclear element is concerned the Department of Energy and the Department of the Environment are involved.  It was in recognition of this fact that under the Bill, licences can only be issued after consultation with these people, so that we will have a global outlook on it and have the advice of all the experts before a permit is granted.  By having that close examination and monitoring we will be in a position to categorically state what was dumped, where it came from and what the extent of the monitoring was, so that we will have a better situation as the Bill becomes effective.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we should divorce our minds from the matter of radioactivity because that is, by and large, the responsibility of the Nuclear Energy Board and the Minister for Energy.  It is the subject of very strict controls in legislation under the Minister for Energy and consequently it is not necessary to have duplication here.  Apart from that the Department of Fisheries have staff at the fisheries research centre and they monitor all the licences granted, to which Deputy Corish and I referred earlier. They also pay considerable attention to sewage disposal licences and the authorisation granted to Dublin Corporation for disposal locally.  There are five senior technical experts in the Department and they provide the cover as far as the Department are concerned.  The Department of Transport have experts concerned with marine work and so on.  The Department of Energy have their experts apart from the specialists attached to the Department of the Environment.  There is a fair complement of specialised trained technical staff available.  Subsequent to the passage of the Bill if there is an increase in the amount of waste being <Col N="1433" /> loaded or disposed of inside or outside our territorial waters and if there is need for further staff to be recruited or trained to deal with permits and applications for licences, the Department will not be found wanting.  I give that assurance to the House.</P>
    <P>Anxiety was expressed concerning notification of dumping licences applied for at international level.  All dumping operations under the Oslo Convention have to be notified to all countries.  All member states are briefed, irrespective of where the dumping is carried out.  We are fully aware of this at all times.  I agree with Deputy Deasy that this is an area where there must be international co-operation. The most sophisticated methods of tracking and monitoring are necessary. We must provide other countries with that kind of information, just as they must reciprocate as far as we are concerned. It is like that at present.  We fully endorse all the measures of the convention and attend commissions set up to improve regulatory situations.  I would welcome the support of the House as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>Is there a grey area here?  Perhaps there is.  The ocean is a vast place, but at present every effort is being made by specialists and by consultation between member states.  One cannot dump unless one has an authorised docket from a member state on board for each individual dumping.  Very strict regulations have to be complied with, involving weather conditions, characteristics of the containers and so on.  It involves a considerable amount of documentation in the Department.  The dumping of dangerous wastes requires notification to the commission under the Oslo Convention.  It is interesting to note &mdash; and this is fundamental to the proper working of the whole system &mdash; that the commission controlling these operations notifies the member states and has to have the approval of them all.  If someone decides to dump toxic wastes in some part of the ocean they cannot do so and disregard the wishes of the other member states. There is co-operation at a high international <Col N="1434" /> level as far as this type of dumping is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish wanted a clear indication of the extent of the Oslo Convention so far as it applied to particular seas under its control.  Subsequent to the Oslo Convention the London Convention decided to make it worldwide, and if that had not been done there would have been an obvious loophole.  The various signatories can control all the plant and life in their seas.  All the north-east Atlantic countries have signed the Oslo Convention and ratified it except for the eastern European countries of the Baltic.  Even though they are not signatories they have a separate convention of their own.  All the European countries have signed the London Convention and that covers all the oceans, aircraft, platforms, shipping and any other instrument or situation that might arise under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Are there any basic differences between the Oslo Convention and the London Convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, there are.  Because Deputy Deasy raised the question a number of times during his speech I am going to take the liberty of providing him with a copy of the reports of both the Oslo and London Conventions and any information that he might require to satisfy himself about the extensions and limitations of the Bill.  These will be given most graciously by the Department to him.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking the two conventions are the same but there are some small differences in regard to limitations and type of waste.  As far as we are concerned these differences would not be significant in the application of either except that the London one gives the greater cover.  At any rate we are signatories to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by Deputy Corish's sincerity and I hope that the Bill will put aside any misgivings he might have as to the effectiveness it might have in dealing with all kinds of dumping.  He referred to the question of taking some power away from the Department of Transport and hiving it off to the Department of Energy. That is not so.  Our powers under this Bill <Col N="1435" /> are total except that under existing legislation there is a certain amount of overlap in so far as the Department of Energy are concerned.  Rather than have a duality of responsibility we decided that the best thing to do would be to transfer responsibility for certain types of waste, such as nuclear waste, to the Department of Energy who would be the proper body to deal with them.  That is the subject of the major amendment put down.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to Annex I and I will take the opportunity of giving him a copy of the documentation referred to in the Bill.</P>

      <P>: There is legislation which gives these powers as far as pollution is concerned to Ministers other than the Minister for Transport.  The Deputy will notice that oil is not of major significance in this Bill because it is covered by other legislation attached to other Departments. However, there was an area dealing with waste other than oil and nuclear waste which could in effect provide a loophole allowing this kind of dumping to go on.  The reason for this Bill, to use the phraseology and terminology used by the Deputy, is to plug the holes as we see them.  Annex I referred to by the Deputy is the black list under the convention and that black list includes a number of different substances which cannot be dumped in the sea at all under any circumstances except in the gravest situation, and I cannot imagine offhand the type of situation that might demand that people would be released from that except under the gravest circumstances where life might be threatened.  Annex II is the grey list which refers to the special licence and low-level radioactive nuclear waste in a solidified state.  Annex III deals generally with the characteristics of the waste, containers and mobilisation of efforts to dispose of the waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> Reservations were expressed on the question of the seven days.  I appreciate that it is a short period.  Nevertheless, because all dumping of a significant nature has to be done under permit and because all the member states must be aware of those conditions, a ship, not just plying for trade but one which would be under the surveillance of a number of international bodies and of particular concern, an isolated ship doing a certain job with an authorised officer on board and under surveillance by special technological systems used to track it, if it were lost or foundered there would be reason to expect that it would be reported in not just seven days but in seven hours or maybe seven minutes.  The Deputy might reconsider his suggestion in that the seven days is more than adequate in that regard, If certain matters have to be attended to or if they have to dispose of certain waste because of adverse circumstances where there was a danger of loss of life and so on, seven days would be adequate time to allow the master to fulfil his obligations under the Bill.  We have not had any experience of that yet and I think that a period of seven days is adequate.</P>
    <P>The first licences were granted about 1975 and over the five-year period the system has worked very satisfactorily. We have not had any major difficulty. That is not to presuppose that in the future difficulties will not arise, but the experience to date has been very satisfactory and dumping has not been operated or attempted nearer to what the licence demanded.  Whether such a situation arises or not, the Bill is strong enough to support the view that we can deal effectively with anybody who might try to short-change us in that regard.  With regard to penalties, by international standards or present-day monetary values the suggestion might be authentic.</P>

I do not suppose that £500 or £5,000 is necessarily the way to deal effectively with this.  The officer has the right to go in, inspect, retain, hold up, to do what he likes, if he suspects that an evil might be perpetrated, apart altogether from the fact that it has happened.  It has been the experience in other situations where the Navy were concerned in bringing people to heel that the question of the ship, the gear and so on has been the major deterrent. Generally speaking the prosecution, procedures and penalties as laid down in the Bill are effective.  We have to take a figure and I suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke about fish life in the Irish Sea and that is a matter of continuing concern to everybody in that it is one of the major fishing grounds. However, I am advised reliably that nothing that has emanated up to now from the land-based sources is not comprehended by this Bill.  I must emphasise that.  It is the subject of regulation under another authority.  It has not affected fish life nor brought about a health hazard <Col N="1438" /> situation which might be of concern to us at this time.</P>
    <P>I agree that this very important subject must be a matter for continuous monitoring by the Department.  That is why the new vessel is being procured.  It will provide full cover to determine what effects the disposal of this and other kinds of waste will have on our fish stocks and we will be in a position to carry out proper surveys and advise all concerned of the dangers, should they become apparent. At this time that danger does not exist and, hopefully, a situation will never arise where we must move against any installation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to easing off in section 2.  If charged, the person will have to prove his innocence.  Because of the enormous expense attached to disposal at sea, it would not be in the best interests of the people being granted the licence to act in a haphazard way.  They will not get a licence for a lifetime.  That is very important.  We should not be seen to give broad licence cover to carry on <i>ad infinitum</i> in a particular area because, whether it is nuclear waste, toxic waste or any other noxious substance being disposed of, it would be in the best interest of all concerned that the sites be monitored and visited.</P>
    <P>At present a study is being carried out on suitable sites that might be available. Not every site is suitable because of wind direction, tidal movements and so on.  All those aspects have to be examined by the technical experts before deciding what might be a good site for a particular kind of waste disposal.  It is only after the most exhaustive examination has taken place that these matters are attended to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is a technical matter. I was aware that these sophisticated <Col N="1439" /> mechanisms are available.  The Deputy will agree that these are effective means of keeping an eye on operators who do not have an authorised officer on board. There are certain types of operation where an authorised officer from a member state must be on board.  He must take the necessary soundings and tests before dumping can take place.  Only on his signature can this take place and a full report is submitted to all concerned so that we are fully aware of all aspects of the dumping.</P>
      <P>Not all tracking cases which are authorised are permitted by the Irish authorities. A special Decca track plotter is placed on board a ship.  It keeps a continuous log in a graphic form of the movements of the ship by reference to the Decca navigation system.  This is a radio beacon navigational aid and is used by most of the Irish concerned because it has been found to be the most successful.</P>
      <P>It is very important to realise that when a permit is granted for a licence to dump, irrespective of the type of waste involved, certain conditions have to be fulfilled.  If testing is necessary, or if a base line study in the area before the dumping takes place is necessary, that will have to be done and paid for by the person seeking the permit.  We can include as part of a schedule for the granting of a licence that this equipment, or some similar sophisticated technological aid, must be on board before the permit is granted and it will have to be shown to the authorising officer before the permit is finally released.  It is intended, and I hope, that in all cases some type of equipment will have to be installed before the permit is signed by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That cover, coupled with consultations and the international co-operation that has been evident as far as these conventions are concerned, will, in the final analysis, provide us with what I regard as the first comprehensive Bill to deal with a problem which may not be of major proportions at this time but which in an age of advancing technology will be a cause for concern to the Department.  The Opposition might be generous in congratulating us on bringing in legislation <Col N="1440" /> before the horse leaves the stable.  By having this on the Statute Book in advance of any problem that might arise we will be able to deal effectively with it if it arises and, hopefully, there will be no need for public concern at any stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Irish Whiskey Bill, 1980, are explained in the memorandum which was circulated to Deputies on 25 June 1980.</P>
      <P>This short Bill provides that spirits described as Irish whiskey or blended Irish whiskey must comply with certain technical requirements.  It further provides that whiskey and blended whiskey produced either in the state or in Northern Ireland in accordance with these requirements shall be entitled to the description &ldquo;Irish Whiskey&rdquo; and &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo;.  It also provides that the Irish Whiskey Act, 1950, be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Whiskey Act, 1950, protected the &ldquo;good name&rdquo; of Irish whiskey solely for the purposes of customs and excise, that is in connection with permits and certificates issued under the Spirits Act, 1880, accompanying the spirits in transit.  These permits and certificates were designed to ensure the due payment of the duty chargeable on goods and were required to accompany them during removal from one place to another.  Thus <Col N="1441" /> the Act of 1950 ensured that only spirits conforming to the definitions of Irish whiskey and Irish pot still whiskey as laid down in the Act could be described as such in the permits and certificates.  However, the use of these permits and certificates by the Revenue Commissioners has now been discontinued for several years.  In addition, the definitions contained in the 1950 Act are now considered inadequate because they do not make any reference to:</P>
    <P>(a) a distillation strength limit;</P>
    <P>(b) the period of maturation;</P>
    <P>(c) the necessity of having organo-leptic &mdash; that is, taste and smell &mdash; qualities associated with and derived from the raw materials.</P>
    <P>Also, the term &ldquo;Irish pot still whiskey&rdquo; is no longer used in marketing whiskey and there is no definition of blended Irish whiskey.  For these reasons and some added considerations I am promoting this legislation.</P>
    <P>The main added consideration which I have in mind relates to the fact that the only whiskey distillery operating in Northern Ireland is a subsidiary of our main distillery group, namely, Irish Distillers Limited.  That subsidiary market their whiskey under the appellations &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; and &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo; though their use of these appellations is not supported by legislation enacted by the Oireachtas or, until a very recent enactment, by legislation enacted by the UK Government.  This point is of great significance because of new regulations being proposed by the EEC to govern the movement of whiskey within the Community.  Under these proposals whiskey produced in Northern Ireland would not be entitled to be described, as it has been for years, as Irish whiskey or blended Irish whiskey, unless the use of these appellations is based on the legislation of a member state or states.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place between the British authorities and ourselves as to the best way of dealing with the problem which the proposed regulations would otherwise present.  It was considered that <Col N="1442" /> the problem could best be overcome by including in our legislation a provision to the effect that whiskey or blended whiskey produced in the South or in the North would be entitled to the appellations &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; or &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo; and that similar legislative provision be made by the UK Government.  Very recently, the necessary legislation was enacted on the British side and our Bill now proposes to do likewise.  The enactment of this reciprocal legislation is, I should point out, a concrete example of political and economic co-operation about which the Taoiseach spoke in connection with his visit to the British Prime Minister earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is another reason for my being anxious to revise our definition of whiskey.  The EEC Commission have had in mind for some time that whiskey be defined in an EEC context.  The UK Government and ourselves feel that, prior to the discussions at EEC level on such a definition, the traditional manufacturers of whiskey in the Community &mdash; the Scottish and ourselves &mdash; whose production processes are broadly similar, should not only have as strong a definition as possible for whiskey but that both our definitions should be harmonised to the maximum possible extent.  Though Scotch whisky is our main competitor in export markets, it is recognised on both sides that it would be to our mutual advantage to secure a Community definition that is acceptable to us.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is now before the House takes into account all of the foregoing considerations.  Thus the definition of Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey will now be aligned in general terms with the generic definition of whiskey as set out in schedule 7 to the UK Finance Act, 1969, as amended by clause 9 to the UK Finance Act (No. 2) 1980.</P>
    <P>While I do not intend to go into the technical details of this Bill, which I am assured are in order, I should like nonetheless to draw Deputies attention to a few points of general significance.</P>
    <P>I have decided not to provide for a generic definition of whiskey based on <Col N="1443" /> the criteria set out in the recent UK legislation &mdash; the Finance Act (No. 2) 1980, Clause 9 &mdash; because I am advised that such a definition might be regarded by the European Court of Justice as a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction and thus contrary to Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>Although the Irish Whiskey Act, 1950, specifically defined Irish pot still whiskey, I have decided to omit reference to this product in the Irish Whiskey Bill, 1980, as the Irish distilling industry do not at present use this marketing term and do not envisage its use for marketing purposes in future.  It is also relevant that the UK has not legislated for this type of product, and apparently does not intend to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) of the Bill provides that for the purposes of any statute or instrument made under statute, spirits described as Irish whiskey shall not be regarded as corresponding to that description unless those spirits comply with certain requirements.  The objective of this provision is to ensure that Irish whiskey has an identity, backed by legislation, on both the domestic and export markets for any purpose.  Section 1 (2) provides that the expression &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo; shall mean a blend of a number of distillates, each of which separately is entitled to the description &ldquo;Irish Whiskey&rdquo;.  The production of blended whiskies is a feature of modern distilleries; such whiskies are so called to distinguish them from straight whiskies, which are produced from one distillation process.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (3) (a) of the Bill sets out the technical requirements which must be adhered to before a product is entitled to use the appellation &ldquo;Irish Whiskey&rdquo; or &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo;.  These criteria have been settled in agreement and following full consultation with the industry. Deputies will, I am sure, excuse me from explaining in any detail the precise reasons for these particular standards having been set.  In any case I should be loathe to divulge the secrets of the whiskey production process which the Irish whiskey <Col N="1444" /> industry so jealously guards from its competitors.</P>
    <P>As it is considered, for completeness sake, that a requirement about maturation should form an integral part of the legislation, section 1 (3) (b) provides that spirits must be matured for at least three years, either in the state or in Northern Ireland or partly in one and partly in the other before they can be described as Irish whiskey or blended Irish whiskey. It is provided also that the spirits must be matured in wooden casks.</P>
    <P>The Irish whiskey distilling industry is one of the oldest and most valued industries in the country.  Particularly in the past decade, it has grown in importance and has contributed significantly to our economy and to our export trade.  The Irish Distillers Group, the blend &mdash; if I may so term it &mdash; of John Jameson and Son, John Power and Son, Cork Distilleries Company and &ldquo;Old Bushmills&rdquo; has an impressive track record behind it.  For instance, the group now employ more than 1,000 people at their various locations, that is, at the two distilleries in Midleton and Bushmills; at its bottling plants and other offices.  Sales of Irish whiskey rose from £18.8 million in 1970 to £82.3 million in 1979.  Irish whiskey is now exported to more than 100 countries and the volume of this business has risen by 420 per cent between 1970 and 1979, from 207,000 cases to 1,080,000 cases. Indeed we all look to continuing growth in exports of the products of the group as now constituted and organised.</P>
    <P>As the industry considers that its product requires legislative protection so as to give it an identity on both the domestic and international markets, I commend to the House the proposals set out in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: As this is the first occasion on which I have spoken in the House since the Minister of State was reappointed I would like to extend good wishes to him and to wish him success in his Department.  This side of the House welcome the Bill with the exception of some minor reservations which we can discuss at length on Committee Stage. The term &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; cannot be used <Col N="1445" /> in future unless it corresponds with the legal requirements set out in the Bill.  It is necessary to ensure that our whiskey is properly defined, of a proper standard and of proper marketable quality in regard to its export.</P>
      <P>Irish Distillers, whom the Minister mentioned, have a subsidiary in the North of Ireland.  This company cover the whole of this island and it is good to see that in the Bill the term &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; refers to whiskey from the whole island.  I am glad to see that this particular firm have the name Irish Whiskey attached to them.  I know that reciprocal legislation has already been passed giving effect to this.  Problems could be caused if we did not have this Bill and also reciprocal legislation passed.</P>
      <P>Section 1 (3) (b) deals with the maturity of whiskey.  All whiskey distilled here is retained in wooden casks in warehouses for a minimum period of five years before it is let on to the market.  In this Bill we have a period of not less than three years.  I do not think that is wise. The Minister should ensure that a minimum period of five years is set out in the Bill.  I have spoken to people who have taken whiskey which had been distilled for approximately three years.  I believe that such whiskey can be dangerous and is rough whiskey to drink.  The people I have spoken to maintain that because it is a rough whiskey it will put people off drinking it.  It is very important to extend the three-year period in the Bill to a minimum period of five years.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has defined the maturation period.  It was not defined in the Irish Whiskey Act, 1950. I believe the minimum maturation period is in the Immature Spirits Act.  People in the licensed vintners trade to whom I have spoken would like to see the period extended to five years.  The Minister should take this matter up with Irish Distillers. I hope that a satisfactory agreement will be arrived at in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that there will be legislation in relation to this matter coming from the EEC.  It is important, therefore, to have this five-year period inserted in our Bill.  Our exports of whiskey are of great importance to us.  Is the <Col N="1446" /> Minister aware of difficulties which our exports of whiskey are having in relation to advertising?  There were difficulties with regard to our entry into the French market in relation to advertising.  This matter came before the EEC court because Irish whiskey is a cereal based spirit so we had difficulty in advertising it on the French market.  Spirits in France have been categorised into aperitives and digestives.  Our spirits were put into the category of aperitives.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would let us know what the present position is in regard to advertising our product on the French market.  If we cannot advertise our product we will not be able to sell it to the fullest extent. I believe we are agreeable to allowing the French advertise here so I hope that reciprocal arrangements will be made available to us so that we can advertise our products in France.  As far as I know, the EEC Commission decided that we must be allowed to advertise our products fully in France.  I hope the Minister looks into this matter.  It is difficult for our products to gain admission to the French market and I should be glad if the Minister would deal with this fully in his reply.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister of State gave some figures with regard to exports. He said that sales of Irish whiskey rose from £18.8 million to £82 million in 1979. Those figures appear satisfactory but with a more vigorous marketing campaign we could increase our exports.  I have had occasion to visit England, France, Germany and other European countries as well as African countries and I must point out that I found it difficult to obtain Irish whiskey in some of those places, and this applies in particular to the European countries.  There is a market there that could be tapped.  The figures with regard to sales appear satisfactory but with proper marketing we could sell much more in Europe, America and elsewhere. This is an Irish product that is regarded highly throughout the world.</P>
    <P>This legislation will be of considerable benefit but I think every Irish person should be an ambassador for this country when he goes abroad.  Everyone who consumes <Col N="1447" /> alcoholic drink should do his best to promote Irish whiskey.  It is very rare to find a Scottish person drinking Irish whiskey.  That is their choice but I think that, similarly, we should see the advantages of our own products.  Imports of Scotch whisky here are sizeable.  Irish people who go abroad on holiday or on business should make an effort to promote Irish whiskey.  The goodwill is there and it is up to us to make the effort to promote our products.  Irish whiskey is as good a product as there is on the market and it would be to our advantage to improve sales.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (3) refers to spirits distilled at an alcoholic strength of less than 94.8 per cent by volume.  Is this a reference to the product as it comes off the still?  The product will be about 70 per cent proof in the bottle and I should like the Minister's clarification on the figure of 94.8 per cent.  Whiskey would be very potent at that level.  I presume that that figure refers to the product as it comes off the still, at which point it is distilled further and reduced in strength.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill.  As the Minister pointed out, there has been a satisfactory growth in the sales of Irish whiskey since the Irish Distillers group took over.  Our embassies should stock Irish whiskey.  I remember visiting one of our embassies some years ago and practically every drink was available except Irish whiskey. I was disappointed that such a situation should arise in an Irish embassy and that point was made to the authorities there. Our embassies, Córas Trachtála and other organisations should co-operate with the Irish Distillers group to encourage our exports of whiskey.  The sales of this product are important to the economy. With the minor reservations I have made, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>: On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to join with Deputy Enright in accepting the need for this Bill.  I agree with the Minister that the problems that have arisen, particularly with the EEC, require that this measure be passed.  I suppose that none of us here is an expert on the subject of <Col N="1448" /> Irish whiskey; I take a different beverage and I cannot speak with personal knowledge of Irish whiskey.</P>
      <P>As a Member of the European Parliament I have been aware of the ethyl alcohol directive that has been debated for a considerable time.  Agreement has been slow at the European Parliament level.  It demonstrates the problems that occurred on entry to the EEC with the opening of the European Market to whiskey and spirits.  This caused a considerable problem for the original six producers of cognacs, wines and spirits.  There is no doubt that spirits from Ireland and Scotland have made considerable inroads on the Community markets and this has alarmed producers on the Continent. Therefore, every trick in the book is being used to increase the cost of the Irish and Scottish products in the Community. The ethyl alcohol directive certainly had that in mind, making it more difficult to sell wines and spirits.  That is why we have this Bill before us today.</P>
      <P>To make it easier for our exporters we should see that the Bill goes through without hesitation.  I am not in favour of harmonising everything in the EEC and I would not like the Bill to give the impression that the Scottish and Irish whiskies were the same blend.  That would be a mistake because we have a very distinctive market from our Scottish friends in their export drive and the success of Irish marketing can be seen from the figures which the Minister has given&mdash;a 425 per cent increase, from £18.8 million to £82 million in ten short years.  That is a vast improvement in export sales, even allowing for inflation during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister had told us more of the problems in the EEC, particularly under the ethyl alcohol directive, which, I think, is the one which refers specifically to the ingredient in the distilling of whiskey, the problems that were there and how members of the parliament could be briefed on the problem.  In the past we had a gentleman from Irish Distillers who did brief some of us but, since I have not been a member of the agricultural committee which deals with this at European level, I have not seen any documentation <Col N="1449" /> from there.  If there is anything that Members can do, it is the duty of the Government and the producers to see that we are equipped with the facts.</P>
    <P>I would like to see what the rise in the home market sales has been.  We are all aware that there has been a very substantial rise in the consumption of spirits on the home market.  While that may be good for the producer it certainly has not been good for the moral fibre of the community or for the driving public, because there has been a number of accidents caused by too much drinking.  While we may welcome the Bill from the point of view of exports, there is concern about the way the product is being sold on the home market because more young people are drinking spirits.  I hope advertising in this country is tempered so that whiskey is not put forward as a great boost to young people or as being a more manly drink than some other less potent spirit.</P>
    <P>In duty free areas, where sales are very high, whiskey is probably the biggest individual seller.  Indeed, metrication has been accepted at that level but not on the home market.  Whereas we are being advised to adopt metrication, in that area we are still dealing in pints and half pints, in spirits and any liquid except, perhaps, in motor oil.  We have litre bottles at airport exits.  The Minister should ask his colleagues in the Department of Finance, if the export drive is to take place at that point, if he will harmonise the size of the bottle, making it either litres or pints because there are unfortunate people who buy two litre bottles and find they are over the duty limit and have to give one up.  People are embarrassed by this. It is a good export point for us, we should either change the rule in consultation with our European partners or correspond to the actual limits that are allowed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright talked about the embassies abroad.  I have been in many embassies in the last eight years, since I have been a member of the European Parliament, and my experience is that they do produce the home product on every occasion.  I have to say that, because I have visited them in both Canada <Col N="1450" /> and the United States and in various member states and, if it is a sales point, they are most generous in their selling of the product.</P>

      <P>: I want to comment also on Deputy Enright's point about reducing the maturation period to at least three years.  I was in the House on one occasion when the maturation period was reduced from, I think, ten to five years.  Maybe I am wrong, I cannot say definitely, but I do know there was a short Bill brought in to reduce the maturation period on that occasion.  If this is a further reduction, the Deputy is right to comment adversely on it.  On the last occasion export orders were so great because of the long maturation period that stocks were being reduced at such a rate that they could not fill the orders and, therefore, the short cut was to reduce the maturation period which would, in the long run, be an adverse selling point.</P>

We have a good name in this area and we should maintain it.  It would not be maintained if the maturation period is drastically cut.  It also will have another effect because, when the last Bill was brought in, the ten-year-old blend became much more expensive and sold at a far higher rate at home.  I join with Deputy Enright in asking the Minister to take a very close look at what is being suggested in that section.</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright raised the matter of maturation and said that whiskey must be matured for five years, this being traditional in the case of Irish whiskey.  That is not entirely correct.  The Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act. 1969, provides for three years and the present Bill does not concern itself with the age of whiskey but merely provides that spirits must be matured for at least three years in order to be described as Irish whiskey or blended whiskey.  The assumption that it was necessary to mature the whiskey for five years is not altogether correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo; That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the law relating to rape.  The Bill restricts the admissibility of evidence at a rape trial of any sexual experiences of the complainant with men other than the accused and prohibits, as a general rule, the disclosure of the identity of the complainant or of the accused.  The Bill further provides for increased penalties for the offence of indecent assault on females.</P>
      <P>There has in recent years been growing criticism of certain aspects of the present law relating to rape.  Deputies will be aware that a submission on the matter, commissioned by the Council for the Status of Women, was debated in the Seanad in April 1979 and that last June a Private Member's Bill on the subject was presented in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice has stated <Col N="1453" /> on a number of occasions in this House, we have had the question of introducing a Bill on this important matter under consideration for some time.  The need to produce a Bill as quickly as possible was recognised, but an even more important objective was to produce the best solution we could for the complex problems involved.  The central problem, of course, is that on the one hand rape is one of the most reprehensible crimes known to the law and its victims deserving of every protection the law can properly give; but, on the other hand, false allegations of rape are, unfortunately, not unknown and the law must take account of that fact.  It is necessary, therefore, to take both these factors into account and, so to speak, to balance them properly.  I believe that this objective has been achieved in the Bill now before you.</P>
    <P>The Minister welcomed the submission from the Council for the Status of Women.  That submission has been given very careful consideration in the course of the examination of this question.  We have also had the benefit of the views of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and of various people experienced in the practical operation of the law as it stands at present.  The legislative proposals contained in this Bill take account of all those views.</P>
    <P>The definition of a rape offence in section 1 ensures that the provisions of the Bill will apply also in relation to offences such as attempted rape, or aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring rape.  The definition of rape in section 2 uses the phrase &ldquo;sexual intercourse&rdquo; rather than the older phrase &ldquo;carnal knowledge&rdquo;. Both mean the same thing.  Section 63 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, provides that carnal knowledge shall be deemed complete on proof of penetration only, without the need to prove emission of seed, and the effect of subsection (2) of section 1 of the Bill is to continue this rule in relation to &ldquo;sexual intercourse&rdquo;.  Subsection (3) includes a provision preserving the common law rule that a boy under 14 is to be presumed to be incapable of being a principal in an offence involving sexual intercourse. However, a boy under 14 may be convicted <Col N="1454" /> of aiding and abetting a rape, as may a woman.</P>
    <P>May I say at this point that I appreciate that there can be two views on this question of preserving the legal presumption that a boy under 14 is incapable of rape. I suggest, however, that if it were proposed to change the present law on that score, it would be better to include the proposal and debate it in a wider Bill dealing with young persons, or, alternatively, a wider Bill dealing with sexual offences.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the first time in law a statutory definition of rape.  Rape is a common law offence and persons convicted thereof are liable to imprisonment for life.  The intention is not to change the law as to the meaning of rape but only to make it clear what constitutes the offence.  The essence of the offence is that the woman does not consent and that the man either knows that she does not consent or is reckless as to whether she does so or not.  One advantage of putting the definition on a statutory footing is that any popular misconceptions there might be about the nature of that offence will be dispelled, in particular the misconception that the use of force or fraud is a necessary ingredient of the offence.</P>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; in the definition means that the Bill does not propose to change the present law under which a husband cannot be convicted of rape on his wife save in exceptional circumstances. There is some doubt as to the exact scope of the exceptions to this rule, but undoubtedly they include the case in which the husband and wife have been judicially separated.</P>
    <P>Some suggestions have been made that the law should make no distinction at all in this area between people who are married and those who are not.  It has from time to time been alleged that the present rule has been founded on a legal view of women as the property of their husbands. As it happens I am advised that such a view of the law is not sustainable.  Historically, the reason judicially given for the rule was one based on the doctrine of irrevocable consent given at the time of marriage, but it seems likely that even <Col N="1455" /> that was only a &ldquo;formula&rdquo; and that the underlying reason was the recognition of the obvious problems that would be likely to arise if it were possible to bring charges of rape as such as between a married couple.</P>
    <P>But &mdash; and this is what I would like to emphasise &mdash; there is a vast difference between saying that the law does not in the normal course allow a husband to be convicted of the specific crime of rape and saying or implying that the law permits a husband to use violence against his wife in order to force her to have sexual intercourse with him.  No doubt many Deputies will have seen in newspaper articles or letters some rather horrifying stories of this nature &mdash; husbands behaving in outrageously brutal fashion, sometimes before their children.  The difficulty about such allegations is that they tend to be made in a way that implies that there is no legal action that can be taken and this, in turn, can mislead women as to their legal position.  Of course the law permits legal charges to be brought in such cases &mdash; not charges of rape but charges of assault of one kind or another depending on the facts.  And, in the course of any such legal proceedings, evidence of all the facts can be given.</P>
    <P>Whether in any particular case it is in the best interests of the woman or of any children of the marriage that charges of assault should be brought as well as or in preference to reliance on other measures is another matter and one that may depend on many circumstances.  But the impression should not get around that the law is indifferent to the kind of brutal situation that we see portrayed.  It is not. To imply otherwise is misleading and, what is more important, misleading in a way that can have serious consequences for any woman who may be at risk in such a situation.</P>
    <P>There would be some merit in clarifying by statute the precise scope of the exception to the rule that a husband cannot be guilty of rape on his wife if the matter were otherwise free from difficulty. However, the issues involved in this area of the law are much more far-reaching than the relatively straightforward <Col N="1456" /> cases of judicial separations or separation agreements.  Questions would inevitably arise as to cases in which the marriage had been annulled under Church law and not under the civil law and also cases in which there was a barring order &mdash; though such an order might be of temporary duration only.  Cases involving desertion and actual separation by mutual consent without legal formality would also have to be considered.  Moreover, to enact a provision with defined exceptions would prevent a further development of the law except by statutory intervention.  Any attempt to legislate in this area would be likely to give rise to serious difficulty and we considered that, pending further study, the best course would be to make no provision in the Bill on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women recommended that the definition of rape should be extended so as to include certain particularly obnoxious forms of indecent assault not amounting to rape at present.  While that recommendation has not been accepted in the form put, the Bill deals in another, and I believe a more effective way, with the problems which inspired the recommendation.  I shall come back to that later.  For the moment, I will confine myself to saying that we do not think it is desirable to change a well-established meaning of a well-known word.  Moreover, there are good reasons why the law should treat rape as we now understand it as being an offence apart. But, as I say, we recognise the seriousness of the problems that led to the suggestion and we are dealing with them later in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A defence sometimes advanced against a charge of rape is that the man believed that the woman consented to the intercourse &mdash; in other words, that a necessary ingredient of the crime, an intention to have intercourse without her consent, was lacking.  Subsection (2) re-states clearly what the law is in this regard. Following fundamental principles that are applicable generally in the criminal law, it recognises that it is not necessary, for the defence to succeed, that the belief should be based on reasonable grounds but it makes it clear that the presence or <Col N="1457" /> absence of reasonable grounds for the belief is a matter to be taken into account by the jury in deciding whether or not the defence should be accepted.  I think there is advantage in providing a clear re-statement of the law in this matter.</P>
    <P>I should now like to come to what is probably the most important change in the law proposed in this Bill.  One of the main criticisms made of the existing law on rape concerns the rules or the practice under which evidence may be adduced and cross-examination of the complainant permitted in order to show that she has had sexual relations with men other than the accused.  It has been said that the practice is unfair to the woman in that this kind of evidence or cross-examination, while frequently irrelevant, subjects the woman to hardship and trauma and violates the privacy of her personal life; that the woman's denials, even if true, may not be believed by the jury; that it discourages women from reporting cases of rape and that it may confuse juries by diverting their attention from the true issues in the case, namely whether the complainant consented.  The Bill is based on the conviction that there are firm grounds for those complaints.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to recognise that existing practice is open to serious criticism.  It is another matter to find the best solution. The question of the admissibility of evidence as to the complainant's sexual history with men other than the accused has been a matter of considerable difficulty in many other jurisdictions which, in general, have rules of evidence basically similar to our own.  In the United States of America, for example, many of the states have enacted legislation in this field, but adopted widely differing solutions.  These solutions range from almost total exclusion of the evidence in question to those which impose virtually no restrictions on admissibility, leaving it to the judge to be satisfied that the probative value of the evidence exceeds any prejudice likely to be caused to the complainant.  In theory, it is possible to adopt a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; at any point on a range from total exclusion to total admissibility at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with total exclusion, of <Col N="1458" /> course, is that there would be a serious risk of causing grave injustice to the accused and indeed of wrongful conviction. There is no doubt that there could be circumstances in which evidence of the complainant's sexual relations with men other than the accused can be highly relevant to a material issue in the case.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the spectrum, it would be possible to have a law which would simply leave the question of the admissibility of evidence of this kind totally to the discretion of the judge without guidelines.  As there appears to be no such guidelines laid down in any court decision here, such a provision by itself alone and in our circumstances, could involve such little change&mdash;if it involved any&mdash;in the present law that I think it could fairly raise a doubt as to whether it would be worth enacting.  The court already has inherent jurisdiction to exclude evidence which is irrelevant. What is proposed in section 3 is that in any case in which defence counsel wish to adduce evidence or cross-examine as to any previous sexual experience of a complainant with a person other than that accused, an application will have to be made to the judge in the absence of the jury and the judge will only grant such an application if he is satisfied that, in a particular sense set out in the section, it would be unfair to the accused not to do so.  The sense in which the word &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; is used is that, before giving leave, the judge must be satisfied that the effect of allowing the evidence or cross-examination might reasonably be to cause the jury not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty in circumstances where they otherwise might be so satisfied: that is, that it might rationally make the difference between conviction and acquittal.</P>
    <P>The provision, I think, strikes the correct balance between the need to afford protection to the complainant and the need to preserve the accused person's right to a just trial.  The other provisions in section 3 and the provisions in section 4, which deals with preliminary examinations in the District Court, and in section 5, which deals with trials of juveniles, are consequential provisions arising out <Col N="1459" /> of the main provisions.</P>
    <P>An application under section 3 will, as I have indicated, be heard with the jury absent.  Section 6, in addition, will exclude the public while the application is being dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women recommended that applications for the admission of evidence of sexual experience with other men should be heard in the absence of the jury only and did not go so far as to say that they should also be heard in the absence of the public.  We believe, however, that there is an overwhelming case for excluding the public from the court when the judge is hearing such applications.</P>
    <P>To enable the judge to assess the merits of an application it will frequently be necessary for counsel for the accused to indicate in some detail the nature of the evidence he proposes to adduce or the kind and purpose of questions he proposes to put in cross-examination.  Since one of the main reasons for restricting the freedom of the accused to cross-examine or to adduce evidence of this kind is to protect the complainant as far as possible from the ordeal that this would entail&mdash;and indirectly to reduce the risk that this would deter other women from reporting rape&mdash;to allow applications to be heard in public would be inconsistent with this basic objective and would greatly reduce the protection it would afford to complainants.  The exclusion does not in any material way affect the normal right to a public trial, for all that is being adjudicated on in private is whether certain evidence is relevant in the sense I have explained.  If it is not relevant, it should not be open to be heard by the public.  If it is relevant, it will be heard by them in the course of the trial proper.  I would like to make it quite clear that, when I speak of the evidence being or not being relevant, I am not overlooking the fact that in a number of cases we are speaking of allegations or imputations against the complainant that are not only irrelevant but, quite simply, false as well.  That is an added reason for affording protection to the complainant.  Subsection (2) of section <Col N="1460" /> 6 preserves the right of a parent, relative or friend of the complainant or of the accused, if he is under 21, to remain in court while the application is heard.</P>
    <P>The next important provisions of the Bill are sections 7 and 8 which prohibit, subject to exceptions, the publication of any matter likely to lead to the identification of a complainant in a rape case or the identification of the accused unless he is convicted.  While the news media generally refrain from publication of the name and other details likely to disclose the identity of a complainant at present, there has been at least one recent case of failure to do so and women may be in fear of publication in any particular case. We are satisfied that such a prohibition in relation to complainants is desirable in order to protect them against distressful and potentially harmful publicity and section 7 contains the necessary provisions. The point might be made that this protection should not be allowed where a complaint of rape is falsely made.  This would be valid if it were possible to identify such cases in the Bill, but it is not.  It cannot be inferred, merely because there is an acquittal, that the charge is false. There is no way of distinguishing which charges may be false and which have simply not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and so the rule must apply equally to all.</P>
    <P>Having decided to provide protection for all complainants, we considered that, on grounds of fairness alone, the accused, unless and until he is convicted, must also be protected from having his identity published and this is provided for in section 8.</P>
    <P>Both section 7 and section 8 provide grounds for seeking a disclosure of the complainant's or the accused's identity and such an application can be made before or at the trial.  In all cases application must be made to the judge or justice as the case may be and the judge or justice may allow a full or partial disclosure if he is satisfied that such is warranted on the basis of the application made to him.  The grounds on which an application for disclosure can be made are that it is necessary for the purpose of inducing potential witnesses to come forward <Col N="1461" /> to give evidence at the trial and that the conduct of the applicant's defence at the trial is likely to be adversely affected if the application is not granted.  An accused will, also, be able to have the prohibition in relation to his own identity lifted on his own application.</P>
    <P>Subsections (6) to (9) of section 7, which are repeated in section 8 in relation to the anonymity of an accused, specify the person who will be guilty of an offence in the event of a publication or a broadcast in contravention of the provisions of the Act, define &ldquo;a broadcast&rdquo; and a &ldquo;written publication&rdquo; and make consequential provisions.</P>
    <P>In those sections in particular, but also in some other respects, I would like to acknowledge our indebtedness to the text of the corresponding English legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the Act will apply to trials by court-martial.  In this connection I might mention that a trial for rape by court martial will only take place where the offence has been committed during active service.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the problem of there being certain very serious and very obnoxious forms of indecent assault. Under section 6 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment for an indecent assault on a female is two years' imprisonment on a first conviction and five years' on a second or any subsequent conviction.  We considered that, for the very serious and aggravated case of indecent assault, which does not amount to rape, or attempted rape, the existing penalties are clearly inadequate. We have deliberately refrained from attempting to define or describe the kind of offences to which such higher penalties should apply.  It would be impossible to do so satisfactorily and unwise to try. There are far too many possible variations of facts and circumstances.  Instead, section 10 increases to ten years the maximum sentence where the conviction is on indictment.  Of course, even where the trial is on indictment, the imposition of the higher penalty will be at the discretion of the judge, and the reason for the substantial increase in the maximum is to give power to the judge where he is satisfied <Col N="1462" /> that the offence is aggravated by grossly indecent or violent sexual assaults or the causing of severe suffering or humiliation to the victim to impose a penalty commensurate with the crime.  In case anybody should think that we are going a little too far in proposing&mdash;even as a maximum&mdash;that a penalty of up to ten years may be imposed, I would like to place it on record that the Government gave very specific consideration to this matter and they believe that it is right that Parliament should mark its abhorrence of the more aggravated forms of indecent assault by providing for such a penalty.</P>
    <P>The penalty for publishing or broadcasting unauthorised matter in contravention of sections 7 and 8 where there is a conviction on indictment is laid down in section 11.  The maximum penalty is severe and is so designed to enable the Courts to deal with the deliberate flouting of the law in relation to one of the main provisions of the Bill, the anonymity rules in relation to complainants and accused persons.  Section 11 also contains a provision of the usual kind for the liability of directors and other officers of a body corporate in the case of an offence of publishing unauthorised matters.</P>
    <P>Section 12 contains provisions for the summary trial of an offence of indecent assault on a female or of an offence of publishing or broadcasting unauthorised matter.  The consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for either offence to be tried summarily will be necessary.  Neither the offence of rape nor its ancillary offences can be tried summarily.  Finally, section 13 contains the Short Title of the Bill and provides that it shall come into operation one month after it is passed. This section also contains transitional arrangements in relation to trials and preliminary hearings for a rape offence which will have already commenced, and to charges alleging a rape offence, which have been made, before the Act comes into operation.  In relation to an offence of indecent assault on a female the Act will not apply to offences committed before the commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer briefly to a few particular recommendations made by <Col N="1463" /> various groups which we either found to be unacceptable or which would be inappropriate for inclusion in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There was a recommendation that there would always be at least four women and four men on a jury in a trial for rape.  This would create serious problems of principle.  Similar arguments could be adduced for special &ldquo;mixes&rdquo; in juries in many other trials.  Since the Juries Act, 1976, women are equally liable with men to jury service and there are elaborate provisions to ensure that there will be random selection.  Any special provision for a set number of both male and female jurors would be a fundamental interference with the principle of random selection.  The argument in favour of having a minimum number of women jurors is that some defence counsel still object systematically to women jurors in rape cases in the belief that all male juries give an accused a better chance of acquittal. I understand that such an attitude may still prevail in some provincial centres, though, I am told, only in some. Recent experience suggests, however, that male juries are certainly not less disposed to bring in &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; verdicts in rape cases than mixed juries and my information is that this is now accepted as fact in Dublin and in many other areas. I would expect that any remaining tendency to object to women jurors as a matter of course will die out quite soon.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations which have been made refer to the Garda investigations of rape offences.  Various suggestions of a procedural nature in regard to the investigation and to the medical examination have been made.  One sufficient reason why there can be no reference to these matters in the Bill is that these matters do not involve legal provisions. The Garda have detailed instructions providing guidance on how to deal with rape complaints, including an instruction that the complainant's statement should be taken by a ban-gharda where possible and in the great majority of cases this will be possible.  The Garda are also very much aware of the importance of the medical and scientific evidence in a rape case and all members of <Col N="1464" /> the force are instructed on the procedure to be adopted in a rape investigations.  As the complainant can only be medically examined by consent she has always the option of nominating her own doctor for the medical examination, and in practice she will be taken to the local hospital or to the doctor's surgery for the examination. These are matters which the Garda authorities propose to keep under constant review but, as I said, they are not matters that are appropriate for legislation.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has also been made that special forensic kits should be made available in Garda stations for use in the investigation of rape complaints.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that for their part no problems have arisen in this regard and that, in particular, they have not encountered difficulties because of any lack of special equipment either for, or on the part of, doctors who are called in to deal with the medical aspects of these investigations.</P>
    <P>Any idea that the Garda should retain a supply of special equipment for doctors would raise practical problems because, for one thing, the equipment would be required in the vast majority of stations only on very rare occasions.  Nevertheless, I am informed that the Garda are checking out whether certain aspects of the arrangements now in operation might not be improved further, particularly with a view to reducing in any way possible the difficulties which have to be faced by persons making complaints.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women have made recommendations concerning the existing facilities in hospitals for the examination of sexual assault victims and the training of medical personnel in this area.  These are matters which are essentially the concern of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>At present our Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1935 provides that it is a felony to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 years.  Unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl of 15 or 16 years is a misdemeanour.  Consent is not a defence in either case.  The Council for the Status of Women recommended that these ages should be reduced to 13 years, below <Col N="1465" /> which the felony would be committed, and to 16 years below which the misdemeanour would be committed.  We do not accept that any case has been made for reducing these ages.</P>
    <P>The council also recommended that legal aid should be provided towards the cost of representation of rape victims who apply for compensation to the Criminal Injuries Tribunal.  The Criminal Injuries Scheme has, as a matter of principle, been designed to render legal representation unnecessary and, although such representation is permitted, the costs of representation are not awardable.  However great one's sympathy must be for a rape victim, there is really no case for having special rules applicable in the matter of claiming compensation from the Criminal Injuries Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The council also recommended that evidence of the defendant's character should be made admissible at the discretion of the judge if the defendant attacks the character of the complainant or other prosecution witnesses and the main purpose of the attack is directed to their credibility.  The proposal raises important, perhaps even fundamental, considerations as to the rules governing the admissibility of evidence of an accused person's character and it would, in my view, be wrong to change the law in this respect in the case of rape without reference to the position in relation to other crimes and without a much more thorough examination of the general considerations involved in such matters than it has so far been possible to make.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House. Changing the law will not of itself lead to an eradication of the crime of rape.  What we can do by legislation, and what we are endeavouring to do in this Bill, is to remove certain features which may, at present, inhibit rape victims from bringing their complaints to the Garda and thus create a situation where there will be a greater likelihood of rapists being brought to justice.</P>

      <P>: This Bill is a timely one. I am pleased that the Government have introduced a measure which may help, although we have some reservations <Col N="1466" /> about it and would appreciate if the Minister would give earnest consideration to our thoughts, with a view to perhaps amending the Bill in certain respects.</P>
      <P>The act of rape, which appears to be increasing in number and variety of permutations, is a savage violation of one human being by another.  It is surely one of the most repugnant of crimes.  It is obligatory on us all that we do everything possible to ensure that this most primitive and personal violation is not just curbed but eradicated from our society.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his final paragraph said that changing the law will not of itself lead to an eradication of the crime of rape and that all that may be done by legislation, and what he is endeavouring to do in this Bill, is to remove certain features which may at present inhibit rape victims from bringing their complaints to the Garda and thus create a situation where there will be a greater liklihood of rapists being brought to justice. The Bill in that respect is deficient. It assumes that rape is inevitable.  It appears to try to facilitate a greater likelihood of apprehension, but it should be more fundamentally aligned.  It should take perhaps a more compassionate view of the real trauma and real tragedy which this form of crime inflicts and should make a much more fundamental attack on the reasons for rape in a much more determined effort to try to ensure that such offences do not occur in the first place, by analysing the reasons for these crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear to us all that in many cases there is a degree of demented passion about rape.  There are many cases, too&mdash;the majority, according to the statistics&mdash;where the crime of rape is meticulously and carefully planned.  Figures will show, for example, that, in cases of rape involving one man, over half of such cases had been carefully planned and were not just the crime of passion which some might like to interpret rape as regularly being.  Where more than one person is involved and where there is a group of men, as many as 95 per cent of the cases, on the statistics available to us, are clearly carefully and systematically planned.  This is, therefore, a callous <Col N="1467" /> crime and one which needs a strong reaction.</P>
    <P>However, a punitive and repressive reaction in itself, which this Bill to some extent endeavours to put forward, is not adequate.  I honestly believe that we must do much more to try to create in our society a far better development of human relations and of sexual relations and sexual understanding between people.  The way in which we bring up young people in our society and educate them is deficient.  It does not help them to understand the nature of their own sexuality and the nature of the opposite sex.  It allows, inevitably, misunderstandings, alienation, isolation, fear and all the other inhibitions &mdash; psychological and otherwise &mdash; to occur.  I believe that it is often out of that kind of temperament and environment that the context in which rape occurs is created.</P>
    <P>The Bill, and any attempt to deal with this crime, must bear in mind, at least, that it is not merely a question of the size of the penalty, the swiftness of the trial, the admisibility of evidence and so forth. This is a crime which needs attention at its roots and origins.  Although it may not necessarily be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice to concern himself with that area of mature human relations between men and women, married and unmarried, it is, nevertheless, a factor to be considered.</P>
    <P>The number of incidents of rape is clearly on the increase.  We are told that rape is probably the most under-reported crime.  Accordingly, any statistics which one would utter would clearly be on the conservative side, although there are also allegations that there is a degree of over reporting by people who are willingly engaging in sexual acts but who are apprehended by third parties and may therefore report a rape which has not in fact taken place.  The overwhelming burden of evidence is that the figures one has are extremely conservative.  Those figures are significant.  I pay tribute to the Rape Crisis Centre which has been pioneering work in this area and which has almost been a lone voice in seeking <Col N="1468" /> reforms and progress and in actually working with the women who are the unfortunate victims in this case.</P>

      <P>: I was talking about the difficulty experienced in getting this debate on such a very important subject, its meaning in our society and the apparently great fear there is amongst all parties of discussing subjects of this kind which appear to involve questioning the position of the Roman Catholic Church in our society.  I was deeply shocked by the categorical refusal of the Government even to consider the desirability of establishing some kind of discussion group on whether there was a need for divorce, which there undoubtedly is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1967 it was agreed to set up an all-party committee which would make recommendations. Their recommendations at paragraph 126 are that it can be argued that the existing Constitutional provision <Col N="1470" /> is coercive in relation to all persons. Catholic and non-Catholic, whose religious rules do not absolutely prohibit divorce in all circumstances, that it is unnecessarily harsh and rigid and could in their view be regarded as being at variance with the accepted principles of religious liberties as declared at Vatican II and elsewhere.  This was the conclusion they arrived at.</P>
    <P>This committee comprised politicians of very long standing, distinguished in their own right.  On the Labour side there was Deputy Tully and Deputy Seán Dunne, on the Fine Gael side Senator Dooge, Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Higgins, who is now a member of the Supreme Court, and on the Fianna Fáil side there was the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, the present Tánaiste, Deputy Colley, and Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.  I would dismiss their recommendation as being silly and unworkable. Deputy Cluskey described them as being sectarian.  Of course they were but is it not an interesting thing that sectarian and all as it is, it is an advance on anything that we have at present?  Is that not a reflection on all of us in all parties who have not made any attempt to accept the recommendation?  One of the most extraordinary things has been the categoric rejection of the proposal about divorce following as fast as it did on the absurd Family Planning Act.  Both were a rejection of the pleas of the minority Protestant community that their attitude to both divorce and contraception should be recognised.</P>
    <P>On the eve of the election in Donegal there are 8,000 or 9,000 Protestants capable of issuing a rebuke to the Government on this matter in defence of their right.  Are these people to continue to play this Uncle Tom role, this tethered goat role in our society to encourage the Protestants in the North to join us, that everything is all right?  Why can they not take this opportunity of expressing their repudiation of the Government's departure from the position taken up by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass?</P>
    <P>Divorce is necessary obviously in the Republic in order to alleviate to some extent the great distress there is among <Col N="1471" /> people.  It is also essential to introduce a Bill to seek the deletion of this Article of the Constitution so that we can eliminate as far as we can, as a token of our good faith to the Northern Protestants, the charge that Rome rule is synonymous with home rule.  This can be done by the removal of the Article.  It seems that there are three types of people who approach the whole question of solving the Northern problem.  There are the Provos who simply go in and try to blast their way into a united Ireland.  While I understand their frustration and sense of impotence because of our failure down here, I do not share their views.  There is a group which take the British position or the passive attitude that everything will be all right eventually and that they will come in of their own volition.  Not in a thousand years.  The Labour Party take up the position that they are opposed to violence, but there must be something more than that.  There must be an attempt to take up the true republican position of a secular pluralist attitude on all social and economic matters.  We should take up the position that we believe that this series of matters which seem to reflect the nature of our State, matters like coeducation, interdenominational education, divorce, contraception, the <i>ne temere</i> decree should be dealt with so as to introduce the secular pluralist element of true republicanism into our laws and Constitution.  The leader of the Labour Party should, in view of the findings of the 1967 committee and the fact that Labour were represented on it and the categoric statement by them that nobody could object to the need for some kind of divorce laws, now make his position clear to the people who need divorce and to our friends in the North, our fellow Irishmen. He should lay it down&mdash;ideally I would like to get it from Fine Gael as well&mdash;as an indispensable precondition to the formation of any future Coalition, if he decides to take that decision, that he will agree to campaign on the question of divorce laws and the removal of the ban on divorce.  He should insist on the setting up of an all-party committee to investigate the type of divorce laws we <Col N="1472" /> should have.  In the first instance he should call for the removal of the ban on divorce and specify that he will not enter into any coalition unless that undertaking is given to him by the leader of that coalition.  Is he prepared to give that undertaking now?  If he was it would be an expression of good faith by himself and his party on this very important issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: It seems to me that in the debate on the divorce question so far we may not have pressed the Government as strongly as we should into a necessary defensive position.  The difficulty we have in so doing is that, rightly, the Labour Party have placed great emphasis on the need to support marriage. The Fianna Fáil side can also profess to support precisely the same objective but disagree totally as to the best means of so doing.  At this stage of the debate I should like to place more emphasis on the denial of human and minority rights on this issue and to stress the degree of individual suffering being caused by the existing law.  It is essential in this debate and in the years ahead&mdash;it is inevitable that change will come&mdash;that the Government should be forced to justify the existing position they support.  It appears that all the justification for change is being put by one side, largely by those of us who are arguing for the introduction of divorce.</P>
      <P>There is another assumption that we must start from in this debate: that there is a great need to promote stability, harmony and happiness in family life and in marriage here.  We must also assume that the role of children is of the greatest importance in such a relationship.  Therefore, the question arises: how can the law help?  Can the law do anything of great consequence in support of marriage?  If it is held that this is so then we must ask what are the limitations of the law in giving such help and we must ask, if we are concerned about measures to promote stability, harmony, and happiness in family life, if the law as it stands does damage to this relationship.  I shall address myself to those questions in the course of my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to stress that there has <Col N="1473" /> been a great tendency during this debate, and throughout the country &mdash; perhaps it is the occupational disease of legislators &mdash; to over estimate the power, influence and effectiveness of the law as a mechanism in promoting harmonious and stable relationships.  I have learned as a Deputy for the past 12 years, and as one who has been involved in public life for the past 25 years, that we have to pay far more attention to factors other than the law.  We must pay great attention to matters such as housing policy, family maintenance policy and the supportive policies for children in our society.  However, for one reason or another we have given specific tasks to the law to assist human relationships in marriage.  It is of some importance that this debate should consider some of these specific tasks. Deputy Keating alluded to a number of them.  We must now slowly but quietly get to the nub of the issue, the question of divorce.</P>
    <P>Firstly, we must consider the question of prevention as outlined in the law.  It has been suggested that we should raise the marriage age and that such a decision would be of great assistance.  There has been a great deal of discussion and debate on this issue.  But I should like to point out that raising the marriage age does not necessarily prevent relationships developing between young people, it does not prevent pregnancies occurring and it does not add greatly to the general betterment of the present situation.  It has been suggested by Deputy Keating also that better marriage counselling is necessary.  That is a fairly universal panacea for marital breakdown and is not to be dismissed.  I accept that there is a need for better facilities and greater State support for the many voluntary agencies involved in marriage counselling and, indeed, I would argue that the State should play a more positive role in this field through our health boards and social work agencies. It is important to accept that marriage counselling can only be of real and measurable benefit where such counselling is voluntarily undertaken by one or other or both parties to a shaky marriage.  It is also important to point out that those <Col N="1474" /> who are most likely to need marriage counselling are those who are least likely to avail of such a service.</P>
    <P>Another specific task given to the law is the warding off of certain threats to marriage.  There is a proposal before the House dealing with civil action for adultery. Presumably the purpose of that legislation is to discourage potential adulterers in Irish society.  However, I believe it is unlikely to be successful because for any deterrent in law to work it must be credible and it has to be directed to real as opposed to imaginary threats to marriage. Adultery, in my opinion, is often a symptom rather than a cause of a broken relationship.  Civil action on the part of the State is unlikely to deter a person in this regard because its operation would have to be highly selective and would have to be directed against highly emotive conduct which is unlikely to be affected by a threat of selectively imposed sanctions.</P>
    <P>The third specific task which has been given to the Dáil &mdash; here I come to the question of divorce &mdash; in the Constitution is the placing of marriage in an institutional, constitutional and legislative straitjacket.  That is the way we have decided to protect the role of marriage in our society.  In essence this means that we have a ban on divorce and a statutory ban on remarriage.  There is a simple, direct and crude attempt to prevent fragmentation of marriage.  It is an attempt by using the straitjacket of the constitutional bar to lock the parties directly into a marriage.  By virtue of there being a constitutional bar Dáil Éireann and the State have proceeded to throw away the key.  I submit that the vast majority of legislators and legal opinion cannot be convinced that that is an effective solution. If any Deputy wants to read one book on this matter perhaps he would read William Duncan's publication, <i>The Case for Divorce in the Irish Republic</i>. This gives an objective and, to me, thoroughly convincing explanation of the total inadequacy of the situation.</P>
    <P>Among the reasons why the present situation does not work is the fact that in Irish society there is an increasing incidence of marriage breakdown and a total <Col N="1475" /> absence of any legislative framework, as the Taoiseach knows well, to cater for this situation which is causing and will continue to cause the greatest personal hardship to individuals and will cause ever greater hardship for young people because we refuse to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The compulsion of the Constitution on this issue and the prohibition on remarriage are not a good basis for the development of personal relationships between people.  If I were a sociologist I would argue that it is anything but a good basis.  The Taoiseach talks about not coercing anyone in Northern Ireland but, in his own constituency, he is coercing people to live together because they have no hope of living otherwise.  To me that is political hypocrisy of the first calibre.</P>
    <P>Even worse is the fact that coercion is not just related to society but it is related in particular to women.  There are thousands of women in that situation and they can earn only 60 per cent of their husband's income because we have not got equal pay.  Generally they are not in employment when they are married and in many cases they are economically dependent on their husbands.  They are locked into that straitjacket.  Whereas both parties are locked in, very often the woman involved in a marriage breakdown is doubly locked in.  Therefore, a change should be made.</P>
    <P>Where the law does not reflect what is possible in many human relationships, namely, where it imposes impossible constraints and ideals, the tendency will be for the law to be evaded, avoided, abused and ultimately treated with contempt.  In future there will be less respect for the marriage laws.  That is not in the national interest and it is not in the best of interests of the people of Ireland.  Because the law places an impossible burden on marriage relationships, we have examples of evasion such as despairing resort to Church annulments, with all the anomalies that entails and all the hypocrisy which surrounds that, the possibility of getting a Church annulment but not being entitled to remarry.  There will be resort to divorces outside the jurisdiction of this <Col N="1476" /> so-called Republic within the EEC and, of course, an increase in stable and unstable relationships outside marriage. We have the tangled web which is already a product of the existing law and is proving an increasingly serious threat to family life.  The non-recognition by the State of second stable relationships places very many individuals, especially the children of such marriages whom we are supposed to cherish, in a very vulnerable position.</P>
    <P>Such being the nature of politics, I suppose it would have been somewhat unrealistic for us in the Labour Party to anticipate that Fianna Fáil would support our call for an all-party committee to consider the introduction of a referendum on the question of divorce.  Is the Taoiseach so assured in his mind that he denies the Irish people the right to decide?  Apparently so.  However, I might have expected something better from Deputy Doherty, the Minister of State. Deputy Síle de Valera may not have cleared her script about the H blocks, but surely the Minister of State at the Department of Justice should have cleared his script on divorce with the Taoiseach.  His speech was an indifferent, dismissive approach, probably written by some public servant in the Department of Justice, who gave the statutory response to the Minister, who swallowed it hook, line and sinker and then trotted it out in this House.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, tonight most Deputies in the House are preoccupied with the by-election in Donegal or the Presidential election in America.  Many people whose marriages have broken down irretrievably and irredeemably are getting scant concern from the vast majority of Deputies.  In this statement to the House last Wednesday evening the Minister said he thought divorce would bring much greater and widespread suffering and social disadvantage.  That was a bald statement.  May I ask the Minister to provide the House with any detailed information, any sociological research or social investigation, even by way of a discussion document, his Department or his party have carried out on this problem? Is there any discussion document on this issue available from the Law <Col N="1477" /> Reform Commission?  Apparently not. They are precluded from considering the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to stress the importance of family life and as his pivot point he stressed the fact that it is the basis of our community as enshrined in Article 41 of the Constitution.  He failed, as did the vast majority of Deputies on the Government side and indeed quite a few on the Opposition side, to appreciate that the Constitution is extremely selective in what it means by &ldquo;family&rdquo;.  Where a couple are married they and their children have the full protection of our Constitution, but if either of the parties were previously married and decide to remarry, under our Constitution that protection disappears.  In effect, that means that should this couple have any children, they do not have the protection of Article 41 of the Constitution, and this in an allegedly Christian society.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one might ask why the Government have not made any effort to find out the extent of this problem.  I might even ask why the Government refused to include the category separated in the 1981 census form.  I have pleaded with the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at least to make an effort to find out what is going on.  The former Taoiseach gave a specific assurance to the group concerned that the change would be made, but he was scrubbed out of office by the present Taoiseach before he had an opportunity to do so.  Surely before the Government speak with authority on this issue they should make themselves familiar with the extent of the problem, or do the CSO mandarins rule the roost completely and decide what goes into a census form and what does not?</P>
    <P>I will not pursue this because I believe we have the sympathy of the Taoiseach on the matter.  I raised the matter twice at Question Time and I am raising it again now.  It is not unfair to say that among all the leaders in the European nations we have strong elements of moral cowardice in the political field, but on the question of divorce we in Ireland remain unique in our capacity to lead Europe.  Fianna Fáil concede that thousands of marriages <Col N="1478" /> here do not exist any longer in any form or definition.  As the Taoiseach well knows, and as his Ministers know, as Deputies on all sides know, there are marriages here which have ceased to have any spiritual meaning, any personal meaning, any physical meaning whatsoever, any custodial meaning, any meaning in terms of emotion, in terms of family income, maintenance, or any form of supportive concept in respect of any kind of human relationship.</P>
    <P>One can have a husband in prison for battering his wife and children.  He can later go off to the UK and not be seen for 20 years.  That marriage does not exist, yet that woman may not remarry.  So we determine, in our self-righteous protection of the Irish Constitution.  A man may even have gone to England and bigamously married another woman, yet no hope whatsoever is held out for the spouse left at home.  Despite clear acceptance that such marriages are irredeemably terminated we in the Republic continue to proclaim their existence. Therefore, I suggest there is a great deal of double talk and hypocrisy surrounding the question of divorce.</P>
    <P>On this question of hypocrisy, one need only talk in the bar of this House or in one of the restaurants here and to a cross-section of Deputies, one need only meet them at a by-election hustings and talk about problems which all of us face in our daily constituency work, and in a substantial majority such Deputies will concede that there should be a change in the law to introduce termination of marriage. But in public they are abject, they will not in any circumstances accept that they should make a change.  I am glad the Taoiseach has joined us here because he is a man of great political experience, a man of the world.  Nobody knows as much as he and I do about the reality of this position.  We should not be in a position of fearing for our political future and then run away like frightened political goats from honest and frank debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>So far the only response of the Government has been the introduction of a so-called Adultery Bill.  Suffering God, is that our only response?  Is this yet another <Col N="1479" /> Fianna Fáil Irish solution to an Irish problem?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: If Hugh Leonard wants to write another play he has a rich source of material.  In this Adultery Bill a situation can develop where children will see their parents dragging each other through the courts to establish that one of them is a bigger adulterer than the other, all for monetary gain, because of a change in the law.  I doubt if anybody in this country believes that people who do not particularly avail of divorce should in any way be made to avail of it.  Divorce is not a cure for marital breakdown, but it is the most humane, most Christian, most sensitive response to the human and social exigencies of that situation.  As a married man and as a Catholic I believe that.  I am firmly convinced of it and I am prepared to argue it with clerics, sociologists and fellow politicians, because if we believe in something we should say it and not dodge behind the columns of lobbies here to avoid our responsibilities.  Without speaking frankly on such issues political life becomes a sham with which I would prefer not to have anything to do; I would prefer to go out and dig ditches because it would prove to be more productive in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation we advocate here is a basic human right, and a responsible Government has not got an option to making it available.  In doing so the religious beliefs of everybody in the community and those whose consciences would not allow them to avail of divorce would be fully respected.  I was a member of an all-party committee&mdash;not the Mickey Mouse one of 1967 with the sectarian amendment Deputy Noel Browne has referred to here &mdash; on the implications of Irish unity and I remember some skin and hair flying when the late Cardinal Conway assured members of Fianna Fáil, Labour and Fine Gael that he would have every pulpit in this country speaking against us if we dared to recommend a change of the law relative to divorce.  He was informed by some solid and <Col N="1480" /> respected members of Fianna Fáil that no religious or political body in this country had an exclusive veto on issues of human rights.</P>
    <P>This is not an area on which either the religious authorities or indeed the civil authorities have a right to exercise veto. Therefore I strongly believe that while divorce is in no way going to solve all marital problems it will at least put an end to the social anomaly of refusing to allow persons to live with normal human dignity, of refusing persons to remarry and refusing to legitimise the children of second unions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in conclusion, if the State's goal is to promote and support family life and marriage it is high time that we learned the lesson that formal legal rules and constitutional principles are less likely to have effect than the development of social policies, the development of sensitive legislative statutes and above all economic policies such as housing, health, education and child care designed to bring about conditions favourable to the family in society, to the health of all families, to the welfare of all families, to the stability of all families and ultimately to rewarding human relationships at all levels of the family and society.  Even in one parent families where divorce has occurred this is possible.</P>
    <P>For that reason I strongly support the motion introduced by my distinguished colleague, Deputy Desmond, whose humanity and sensitivity is well known. Lest we claim an interest, we are not related; but I am proud that someone of my name has shown such courage and persistence on this issue in recent years. This is another reason why I am honoured to have the opportunity of seconding the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I shall address myself to the Fine Gael amendment which is before the House.  This seeks the establishment of an all-party committee to consider the problems of supporting marriage and the family under modern conditions and marriage breakdown.  The text of the amendment we have put down is broader than the original motion and deserves the support of the House.  No <Col N="1481" /> public representative can be but conscious of the many pressures under which families are living in modern times.  I am sure we have all had many wives coming to us seeking representations for income, protection from husbands and protection for their children.  It is sad to see that the numbers coming forward to seek public help are increasing at a rapid rate.  It is in the spirit of seeking to examine the causes of marital problems and marriage breakdown that we put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister of State in replying to the motion and amendments is nothing less than hypocritical.  What has been sought in the motion and in our amendment is that an all-party committee of the House be established.  It is urgent and vital that this Dáil should address itself to this very difficult and personal area of law.  Article 41 of the Constitution is quite specific in saying that no law shall be enacted for granting the dissolution of marriage.  I have no doubt if a referendum was held on this issue as of now an amendment to the constitution would be defeated and there would be no popular support for it.  That would be the case because there is not a sufficient body of evidence or a report available to put before the electorate.  As of now I am sure Fianna Fáil in their narrow-minded, regressive fashion would go off on the hustings, fight the amendment and in all probability win.  In doing so what would they achieve other than an election victory?  What is needed is a body of elected Members of Parliament to sit down and examine the problem in a serious fashion and come up with recommendations to the House not only in relation to divorce &mdash; to highlight that would be unfortunate &mdash; but in relation to support for marriages and for the family unit which is seen as being the most important unit in the State.  For the Minister to come into the House in such a dismissive and negative manner is nothing less than shocking.  It shows his lack of insight into the serious social problems present in society and the tendency by the Government to run away from problems rather than to tackle them.  That is unfortunate.  The Labour motion, put down seriously and in light of policy, <Col N="1482" /> should have been treated seriously by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The tendency to marry at a young age should be discussed.  The minimum age should be examined.  Many marriage breakdowns we have witnessed, especially in the last few years, have resulted from very early teenage marriages.  They are young boys and girls who are ill-prepared, ill-informed and extremely immature. We should look at this area with a view to increasing the minimum age.  It is far too serious an event to allow it at an early age.  I know the Church is very concerned about this and is trying to encourage marriage courses and that a certain period be established before a marriage takes place.  It is a serious problem which could be looked into by an all-party committee.  It is something the Government cannot ignore or run away from.</P>
    <P>There is need for greater education in schools about marriage, the child growing up, maturing and taking his place in society and at the head of a family or, in the case of a girl, as the wife and mother of children.  Our school curriculum at second level does not allow for an in-depth study on this important question.  The emphasis on examinations, which I deplore, sweeps aside the time that could be given for courses for the young boy or girl on taking his or her place in society. However, we are very lax in this area about informing our young children as to the role they can play in life.  It is here in very basic education that we can do much for young children.  We can imbue them with a greater understanding of the laws of the State under which thy live and their role in society upon leaving school, yet practically nothing is done in the school to prepare children for adult life.  That is very sad.  It should be discussed and can be remedied.</P>
    <P>The role of the welfare officers of the health boards in the country is something which I would like to praise.  In my constituency there is an excellent service under the health board for the aid of distressed mothers and housewives, and it is being run on very small amounts of money with great confidence and sympathy. I have nothing but praise for the <Col N="1483" /> many welfare officers who have become involved at a very practical level.  This is not just an academic exercise here this evening.  I am talking about a very practical area.  Welfare officers in the welfare service are doing especially good and sympathetic work and their role should not go unmentioned.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, other law at the central Government level which allows support for distressed or separated wives and that is as it should be, but it is not adequate.  The moneys payable to deserted wives is small in the extreme and we should have a radical look at this whole area with a view to evolving a comprehensive service especially for deserted wives who are trying to rear children on a very small income indeed. Although in our welfare services we cannot but be proud of the level of commitment to those deserted wives with young children, they get very small money indeed and but for the supplementary support which they get from the health boards they would be very badly off.  I can say that they are poor people who are not being treated as well as we should treat them.</P>
    <P>The present position relating to marriage is extremely difficult for the layman and as a layman I admit that the whole area is difficult even for me to understand. The question of the civil dissolution and civil legality of marriage is one area that is confounded by the whole attitude of the church to annulment and re-marriage.  There has been quite a departure from the church position in civil law.  Certainly the civil practice in our neighbour country and countries in Europe differs greatly from the practice in Ireland in relation to the civil status of marriage, divorce, annulment and so on. At the moment the question of the children seems to take second place, and that is most unfortunate.  Of course, that also applies perhaps even more so in relation to church law.  The whole area needs to be examined expertly and that can be done only by an expert committee, a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am very sorry that the Government have run away from this very important <Col N="1484" /> and delicate area.  They have stuck their heads in the sand and are not prepared to take the issue seriously.  Many informed people will not look kindly on the Government position in relation to this question of the establishment of an all-party committee.  Many genuine, honest-to-goodness men and women are suffering because of the present situation in Ireland.  That the Fianna Fáil Government are refusing to have anything to do with an all-party committee smacks of hypocrisy and cynicism.</P>

      <P>: It is very sad indeed that they have taken such a narrow line on this vital issue.  I can only appeal to the other members of the Government to have a look at this again.  Obviously the Minister here tonight is not capable of doing so or of becoming involved in this issue.  We are not talking about anything other than the establishment of an all-party committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, something that commends itself to me.  I can only say that I am bitterly disappointed with the Government position on this matter.  Little can be said that has not been said by previous perhaps more knowledgable speakers as reported on the record of this House.  I do not wish to repeat it, but the attitude of the Government is extremely disappointing and will be seen by many people to be unfortunate and very sad at this time of great pressure and stress on married life in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: In this matter, as in so many others in this country, there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. Before I talk about that I wish to draw the attention of the House, and through the House that of the wider public, to some of the issues concerned with the Constitution.  There has been a lot of muddying of the waters in relation to what this House has or has not competence to do in relation to divorce.  It is assumed by well-meaning people who are either for or against divorce that all we have to do in this House is to pass a law and divorce would be available in the <Col N="1485" /> morning.  These people fail to realise that the Constitution which we are discussing at one remove under this motion of the Labour Party was framed and devised by a very skilful political mind.  It is a Constitution which not only allows the Irish people, but restricts to the Irish people as a whole in this State, the right to change the provisions of that Constitution. The man and the Government who drafted that Constitution, however, were not so careless as to leave a situation in which the Irish people could change their Constitution whenever they wanted to. No.  The Irish people were going to be allowed to change their Constitution only when a majority of Members of the Dáil and Seanad decided that they should be given the opportunity of changing it.  We in the Labour Party benches believe in the necessity for the provision of civil divorce proceedings in circumstances in which marriages have broken down irretrievably. However, in a sense that is not even the issue here tonight.  The issue here tonight is whether the Irish people should be given an opportunity of saying the same thing.  If they do not agree with us in the Labour Party by deleting or by substituting another provision for the relevant subsection of Article 41 of the Constitution, then we are all back to square one.</P>
      <P>What opposition to this motion means must also be made quite clear.  It is plain from what the Minister of State told us last week, that there will be mass opposition from the Government benches to this motion. Opposition means that the Government party effectively are denying to the Irish people the right even to express an opinion of whether the provision of our Constitution relating to civil divorce should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that in a democracy one cannot consult the people by way of referendum on everything, although, God knows, there are occasions when one would like them to be consulted.  One cannot consult them on the annual budget or on the level of taxation.  To try to run a country like that would make it absolutely ungovernable but there is written <Col N="1486" /> into this Constitution the underlying assumption that the electorate as a whole have the right to be consulted about fundamental matters which affect the Constitution and their lives.</P>
    <P>We believe this is one of these occasions when this consultation machinery should be adopted.  Let there be no doubt about it.  If a decision is ever taken to put this to the people by way of referendum, to clear the decks so that an appropriate divorce law can be brought into this House, I and other Members of the Labour Party will be making our views felt on that occasion.  The sad fact is that not only have the Government decided to vote against it on this occasion, but, to listen to what the Minister of State said here last week, they have set their collective and stony face totally against it.  The Minister of State made it clear that the Government were opposing this motion totally lest there be the slightest shred of ambiguity in people's minds about the possibility that divorce legislation might ever be passed by this House.</P>
    <P>I find that degree of refusal to face facts extraordinary because the Minister must know, as we know on these benches and as I have no doubt they know on the Fine Gael benches, that the provisions of our Constitution will be changed and that laws providing for civil divorce will be introduced and passed by the Dáil and the Seanad at some date in the future. The question is not whether but when.</P>
    <P>We also know that the main motive force behind that move for change, that move for appeal, when it comes will not be the misery of the thousands of people who suffer under it now, but the greed of the people who at present can afford to get foreign divorces, who can afford to arrange their matrimonial affairs in such a way that the laws of the State impinge little upon them, when they discover into the second and third generation that even though they may escape in their personal lives the consequences of the absence of divorce legislation, they will have serious difficulties in passing on their accumulated, no matter how ill-gotten, gains to their offspring.</P>
    <P>It is this power, the power of resources, of wealth, which when it finds itself <Col N="1487" /> blocked will be leaning heavily on the shoulders on the leaders of political parties like Fianna Fáil to get them to change a law that three, four, five or ten years before they had said was unchangeable. It is when that pressure builds up that the pressure will become effective.  In the meantime the misery, suffering and lack of an adequate home life and all the problems associated with marital breakdowns will continue for those without the resources to escape the penal consequences of our present system of legislation, without the resources to travel abroad and spend the six or eight weeks in Las Vegas, to establish fake domicile in Britain, to do any one of these things which are at the moment the convenient backdoors through which they can escape from the provisions of our present laws.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party put down this motion now not just because we do not ever get, and would never want, support of that group in our society but because we believe present problems demand present remedies.  To sit on our collective behinds and wait until the pressure builds up to the point at which a Government's political skill is deemed not to be in danger is a fundamental act of political cowardice.</P>
    <P>The case can be made &mdash; I noticed the Government did not make it but I am sure among their benches there are people who would make it &mdash; that there is a relationship between divorce and marital breakdown, that if you allow civil divorce legislation, assuming always that the Irish people would consent to change the Constitution, this will open the floodgates to every manner of abuse and immorality. We ought to be mature enough at this stage of our national development to reject this absurd domino theory of morality.  Of course there is a relationship between marital breakdown and divorce but it is the other way round from the way it is sometimes presented to us. Divorce is not a cause of marital breakdown; marital breakdown is a cause of divorce.  Unless we learn politically to put the cart and the horse in the right order we will never have serious debates on economic or social issues in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> Another point we should be aware of, and this is one on which we on these benches set particular store by, is this: divorce is not a remedy for marital breakdown. It is not a cure for the problem of marital breakdown.  It is a recognition of the fact that marriage can and does break down and of the need to provide, if necessary, a new relationship for the welfare of adult men and women and of growing children.  This party have for several years now adopted that policy but they do so in a much wider social and economic context because this party, more so in every respect than the Government party, would also argue very strongly that the causes of marital breakdown are not to be found in the provision of divorce &mdash; God knows there is marital breakdown enough in the country and no divorce is in sight &mdash; but within the social and economic pressures which bear on all married couples, and upon younger married couples in particular as they start out on their married lives.</P>
    <P>We know, and we have more reasons to know than most, the kind of social and economic policies which are created, for example, by the Government approach to housing which refuses local authorities funds to build enough houses for people who are forced to live with in-laws, in caravans, in mobile homes, in conditions of indescribable squalor up and down the country.  We know, too, of the bad planning &mdash; and here, perhaps, the blame is to be somewhat more widely shared &mdash; the type of planning that breaks up city communities, which condemns young people to spend their married lives removed from the extended family, consigned to vast dormitory suburbs outside the centres of our cities with few social amenities, few recreational facilities and an exiguous transport service to bring them back to the areas in which they grew up.</P>
    <P>We know, also, of the social pressures that are placed on everybody, but not least on young families, by the social crime of unemployment and by the feeble attempts, of this Government especially, to cope with that problem.  We have a situation today in which the best part of 250,000 children live in families who are <Col N="1489" /> dependent on assistance from the State in one form or another so that they might have enough bread to eat in the morning and who is to say that they even have that much.  Those in this House who are comparatively and comfortably well off and who intend voting against this measure this evening should examine their consciences and ask themselves if their marriages would be as comfortable or as happy or if they would be so well off if they were part of one of those families who are dependent on social welfare benefits, on social welfare assistance, on disability benefit, on the deserted wives allowance or on unmarried mothers allowance.  If, after such examination, the conscience of any such Member is clear, let him vote accordingly.</P>
    <P>We are not simple issue politicians.  We do not regard divorce as a solution to the problem of marital breakdown.  We seek the provision of civil divorce, including the right to remarry where remarriage is required, as part of an overall social and economic policy which is designed not only to tackle the symptoms of the social problems that we encounter today but also to attack in a more fundamental way the underlying economic base and root problems involved.  We are aware that the problem of marital breakdown will be with us for as long as there is marriage but our social and economic policies, above all, are of a kind which are destined to make those problems much less of a reality than they are.  But in so far as there are problems, they must be met and unless we meet them now we will stand accused, and rightly so, of running away from them.</P>
    <P>In a more mature assembly than this, the Government of the day faced with the undoubted division in their own ranks, might have the level headedness to allow their members a free vote on this issue and when I refer to this issue I must remind myself that all we are trying to decide on this evening is a proposal to set up an all-party committee to recommend a revision of the Constitution to allow our people to make up their minds.  However, the Government party are never a great party in the context of a free vote. I recognise that there are reasons for that <Col N="1490" /> but there is another option open to the Government and I am surprised that they have not adopted that other option.  If they are incapable of allowing a free vote to their own people, let them abstain on this issue.  If they cannot solve the problems and the internal disagreements within their own party other than by putting on the whip to vote against, which is the softest option of all, let them abstain and let those Members who are willing to vote decide the issue so that the committee can be set up and set about their work.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated publicly following his meeting with Mrs. Thatcher that there was no support for divorce in the Republic.  However, the ESRI survey in this regard indicated that almost half the people who replied were in favour of such provision.  But on this side of the House we are not interested only in counting heads, important though that may be. We are interested in the fundamental issues that are involved here and which cannot be solved totally by the counting of heads.  So far the Government have refused to face this fundamental issue and until such time as it is faced it will not go away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: May I say at the outset that I deeply regret the attitude adopted by the Government to the motion before us tonight?  It is an attitude which derives, not from a principled evaluation of the measure proposed, but from a cruel and heartless pragmatism which serves neither the interest of those who have genuine conscientious objections to amending Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution, nor of those, like myself, who believe that natural justice, for reasons I will outline, requires this House to rectify various anomalies in the law relating to marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a radio interview last Thursday, the Minister for State at the Department of Justice made the Government's position on the matter quite clear.  In summary, it is that the Government are not, in principle, opposed to the enactment of legislation to provide for the dissolution of marriages which have irretrievably broken down.  The Minister, indeed, went so far as to imply that he foresaw a time <Col N="1491" /> when such legislation could be enacted as demand for it grew.  He felt, however, that the time is not yet ripe for such a measure, irrespective of the injustice currently imposed on tens of thousands of men, women and children by the present legal position.</P>
    <P>That is an attitude which brings this House and the whole political process into disrepute.  The politics of pragmatism has no place in a debate on a matter of such profound importance to so many in our society.  I have respect for those who conscientiously hold views different from my own on this matter and who genuinely believe that the enactment of legislation which would allow for divorce, no matter how tightly restricted, would constitute a greater evil than that which currently exists.  Those views deserve respect because they are conscientiously held.  I can have no respect, however, for a Minister or for a Government who have no philosophy on the matter and whose position is determined simply by an assessment of where the majority of votes currently lies.  That is a discreditable form of politics which, followed to its logical conclusion, would preclude the enactment of any legislation to cater for the rights of minorities.</P>
    <P>The strength of a democracy rests on its willingness and ability to respond to the rights of minority groups.  When those rights are infringed an injustice is perpetrated, not only on the minorities concerned, but on the whole of our society.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that all parties in the Oireachtas have already recognised the validity of this argument as it applies to the issue of the dissolution of marriage.  The Report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, published in 1967, recommended that Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution should be amended to permit the enactment of marriage laws acceptable to all religions. Here the committee were facing up to the fact that the Constitution, in its present form, discriminates against religious minorities whose religious beliefs do not preclude the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>The committee proposed an alternative formulation of Article 41.3.2º which <Col N="1492" /> took account of the rights of religious minorities.  In doing so, the members were clearly seeking to see to it that one set of minority rights on this issue were respected in our Constitution, a requirement which persists to this day.  It is now 13 years since that recommendation was made by respected Members from all parties in this House.  Following the passage of time, most Members of the Oireachtas would not now agree with the particular formulation proposed by the all-party committee, since, in a fundamental way, it would reinforce sectarian values in our basic law.  Yet, inadequate though that particular formulation was, and it must of course be seen in the context of the time it was proposed, it recognised the rights of religious minorities. The Government today are not even prepared to go that far.  Instead, they stand over a Constitutional provision which discriminates against those who hold minority religious views, while simultaneously mouthing their traditional cliches concerning national unity.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that one of the main motivations behind the decision to set up the all-party committee was to explore ways in which the Constitution could be amended to ease the path to reconciliation between both parts of this island.  The Oireachtas then, if not now, recognised that the eventual achievement of national unity would require that we make changes in our laws down here to accommodate the views of the Northern majority.  That of course was a correct assessment of the position.  Thirteen years later we have reverted to the point where no concessions at all are being made to the legitimate views of Northern, or indeed Southern, Protestants.  Following tonight's vote, the Taoiseach's first political priority will be seen by them for what it is&mdash;an empty cliché, signifying nothing except an appeal for support to Fianna Fáil's traditional political heartland. This party are not and never have put forward the argument that our Constitution should be changed solely to accommodate or appease people in the North.  We claim in the past and now that our Constitution should be changed because it is right to change it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> The need for a re-examination of the law in relation to marriage arises for reasons more generalised than those I have mentioned.  We must, I believe, face up to the reality that some marriages do and will continue to break down irretrievably, often despite the best efforts of the persons involved.  We must face up also to the reality that sometimes the best interests of the children of a broken marriage would be served by a dissolution of that marriage.</P>
    <P>The reality of the failure of some marriages is already recognised in our law.  It has long been accepted in this country, as a matter of common sense and common humanity, that where a marriage fails completely the law should not only allow but, in cases where protection is needed, compel a couple to live apart.  Indeed, greater awareness of family violence has led in this as in other countries to a strengthening of the courts power to order separation.  It is recognised also in our social welfare code in the sense that deserted wives and their children are legally entitled to an income from the State subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>In addition, our civil courts and ecclesiastical tribunals recognise the concept of marriage annulment.  In 1978 there were 825 applications for annulment to regional marriage tribunals of the Roman Catholic Church.  Desertion, legal separation and civil annulments of marriages are, therefore, recognised entities in our civil law at present.  These are not at issue in this debate since they are already a part of our social reality and our legal system.</P>
    <P>What is at issue is the right of those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down or been annulled in ecclesiastical law to remarry.  At present, only those whose marriages have been annulled in a civil court may contract a second marriage.  Those who have received ecclesiastical annulments or who are legally separated or deserted may not do so.  What is more, the children of annulled marriages are classified as illegitimate.</P>
    <P>None of us, surely, can feel gratified with this situation which amounts to a <Col N="1494" /> denial of the civil rights of a significant proportion of our population.  Surely, those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down or whose marriages have been annulled by ecclesiastical tribunals have a right in justice to remarry, should they so wish.  Natural justice alone would suggest that they have that right.</P>
    <P>In facing up to this matter, the Labour Party does not assert that divorce should be made easy or should become commonplace. A primary obligation of the State must be to support the institution of marriage with all the means at its disposal. It has, in this sense, an obligation to ensure adequate housing, income and employment for all families.  The lack of one or all of these essential requirements is placing impossible strains on far too many families at present and will continue to do so as long as current economic policies are pursued.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we need to dramatically improve family support and marriage counselling services to assist families in difficulty.  Lip service to the value of marriage by politicians who do not provide either the economic environment or support services to encourage families in trouble amounts to nothing more than monumental hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, and only when marriages appear to have broken down irretrievably, applications for a disolution of marriage should be heard in family courts, one of whose functions should be to attempt to effect a reconciliation before a final decision is made.  The proceedings in family courts should be based on the objective of reconciliation and the adversorial format, which is used in some other countries, should not be condoned here.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposals which other Labour speakers and I have outlined during the debate on this motion constitute a humane and civilised response to the needs of many thousands of men, women and children in our society today.  We have faced up to the fact that the law relating to marriage must take account of social realities.</P>
    <P>In the end, we cannot legislate for good marriages.  We have an obligation to encourage marriage and to support it by every means at our disposal.  We do not <Col N="1495" /> do so adequately at present.  But when a marriage breaks down and when the best efforts of enhanced social services cannot recreate a stable relationship, then justice requires that we allow the couple concerned to have their marriage dissolved. I believe that they and their children are entitled to expect no less from this House.</P>
    <P>Some people have suggested that the motion by the Labour Party will only have negative effects.  In fact, in speaking to the amendment put in by Fine Gael, members of that party have spoken of support services for marriage.  Our approach to this problem in our society is well known.  Nobody from any side of the House has suggested that it is not a very serious problem for many thousands of our people.  We have approached it in a realistic and a humane way.  We have at all times, including in the terms of the motion before the House in our name, tried to emphasise the importance of the marriage state and to ensure that full effect is given in practical terms to its importance by the State.</P>
    <P>Many marriages which are now irretrievably broken down would not be so except for the fact that we run our economic and social affairs in the manner in which we do.  How many of us have gone to our political clinics and have had young men and women coming to us whose marriages could have been successful if they had decent homes in which to live together?  How many of us have sat across the table from a young girl with two or three small children dragging out of her, pouring out her heart telling us that it was impossible to get her marriage off the ground because she was forced to live with his people or he was forced to live with her people?  In many cases they were forced because of the lack of a basic right &mdash; a home of their own &mdash; to live apart. The economic system has caused the irretrievable breakdown of many marriages. We cannot continue to inflict two wrongs on these people.</P>

The contracts for the supply of the rolling stock including detailed specifications, and other works in connection with the project, are matters for which the board are directly responsible.

Each will have accommodation for a total of 180 passengers, 72 seated and 108 standing.  CIE invited tenders for the supply of the rolling stock from a number of manufacturers.

      <P>: The highest international safety standards for shipping are those laid down in the Conventions on Safety of Life at Sea promulgated by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultation Organisation (IMCO), which is the specialised United Nations world-wide organisation concerned with safety of shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has ratified and implemented the convention of 1960, which among other things provides for periodic surveys of ships and the issue for limited periods of various safety certificates whose form and content are laid down in the Convention. <Col N="1318" /> The surveys are carried out by surveyors of my Department's Marine Survey Service, and safety certificates are issued by my Department in respect of vessels which are found, upon survey, to be in compliance with the appropriate international safety standards.</P>
    <P>I hope to introduce in the present session of the Oireachtas a Bill to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, which replaces, updates and expands the 1960 convention, and the 1978 protocol to the convention of 1974.  The 1978 protocol provided among other things for more frequent surveys of ships, especially older ships.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures are fully adequate to ensure the maintenance of the highest safety standards on Irish-registered ships.  In the case of chartered ships, the responsibility for ensuring, by survey and certification, their compliance with international safety standards, rests with the flag state: this is one of the basic features of the international ship safety system prepared and promoted by IMCO, to which virtually all of the world's sea-going nations have subscribed.</P>

    <P>I hope to introduce in the present session <Col N="1319" /> of the Oireachtas a Bill to enable Ireland to ratify the Protocol of 1978 to the Convention on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974.

      <P>The implementation of this recommendation would entail the drawing up of a standard international requirement, as in the case of the other safety certificates, referred to by the Deputy, which ships are obliged to display.</P>
      <P>I have brought the recommendation to the attention of the International Association of Classification Societies, whose members would be particularly concerned with it, as well as of the Oil Companies International Marine Forum and of the International Chamber of Shipping. They have promised full co-operation and have indicated that they are initiating specialist studies of the recommendations.</P>

I have submitted a paper on all the recommendations of the report for consideration by this committee at their next session.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the serious housing situation in the Dublin <Col N="1321" /> region for people seeking housing accommodation from Dublin Corporation; if he is in a position to make an allocation of additional capital to Dublin Corporation to increase their housing output; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>: Following the Government's recent decision to increase the authorised expenditure on local authority housing for 1980 by £12 million, Dublin Corporation were notified on 17 September 1980, of an increase of £3 million in the capital allocation for their housing programme. This brought their allocation up to £35 million and represented about 31 per cent of the total overall authorised capital expenditure on local authority housing for 1980.  This is the maximum amount that could be allocated having regard to the overall constraints in expenditure on capital works in 1980.</P>
      <P>The latest progress figures available in the Department show that at the end of August 1980, a total of 883 houses have been completed by the corporation.  Of the 2,030 houses in progress at that date it is expected that a further 650 will be completed by the end of the year bringing total completions for the year to about 1,550.  Actual vacancies to the end of August were 786 and it is anticipated that about 400 more vacancies will arise by 31 December 1980.  This will mean that the total number of dwellings available for letting in 1980 will be over 2,700 which compares favourably with a total of 2,562 in 1979.</P>

      <P>1.  (a)  Development of Rossaveel as a fishery harbour.</P>
      <P>(b)  A committee entitled the Rossaveel Harbour Development Advisory Committee was set up on 3 March 1980 to recommend for consideration by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry appropriate works in order of priority for the development of the infrastructure of Rossaveel Major Fishery Centre and other matters incidental thereto.</P>

            <entry>On 8 July 1978 the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group was established with the following terms of reference:<br />(i)  To examine and report on the feasibility of giving to the telecommunications service such form of autonomous organisation as is likely to be most effective in meeting current public demand and providing for future development and expansion: and to make specific proposals regarding the nature, powers and functions of the organisations recommended.<br />(ii) To examine and report on the organisational arrangements necessary to secure the modernisation of the postal system so as to promote an efficient delivery system nationwide.</entry>
            <entry>Report submitted on 28 May 1979.</entry>
            <entry>The basic recommendations were that:<br />(i)  The telecommunications and postal services should be taken out of the civil service and set up as two separate State-sponsored bodies, and<br />(ii)  That an interim board be appointed to assume the widest possible responsibilities, consistent with the legal framework, for the operation and development of telecommunications services.<br />The Government decided in July 1979 to accept these recommendations and two interim boards, one for the telecommunications service, as recommended by the Review Group, and one for the postal service, were appointed in October 1979. A Green Paper was published in May 1980 containing proposals in general terms for the reorganisation of the postal and telecommunications services.</entry>

      <P>: The sub-critical device otherwise known as the &ldquo;student training reactor&rdquo; was acquired by University College, Cork, under a grant provided by the Government of the United States of America in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement for Co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States and which came into force on 9 July 1958.  The agreement was published in the Treaty Series No. 19 of 1958, and the terms of the Agreement were laid on the Table of Dáil Éireann (Pr. 3686).  The agreement was amended and extended by subsequent agreements dated 7 August 1963 and 12 June 1968 which were published in the Treaty Series (No. 4 of 1964 and No. 13 of 1968) and laid on the Table of Dáil Éireann (Pr. 7638 and Pr. 1405).</P>
      <P>A further agreement dated 24 March 1960, concerning the acquisition of certain nuclear research and training equipment and materials effected by exchange of notes between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America, entered into force on 7 April 1960.  The terms of this agreement were approved by Dáil Éireann on 5 April 1960.  As some of the material requested under the terms of this agreement fell outside the categories covered by the agreement for co-operation, it was necessary to amend the relevant Article (No. V) of that agreement.  This amendment was approved by the Government at the same time as the 1960 agreement and entered into force on 30 March 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following Ireland's entry to the European Communities, the Agreement for Co-operation between Ireland and the <Col N="1381" /> United States was superseded by the Co-operation Agreement between the United States and EURATOM in relation to items which had not been supplied prior on that date.</P>
    <P>The supply of information as to the nature of the research and other questions relating thereto is a matter for the authorities of University College, Cork.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the device was acquired before the Nuclear Energy Board were established but general approval for the installation of the device was implied by the Government's participation in the agreements already mentioned. The device was subsequently licensed by the Nuclear Energy Board under the provisions of the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977).  For reasons of radiation safety, security and commercial confidentiality it is not the practice to give details of the conditions on which licences of this nature are granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>

      <P>(2)  It is suggested that this question should in the first instance be addressed to the authorities of University College, Cork.</P>
      <P>(3)  I am advised that it is misleading to refer to this device as a reactor.  It is a sub-critical assembly of nuclear material in which the self-sustaining fission chain reaction cannot be established and maintained. Its existence does not in any way pre-empt decisions on the nuclear option for power production in Ireland.  The terms of reference of the proposed inquiry have not yet been determined.</P>
      <P>(4)  As the device is not a reactor, an emergency evacuation plan of the type implied in the question is not relevant.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos, 427, 428, and 429 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulation which has enabled me to forward to the Commission a programme for the development of the Border counties was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 7 October last.  The finances for this programme will be made available from a special fund which will <Col N="1386" /> be co-financed by the Exchequer and the non-quota section of the Regional Fund. We propose to allocate IR£20.5 million to the fund over the five year period of the programme.  I would like to stress that this fund represents expenditure over and above normal expenditure from the quota section of the Regional Fund which is used on a country-wide basis to boost the Public Capital Programme.  I should also like to emphasise that Border counties will continue to benefit as heretofore from the additional resources which are derived from the quota section.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed are designed to improve the tourism potential of the Border counties and to encourage the development and expansion of craft industries.  A tentative allocation of the moneys of the Special Fund has been made as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>IR£3.6 million for grants for development of tourist accommodation.</P>
    <P>IR£1.0 million for the promotion of tourism in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>IR£5.3 million for the development of tourist related amenities.</P>
    <P>IR£5.1 million for the improvement of telecommunication services and access to tourist areas that is improvement of minor roads.</P>
    <P>IR£1.6 million for the development of an airport in Donegal.</P>
    <P>IR£0.6 million aids to transport facilities within the area.</P>
    <P>IR£3.3 million for grants and marketing aid for craft industries.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that these allocations are not definitive.  There is room for flexibility in the allocation of funds for the different measures.  Over the five years a pragmatic approach will be adopted in the allocation of funds.  This is a new venture and we will learn as the programme progresses the measures which are best succeeding in attaining the objective of the programme which is the improvement of the economic and social situation of the Border areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">

      <P>: The Government are fully satisfied with the performance of the Irish pound in the EMS.  In recent months our pound has consistently been in a strong position within the EMS band.  The change in the exchange rate of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pound sterling is not due to any weakness of our currency in the EMS but rather to the appreciation of sterling, for reasons that are well known, against all the EMS currencies.  Yesterday, for example, when sterling registered further gains against the Irish pound and indeed against the other EMS currencies, our pound was in fact strengthening within the EMS band.</P>
      <P>As regards future movements in the Irish pound/sterling exchange rate, these will depend on the fluctuations of sterling outside the EMS.  It would not be appropriate for me to speculate about the likely direction and size of future fluctuations of sterling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The following is a summary of the steps taken in the past few months:</P>
      <P>1.  Winter Fodder Scheme 1980</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the difficulties faced by farmers arising from the current problems of <Col N="1391" /> fodder supplies for winter feed a new fodder scheme was introduced on 21 August.  The scheme which is estimated to cost £800,000, provided for:</P>
    <P>(a)  a subsidy of £20 per ton of CAN or equivalent in high nitrogen fertilizer purchased and used between 13 August and 6 September.</P>
    <P>(b)  a subsidy of £3 per tonne (maximum £150) for silage made between 21 August and 31 October on farms which had not made silage before.</P>
    <P>2.  Farm Modernisation Scheme</P>
    <P>An extra £15 million has been provided under the farm modernisation scheme, including the western drainage scheme, to enable outstanding claims under this scheme to be cleared up-to-date.</P>
    <P>3.  Rates</P>
    <P>The Government have arranged (a) to remove the obligation on farmers in the £40 to £60 RV category to pay the second moiety of rates this year, and (b) that no farmer who is in temporary financial difficulties will be pressed for his local rates and that no interest will be payable on outstanding amounts.</P>
    <P>4.  Restructuring of Existing Borrowing</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Government discussions with the four associated banks about the present position of farmers' indebtedness, the banks have indicated that they will take a constructive and positive approach to the restructuring of existing loans on a case by case basis where farmers are faced with serious repayment problems.  The banks consider that this, coupled with the recent reductions in interest rates, should substantially ease the position.</P>
    <P>Following an approach from the Government, the ACC also have indicated their willingness to review the situation of farmers with serious repayment problems and, as in the case of the banks, to restructure existing loans, where appropriate, on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>5.  Reduced Interest Loans from ACC and Associated Banks</P>
    <P>In order to increase the incentive and facilities for productive investment in agriculture, the ACC and the Associated <Col N="1392" /> Banks, arising from discussions with the Government, are making available up to £100 million from foreign borrowings. This will be loaned to farmers at variable interest rates, originally in the range 13 per cent-13½ per cent but now somewhat lower.  The types of investment covered include additional working capital where the farmers' own funds are seriously depleted; the financing of increases in breeding stock; land reclamation and drainage; fodder storage and buildings for additional livestock; and assistance to young farmers taking over holdings for the first time.</P>
    <P>6.  Beef Suckler Scheme</P>
    <P>A beef suckler scheme, to be funded by the EEC, has been introduced whereby grants totalling about £6 million will be provided for about 60,000 farmers. Subject to Commission clearance, this will be supplemented by a national scheme of grants in respect of each additional cow in beef suckler herds.</P>
    <P>7.  Headage Payments in Disadvantaged Areas</P>
    <P>The rates of grants under the cattle headage, beef cow and sheep headage schemes have been substantially increased.  Subject to clearance by the EEC Commission the rates in the case of cattle and beef cows will be £32 and £28 as compared with £17 and £13 in 1979, while the sheep rates have been increased by £1 per head.</P>
    <P>8.  Sheep and Sheepmeat</P>
    <P>In view of the delay in the implementation of the common organisation of the market for sheepmeat the subsidy under the mountain lamb extension scheme was increased from £1.50 to £3.00 per head as and from 22 September.</P>
    <P>The common organisation of the market, for which the Government had been pressing, has been introduced as and from 20 October.  Under the new arrangements a compensatory premium estimated at approximately £7 per ewe in the full year but depending on the actual level of market prices will be payable on good quality ewes.</P>
    <P>9.  Aid for Warble Fly Campaign</P>
    <P>Assistance is being provided by the <Col N="1393" /> Government to keep the cost of warble dressing to farmers this year at last year's level.</P>
    <P>10.  Farm Relief Services</P>
    <P>The annual grant to Macra na Feirme is being increased by up to £20,000 per annum for five years to enable that body to organise and co-ordinate the establishment of local farm relief services on a group basis.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that the terms of the national understanding provide for a double payment for one week in December 1980 in weekly social welfare payments to long-term social welfare recipients and it is proposed that this payment will be made on 11 and 12 December, as appropriate to the particular pension or allowances.</P>
      <P>These arrangements have been made in consultation with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>Similarly arrangements have been made with that Department for the payment on Wednesday 31 December 1980 of pensions and allowances due on Thursday 1 January 1981.  Other pensions payable in that week will be paid as usual on Friday, 2 January 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">

      <P>: RTE say that they plan to bring a new high-power transmitter at Holywell Hill into service this month and that this will provide a two-channel colour service for a significant area of Inishowen. In addition they expect that the Fanad transposer will be equipped to transmit RTE1 in colour by the end of the year and RTE2 in colour next Spring, thus bringing the full 625-line services to western parts of the peninsula.  Plans are also in train to equip the Moville transposer to carry the full 625-line services to the remaining areas of Inishowen as soon as possible, but RTE cannot say at this stage when these transmissions will commence.</P>
      <P>Inishowen is not, of course, the only part of the country where an adequate signal has not yet been provided by RTE. Extending the television services to the remoter parts of the country is a complex task which cannot be planned or carried out quickly.  A particular difficulty so far as Inishowen is concerned was the non-availability of suitable 625-line VHF channels for that area.</P>
