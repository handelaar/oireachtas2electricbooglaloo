      <P>As I indicated in the reply, the report was submitted to the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  The initial examination commenced in that Department. Subsequently it had to be transferred and because of the change in the allocation of functions between the different Departments, the examination of the report, I regret, took longer than normal.</P>

      <P>My policy in regard to the question of the replacement of premises for two-teacher schools is to give special consideration to the circumstances of each individual school.  I should say, however, that, in general, the provision of two-teacher schools, which would represent an investment for the future, would not be warranted in the long-term educational interest of the pupils of national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of maintenance of national school premises is a charge on local <Col N="1609" /> resources and is, primarily, the concern of the board of management of the school.</P>

      <P>A census of pupils effectively enrolled on 30 September is taken each year. This date applies to vocational schools, under all vocational education committees. The numbers and grades of posts of responsibility in a vocational school for any school year is determined by the points rating of the school, which is calculated by reference to the number of pupils at 30 September and their ages at 1 February of the previous school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The task of the visiting teachers of the hearing-impaired is to give guidance to parents on the handling of their hearing-impaired children in the development of speech and language. The frequency of visits to each family can vary from child to child and from time to time depending on the particular needs.</P>
      <P>As the visiting teachers are highly specialised personnel they cannot be replaced by substitutes in the same way as ordinary teachers.  In practice, teachers who are absent due to illness or other causes are substituted from the common pool of visiting teachers by a reallocation of duties.  This arrangement has worked.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, due to unforeseen circumstances the teacher has been absent for an exceptionally long period.  Until she resumes duty, arrangements have been made for fortnightly visits to the family by two visiting teachers&mdash;one of them being the senior teacher in charge of the whole service.</P>

      <P>Might I raise a point of order?  This arises out of our attempt to elicit exactly what is Government policy in this area and out of conflicting speeches and statements made by Ministers and junior Ministers.  The point of order I am making arises out of the Chair's suggestion that a separate question be put down.  I would remind you, a Cheann Comhairle, that recently I put down a question in regard to a statement by a junior Minister on the Moscow Olympics, saying that our team were going there.  The question was rejected on the ground that it contained argument.  How can we raise this question in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Of this a sum of £680,000 was allocated to Dublin Corporation, which represents a high proportion of the total available for the country as a whole and is by far the biggest single allocation to any area.</P>

      <P>I was moving this amendment when the House adjourned the question last week.</P>
      <P>I am proposing that the subclause &ldquo;which is not a tour of inspection made by the inspector specifically to investigate an accident&rdquo; be deleted.  I should have thought that it would be as desirable for the factory inspector to be accompanied by the safety representative on a tour investigating an accident as on any other tour.</P>

      <P>As sections Nos. 36 and 37 are drafted, it should be clear that the safety representative and the safety delegate, plus the safety committee of which the delegate is a member, would be primarily concerned with preventive measures in the area of workplace safety. Where despite preventive measures an accident occurs, the inspector who investigates it will need to find out what caused the accident and whether there was contravention of any existing legislative requirements.  In order to get this information the person or persons employed, whom it is both relevant and imperative for the inspector to meet and talk with, are those directly involved with the accident&mdash;in other words, those who may have seen it, who may have been present, or who may have some information to offer.  That is the practice <Col N="1701" /> already followed by the industrial inspectorate. Unless the safety representative or safety delegate was one of the persons directly involved, he would not be in a position to give the useful information which would be supplied by eyewitnesses to the accident.  Therefore, his presence would not serve the inspectors twin purpose in making the investigation. It is not inconceivable that the safety representative or delegate might feel that he had some share in culpability for an accident and, indeed, his presence might even hinder the investigation if it inhibited those directly involved from communicating freely and privately with the inspector.  This has been the practice and it is a good one.</P>
      <P>In rejecting the Deputy's amendment I am bearing in mind the special nature and purposes of a tour made by an inspector specifically to investigate an accident and the fact that the practice followed at present to achieve the purposes of the investigation is satisfactory where the inspectorate are concerned.</P>
      <P>Question &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 60b:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) Before the commencement of any inspection the safety representative shall be informed of the inspection by the inspector, and shall be afforded the opportunity of a private discussion with the inspector.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is something along the same lines as the previous one.  It is to reinforce the role of the safety representative and also to protect the safety representative and give him an adequate opportunity to discuss with the factory inspector, in private, the safety measures at the particular place of employment. We propose here the addition of a further paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> If we do not make some provision along these lines the inspector could very will be led astray by the management of the firm who would have a vested interest in insisting that they had observed all the safety requirements when sometimes they might not have done.  It would be highly desirable that any inspection by the factory inspectorate should be notified at the outset&mdash;not necessarily in advance&mdash;to the safety representative at the beginning of the inspection and that he should have an opportunity to discuss in private, without anyone else being present, the whole safety situation at the place of employment concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My first point in reply to Deputy Mitchell is that I could not accept that the inspectorate could be influenced by anyone.  Since I came to the Department I have been impressed by the competence and the independence of the inspectorate.  I know that will continue in the future.  I am glad the Deputy has clarified a point because I was not sure from the wording of the amendment whether it referred to prior notice.  It is important that the inspectorate have the opportunity of deciding when they will call on a company, not necessarily giving advance notice.  That should remain the decision of the inspectorate. However, I think arrangements could be made on an administrative basis to ensure that the safety representative is informed before the inspector commences inspection.  I know the FUE will encourage their member companies to see that this is done.  In addition, the name of the safety representative will have been entered on the general register by virtue of subsection (4) of this section. Therefore, the inspector will know if a safety representative has been appointed and can ask that he accompany him on his tour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, subsection (3) will oblige the occupier to consider representations made to him by the safety representative on matters affecting the safety, health and welfare of the persons employed and such representations could include the fact that the safety <Col N="1703" /> representative is to be notified by the occupier before an inspector commences his tour of inspection.  With regard to the question of the safety representative being afforded the opportunity of having a private discussion with the inspector, it goes without saying that the inspector would be pleased to afford him such an opportunity since the inspectorate place considerable importance on the advisory role of inspectors.  It goes without saying also that it would be in the interests of the occupier not to frustrate the opportunity for a private discussion because he stands to gain by anything that will improve knowledge and awareness on matters of health and safety on the part of the safety representative and, consequently, of all employees.</P>
    <P>I believe the position is covered adequately. I am almost satisfied that this amendment is not necessary but as I want to ensure that the Bill is as comprehensive as possible I am prepared to look at the amendment between now and Report Stage.  However, I wish to repeat that I do not think there is need for the amendment.</P>

      <P>It highlights the approach of the Minister and the Government in not giving Parliament the seriousness and importance it should have so that legislation can be improved in the House.  If that importance were attached to it we would have a larger attendance in the House.  The fact is, there is never a good attendance in the House <Col N="1704" /> on occasions like this because Parliament is irrelevant.  It is not allowed to make any improvements.  The important question is, what does acceptance or non-acceptance of the amendment mean in the context of safety?  It is not important that I beat the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, or he beats me.  The important thing is, does the amendment improve the Bill?</P>
      <P>If we are serious about safety we must build up the importance of safety representatives, delegates and committees. Also, we must make them as imdependent as possible.  Because a person suggests prudence does not mean he is reflecting in any way on the factory inspectorate. On the contrary.  The factory inspectorate is composed of human beings like every other section.  I am saying it is a basic, reasonable requirement that when the factory inspector arrives at a place of employment, whether it be after an accident or on a routine inspection, the safety representative should be informed at the beginning of the tour so that he may have an opportunity to discuss privately with the inspector the whole question of safety.  It is not unknown for safety representatives or others to be afraid to express publicly their fears about safety precautions in case their employer might take it out on them because of the financial cost involved. I should have thought the Minister would have understood that very human possibility.  Probably it does not arise in most cases but it could in some cases.  It does not reflect one iota on the factory inspectorate or the safety representative but it betrays a lack of understanding of human behaviour on the part of the Minister not to make such a provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no surprise we have had to table an amendment like this but it was a major concession by the Minister to say he would consider it between now and Report Stage.  It is symptomatic of this entire Bill.  Some two-and-a-half years ago the Bill was put on the Order Paper because of the lack of a legislative programme on the part of the Government. It is interesting to note that the <Col N="1705" /> Minister has had to table many amendments to his own Bill.  In addition, he conceded that he will have to set up a working party to get a right Bill when this is passed.  The approach by the Government deserves to be highlighted and criticised.  There is little point in our going through the charade of a debate here, of trying to improve legislation when every single suggestion, however meritorious or non-political, has been thrown out by the Minister.  This has happened also in the case of other Ministers.</P>
    <P>This is a simple but important amendment. It provides that before the commencement of an inspection the safety representative shall be informed of the inspection by the inspector and shall be afforded the opportunity of a private discussion with him.  The Minister has made his position clear.  We know the amendment can and will be defeated. Alternatively, I have been told that if I leave the matter, as a concession to me the Minister may have a look at this matter between now and Report Stage.  I do not think that is good enough.  I want this amendment in the Bill, by fair means or foul, but I will not press it now.  I hope the Minister will take what I have said into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy strayed somewhat from the terms of the amendment.  I did not say that this Bill was the overall Bill where safety was concerned.  I said there was need for the Bill, for updating existing legislation.  The setting up of the working party is entirely outside the Bill.  The purpose of establishing the working party is to examine the whole area of safety.  I never claimed that was covered by this Bill.  I am convinced there is no need for the amendment but I repeat, in the interests of safety I am prepared to look at the points raised by the Deputy between now and Report Stage.  I think that is a fair approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to a proposal that was agreed jointly by the ICTU and the IEC.  It is to empower the Minister to revise upwards or downwards by regulations the number of persons employed in a relevant factory or other premises in connection with the appointment of a safety representative.  Before making such regulations the Minister is required to consult the representative bodies of the employers and the unions.  Clearly, regulations made under this subsection would have a direct bearing on section <Col N="1707" /> 37, safety committees, and section 38, occupier appointed safety representatives of safety committees.  To avoid any possibility of conflict paragraph (c) of this amendment provides that where such regulations are in force under section 36 the reference to &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; in subsection (7) of that section and in sections 37, 38 and 38 (1) are to be construed as a reference to whatever number is specified in those regulations instead of 20.</P>

      <P>Subparagraph (1) will entitle a safety committee to select and appoint a safety delegate from amongst those of their number who were selected and appointed by the persons employed in the relevant premises.  If the safety committee freely chose not to select and appoint a safety delegate they are perfectly entitled to make that decision and I see no justification for permitting the chairman of the committee to undertake the functions of safety delegates in the event of a safety delegate not being appointed in those circumstances. Further, should it so happen that a safety committee became aware of the impending visit of an inspector and while wishing to avail themselves of the functions given to a safety delegate where an inspector is concerned, had not yet appointed a safety delegate for whatever reason, there is nothing in the section which would preclude the committee from calling a meeting and appointing one of their employee members to be the safety delegate for a specified period of time, such as would be sufficient to cover the visit of the inspector. There is no question of any member of the safety committee undertaking the functions of the safety delegate.  The committee either appoint a safety delegate or they do without one.  At the same time there is no restriction in the section on the length of time during which a safety delegate must hold office. In that way contingencies may be catered for by making a short term appointment. That should satisfy the Deputy.</P>

In those circumstances the chairperson for the time being would have the same entitlement as the safety representative.  I understand the Minister's fear that this might be a way of not having safety representatives or avoiding their appointments, something I would not want, but it occurs to me that it would increase the power and status and authority of the safety committees and safety representatives in this area.

      <P>I move amendment No. 72:</P>
      <P>In page 25, subsection (9), line 31, to insert &ldquo;and are not a premises to which section 36 of this Act applies&rdquo; after &ldquo;applies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  While section 36 gives the right to have a safety representative in a premises in which not more than 20 persons are employed for the time being there is no reference in section 37 which would give the right to have a safety committee in a premises in which more than 20 persons are employed.  The reason for not having included a numbers qualification in section 37 is that the intention was to allow the <Col N="1714" /> setting up of voluntary safety committees irrespective of the total number of persons employed in a premises but if such a committee were not set up the occupier would have to step in under section 38 and appoint either a safety representative if not more than 20 were employed on the premises, or a safety committee if more than 20 persons were employed there.  The parliamentary draftsman advised me that there was a conflict in section 36 and the amendment is intended to dovetail the provisions.</P>

      <P>Suppose a firm employed 2,000 or 3,000 people they would need more than one safety committee. A safety committee of 20 would be satisfactory for a place that employed 100 people but a place such as the Inchicore works which employs about 1,000 people would need more than one safety committee.  Has the Minister thought about providing for such firms?</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point but in our industrial circumstances as the Deputy is aware, our numbers in any premises are not exceptionally high. The Deputy can take it that the safety committee provisions are adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision with which we dealt earlier whereby the safety representative is required to have, after two years, some first-hand knowledge of the type of work going on in the place for which he is the safety delegate.  In a place such as the Inchicore works, Asahi or Guinesses there are many different types of work in very big premises and I feel that they would require more than one safety committee, they would need departmental safety committees and safety delegates.  Will the Minister consider that aspect between now and Report Stage?</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's point.  At the moment we are not talking about industries employing 2,000 people but the history of Ferenka which employed about 1,500 people should be borne in mind.  Safety factors were one of the things that contributed to the situation at Ferenka which subsequently closed down.  For that reason the Minister should consider this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We had extensive discussions with both sides on this point. More than ten members on a committee might make them unwieldly, inefficient and perhaps not as committed.  I take the Deputy's point that what may be appropriate for one concern is not necessarily appropriate for another but a committee with a maximum number of ten seems adequate.  I am reluctant to bring in an amendment to change the size of the committee, especially to enlarge it because a proper representative committee of ten should cover the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a committee that is too big will not be appropriate but from my experience of serving on safety committees in very large employments it is desirable to have a central safety committee responsible for safety policy and also to have more localised safety committees in the departments.  Otherwise a safety representative is unlikely to be fully aware of the nature of the work and the hazards involved in so many different areas in places of employment. Consideration should be given to making provision for sectional or departmental safety.</P>

      <P>These amendments have been discussed in great detail with both sides of industry.  If any such changes were regarded as being necessary I have no doubt that those people would have pushed for them.  They did not do so.  It would be undesirable at this stage to consider it because obviously it would involve a further consultation and we want this Bill to pass through the House as quickly as possible.  Having had detailed consultation on these amendments, particularly with regard to <Col N="1716" /> the committee, the Deputies could accept the position as it is now stated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not be able to live up to amendment No. 67 which we have just passed.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>When reasonably practicable a person appointed to be a safety delegate shall have had, within the period of two years ending immediately prior to his appointment, experience in the work in which are engaged in the course of their employment the persons with whose safety, health and welfare he is concerned.</P>
      <P>How does a safety delegate so provided get experience in all aspects of the work in a multi-process concern where there may be as many as 4,000 people employed, as there is for instance in Guinness's Brewery, where the safety provisions now being suggested are already in operation?  I wonder if we should take Guinness's as an example and see if other large concerns are living up to that standard because otherwise amendment No. 67 is not going to be enforceable or practicable.</P>
      <P>There is also little merit in our considering this Bill here in this House if the implication of what the Minister is saying is that, having consulted with both sides of industry, there will be no change in the proposal and no further consultation and that it is accepted.  We should take every opportunity as the Bill passes through the House to discuss any improvement in safety suggested.</P>

      <P>In page 25, subsection (1), line 36, to delete &ldquo;one month&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of discussions with the interested bodies which I referred to.  It was requested by the Irish Employers Confederation.  The purpose is to extend the period within which the employer must provide a safety representative or a safety committee, as appropriate, in cases where employees have not done so.  The extension is to three months instead of, as provided at present, one month after the expiration of six months from the commencement of sections 36 and 37.  This will enable the employees themselves to select and appoint either a safety representative or members of a safety committee, depending on the number of persons employed in a factory or premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's statement that there is apparent agreement between the social partners on this point, I think this is a move in the wrong direction.  It weakens the Bill.  We are now going to give three months over and above a period of six months when no safety representative or safety committee or safety delegate will be appointed.  In other words, there would be a possibility of a maximum of nine months.  Seven months is long enough and I regret this amendment. The one month should stand.</P>

      <P>In page 26, line 48, after &ldquo;premises&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in each part thereof&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with making provision for large places of employment.  There are many of those in this city and indeed around the country, particularly in Cork, Limerick, Shannon and Ballina.  A general statement on safety from employers could be a very long one and therefore meaningless in respect of each place of employment, especially where there are different processes going on.  I do not know the lay-out of the Asahi plant in Ballina but I do know that they use vinyl chloride which is a very dangerous substance.  Obviously, in departments where such a dangerous substance is used there would have to be a very clear statement of safety policy and everybody in the department ought to be aware of that safety statement.  If this is to be included with a safety statement dealing with the maintenance shop or the offices or the distribution depot it could well get lost.  Therefore, I propose inserting here the words &ldquo;and in each part thereof&rdquo; so that the matter does not get lost in a very big statement or so that at least the statement would appear in each department.  It would improve the section under discussion if we added those words.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's amendment postulates a position where in every premises there would be a place in which the safety and health of the persons employed would be at risk.  This is obviously not true.  There will be parts of most premises which will not constitute an inherent danger to safety and health&mdash;for example, the place where people hang up their coats.  The requirement placed on the occupier under section 40 is that he has to specify in the safety statement the manner in which the safety and health of persons employed in the premises will be secured.  I can, therefore, assure the Deputy&mdash;legal advice <Col N="1719" /> has confirmed this for me&mdash;that, should there be a risk in relation to safety and health of the persons employed in any part of his premises, then the occupier must include the arrangements for safeguarding the safety and health of such persons in those parts of his premises in the safety statement.  If the occupier fails to do this, then his safety statement will not be an adequate one and section 40 (4) (a) empowers the Minister to require him to revise it.  The position is adequately covered without the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has stated, that the safety statement should include reference to the particular departments where there is a danger or hazard but in large premises one would need a comprehensive statement dealing with different hazards and dangers within each department. Employees of a big concern could not go through a long statement.  I am not pressing my amendment but I suggest that the Minister again consider the point I raised.</P>

      <P>In page 27, subsection (1) (b), lines 2 and 3, to delete &ldquo;if necessary be revised from time to time&rdquo;, and to substitute &ldquo;be revised as often as may be appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals specifically with the safety statement.  Subsection (1) (a) states that the occupier of a premises must prepare or cause to be prepared a statement in writing specifying the manner in which the safety and health of persons employed in the premises will be secured, and without prejudice to the generality of the former, the statement should specify the arrangements for safeguarding the safety and health of such persons.  My amendment seeks to revise the statement &ldquo;as often as may be appropriate&rdquo; and not &ldquo;from time to <Col N="1720" /> time&rdquo; as is provided for in the Bill.  The subsection I refer to is not strong enough.  With diversification in industry and changes in the use of machinery the safety factor can alter over a short period.  The statement should be revised as often as may be appropriate to the safety of the workers in the industry.</P>

      <P>This amendment was also put forward by the ICTU in the course of discussions which took place between the completion of Second Stage and the initiation of Committee Stage of the Bill.  It was explained to the ICTU delegation at the time that paragraph (b) of subsection (1), paragraph (a) of subsection (4), subsection (3) and subsection (5) of this section adequately met that organisation's proposed amendment. In other words, under the provisions to which I have just referred, a safety statement shall, if necessary, be revised from time to time.  That statement must be revised by direction of the Minister, in accordance with the specifications in that regard contained in the direction, in cases where the Minister is not satisfied that the statement is adequate and whether or not the statement had already been revised by the occupier. A safety statement must be given, in the form of a copy, to an inspector once the inspector asks for it.  On examination of the statement, the inspector will be in a position to advise the occupier as to whether or not it is adequate. If it is not, and the occupier refuses to revise it, then the Minister has been empowered to give a direction to the occupier in the way I have already mentioned.  In addition, the safety statement shall be given, as appropriate, in the form of a copy to the safety committee or every person employed in the premises.  This constitutes another check to ensure that the statement is adequate. The points put forward by the Deputy are reasonably well covered by the section.</P>

      <P>This amendment was put forward by the ICTU in the course of the discussions which took place.  The practical reasons behind the provision at paragraph (c) of subsection (3) of this section were explained to the ICTU delegation.  I should like to outline them again for the Deputy's information. From the eventual commencement date of sections 36, 37 and 38, employees will have six months in which to select and appoint safety representatives and safety committees.  If they do not do so within that six month period then the relevant occupiers will have a further three months, as a result of the section we have just passed, in which to make the appointments.  Therefore, there could be a time lag of between six and nine months from the coming into operation of sections 36, 37 and 38 before safety representatives and safety committees are appointed.  Paragraph (c) of subsection (3) is designed to cover this pre-appointment period and will ensure that, in such case, every person employed in the premises will be given a copy of the safety statement.</P>

    <P>The minimum of 20 people would not meet the needs to ensure proper safety. In recent years the emphasis has been on the creation of small industries and in many concerns throughout the country the maximum work force is 14 people.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, amendment No. 77 is a drafting amendment. With regard to the points made by Deputy Ryan I should like to state that the purpose of it is to apply the section to premises where &ldquo;20 or more&rdquo; persons are employed, as opposed to where &ldquo;more than 20&rdquo; are employed.  Amendment No. 77 is relevant to that being moved by the Deputy to this section with the aim of deleting the phrase &ldquo;in which more than 20 persons are employed for the time being&rdquo;.  Acceptance by me of such an amendment would have the effect of applying the section to those premises to which section 26 of this Bill applies, irrespective of the number of persons employed in them.</P>
      <P>It is not my general intention to expand legislation about safety statements to cover premises with less than 20 employees.  Apart from the fact that such premises are relatively few in number, comprising less than one-tenth of the total number of premises subject to inspection, there is the consideration that their small size would not normally necessitate the formal preparation by the occupier of a safety statement.  In such cases the occupier and the employees, being known to one another, could work out safety policy easily and informally among themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw Deputies' attention to paragraph (b) of subsection 6 of this section which enables the Minister for Labour to apply the section by regulations to premises additional to <Col N="1723" /> those referred to in paragraph (a) of the same section where any manufacture, plant or process is of such a nature as is likely to cause risk of bodily injury to persons employed.  Thus it will be possible for premises where the nature of the work is inherently dangerous to be brought within the scope of this section irrespective of the number of persons employed.  I have taken into consideration the points made by the Deputy in the amendment.  The amendment as outlined by the Deputy is not necessary but I am prepared to have a further look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <P>Further consideration has been given to section 51 of the Bill since completion of Second Stage.

In that connection the amendments have regard to the possibility of there being more than one registered medical practitioner designated by the Minister as industrial medical advisers for the purposes of the <Col N="1725" /> Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, while permitting administrative arrangements to vary the name somewhat, as for example to distinguish differences in grade.  They have a regard to a distinction being made by the Minister in respect of the tasks of industrial medical advisers in the event of there being more than one such adviser.  Also they have regard to the possible tasks of the advisers, permitting surveying to be carried out in the future where workers in the control group would not be exposed in the course of their employment to risk of danger to health.</P>
    <P>The reference in the singular to industrial medical adviser is being changed throughout the section where appropriate and is consequential on the terms of the proposed new subsection (1) which now permits the designation of one or more industrial medical advisers.</P>

      <P>This amendment was also put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the course of discussions which took place.  It was explained to the delegation at the time that this section was drafted in accordance with legal advice to the effect that its provisions should be permissive and that, in the circumstances, acceptance of the amendment was not possible.  Section 55 as drafted will enable information concerning factual matters relating to safety, health and welfare to be made available.  There are clearly serious legal obstacles to going any further than that. This in fact was acknowledged by my predecessor in the discussion document of 29 June 1977 in which it was stated:</P>
      <P>Employees have an interest also in the investigation by the Minister for Labour and his Department of complaints concerning non-compliance with existing safety laws. There are however serious practical and legal problems involved in making available information of this nature in cases which might ultimately have to be brought to the courts for determination.  In the interests of stimulating and maintaining worker involvement, the new legislation could give power to the Minister to reveal specific kinds of information consistent with the reasonable interests of all parties in the safety situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That quotation acknowledges that serious legal obstacles were considered in that discussion document.  When I examined the legal advice obtained on <Col N="1729" /> this matter I saw no reason to disagree with my predecessor's acceptance of it, and the terms of section 55 correspond to the proposal made in that discussion document.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to other provisions on safety, health and welfare in the Bill which are broadly designed for informative or helpful purposes where safety representatives, safety committees and safety delegates are concerned.  Under sections 36 and 37 safety representatives and safety delegates are entitled to accompany an inspector on any tour, or on any part of such tour, of inspection of the relevant premises which is not a tour of inspection made specifically to investigate an accident.  Safety delegates are entitled to make representations to an inspector on matters concerning the safety, health and welfare of the persons employed in the relevant premises.</P>
    <P>Under section 39, on the request of a safety representative, safety committee or safety officer, the Minister for Labour is empowered to cause an investigation to be carried out as regards a danger, or potential danger, to the safety, health and welfare of persons employed in the relevant premises and to communicate the outcome of the investigation to whoever requested it.</P>
    <P>Under section 40 the occupier of the relevant premises is required to prepare a written safety statement which has to be given to the safety representative or safety committee.  I might also mention that when talks are being held with representatives of both sides of industry prior to the making of regulations, as is required under sections 36 and 37, and additional functions for safety representatives and safety committees, I intend to have considered the question of disclosure by the occupier to such representatives and committees of adequate information to facilitate them in the efficient performance of their functions.  Effective communications and information flows in both directions should be the aim in any firm.  It should not only be the aim but the rule, where safety, health and welfare are concerned <Col N="1730" /> in the interests of both employers and employees.</P>
    <P>I have explained the position and the legal obstacles to the Deputy and ask him to accept the position.</P>

      <P>The main amendment here is the proposed deletion of subsections (3) and (4).  The amendment to subsection (1) is a drafting amendment and is clearly consequential on that deletion.  Subsections (3) and (4) have been reconsidered since the completion of the Second Stage of the Bill.  The Attorney General drew my attention to a decision that was taken&mdash;and with which he is in agreement&mdash;by the previous administration in relation to the then Consumer Information Bill, whereby a proposal to include provisions similar to subsections (3) and (4) of section 57 of this Bill was rejected on the grounds that such a course would be open to very serious objection from the point of view of public policy in the area of criminal law.  That proposal was, therefore, opposed as a matter of principle, apart from any other consideration that might arise.  It is on the basis which I have just outlined that I tabled these amendments.</P>

As any person guilty of an offence under the Safety in Industry Acts shall be liable to a fine on summary conviction, it is the District Court which is in question and trial by jury is not involved.  Therefore, my legal advice is that it is essential to fix a ceiling on the amount imposable for a continuing offence&mdash;that is, not to exceed £600 in all&mdash;given that, were the monetary penalty to go beyond that amount, the offences in question would be outside the jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>

      <P>This highlights the problem.  Parliament is continuing the practice of fixing fines which quickly become irrelevant.  Years ago when inflation rates were not very high that was all right, but lately inflation rates can be of the order of 20 per cent or 25 per cent and very quickly the significance of these fines is reduced.  There are still in law many Acts which impose fines which were relevant when they were enacted but which have become totally irrelevant, thereby subverting Parliament's intention.  We should consider having an annual indexation Bill which would update all these fines, including the authority of the District Court.  Obviously the fining authority of the District Courts should be index-linked. The maximum fine in the District Court is the same as it was several years ago. In real terms that fine is much lower.  I advocate that we consider having an annual indexation Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Local Government (superannuation) (No. 2) Bill, 1979 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When the debate was adjourned <Col N="1735" /> I had said most of what I wanted to say on the general principle of the Bill and on the principle involved in introducing retrospective legislation to authorise or to make payments.  I pointed out that it is provided in section 12 that sections 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10 shall be deemed to have come into operation on such day or days prior to the passing of the Act as may be fixed therefor by order of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I think I am correct in thinking that these sections have the effect of giving authority to the Minister to make superannuation schemes for local authority employees.  Section 2 gives that specifically.  Section 3 gives the Minister power to amend schemes regarding existing local government superannuation. Section 4 authorises the payment of gratuities to certain local government employees for non-pensionable service. Section 9 amends an Act passed in 1971, the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>As I said on the last occasion, I am very much against this type of legislation which legalieses actions that have been taken, payments that have been made and schemes introduced some considerable time ago, presumably on the basis that they will be ratified in due course by Dáil and Seanad.  I think it is setting up an extremely bad precedent which, if allowed to drift on, will lead to trouble in the future.  There can be little doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My argument is based on the fact that the Minister now in office, and I presume his predecessors, have assumed that Parliament will ratify these types of payments.  In the past we had the Department of Local Government, and the various local authorities were confronted with such things as the innovation of the five-day week and the lifting of the marriage ban.  Both made it necessary to operate schemes in a different way, and my understanding of the situation following the introduction of the five-day week is that all sorts of assumptions <Col N="1736" /> had to be made.  Particularly it had to be assumed that if an employee had the opportunity to do so he would have worked on the sixth day if work were available on that day.  Of course there was not any guarantee that the employee would have worked on the sixth day. Local authorities drew up a scheme on that basis, and we are now being asked to authorise the Minister retrospectively to bring in a scheme to cover that sort of situation.</P>
    <P>If the Bill did not contain these retrospective provisions a lot could be said for it because it makes the law regarding superannuation schemes much more flexible and it allows alterations to be made, if the need occurs, in respect of the instances I have been speaking about, the five-day week and the lifting of the marriage ban.  It also gives authority to introduce categories of employees who had not previously been covered into schemes and authorises local authorities to alter the conditions of qualification for superannuation or lump sums.</P>
    <P>In considering the Bill it struck me that the simplification of the formation of schemes might lead to frequent changes in them.  Indeed perhaps even superannuation and the conditions for qualification could be used as a bargaining weapon either by the official side of local authorities or by the employees and that too frequent alteration of these schemes could lead to confusion.</P>
    <P>Certain sections of a number of Acts will be repealed when the Minister makes the necessary order, Acts such as the Local Government Act, 1925, the Vocational Education Act, 1930, the Agriculture Act, 1931, the Pensions Abatement Act 1965, the Health Act 1970; the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts of 1948 and 1956 which are being repealed <i>in toto</i>.  In section 6 of this Bill the rights which have accrued under sections of Acts which are being repealed are being preserved to the employees.  In other words, it is stipulated in section 6 that the repeal or amendment of any enactment by or under this Bill shall not operate to reduce <Col N="1737" /> any pension and so on, that it shall not operate to take away any rights which have accrued already to employees.  It is very important that a liberal interpretation be exercised when deciding what rights have and have not accrued. Everything is not white and black in the measures which are being repealed; there are certain grey areas.  For example, I understand that certain questions could arise as to the rights of officers of local authorities who get married and who retire after marriage.  I think it is under an Act of 1956 an official of a local authority can retire after marriage if that officer has not opted for the new scheme.  I believe the question can arise as to whether a lady officer of a local authority could remain on for several years and then decide to retire and qualify for the retirement lump sum.  One interpretation is that if a lady officer has five years' service, if she intends to retire and claim the lump sum, she must do so within two years.  I understand that another interpretation is that, in certain circumstances, the officer could remain on for many more years and then decide to retire.  I should like to know from the Minister which interpretation he intends putting on the various sections giving rise to that situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, also makes provision for the granting of gratuities for non-pensionable service.  This is an improvement on the present situation but I should like the Minister to say whether that will cover, say, a person who has been employed for several years on rates, as they are known, but who is employed for virtually most of the year on a temporary basis.  Will that type of officer qualify for a gratuity <i>in lieu</i> of a pension?  Also what will be the position of veterinary surgeons employed by local authorities over a long period but who do not qualify for pension?  Will they qualify for the type of lump sum mentioned here?</P>
    <P>Those are some of the questions that occur to me and that we shall be raising on Committee Stage.  I can sum up my attitude to the Bill by saying that in so far as it is a retrospective measure going <Col N="1738" /> back over a period of several years, meant to ratify schemes that have been operated, pensions that have been granted and lump sums paid out without any statutory authority, I am dead against it.  I am sure there have been no abuses.  Nevertheless, in the sort of parliamentary democracy we have&mdash; which is the best type of government, bad and all as some people think it, yet found&mdash;it is necessary that authority be sought from this House and not as sumed or taken for granted.  If I am correct&mdash;and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;this Bill, and particularly section 12, is so drafted as to ratify things that have been done over several years, certainly since the introduction of the five-day week and the lifting of the marriage ban.  Therefore, so much for the principle of retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>As far as the individual sections of the Bill are concerned, I have raised in a general way the points that I would like to raise in more detail when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has come to us from the Seanad where it has been debated at some length.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick has indicated in his concluding remarks, it is essentially enabling legislation. The purpose of Second Stage debates in this House is to explore and debate the principle behind the legislation. Committee Stage is the period in which we go through the various sections.</P>
      <P>I do not think that anybody on any side of the House questions seriously the principle of pension schemes, particularly for public service employees.  Indeed, it is held out frequently by mothers and wise uncles that one of the attractions of the civil service is the pension. Therefore, on Second Stage in a debate like this there is not much point in trailing down through the various sections when we are going to get a reasonable bite at them on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had discussions with a number of people involved and we are concerned about why it has taken so long for this Bill to come to both Houses.  In his reply <Col N="1739" /> the Minister might indicate the reason for this.  The scheme basically was thrashed out during 1976 and I understand it was agreed in 1977.  This is not any reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, but increasingly the House has been asked to rubber-stamp in retrospect decisions that have been taken by the Minister of the day.  It might be more realistic to say the Department of the day, because frequently the Minister is not in a position to evaluate one way or the other whether it should be done.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of this House at all in authorising retrospectively actions taken by the Minister?  Let us suppose theoretically that we decide not to pass this Bill.  Does that make invalid the actions that have been taken by officials in the Department of the Minister of State? Does that mean that lump sum moneys will have to be repaid?  Is some kind of farcical charade taking place?  Does anybody seriously think that officials can be requested to return the payments made to them?  Does it not make a mockery of the whole process of an accountable civil service?  The issues raised in that kind of commentary belong to another place, another debate and another day.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the House, increasingly we are seeing this kind of legislation coming from the Department of the Environment. We had it in relation to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. That is another piece of disgraceful legislation from that Department where the Bill was moved ostensibly in December 1977 if I am correct in my memory&mdash;perhaps Deputy Fitzpatrick will remind me&mdash;and it was virtually a full year later, certainly six months, before we got the Second Stage.  The record shows that it was tabled for reading and introduced in the House in December 1977.  Again, there were bits and pieces of grants and regulations that had been authorised by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points which can be made usefully only on Committee <Col N="1740" /> Stage and not on Second Stage. Therefore, I do not propose to go down through the Bill at all.  Obviously, we are in favour of a pension scheme that can be negotiated with the representatives of the employees, but I have one question of a general nature to put to the Minister.  Frequently I get representations, as many other Deputies probably do, about people who cannot be employed by the local authority because they are over the age of 45.  If such people are taken on for more than a year, apparently the local authority in question would be contracting to take on an obligation with them which involves pension rights.</P>
    <P>To illustrate this I take the case of a woman who was a cleaner in Clonskeagh Hospital.  The chief executive of the hospital contacted me in this case because the woman in question was working as a cleaner in the hospital and she had a natural capacity for working with elderly people.  She got on exceptionally well with the ward staff and was nearly a sort of para-medic.  They were very upset because she could not be kept on.  They were looking for a replacement for her because the personnel department of the Eastern Health Board said that she was over the age of 45 and they could not employ her for more than six months at a time.  They were getting into all kinds of nonsensical arrangements whereby she would be employed for six months, then they would find somebody whom they could employ for three months and they would then take her back for another six months.</P>
    <P>That kind of anomaly is getting in the way of the principle of a pension scheme on the one hand, with which we all agree, and with the desire to maintain a certain degree of flexibility in employing staff.  Many of the population have to change their employment after the age of 45 and the local authorities and the State generally are major employers in this country.  There may be good technical reasons for the situation, but if technical reasons exist as to why somebody cannot be employed permanently after the <Col N="1741" /> age of 45, then those reasons have been created by the Department of the Environment and by the pension regulations generally.  I hope that the provisions of this Bill will enable local authorities to have discretion to take on such people and so avoid the difficulty that my local authority and others also have experienced.</P>
    <P>We welcome the principle of the Bill. We regret very much that it has taken so long to get here.  My colleague, the former Minister for Local Government, on a number of occasions asked questions in this House about when it would be implemented.  I conclude by asking the Minister if he will indicate in his reply, first of all, if he would envisage that this Bill would remove the anomaly to which I refer.  If he wishes to wait until Committee Stage I am happy to wait until then for that reply.  I ask him to give some indication to the House why this Bill has taken the time that it has.  I ask him also if he is satisfied with the basic implications behind this Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Quinn for their contributions on this Second Reading.  Both of them have been critical of the long delays involved and of the procedures followed, especially with regard to retrospection.  This could be a question of trying to have it both ways. This Bill was introduced because of the unsatisfactory position.  We want to make the changes and the changes being made will get us away from the position in which we found ourselves with regard to retrospective legislation.  The proposals in the Bill to move from having the detailed provisions set out in a statute and to have superannuation represented in a more flexible way by schemes are intended precisely to get away from the situation mentioned by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should expand a little on this.  The first big change in the superannuation framework laid down in the 1956 Act was the adoption of the widows' and orphans' scheme.  That improvement <Col N="1742" /> was adopted throughout the public service in anticipation of the legislation.  So far as the local services were concerned, the Department intended to promote legislation to validate this, but learned that further concessions were being discussed with the civil service which would also be applicable to the local services.  They became available in due course but only as an interim measure.  Further concessions were being discussed.  Later a large number of amendments were suggested to the Department by the unions, and a working party was set up to consider them. The working party, which is still in being, issued an interim report in 1977 which was also implemented in anticipation of legislation.</P>
    <P>It was against that background that we decided the old system of having all the conditions set out in a statute no longer worked.  We had no choice but to opt for a more flexible system of schemes which now operates throughout the public service.  It was suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick that we should have introduced a temporary Bill to effect these specific amendments.  The problem there was that we would have needed a stream of Bills and each one of them would have taken time, involving delay and hardship until after its enactment in order to provide the benefits.  In so far as we are looking for a general absolution for this, we have many good precedents for it, not least the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.  This Bill is modelled exactly on that one and account has also been taken of retrospection.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with the future and regulation by schemes is now the standard method.  It must not be forgotten that the schemes must be presented to each House of the Oireachtas and are subject to annulment.  The scheme will be flexible.  The questions raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Quinn can be better dealt with on Committee Stage.  The local authorities have a pretty wide scope to take into account the different problems which may arise.  By its very nature, the scheme has to be flexible. <Col N="1743" /> For example, in many cases veterinary surgeons with non-pensionable service will be entitled to qualify for the gratuity.  That will depend on length of service and other conditions. The local authorities will adjudicate. If the people concerned are not happy with the ruling of the local authority, they have the right to appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The main thing is that nobody has suffered by reason of the delay involved. I take Deputy Quinn's point that it took quite a long time to get the Bill to this stage in the House.  That is not my fault. I am not responsible for it.  Normally the business of the House is arranged between the Whips and there is pressing legislation which must get priority.  We wish the Bill had come before the House much earlier, but there was nothing we could do about that.  Entering into that debate leads us into a much wider field. As I say, no one has suffered because of this delay.  We will do everything possible to ensure that any unforeseen circumstances will be given sympathetic consideration.  The matters raised by Deputies can be discussed in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1980: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue the existing scheme of rates relief on agricultural land with certain modifications for 1980 and the two subsequent years.  Rates reliefs on agricultural land have been provided by way of agricultural grant under a series of temporary Acts, the latest of which&mdash;the 1978 Act&mdash;expired at the end of 1979. <Col N="1744" /> This Bill is necessary to provide the statutory basis for the reliefs in the present year and in 1981 and 1982.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill the rated occupiers of land holdings with a valuation of £20 or less will continue to be in effect fully derated.  For rated occupiers with land valuations between £20 and £33, no rates will be payable on the first £20 of such valuation.  Rated occupiers with valuations of £33, and over but less than £40, will be required to pay only two-tenths of the rates on the first £20 valuation and seven-tenths of the rates on the valuation over £20.  The cost of the reliefs, which are recouped to local authorities from the Exchequer through the agricultural grant, will amount to an estimated £37.725 millions in 1980.</P>
      <P>The change from the reliefs which applied in 1979 is that the ceiling on the valuation of holdings to which the reliefs apply is fixed at £40 in the Bill instead of being linked to whatever valuation threshold might apply to whole time farmers for income tax purposes on 1 January of each year.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out the basis on which the valuation of separate holdings in the occupation of the same person is to be aggregated for the purpose of determining whether the aggregated valuation is within the £40 upper limit.  This provision which is contained in subsection (2) of section 1 replaces a corresponding provision in the 1978 Act.  It indicates more precisely than the earlier provision how valuation aggregation is to apply. The 1978 Act also provided for the waiving by ministerial order of national aggregation in relation to any year.  Such orders were made in respect of 1978 and 1979 mainly because of administrative difficulties in implementing the aggregation provisions.  The need for such waivers no longer exists and the relevant subsections of the 1978 Act are accordingly being repealed by section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 2, 3 and 4 contain a number of purely technical amendments designed to remove doubts and facilitate the application of the agricultural grant reliefs under the Rates on Agricultural <Col N="1745" /> Land (Relief) Act, 1976, to land removed from county health districts and added to county borough, boroughs or urban districts by boundary extensions.</P>
    <P>I commend this short Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The net effect of this Bill is to abolish rates relief on agricultural land having a valuation between £60 and £40.  This is the major effect of the Bill, although the Minister reverses the position and says it is a Bill to enable the continuation of agricultural relief grants. It is no such thing.</P>
      <P>For as long as anybody in this House can remember relief was granted by the Exchequer in respect of rates on agricultural land.  In 1978 this Government abolished for the first time that relief in respect of holdings with a poor law valuation of £75 or over.  In 1979 that withdrawal of relief in respect of rates on agricultural land was extended by taking away relief on all holdings with a valuation of £60 or over.  By their first Bill the Government in 1978 saved the sum of £7 million and in 1979 they saved a further £2 million, a total of approximately £9 million per year.</P>
      <P>This year they propose to take away relief in respect of rates on agricultural land on all holdings with a valuation between £60 and £40 and perhaps the Minister will tell us how much money will be saved this year as a result of that operation.  Regarding farmers with valuations between £40 and £60 the following will be the effect: based on a rate of £12.35 in the £ a farmer with a valuation of £40 will have his rates increased this year as a result of this Bill to the extent of £271.60 and the farmer with a poor law valuation of £60, based on a rate of £12.35 in the £, will have his rates increased to the extent of £345.60. That is a summary of how this Bill will affect the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In plain language, this Bill represents another chapter in the move away from the Fianna Fáil manifesto published in 1977 in that it represents a transfer of <Col N="1746" /> the rates on private dwellings to the agricultural sector.  Under the heading &ldquo;Local Government&rdquo; the manifesto states that rates will be abolished from January 1978 on all private houses and local authority houses will have the rate element eliminated in the rent, as will tenants of privately rented accommodation. Rates will also be abolished on the residential portion of business premises, all secondary schools, bona fide community halls and farm outbuildings.</P>
    <P>Immediately this precious document saw the light of day a great number of people said that the rates would be shifted from the private house sector to the agricultural sector and to the industrial and commercial sector.  No sooner was that argument put forward than the then leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Lynch, was sent out to give a solemn assurance that this would not happen.  Just as he undertook that petrol would not be taxed <i>in lieu</i> of a tax on motor cars, he gave a solemn assurance that the rates taken off private houses would not be shifted to the industrial and commercial or the agricultural sectors. No sooner had they got into office on foot of this manifesto than they proceeded to do the thing which they had undertaken not to do.  What is this Bill other than a transfer of rates from private houses to agricultural land?  The Government saved £7 million in 1978 and a further £2 million the following year, making a total of £9 million, which represents a substantial portion of the rates removed from private houses.</P>
    <P>Rates were attacked and condemned by all sections of the community on the basis that they represented a form of taxation which did not have regard to the income of the ratepayer and his capacity to pay.  On that basis a good argument could be, and was, made against rates.  What do we find now?  We find rates being perpetuated, being continued in a more aggressive form than previously because here farmers with valuations from £40 to £60 are being called upon to bear the full brunt of the rates.  It is a wonder that the Minister did not say, in his opening statement, as the <Col N="1747" /> Minister for the Environment did on the last occasion, that these rates can be deducted from income tax for which the ratepayer may be liable.  He would not have the neck to say that on this occasion. When he was dealing, on the first occasion, with valuations from the maximum down to £75 and on the second occasion from £75 down to £60, he made that statement but here he is dealing with valuations from £40 up to £60.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who represents a rural constituency and who, is, I think, a farmer&mdash;certainly he has farming experience&mdash;must know that the great bulk of farmers who fall within the category of valuations covered by this Bill will not be liable for income tax. Their incomes will not be sufficiently high, with a £40 valuation, to attract imcome tax.  Many of them, being married people with families, will have allowances sufficient to wipe out any income tax that may be assessed upon them.</P>
    <P>This is simply a transfer of rates from private houses to agricultural holdings. It can be nothing else.  It is a shameful and disgraceful reneging by the Government on their promise to de-rate private houses, and the promise given on every Fianna Fáil platform in the country and by the man who was then being held out as their leader, whose word could be accepted and trusted, that there would be no shift from one category to another. The Government seem to be hell bent on taxing farmers without regard to the size of their income.  We have reached the stage now when farmers say that they are agreeable to pay income tax the same as anybody else, provided the same rules are applied to them, provided they get the same allowances for capital investment as their brothers in industry and commerce.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came to power they have introduced for the farming communities one system of taxation after another, none of which had regard to the capacity of the farmer to pay. They introduced the notorious 2 per cent levy which split this country and sectionalised <Col N="1748" /> it, drove townsman against countryman.  This levy was clamped down on agricultural takings&mdash;that is the best way that I can put it&mdash;irrespective of whether there was a profit or a loss.  In addition, in 1978, the Government increased by 33? per cent, and much more in some cases, the rates that were paid, again without regard to the capacity of the farmer to pay.  They repeated that dose in 1979 in respect of another category of farmers with valuations between £75 and £60.  This year they thought up another one which had not been thought of before&mdash;the resource tax, which is another additional form of rates.</P>
    <P>If the Government believe that the local authorities or the rating authorities are not doing a good enough job in taxing farmers without regard to their capacity to pay through the rating system, in addition to what the local authorities are obliged to take from the farmers, the Government come along this year with what they are pleased to call the resource tax, a tax of £3.50 in the £ on all farmers with a valuation of £70 or over, on top of the rates and certainly on top of income tax and levies. The principle there is very wrong.  That is another system of taxation which has no regard whatever to the capacity of the farmer to pay.  Hell has broken loose in the Fianna Fáil Party over this resource tax.  Indeed, I should like to be a fly on the wall at the Fianna Fáil Party's meetings this weather, and particularly those which are to be held this week.  I know for a fact that from a former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, in the higher farmer bracket, down to Deputy Callanan, representing the west of Ireland, they are dead against this form of taxation, so much so that the present Taoiseach is driven, just a Deputy Jack Lynch was driven in 1977, to say that there would be no transfer from the private house sector to the agricultural sector, to say that the resource tax is a temporary measure, that it is not going to be permanent.  The records show that income tax, which was introduced about the time of the First World War and amounted to only <Col N="1749" /> a few pence in the £, was introduced as a temporary wartime measure which would disappear when the battles were over and the war was won.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghn):</i> There are wars now, as Deputy Quinn says.  Wars came and went but the war has gone on between the taxpayer and the inspector of taxes year after year, year in year out.  There is no doubt about it, this resource tax will continue and can very easily be increased in amount and extended in operation downwards as regards valuations.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to fix the relief in respect of rates on agricultural land for 1980, 1981 and 1982. Fianna Fáil are nothing if not optimists.  They are doing everything in an effort to win the next general election.  It is obvious there will be another Bill and the figure of £40 in respect of relief of rates on agricultural land will be reduced to £20. Instead of introducing a Bill to extend rates on agricultural land they should abolish such rates, just as they should abolish the resource tax on agricultural land.  They should tax people on their capacity to pay instead of extending the rates system.  It is accepted that the rates are not a fair system of taxation.  They should be abolished completely.  In Northern Ireland, and I presume in England, rates on agricultural land were abolished many years ago and farmers are taxed on income.</P>
      <P>I realise the Government are in a financial mess but it is their own fault.  It did not just happen suddenly.  They are paying for the promises they made in the manifesto.  This Bill is a step away from what they promised in the manifesto. Fianna Fáil gave grants of £1,000 in respect of new houses but now grants are not available to instal toilets, to obtain water supply, to repair roofs or to add additional accommodation to houses.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not envy the Chair the job.  Obviously people get somewhat mixed up when they see a measure like this before the House and realise it is part and parcel of the now infamous package.  This Bill is being introduced at a time that is very bad for the farming community.  Whatever about any other time, certainly there should be no effort made now to introduce a measure providing for taxation without regard to income or earning capacity.  All sectors of the farming community are going through a very lean time.  This morning on radio I heard a farming report which stated that if the state of the agricultural community is to be judged by purchases of agricultural machinery and appliances as well as household appliances, this is a very bad year because such purchases have fallen dramatically. Farmers are not spending money because they are not making it.  Yet the Minister has been sent here by the Department of Finance&mdash;that is where the orders are coming from&mdash;to apply this form of taxation.  It is an increase in taxation of between £271 and £345 on agricultural holdings regardless of the capacity of the people concerned to pay. It is being done when it is generally accepted that the incomes of farmers are declining rather than increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil think that certain sections of the farming community will continue <Col N="1751" /> to stand by them.  That remains to be seen.  There is no doubt that this Bill is a shameful reneging on the promises made to the farmers before the last election.  I appeal to rural Deputies in Fianna Fáil to stand up and fight.  Deputy Gibbons said he fought last year.  He is on record as having said that the resource tax is an unjust and unfair tax and that he successfully fought it last year.  I appeal to the other Deputies representing agricultural areas to fight for justice and fight against discrimination because what we want is a system of taxation that will have regard to the capacity of the taxpayers to pay.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister tell us when this agricultural grant was first introduced?  I think I would not be far wrong in saying that nobody here would remember when.  If the Minister has the information he might tell me now but he need not do so if he does not wish to: what figure will be saved in respect of the drop in the grant this year from £60 to £40?  In my opinion, it must be much more than the saving in previous years because there is a far bigger band, a far greater number of holdings involved than was the case in previous operations.  In my county of Cavan I think there are only about 100 holdings over £100 valuation but I am sure there are several hundred over £40, although it is a county of small valuations.</P>
    <P>We shall have another session on Committee Stage and probably on Report Stage.  One could continue to talk at considerable length on this matter but it all boils down to spelling out as clearly as possible that this Bill is not a Bill to grant relief in respect of rates on agricultural land.  Of course that can be said, but everybody knows that it is a Bill to take away relief in respect of rates on agricultural land, that it is a Bill to impose further taxation without regard to the capacity of the farmer to pay, further taxation on top of the infamous 2 per cent levy and all the other levies, on top of the resource tax of £3.50 which we are told is a temporary measure.  It is a Bill to do all this at a time when <Col N="1752" /> agricultural incomes are dropping and when the vast majority of those affected&mdash;certainly if they are married&mdash;will not be liable for income tax and will not be able to take credit for rates against income tax.  They are being called upon by the Minister and obliged to pay this additional tax, varying from £271 for a £40 valuation to £345 for a £60 valuation based on a rate of £12.35 in the £.  They will be asked to pay that additional taxation entirely disregarding their capacity to pay, whether they are making or losing money.  They are being asked to do this to make up for the manifesto present given by the Government to owners of private houses some of whom are in the millionaire class and some having very large incomes.  The agricultural community are being called on to make up for the relief granted in respect of mansions all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In a way it is an anachronism that this Bill is before the House in its present form and that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is here carrying the can in effect for a Cabinet decision in relation to the budget on which we must vote tomorrow at 7 p.m., I understand, because the Minister is asking us in effect because of the historical nature of the Department of Local Government&mdash;now the Department of the Environment&mdash;to give effect to a financial measure which fits into the Government's overall financial programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One effect of the Bill will be to increase the amount of revenue that local authorities with large agricultural sections within their administrative area will get directly from the rates, because the Bill lowers the threshold of those required to pay rates now and those who will be forfeiting the relief and to whom Deputy Fitzpatrick referred.  While it is quite clear that one could have a budget debate on this measure, within the context of local government finance generally, we had the announcement in today's newspapers that 200 workers will have to lose their jobs because of a shortage of funds in one sector of the Minister's area of responsibility.  Here we have the <Col N="1753" /> announcement that people who previously had been exempt from rates will now have to pay them because the Minister for Finance is seeking to extract funds from the agricultural community and is not prepared to do it openly by means of a direct tax on farmers.  This is because of the way in which the Fianna Fáil party in opposition&mdash;and Deputy Gibbons was no saint in this respect&mdash;went out and pledged themselves prior to the last election that they would not tax the farmers, that the small measures introduced by the previous Government would be vigorously resisted by Fianna Fáil if they were returned to office.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil bought their way back into office through the ballot box and through a manifesto of which they are not now prepared to give out copies&mdash;if we believe what we are told in the newspapers. What the Minister of State is now being asked to do is to tax farmers through the back door.  This is one of the ways in which it is being done.  If Fianna Fáil were in favour of abolishing rates <i>in toto</i> on residential houses, on the basis that it was an inequitable tax, they should be in favour of abolishing rates altogether on agricultural land on the same principle.  Instead they are increasing the take from the agricultural community, on the basis of its land-holding, by means of a system of rateable valuations which everybody agrees is hopelessly out of date.  The basis of that valuation no longer bears any accurate relation to the potential or even resource value of any of the holdings.  So, not for the first time, we have a Fianna Fáil Government contradicting themselves in regard to their financial policy generally.</P>
    <P>As the Minister correctly said, this is a short piece of enabling legislation and the principle involved is quite clear: we are reducing the level of rates relief, going against a tradition going back to the thirties and twenties when smallholders in particular were exempted from this tax because of inability to pay.  That was the historical basis for it.  Given the nature of accountancy system at the time and of communications within the <Col N="1754" /> country then, it was the only effective way in which relief of this kind, which was necessary, could be given to this substantial section of the community. But this is 1980, not 1925.  Many if not all smallholders affected by this measure are members of co-ops or deal with co-ops and co-operatives are adequately equipped to enable any Department of Agriculture, acting in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, to begin to move towards a system of personal income tax for the farming community which would be based on their ability to pay.</P>
    <P>Regrettably there are two contradictory streams running through this Bill. One could argue that the reduction in relief of rates is an equitable measure, because many people with a holding whose valuation is up to £40 are in theory well capable of paying income tax and rates.  Many small businesses could be equated, in terms of volume and turnover, with a farm holding of £40 valuation and should therefore be treated in a similar fashion.  To that extent there is no reason or justification for granting rates relief on that basis.  It could be argued that there are people who will still retain the benefit of rates relief under this Act but who if they were on a proper accounts system and were running their agricultural business in a business-like fashion as far as accounts and the Revenue Commissioners are concerned would be capable of paying rates in addition to all the other taxes which would be payable by them.  But we have not got that kind of system yet, and the Minister in his opening speech made no suggestion that the Government were attempting to move towards it.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to the possibility that in time the nonsense of a Minister for the Environment coming in here on agricultural rates relief Bills would disappear and that the whole basis of taxation for the agricultural community would be put on a sound footing that would take into account, having regard to the technology of 1980, <Col N="1755" /> the revenue that each farmer receives and his or her ability to pay, after due allowance has been made for depreciation and other allowances which all agricultural enterprises would be entitled to on a comparable basis to that of a small trader or manufacturer.  There is no reference to any of that and to that extent the Minister and the Government have lost an opportunity to reassure sections of the farming community who can reasonably infer that with a drop of from £75 to £60 in the first year of Fianna Fáil Government and a drop of from £60 to £40 now in this year it is reasonable to assume that that downward trend will continue so that people with valuations of £30 and £25 can now expect to have a rates bill slapped on them next year.</P>
    <P>Agricultural production is subject to price variation in a way that even manufacturing industry is not.  It is essential if we are to attempt to move towards a planned economy that those sections of the economy over which we have some degree of control are set out and signalled with a certain degree of clarity that will enable people to plan. We cannot expect the agricultural community or the manufacturing community to try to make decisions about investment, about opting for one form of production as against another and evaluate the potential returns from those investments if they are not given some indication in advance over a period of two to three years of the likely balance of tax that would be due on the holdings they possess.</P>
    <P>The short Bill to which the Minister referred was matched by the shortness of his opening remarks.  While I appreciate that the Minister is not the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture or at the Department of Finance because he is doing the work of the Minister for Finance in implementing, ahead of the budget vote, the Second Stage of this Bill it behoves him to indicate the Government thinking in this area and how for long this kind of measure will come before the House. <Col N="1756" /> The Committee Stage will enable us to get into some of the mechanics of the Bill but in fact the Bill is, largely speaking, a straightforward enabling measure. Taken with the previous and most recent Act which was passed it is clear that it is simply enabling the Minister for Finance to pay less money to the Department of the Environment because more money will be coming to local authorities.</P>
    <P>By definition those local authorities who will now potentially be in receipt of extra money because of the lowering of the threshold of rates relief will, largely speaking, be local authorities of counties where there is a static or declining population or a population which is not growing in urban terms.  Counties which are not experiencing a growth in their overall populations or a growth in the demand for different kinds of local authority services will, on the basis of this Bill, be in receipt of extra finance because the tax base upon which they are operating will be enlarged.  The valuation base for the agricultural holdings which will now be liable to rates will be dropped from £60 to £40 if my understanding of the Bill is correct.  The Minister for the Environment, each year since the abolition of domestic rates, set a national figure for increases in the actual rate for every local authority.  Local authorities can only increase by 10 per cent generally.  If that figure is taken on a national basis, it will compound the distortions that already exist in local authorities where some local authorities can survive within the guidelines set by the Minister because of the nature of their tax base and because of the nature of the demand for services within their area.  Predominantly rural local authorities with a smaller demand for services than growing urban areas, because of the backdoor method of taxing farmers will have increased revenue. This proposal will enable the distortion of local authority finance to continue because the aggregate need for local authority finance taken nationally will appear to decrease because of this measure.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council cannot benefit <Col N="1757" /> from this measure.  No ratepayer in Dublin city, the corporation's functional area, will come into the tax net as a result of this measure, but 200 Dublin city workers will lose their jobs next week because they are unable to get any additional money from the Minister for the Environment because of the way in which the finances are being run.</P>
    <P>I am trying to illustrate the contradictions implicit in having a system of taxation for the farming community part of which comes under the umbrella of the Department of the Environment.  If the Fianna Fáil Party had the political courage to tell the farming community that they would be taxed as part of the productive sector in the same way as manufacturing industry we would not be discussing this kind of nonsense and we would not be involved in compounding distortions in the local authority financing system.</P>
    <P>I raised that second point because I believe&mdash;and I said so when the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill was going through this House&mdash;that the change away from the rates as they were then to the provisions which the Minister was taking upon himself at that time would have effects which would in time be compounded, with disastrous results for the autonomy of local authorities.  I also feel that this measure will, ironically, begin to have an effect on people in some parts of the country who would not recognise an agricultural holding if they saw it.  This is not just about taking some small farmers into the taxation net through the back door because Fianna Fáil have not got the courage to do so publicly by means of a budget or to say so locally in the various provincial, rural constituencies where Fianna Fáil Deputies went around in the last election claiming that the farmers would not be taxed.  It does not just affect that sector of the community.  It will distort the total amount of revenue coming directly to the Department of the Environment and will consequently affect the way in which overall funds are made available to the Minister when he comes to allocate an average percentage increase for every <Col N="1758" /> local rating authority throughout the country in the coming year.  To that extent not only is this a bad Bill from the point of view of the agricultural community, because of the fact that it takes no account of the ability of agricultural rate holders to pay the tax, but it is a bad Bill from the point of view of the urban community as well because it further distorts the system of financial allocation in the Department of Finance and in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>This is enabling legislation.  It is an anachronism that we are here discussing it at all.  It is because of that anachronism that the distortions will get worse.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to indicate if the Government propose to abolish the whole system of agricultural rates since they have abolished rates on residential property and since it has been argued successfully in the past that rates are an unjust tax based on an out of date valuation which does not take into account the ability of individuals to pay.</P>

      <P>It can be said that the Government have been consistent in their approach to the farming and agricultural community.  They have not lost one opportunity to extract the last penny from the farmers here.  This approach may have short term advantages. It might satisfy some of the urban people who believe that the farming section are literally digging up money.  It may pacify those people for some time.  It might help them to forget how they are being taxed. It might also help them to forget the way they are being priced out of existence with present price increases.  But it must never be forgotten that the agricultural sector plays a major role in our economy.  It is not said often enough. The amount of employment that is being provided as a result of the purchasing power of the agricultural community when that section is doing well is not emphasised.  When they are doing well they can buy goods such as machinery, cars and hardware and the producers of all these things gain as a result of the farming section doing well.  This increase <Col N="1759" /> in rates is a severe blow.  It is a bad joke for somebody to come in here and say that this increase can be set off against income tax because very few people affected by it pay income tax.  In my own community 875 people will be affected by this reduction in the agricultural grant.  Not many of those people are liable for income tax.  I am convinced that it is an insult to the farming community to tell them that they can set off this increase against their income tax because it does not arise, and that is something that should be said here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing I want to make clear.  Some public representatives are of the opinion that local authorities will derive benefits from the change.  That is not so.  Only the Exchequer will benefit; it is only a matter of the Exchequer not paying and the farmer paying extra.  But not one penny extra will be provided for mine or any other county to halt the dangerous pattern that exists here at the moment.  I would be prepared to accept an increase if I thought that the roads would be made passable for the people who are paying very dearly.  But as things stand the Government are just trying to get any extra money they can in the hope of getting some kind of a nest egg together at a later stage so that they can have a good year before an election. That is the only way we can look at it. That is accepted by the vast majority of people around the country.  But how can one expect the ordinary farmer to forget what he was told two years ago by the Government.  Members of Fianna Fáil went around at that stage and met the farmers.  They represented themselves as a kind of social conscience of the nation, the advocates of the farmers, the people who had a deep interest in agriculture. They spoke about our entering the EEC, about how important it was that the farmer would develop.  Many a farmer is now sorry.  They were led astray.  The people who were canvassing then convinced the farmers that they must be protected from a socialist Government who would continue income tax and <Col N="1760" /> take the last penny from them.  I wonder how the people who said all that are going to go to the country and say to the people that it did not work out as they thought, that they probably told a lie, that they are sorry that they could not do better.  The people are not going to accept that.</P>
    <P>I have a few interesting figures which I compiled.  In my own county in 1977 the rate account was £2,739,688 and the agricultural grant in that year was £1,943,586, at 24.11 per cent.  In 1980 the rates paid by ratepayers will amount to £4,117,400 or 31.9 per cent while the agricultural grant this year will amount to £1,330,000 or 10.4 per cent.  That is a reduction of almost 14 per cent since 1977.  Yet, we are being told that this is a relief Bill.  Any person over £40 valuation will not derive one penny in benefit. When similar Bills were introduced in the last three years we were told that they were relief Bills.  How can one explain to a constituent who has a valuation of £40 that this is a relief Bill when he will be faced with a demand of £494 for rates?  A person with a £50 valuation must now pay £617 compared with £310.</P>
    <P>It is time the Department came clean and told the people that they do not have any money.  The people should be told that because the Government cannot go back on their word in relation to domestic rates they must take advantage of the farming community and take all they can from them.  There would be some excuse for increasing rates if farmers were getting a proper service. The people who are being fleeced by the Government are those who were led astray for many years.  Agricultural instructors advised them to develop and bank managers called them in to encourage them to borrow.  Those people borrowed large sums of money but now they are contacting public representatives in an effort to have grants which are overdue for up to two years paid to them.  Sums of between £2,000 and £10,000 are involved and those people can present four or five letters from bank managers seeking repayment of loans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> We must tell those people that nothing can be done for them at present.  There is no incentive for any section of the community to develop.  How can our agricultural instructors encourage farmers to borrow for development purposes? If that suggestion is made farmers will either release an alsatian or go for a shotgun.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will take note of what is happening in the Department. I am anxious to place on record my disapproval of Government policies.  They are guilty of the greatest con-job ever perpetrated on Irish people or introduced in an Irish Parliament.  Before the Government pursue such policies they should consider resigning because otherwise they will do untold damage to the agricultural sector.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will be able to accuse me of telling lies in relation to what I said about the repayments from Agriculture House but if he attempts to do so I will present him with a list of names and give details of when the applications were approved and sent from Limerick.</P>

      <P>This Bill refers to relief but that is a misnomer.  It should be called a crucifixion Bill because it will crucify many small farmers, the backbone of the country and people whom Fianna Fáil have always claimed <Col N="1762" /> to represent.  They misrepresented those people more often than they represented them.  The Bill also flies in the face of the statements made by the Minister for Finance when he introduced his budget. The Minister told us that one of his objectives was to introduce greater equity in the taxation system.  Where is there equity in crucifying small farmers with a PLV of £40?  Where is there equity in a system where a single farmer with a PLV of £39.99 gets full rates relief while a small farmer with a PLV of £40.01 and 16 or 21 children does not get any relief?  There is no equity there.  The Minister for Finance told us that he was anxious to protect and improve the position of those on low incomes.  Surely a farmer with a PLV of £40 is on a low income. Last year it was estimated that the family income of a farmer with a PLV of £40 was £3,000.  That is less than the income of roadworkers or county council workers.  This Bill seeks to pounce on such unfortunate people.  The Minister for Finance also told us that he hoped to reduce Government borrowing while at the same time protect the source of economic growth.  Surely he is aware that small farmers have been in the front line of every war here, national, social and economic.  In the last war they saved our people from starvation.  They went out and worked without tractors to feed the people, They got little thanks from the Government.  The dead hand of Fianna Fáil is descending on the farmers since they took office in 1977.  It is not a coincidence that farmers got no increase in prices since 1977.  When we left office we had an inflation rate of 9 per cent and a growth rate of 6½ per cent, the highest in Europe.  Today inflation has more than doubled at 20 per cent and the growth rate is zero.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot expect the Government to do much for farmers because they are the Government who jailed them when they marched peacefully to demand their rights and a fair income for themselves and their families.  Rates are an unfair, unjust and iniquitous form of taxation that does not take into consideration the ability of the farmer to pay.  Millionaires with castles and islands or people with <Col N="1763" /> 12 houses let in Dublin city do not have to pay any rates.  I am old enough to remember President de Valera promising to derate all agricultural land.  He promised that when the rates were 3s 6d in the £.  The average rate today is about £13 in the £.  That is how Fianna Fáil kept their promise to the farmers.  We know that the Government need money and must get it from somewhere.  I do not see why they should try to get it from the hardest worked and worst paid section of the community.  Farmers between £40 and £60 poor law valuations come under that description.</P>
    <P>The Government are in a mess and it is one of their own making.  The Taoiseach is trying to distance himself from everything that happened in the past two years, and it is our duty to make sure that he does not.  If the Government cannot subsidise small farmers it is because they squandered the ratepayers and taxpayers money for the past two years.  They issued a manifesto and people were never to have it so good.  They gave the impression that everything was up for grabs and all one had to do was go out and get it. They abolished wealth tax for the well off.  The same Government who did that now expect that a small farmer in the £40 poor law valuation bracket will pay anything from £250 a year to £450 a year depending on the county he is in.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to have a mania in regard to subsidies.  They reduced food subsidies&mdash;lime subsidies, cheese subsidies and various other subsidies. We should not be so surprised that they have reduced the subsidy on rates.  We introduced income tax because, under Deputy Clinton, farmers' incomes had increased from £350 million to over £900 million.  The PAYE payers were carrying too large a burden. We believe in justice and equity and that all sections of the community should pay their fair share of taxation.  The majority of farmers, irrespective of what Gay Byrne or others may say, are ready, willing and at all times want to pay their share.  We had taxation for farmers with <Col N="1764" /> £100 poor law valuation and also the notional system.  I remember the speeches made by Fianna Fáil at that time which criticised us and said that farmers would not be in a position to pay.  I know what happened in my county in the last election.  They went around in the dead of night and told the people that if they were returned to power they would do away with income tax.  Unfortunately they were believed and now, what has happened?  They did not at any time tell the small farmer with £40 poor law valuation, whose income last year was around £50 per week, that he would be mulcted by them and that the subsidy on his rates would be taken away.</P>
    <P>We know that this is the worst possible year to expect farmers to pay any increases in taxation.  Their overheads have increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  The price of fertilisers increased by almost 40 per cent while the price of cattle has remained stable.  The small farmer in tillage is being asked to pay £250 extra in rates while the millers have already said they will pay from £12 to £15 per ton less for his barley.  Is that equity?  Is that treating all the children of the nation equally?  If it is, words have lost their meaning.</P>
    <P>This taxation is unfair and unjust because it does not take into consideration the ability of the farmer to pay.  I will give some figures from my own county.  If this subsidy was still being paid the rate for a farmer with a poor law valuation of £60 this year would be £304.96, but he is losing a subsidy of £266.84.  His rates are increased by that amount and he is paying £571.80.  This Bill is called the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill.  Have words really lost their meaning?  I should like to bring the Oxford Dictionary into the House, as another man did on another occasion, and see what the meaning of the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; is.  Does the Minister call a Bill that increases a man's rates and payments by £266.84 relief?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann rejects the administrative scheme for Civil Legal Aid which the Government is seeking to implement because</P>
      <P>(i) it has no basis in legislation and therefore cannot create a right to legal aid and establish an independent Legal Aid Board to administer it,</P>
      <P>(ii) it is not a comprehensive scheme,</P>
      <P>(iii) it is not a free scheme,</P>
      <P>(iv) it would deny a choice of solicitor to those seeking legal aid and introduce a dispensary system of legal services for them,</P>
      <P>(v) it would discriminate against rural Ireland and those living in small towns</P>
      <P>and calls upon the Government to introduce immediately the necessary legislation to establish a comprehensive scheme of legal aid along the lines recommended by the Pringle Committee.</P>
      <P>This is the second motion on civil legal aid which I moved in this House on behalf of the Labour Party urging the Government to implement a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in civil cases along the lines of the scheme recommended in the Pringle Report.  The first such Labour Party motion was almost exactly two years ago, on 9 May 1978.  We tabled that motion four or five months after the issue of the report.  A further 12 months elapsed from the date of that debate to May 1979 when the Government spoke further on the question of legal aid and announced their plans to implement what they described as a scheme of legal aid based generally on the comprehensive scheme recommended in the Pringle Report.  That long delay can be said to be indicative of the low place civil legal aid occupied in the Government's order of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> Why the elimination of such a fundamental injustice amounting to the denial of access to the protection and remedies of the law to those who do not have the wherewithal to pay for it, should not have been dealt with more expeditiously is very difficult for anybody with any conception of fair play to un derstand.  This is particularly so in the light of the very detailed recommendations outlined in the Pringle Report for the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of aid.</P>
    <P>While the Pringle Report made recommendations for an interim scheme, it is very clear to anybody studying the report, that they favoured very strongly the implementation of a comprehensive report.  They issued an interim report only because it was part of their terms of reference.  As I said, they recommended that the comprehensive scheme be based on an Act of the Oireachtas, that it should establish civil legal aid boards to administer the scheme and that law centres should be operated in conjunction with a legal aid panel of lawyers in private practice in respect of all types of civil court proceedings and tribunals. That scheme was costed at £2 million per year, a remarkably low figure in terms of the money spent on services generally.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has finally placed a scheme before the Houses of the Oireachtas we find it is based neither on the comprehensive scheme recommended in the report nor does it provide anything resembling equal access before the law for citizens of inadequate means. That is why this second Private Members' motion by the Labour Party has been tabled.  Our first objection, as our motion indicates, is that it is not based on legislation.  There is no doubt that the Pringle Report recommended that any scheme envisaged by them would have its basis in legislation passed through both Houses.  The Minister's scheme does not establish a right, founded in law, to legal aid nor can the board have the independence essential for the purpose for which they were set up and for the work they set out to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> The Pringle Committee provided draft heads of a Bill on the last page of their report.  If the Minister had given the subject the importance it merits he could have used or modified those draft heads. This would have facilitated a full debate in the House and would have made the Bill open to amendment.  That sort of discussion, amendment and input of views on legal aid is vitally important in a scheme which purports to cater for people who hitherto have not been catered for, and to meet needs in our society which so far have not been met. Instead, we have a scheme which has been described by Law for All, a body eminently qualified to pronounce on the scheme, as inoperable and a totally inadequate response to the pressing need for legal aid.  Before considering in some detail the scheme the Minister seeks to introduce, may I turn to some of the recommendations in the Pringle Report which have been glaringly ignored in the Minister's scheme?</P>
    <P>The committee were very strong on the recommendation that the scheme, as well as being concerned with the provision of legal aid and advice, should be concerned with the dissemination of information about the law and with research into establishing the nature and extent of hidden legal needs.  They were also strong in saying that the board should make an analysis of the results of their work with a view to making appropriate recommendations in relation to law reform.  That is a very important aspect of the work of a legal aid board.</P>
    <P>We are hoping to deal with bringing the process of the law to the people to whom it has been denied hitherto.  If we have a proper scheme we should be meeting new needs and identifying legal needs which up to now had not been identified because the people concerned did not have the capacity, the know-how or the money to bring their cases before a court of law or to seek legal advice.  It probably did not occur to many of these people that some of their problems could be interpreted as legal cases.  We are dealing with a very new area and we are <Col N="1768" /> hoping in any scheme of legal aid to cater for people who have hitherto been denied their rights or denied access to the process of the law.  For that reason it is very important that this analysis be done and that the information a board would glean in their day-to-day work, the meeting of new needs, the evaluation of the extent and depth of these needs, should be capable of being translated into proposals for law reform.  There is no means within the present scheme whereby this very important aspect of the work can be catered for.</P>
    <P>The Pringle Report recommended that there should be a considerable degree of flexibility in the overall approach to the scheme.  This is very important. We should have in the scheme an allowance for something we have not come up against before, a scheme that would be capable of being interpreted generously in favour of the people to whom we would hope to bring the process of the law.  That report recommended that legal aid and advice should be co-ordinated with all the social services. All bodies who have reported on the need to set up law centres were adamant that there should be close links between law advice centres and other social services.</P>
    <P>As I stated in this House two years ago when speaking to a Private Members' Motion, in private practice there are quite a number of solicitors who have not access to social services. In other words, they have to deal with cases which should be operated by the social services.  At present there is not a link between them.  I do not think that the proposed scheme of the Minister will strengthen any link there may be or make availability of the social services any more realistic for people going to legal aid centres.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Minister's scheme to facilitate the taking of test cases by social groups in the community. Far from facilitating this type of action, it appears to me that the Minister's scheme sets its face completely against test cases.  Indeed legal aid would be refused to a body of persons <Col N="1769" /> who would benefit from a test case for which legal aid would be given.  This is a very short-sighted and narrowminded approach to the problems of people on whose behalf a scheme of free legal aid should be available anyway.</P>
    <P>The Pringle Report recommended that a more flexible approach should be adopted to the means test.  A very rigid means test is imposed, but I will deal with that at a later stage.  It seems to me that in any new scheme such as this there should be a much more flexible approach than the Minister's scheme envisages. Indeed it seems to me the scheme is completely inflexible as far as the means test is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Pringle Report recommended that applicants should have a free choice of solicitor or counsel, and this is where the Minister's scheme falls down badly. There is no provision in it for a free choice.  There is a fundamental difference between availability of recourse to the law in this scheme for those who have inadequate means or who are without any means and those with the financial capacity to engage their own solicitors or counsel.  The Minister's scheme is very limited.  It will deprive people of inadequate means of availing of legal aid to the same extent as those with money.  If we are serious about bringing the protection of the law to people of inadequate means we should not have the blatant difference in the Minister's scheme between poor people and those with means.</P>
    <P>I will go into the Minister's scheme in detail and deal with some of the defects I see in it.  I have been helped in doing this by the sub-committee examining civil legal aid, the Law for All Committee. We are indebted to them for the detailed work they have done on the Minister's scheme.  I agree totally with the criticism they level at the Minister's scheme.  Their general opinion of the scheme is that it is totally inadequate to meet the need that exists in this area.</P>
    <P>Part 1 of the Minister's scheme deals with an area in which the Minister, if he were seriously concerned for the needs <Col N="1770" /> of the people who should benefit by a scheme, could have broadened the provision. It is true to say that excluding community groups could work to the disadvantage of people in the lower income group, particularly those in disadvantaged areas.  The scheme militates against the taking of test cases on behalf of such people.  That part of the scheme should be broadened to enable disadvantaged groups to take legal action to redress some of the more glaring wrongs in society.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Minister's scheme deals with administration.  The proposed board will not be set up by legislation&mdash;it is to be a Ministerial scheme and the board will not have the authority or the freedom that a body set up by legislation would have.  The Minister would be given a power which to my mind is unusual&mdash;I have not been able to do the necessary research on all the other boards set up by Acts of the Oireachtas&mdash;and it seems to me that in respect of this board the Minister will have the power to remove a member from office for all the usual reasons, but he will also have the power to remove from office a member whose removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the board of its functions.</P>
    <P>This seems to be a very wide power indeed.  I have compared the powers of the Minister in regard to this board with his powers over the Adoption Board set up under the 1952 Act and I have found in the First Schedule to the Act that the Government may remove a member from office for stated misbehaviour, incapacity or failure to attend meetings of the board.  They are stated, specific grounds for removal from office of a member of the board, but to give the Minister power to remove a member from the board when it appears to the Minister to be necessary for the performance by the board of its functions is a very wide and vague power.  I am not quite sure if such a power as this applies to other boards.  I do not think it is the type of power the Minister should give to himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" /> There is reference to the question of funding.  The establishment of the service throughout the country is a matter in respect of which the board should be and could be given discretion without reference to the Minister in all cases.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section in Part 3, the section dealing with legal aid and advice, it is laid down in the scheme that legal advice is excluded in a civil bill case where the amount involved is under £20. Indeed it is laid down also that it is excluded in the case of legal aid for civil bills, that is, where the amount involved is less than £150.  I do not know what are the merits of this restriction.  It may be thought that legal aid could be sought in respect of frivolous cases.  But it seems to me that even in these days of inflation £20 in the case of advice and £150 constitute no mean figures in so far as some of the people we would be seeking to serve under a legal aid scheme are concerned. I am thinking in terms of people on pensions, people in receipt of social welfare, many of whom I am quite sure never saw £150 in their lives.  This seems to be a very unnecessary restriction in this scheme.  There are several safeguards in the scheme already and it would seem that these £20 and £150 restrictions should not be included.</P>
    <P>Of course tribunals should not be excluded, as they are under the scheme, because tribunals and social welfare cases generally are the areas of very great importance, sometimes of most importance and most relevance to many of the people who would be seeking legal aid under the scheme.  A lot of the matters which relate mostly to their lives, with which they would be most familiar, in the area in which they would perceive wrong most freely are excluded from the scheme.  This should not have happened.</P>
    <P>In Part 3 there is provision also that applicants must show that they are reasonably likely to succeed.  In effect that places the onus on the legal aid applicant to show, first of all, that he has a <i>prima facie</i> case before he can get to court.  I do not think that is correct either.  I understand that there must be <Col N="1772" /> some restrictions but it would seem to me that this, like many other provisions of the scheme, draws a distinct line between the type of legal service that would be available to people who seek legal aid as opposed to those who can afford to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Test cases are excluded also.  That is a totally unwarranted exclusion because they constitute the method by which a lot of wrong can be redressed.  To exclude test cases from a scheme such as this, to make it impossible to get legal aid, to qualify for legal aid for the purposes of a test case, or in the case where a group of people may benefit from the success of a case mitigates against the righting of some of the deeper wrongs in our society and is certainly against the whole spirit of what a legal aid scheme ought to be.</P>
    <P>Then there is the outrageous suggestion that the applicant, or his lawyer, should inform the other side that he has actually applied for legal aid on behalf of his client.  Certainly it is a delaying tactic. I do not see how it can possibly be necessary to the satisfactory working of the scheme.  It constitutes a grave invasion of the privacy of the individual seeking legal aid.  In any scheme such as this above all we must always have regard to the dignity of the person who must rely on a scheme of legal aid to have redress before the law.  The process of the law is slow enough as it is; we are all already aware of that.  But the requirement that a solicitor on behalf of a client must inform the other party that the application is made, and further inform the party again of the other party to the case that legal aid has been granted suggests an even bigger invasion of privacy and an unwarranted delay in processing the cases of legal aidedclients; I think it is twice that the approach has to be made to the opposing side.  I do not see the necessity for letting the opposing side know at all.  It is against the spirit of any scheme such as this that the opposing side should know that legal aid is applied for and again that it has been granted.  Of course the position is that the opposing side can object, <Col N="1773" /> can state reasons that legal aid should not be given; possibly it would be in the interests of the opposing side to object.  Even if it were not, there is certainly the over-riding question of delay and of invasion of privacy in regard to this.  It is an outrageous inclusion in the Minister's scheme as laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is also the question that the board will not grant a certificate in relation to any proceedings taken in a court other than the lowest court having jurisdiction in relation to these proceedings.  Again there is a distinct difference being drawn between people who have to apply for legal aid and those who can afford to pay their own legal costs.  As far as I can see there is no discretion given the board in this regard, no discretion to waive that requirement; it is imperative that the proceedings are taken in the lowest court of jurisdiction, particularly where the question of jurisdiction of the court is not revised, where the jurisdiction is so low and where it can have a detrimental effect.  I am thinking here particularly of the question of barring orders as they apply to family law cases, where a barring order in the Circuit Court is limited to three months.  That is the limit of the redress of a person who must rely on legal aid as opposed to the person who can take his case to the High Court.  The same question arises in regard to maintenance orders the limitation on the amount of maintenance one can receive. That might be considered to be somewhat unrealistic in so far as people in that category possibly would not be applying for very large sums, or be able to get large sums of maintenance anyway.  But it seems that again a distinction is being drawn between the legal-aided person and the person who does not need such, that it is being carried throughout this scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of unnecessary bureaucracy throughout the whole scheme in which any expenses involved in regard to witnesses, experts and so on must be approved by the Minister for Justice and presumably also by the <Col N="1774" /> Minister for Finance.  One can envisage this being a very slow process, that the already slow process of the law will be rendered slower still in the case of those people who would seek advice under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the law centre.  Law centres are very limited.  I shall have more to say about them if time permits.  For example, if the law centre decides that a person has no case there appears to be no provision for the applicant appealing that decision; if there is no case on financial grounds there appears to be no provision for the applicant appealing his case.  Indeed this runs throughout all our laws as they apply to other matters.  Neither is there any provision for the applicant receiving a detailed statement of the reasons for his case having been turned down.  That runs through all our schemes&mdash;the social welfare schemes, in respect of, say, applicants for unemployment benefit, disability benefit, who when their appeals are refused by an appeals board generally receive a blanket statement saying they are refused.  There is the same thinking running through this scheme, that an applicant has no right to know why his case did not succeed nor is he afforded any facility to appeal his case directly in the event of its being turned down at the outset.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in regard to financial eligibility for the scheme.  There is the question of the resources of both spouses being taken into account.  That might be considered to be a very reasonable way of handling things, particularly where the spouses are living together or, even where they are living apart, if one is being maintained by the other.  But it is not stretching the imagination too far to maintain that there could be cases where both spouses might not agree, where the spouse who had the income might not be at all disposed to financing the other spouse's case.  We should treat people as individuals in their own right and not suggest that because they are spouses they are somehow inextricably mixed up and have no visible individual interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> There is provision for income for qualification for the scheme to be reassessed while in receipt of legal services or within a reasonable time thereafter, Section 5.2.8 of the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice allows for higher contributions only if the income has gone up.  There seems to be no corresponding allowance in the case of one's income decreasing.  The whole thing is punitive and works more or less to prevent people from getting legal aid rather than facilitating them to qualify.</P>
    <P>Regarding payment by instalments, except in very exceptional cases this is not allowed.  This again is a hard-line attitude particularly here where there is already a very rigid means test.  The Pringle Committee in the case of income as opposed to capital stated that payment could be made in instalments spread over a two-year period.</P>
    <P>The scheme suggests that the only redress open to people under it is the service of solicitors in the law centres.  Eligible persons are qualified without regard to the area from which they come.  That is fair enough, but it could work towards the establishment and retention of a limited number of law centres where people seeking legal aid would be forced to travel long distances to seek legal aid, if they had the capacity, financial or otherwise.  While there is some very limited choice in so far as they may go to any law centre, there is another punitive provision that if they go to a law centre other than that nearest to them and the consequences are higher costs, they could themselves be liable for those costs.</P>
    <P>There are several restrictions running right through this which are not consistent with the spirit of a free legal aid scheme.  The board are allowed to establish some part-time services in addition to the law centre.  I do not know what is envisaged here, but it would seem that part-time services for the provision of free legal aid would not be a satisfactory way of going about it.  People providing part-time services, were they of very high calibre whose work-load <Col N="1776" /> was already very heavy, could be expected, without any reflection on themselves&mdash;or perhaps in danger of bringing reflection on themselves&mdash;to give minimal attention to legal aid cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proposed to set up consultative committees.  It is difficult to know what is the purpose of these consultative committees.  The idea is a good one if they are to be given some definable function, but under this scheme the consultative committees have no function and no power.  They may talk about cases but there is very little else they can do to assist in the administration of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding applicants' qualifications for inclusion under the scheme there is the objectionable provision that lawyers operating the scheme are charged with notifying the board of any change in the applicant's means or any developments which might render the applicant ineligible for legal aid.  That is not consistent with trust between a lawyer and his client.  Under this scheme a lawyer is placed in a position where he would have to watch his client very closely as the client relates details of the case to ensure that there is no improvement in means. The client has to watch himself while speaking to the lawyer.  If a client informs a lawyer of any minor improvement in his means it is the lawyer's job to notify the board and so deprive the client of his legal aid.  I agree that in a limited scheme, confined or means tested, there would have to be some control or some knowledge of the income of those qualifying, but to place the lawyer in the invidious position of having to notify the board and also of collecting the costs militates against the building up of trust and confidence between lawyer and client.  Also it puts the client in a position very inferior to that of the client who has the money to pay for his own case.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the means test.  The figures laid down for the assessment of what is determined disposable income are those which were worked out and listed in the Pringle Report issued two years ago.  The deductions in respect <Col N="1777" /> of dependants, travel to work, rent and so on were less than realistic even then. To suggest today that the deduction in respect of an adult dependant would be £9.50 per week and for a child dependant £4.75 per week is totally unrealistic. We talk about allowances for such persons under the social welfare code and how inadequate they are and how out of touch with what is held to be adequate and reasonable in other schemes.  Even compared with the Social Welfare allowances, these allowances of £9.50 for a spouse and £2 for travel expenses to and from work do not stand up.  One gallon of petrol costs almost £2 now.  The allowance for hire purchase payments is £2.  Hire purchase payments for people applying for aid under this scheme can be a very big part of their initial outlay.  They do not have the capital to buy things and HP is part of their lives.  The means test does not bear any resemblance at all to what it costs to keep dependants today.  Here again is the same punitive thinking.  Income tax is deducted in respect of the past year. With inflation, income tax might be expected to be higher in any year than it was in the previous year, although I hope the trend will be the other way in future.  The income itself is based on what might be expected to be earned in the following year.  Therefore, we have two standards here, one in respect of outgoings and one in respect of income, all geared to maximise the income which the person applying for legal aid is deemed to have.</P>
    <P>This scheme is by no means a proper one.  It denies clients applying for legal aid a choice of lawyer.  It denies them the very areas of action, such as social welfare, where it might be very important for them to have a tribunal.  It is not a free scheme and it is severely and unrealistically means tested.  Another provision in the means test is a 25 per cent reduction per year for the value of a car which might be used in the course of the applicant's work.  Every effort is made to bring the income of the person applying for legal aid up as high as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> The scheme is totally restrictive.  It will in no way provide a scheme of aid for people who need assistance from the State on a comparable basis to schemes available to other sections of the community. It fails on all fronts.  It has no basis in legislation.  It will be a dispensary type scheme for the poorer sections of the community and it will discriminate against rural Ireland because there is no way in which it can be made available to people in remote areas.  For all these reasons I ask the House to reject the Minister's scheme and to implement this comprehensive scheme for legal aid based on the Pringle Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;&ldquo;expresses its confidence in the Minister for Justice in relation to the exercise by him of his functions in regard to the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to make one preliminary point before dealing with the specific criticisms of the civil legal aid scheme set out in the motion.  I wonder if the Deputies who framed the motion have read the published civil legal aid scheme at all.  I say that with all the respect I can muster for Deputy Mrs. Desmond.  The bulk of what has been said is simply not true.  This is readily ascertainable.</P>
      <P>For instance, it is not correct to say, as paragraph (i) of the motion does, that a non-statutory scheme cannot create a right to legal aid.  It is quite well established that a scheme of this kind which has been approved by the Government, published and presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas does create legal rights.  I should like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the scheme of compensation for personal in juries criminally inflicted which is also a non-statutory scheme.  That scheme was the subject of consideration by the High Court in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case in question was Hayes <i>versus</i> the Criminal Injuries Compensation <Col N="1779" /> Tribunal when an applicant for compensation sought an order, <i>certiorari,</i> to challenge a decision of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Not only is it clear from this case that persons have a legally enforceable right to compensation under the scheme but that it was never contended by the tribunal or the State that the position was otherwise, despite the fact that that scheme is not only non-statutory but also that compensation under it is on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  It could be argued that the legal aid scheme is more definite in creating rights since the assistance is not being given on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.</P>
    <P>It is also not true to say that the Legal Aid Board cannot be independent without a legislative basis.  The Board will be independent from me and from my Department.  The scheme specifically prevents me from exercising any power or control in relation to any case with which the board is or may be concerned. The board will operate in precisely the same way as if the scheme was a statutory one.  It is inconceiveable that I, as Minister for Justice, or any other Minister for Justice, would attempt to interfere in the performance of the board's functions in breach of the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In stating my complete confidence that the non-statutory nature of the scheme does not deny any person his rights, or in any way affect the independence of the board, I am not seeking to justify keeping the scheme on this basis permanently.  It is my intention that the scheme should be put on a statutory basis as soon as a reasonable period of operational experience has been gained.  That is a perfectly reasonable approach to an entirely new and complex service.  It is also an approach which will enable the scheme to become operational, by which I mean services will be made available&mdash;far more quickly than if the very extensive and complicated legislation had to be enacted beforehand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> It is also wrong to say that the scheme is not comprehensive.  I do not want to get involved in semantics but among people who are familiar with the legal aid schemes of other countries our scheme could only be described as comprehensive. It is comprehensive in the sense that it is based on the comprehensive scheme outlined in the Pringle Report as distinct from the interim scheme outlined in that report or, in other words, in the sense of not being confined to particular areas of law.</P>
    <P>In certain respects&mdash;for example, eligibility limits&mdash;the scheme is more comprehensive in its provisions in comparison with the committee's recommendations. Certain proceedings are excluded on the grounds that they are inherently unimportant, or that the provision of legal aid in such cases could lead to abuse in relation to the fundamental purpose of the scheme.  I must emphasise that there is no scheme anywhere in the world of which I am aware that is so comprehensive as not to exclude some cases.  Even in countries which have not the same limitations as to resources as we have, it is common practice to exclude certain categories.  I wonder can the movers of the Labour Party motion be serious in suggesting legal aid should be free?  Of course the scheme is not a free scheme.  It was never intended to be and the Pringle Committee did not recommend that it should be.  No country in the world has a totally free legal aid scheme for the very good reason that such a scheme would be an invitation to economic waste and abuse of the legal and judicial institutions.</P>
    <P>I shall have more to say about the need to protect the taxpayers' interest, but quite apart from the financial aspect of providing a totally free service, it is obviously desirable to have some system of contribution so as to avoid the demand for and the granting of expensive services which on any just basis are unnecessary or likely to be abused.  The system of contribution provided for in the scheme is a just one and in some respects it is more generous than what was recommended in the Pringle Report. <Col N="1781" /> It enables a spouse's income to be ignored in a family law case and also enables the board to waive contributions in certain cases of severe hardship.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the criticisms which have been levelled at the scheme on the ground that services under it are to be provided exclusively by salaried solicitors in law centres rather than partly by solicitors in private practice.  Let us be very clear about this.  The Government decision in this regard was aimed principally at keeping the financial effects of the scheme under control.  We were concerned with the possibility that without this feature the scheme might take off, as it were.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to spell out for Deputies how this could happen, nor do I think it necessary to be apologetic because the protection of taxpayers loomed large in our considerations of this matter.  That aspect apart, I am fully convinced that the provision of services through centres is the best way of meeting the real needs of our people.</P>
    <P>The Pringle Report stressed the suitability of centres for serving the needs of people in less affluent circumstances, particularly those residing in larger population centres, in other words, the majority of working people and their families who, I anticipate, will comprise the vast bulk of beneficiaries under the scheme.  The Pringle Report mentions the reluctance of socially underprivileged persons to approach solicitors because they often find the atmosphere of a solicitor's office intimidating, creating, as it were, a psychological barrier between socially deprived clients and the solicitor.  The decision to concentrate on providing legal aid and advice through centres was a conscious one and a very conscious attempt to make these services available close to the source of demand, whereas traditionally solicitors' offices in this country are generally located in the central business areas in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the specific criticisms made in paragraphs 4 and 5 of <Col N="1782" /> the Labour Party motion.  It is not correct to say that a choice of solicitor cannot be provided under the scheme.  The scheme at section 7(1) formally sets out the right of an applicant to a choice of solicitor and goes on to deal with the machinery for providing such a choice. To say the least, it is not helpful to use such expressions as &ldquo;dispensary system&rdquo;.  I cannot see what purpose the movers of the motion could have in trying to create a bad image of the type of service to be provided even before the centres are operational.  Apart from being discouraging to the Legal Aid Board who are charged with the operation of the centres, this view is also totally lacking in appreciation of present trends in the provision of legal services.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would point out that one of the most important recommendations in a recent UK report, that of the Royal Commission on Legal Services, was in favour of the extension of the centre system in that country.  The summary of that report states:</P>
    <P>The Commission remarked that the effect and influence of law centres had been out of proportion to their number.  They had proved their worth and were here to stay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not arguing against law centres.  We want both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to come to grips with what the Deputy was arguing about because it is obvious that whoever advised on the putting together of this motion would do well to read what has been published on this subject.</P>
      <P>The summary of the report further states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, they were found to operate under a number of disadvantages, in particular that they were often dependent for funds on local authorities with whom their work might bring them in conflict.  The Commission therefore proposed that there should be established a system of law centres, to be known as citizens' law centres, financed out of <Col N="1783" /> central rather than local government funds and administered under approved guidelines by a small agency operating independently of the government.  The functions of the citizens' law centre, which should have a local advisory committee, should be to provide legal advice, assistance and representation to those in its locality, with special emphasis on social welfare law.</P>
    <P>As to the number and spread of the centres, I have never suggested that the need for legal services will be met by setting up a pre-determined number of centres.  The Government's intention is to meet the need that exists and it will be a matter for the Legal Aid Board to decide upon and establish, with my consent, the number of centres they want. Obviously, they must make a start somewhere and I recently gave my consent to the establishment of two centres in Dublin and one each in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Sligo. This does not preclude the board from coming to me at any time in the future for approval to establish centres in other locations.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to admit that at the end of the day there may be problems of accessibility in remote areas, but I would point out that the problem of accessibility arises in relation to all State services for people living in rural areas.  I have no doubt that these problems in regard to legal aid will be tackled and solved.  The most important point is that services will be available to all who need them and qualify in them. Far from decrying the means adopted under the scheme, we can take pride in the tart which has been made in the introduction of an entirely novel service which needs to be approached very carefully because of its serious potential financial implications.  I am satisfied that in this scheme we are striking the right balance.  It is hardly necessary to say that we must crawl before we can learn to walk.</P>
    <P>I understand that the board have made substantial progress in their efforts <Col N="1784" /> to get the scheme operational and they are well advanced in the matter of recruiting staff and acquiring accommodation. They share my concern to have services provided to the people who need them at the earliest possible date.  It is not good enough to criticise the scheme on the main ground that it does not provide for the same level of service as can be obtained by people who can afford it.  That is a simplistic and unreal approach.  No scheme could or should put the poor person into the position of the rich man who can afford the best brains at the Bar.  The scheme puts the poor person into the position of a person of modest means, as most people are, and such people have to think twice before engaging in legal action.  There is no reason in justice why poor people should be different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very interested in the Minister's remarks.  To a very large degree they seem to support and vindicate the stand taken by Deputy Desmond in her very able presentation of her case.  The scheme which is now being introduced so belatedly by the Government is a pathetic response to the condemnation of this Government by the European Court of Human Rights.  In effect they are establishing a second-class system to provide a second-class service for those whom the Government clearly regard as second-class citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the position in regard to the response of the Government to the Airey decision in Europe and it is no harm to remember the background. There was a commitment by this Government in 1977 in regard to civil legal aid.  A comprehensive report prepared by the Pringle Commission was in the hands of the Government in December 1977.  Despite that and despite the many promises made in the intervening years, nothing whatever has been done by the Government until recently.  It is clear to me that, were it not for the condemnation of this Government by the European Court, we would still be getting further promises. <Col N="1785" /> Mark you, some of these promises were very specific.  I recall one last May where, under very heavy pressure because of the enormous delays that had taken place, we had a specific commitment from the Minister that a civil legal aid scheme would be introduced as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than the end of the current year.  The same old story applied thereafter and it is only now, in the year 1980, that we have the bones of a scheme.  I suppose that is glorifying the scheme proposed to be introduced&mdash;the skeleton of a scheme would be a far better description.</P>
    <P>In my time I always regarded the symbol of justice as the scales being weighed evenly between the different litigants in court.  Certainly, it is quite clear that the proposed scheme does not provide the necessary balance to ensure that those of inadequate means will be able to face, in court, on equal terms, the opposition of those with substantial means.</P>
    <P>I have made a note of the verious points made by the Minister.  If I might single out one in that context, it certainly clearly displays the attitude of the Minister and the attitude of this Government&mdash;a Government of the rich for the rich.  The Minister did not put a tooth in it.  No scheme could or should put the poor person in the same position as the rich person in court.  In effect, that was what the Minister had to say.  Surely it is a condemnation, not personally of the Minister.  He is a member of this Government, this Government party who have so long been identified with the rich of this country and have specifically put it on the record of this House that this is their outlook, this is their vision of the future&mdash;that those in the position of being rich should retain their advantages in the courts of law which are supposed to dispense equal justice to every citizen of this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister defended the situation of not introducing a statutory scheme.  He suggests to this House that the fact that the scheme is not administered by way of statute does not affect the right of the <Col N="1786" /> person to participate in it.  He does not give any answer as to why the Pringle Commission, after three years' deliberation, recommended that there be a statutory scheme and not alone made that recommendation, but actually produced detailed and comprehensive heads of a Bill to be enacted in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells this House that the board is entirely independent and that there will be no question of the Minister interfering with it.  He neglects to mention to the House that he is the person who has the hiring and firing of the board.  He hires them and has full authority at any stage to fire them. Furthermore, he neglects to refer to the clause which I thought he would explain, clause 226 of the scheme, which entitles the Minister, from time to time, to give to the board such general directives as to policy in relation to legal services as he considers necessary.  That is the much vaunted independence of this board.</P>
    <P>Having talked about the right of the individual and the fact that it is not necessary to provide a statutory basis for that right, he tells us thereafter that it is his intention in the future to put it on a statutory basis and does not explain why.  It is all right now to have it on a non-statutory basis&mdash;the people are getting a very good deal but it is the intention to have it on a statutory basis in the future.  He says he wants to get the scheme into operation and there is no time to put it on a statutory basis.  We have had the Pringle Report in our hands since 1977 and he has no time to produce a Bill which the Minister says it is his intention to produce ultimately. How, in the name of goodness, can a Minister come before our House of Parliament and justify his lack of activity in this case and justify the fact that he is introducing this half-baked scheme at this stage, as an adequate response to the needs of the people, as an adequate delivery on the manifesto promises made three years ago?</P>
    <P>The Minister then tells us that the scheme can only be described as comprehensive, you might say <i>à la</i> Pringle. Again, he neglects to tell us about the <Col N="1787" /> various items that have been excluded&mdash;ones that count and would count very much to the person of insubstantial means.  Perhaps the Minister might not consider, being of the party that he is, that defamaties would mean too much to a poor person.  Maybe, in the Minister's opinion it would not mean anything if a poor person's name is libelled or slandered.  The Minister might consider that that is something such a person should put up with, but let the person of rich means who is so libelled and slandered pursue his action.  I do not accept that view at all.  The name of any individual in this country is entitled to the same protection in the courts&mdash;be that person rich or poor.  Let us be fair, that aspect was discussed in the Pringle Report but the Minister justified not permitting services to be issued in regard to Civil Bills for sums below £150.  The whole idea of this scheme is to protect the small person who would probably be dealing with small amounts in the District Court.  When I practised in the district court, its limit of jurisdiction was £50.  That figure was increased some time ago and the limit is now £250.  Yet, under the exclusion of this scheme which is supposed to be there to help the small person, three-fifths of the cases under the limit of the District Court cannot be availed of by that person who wishes to claim his entitlement in that court.  That, again, shows the outlook that one possibly might expect from a Government which puts such store on the protection of the rights of the rich and does little for those of the poor.  The figure of £150, despite the enormous inflation that we have had over the last few years, still means a lot to a great many people in this country and the type of problems that they would be dealing with would very often be at a figure of less than that sum.</P>
    <P>The Minister then sought to justify the exclusion of private solicitors&mdash;of solicitors engaged on a private basis. Here we have come to the nub of the problem.  I must be careful&mdash;the Minister did not make any case for excluding <Col N="1788" /> the private solicitor, but did for excluding the entitlement of the individual to engage the private solicitor. Let us be fair, the private solicitor is doing all right as he is, but the individual who needs his services may not be doing all right, particularly if that individual lives 100 miles from one of these centres which are to be established.  What, in the name of goodness, the poor unfortunate is going to do under the present scheme, I am not sure.  With the cost of petrol and the amount of money he would have to spend in going up and down for consultations to the said law centre, he would have the amount of his claim spent long before he would ever get a shilling back.  Seriously, the situation here is that the Minister is not permitting the individual to engage the solicitor or the barrister of his or her choice.  He said he took particular exception to the words &ldquo;dispensary system&rdquo; but was this not the reason the old dispensary system was abolished?  Because the dispensary system under the Health Acts, established in the poor law days of the last century, had such a poor image among the people the system was abolished, 20th Century thinking came into play and the choice of doctors' scheme was established.  What have we now from the Minister?  In effect, we have the establishment of a similar poor law system in 1980 when it comes to establishing a legal aid system.  Clearly that justified the use of the phraseology by Deputy Desmond.  The Minister appears to think that because Deputy Desmond used that term in the motion before the House it will give the scheme a bad image.  What Deputy Desmond and I have to say in this House will not give the scheme a bad image.  The scheme will have a bad image because it is a bad scheme.  It is as simple as that and trying to suggest that an honest and frank appraisal of the scheme by the Opposition is going to give it a bad name is so ludicrous as to be hardly worth mentioning.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of availability of the centres.  I was particularly struck by the words used by the Minister when he said the thinking behind the scheme was that the centres <Col N="1789" /> should be available close to where the demand lies.  He spoke about the distance people might have to travel to the centre of a city.  I do not know what is the Dublin equivalent of the South Mall in Cork which would be the main area of concentration in Cork.  Was the Minister serious when he made that comment? The Minister, no more than myself, is not a city man.  Is he talking about somebody taking an 18p bus drive to the centre as opposed to the situation of a person in Ballydehob or Castletownbere or even in outlying areas in the Minister's own constituency, people who do not even have public services to avail of, who would have to hire cars to get to one of the famous centres and who might have to travel more than 100 miles?  The Minister tells us that his objective is to make legal aid accessible to the people.  Perhaps he is spending too much time in Dublin.  He may be getting too urbanised, forgetting his roots in the country.  He should remember that he may have to look after those roots again in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always nice to have one note of confidence expressed in this House.  How can the Minister suggest that this scheme will make legal aid accessible to the people when only a limited number of centres will be established? I tried to count them when the Minister was speaking and as far as I could tell they total seven&mdash;two in the city of Dublin and five others.  Is that making legal aid accessible to the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major types of cases where legal aid will be sought will be family law cases.  In fact, the case brought to Europe and which has forced the Government's hand now was such a case.  If one of the parties in a case goes to the office in Limerick, what will happen to the other party?  Will that person have to go to Dublin or Cork for aid? Clearly it would be totally unethical and incorrect that the two people would be advised by the same office.  I could envisage <Col N="1790" /> very embarrassing situations arising, clashes in the centres if the husband and wife came for advice to the same office. We might have a situation such as that which occurred some time ago where two men had a fight.  When they finished fighting both of them got up on their bicycles and went as fast as they could to see who would be the first to reach the best solicitor in the area.  That kind of situation will happen with regard to this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the UK report and the value of citizens law centres.  I am committed to genuine community law centres.  I like the notion and I like the reference in the report to the fact that there should be local bodies backing them up.  In this instance the Minister is establishing a few centres.  In the White Paper there is provision with regard to existing centres and I am glad to see this.  However, they are few in number.  I presume they will be included in the total of seven mentioned by the Minister.  They will not be sufficient to cope with the problem.  What is recommended in the Pringle Report and what is recommended by any sensible person who wants to tackle the problem properly is that there should be citizens' community law centres and, in addition, the entitlement of the individual to avail of private services if he so desires.  Why is that not being done?  It is very simple&mdash;it is a question of finance.  The Government have not got the money. They made promises in 1977 which they subsequently repeated but they have not the money to carry them out.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we should remember the money has to come from the unfortunate taxpayer and he said the Government had to be careful in ensuring that such money was spent in the best way possible.  When promises were made in 1977 about civil legal aid&mdash;no more than promises about the abolition of ground rents and other such dream talk&mdash;I cannot remember any talk about the cost or the burden on the taxpayers. Now we have the turn of the wheel.  In effect, the Minister is saying they cannot provide a proper service because they <Col N="1791" /> have not the money while, at the same time, by some sleight of hand he is suggesting that the service that will be provided will be a proper and a good service. The Minister cannot have it every way.  The weight of evidence is entirely against him and he would need a lot of legal aid to bolster up his case so as to have any hope of winning because it is quite clear that the service he proposes is inadequate, not properly financed&mdash;the estimates show this&mdash;and will not be accessible or available to the people who need it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is talking about crawling before we learn to walk.  The time for crawling is over.  The only crawling the Minister should do at this stage is to crawl to the electorate to apologise for the false promises and misdemeanours of the past.  The Minister should be now breaking into a quick gallop to make some recompense for this infamous record over past years.  He can do so by taking this carefully prepared document produced by a very fine committee presided over by a very eminent judge and implementing it forthwith.  Then he would have some justification for holding his head high before those who had come to expect so much from the promises in regard to civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the moneys involved.  So did Mr. Justice Pringle who, in his report, recommended a comprehensive scheme on which he put a label.  He also recommended that if the Government could not implement that scheme straightaway consideration could be given to an interim scheme but he made it clear that this was not the proper way to tackle the problem and that his recommendation was a proper, comprehensive scheme.  This was priced at £2 million.  Surely when the expenditure of the State is so great, running into thousands of millions, and when the borrowing of the State is so great, running upwards to £1,000 million a year, a couple of million pounds to do a decent job would not be out of the way.  Even at this stage the Minister should consider changing his tune and forgetting about <Col N="1792" /> this patched-up, half-baked proposal which he now seems to want to implement, and introduce a decent comprehensive scheme as recommended by Judge Pringle.</P>
    <P>We have an amendment to this motion put down by the Minister in which he asks us to express confidence in him in regard to the exercise by him of his functions in relation to the scheme.  It is clear from the whole history of the situation, from the lack of activity on the part of the Minister over a number of years past and from the half-baked scheme he is now attempting to suggest is a comprehensive one, that nobody in his sane senses could express confidence in the Minister for what he has been doing.  It is an insult to the House even to suggest an expression of confidence in this case.</P>
    <P>On the other hand there is a detailed motion before the House setting forth reasoned grounds for rejecting the present scheme.  The Minister had an opportunity to provide an answer to the case made by Deputy Desmond, to provide an answer to the solid points made in that motion and on all counts he failed entirely.  It is clear that the individual does not have a right.  There is an even more important point: it seems there will be great waste of money on bureaucracy and administration arising from this.  If the Minister has not already read it in detail I refer him to the minority report to the Pringle Commission Report in which it was suggested that the whole idea of getting legal aid where a person went to a community law centre was that this should not be necessary, that it was a waste of time.  The people in these centres, whether officially or not, will be civil servants paid by the State indirectly&mdash;they will be paid out of the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board. Does the Minister suggest anything will be gained by having these people wasting their time filling up forms getting the appropriate certificates from the board?  This is something the Minister should consider seriously.</P>
    <P>I entirely accept the need for a certificate when private practitioners will be involved ultimately as undoubtedly they <Col N="1793" /> must be when this scheme is seen to be the failure that it is.  It is important that before any such individual asks to proceed too far, beyond possibly just preliminary advice, that he should have to submit a case to an independent legal aid board to get a certificate but it is totally unnecessary that the board's employees should be wasting time filling up these forms.  Surely if they are capable of giving good service to the board it should be part of their functions that if somebody comes in they would be able to give a decision on that point also.</P>
    <P>Lastly, and I think this is the real point, this scheme does not give civil legal aid to those who need it in any kind of comprehensive way or in any way which spreads right through the country. It is confined to those who can go to the few centres that will be established and people who cannot afford the fare to reach those centres will be denied their very right to legal aid.  Possibly that is the major fault in this system.  As a rural Deputy, any part of my constituency will not be within a long distance of one of these centres.  I must take very serious objection to that aspect of the scheme, I ask the Minister to think again, scrap this scheme and introduce a proper and decent scheme as recommended by the Pringle Commission.</P>

Moreover it must be borne in mind that the city centre area, being part of the Dublin Metropolitan Area, has available to it substantial resources of manpower and transport which are not based at the stations mentioned.</P>

    <P>In many instances where a worker approaches a rights commissioner alleging unfair dismissal, the worker and his employer, with the assistance of the rights commissioner, reach an agreed settlement and the worker does not proceed with a formal claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissals Act.  In such a situation, a formal recommendation is not made by the rights commissioner. The above statistics do not cover such activities by rights commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prescribed list of illnesses to which the question refers relates to the long-term illness scheme, not to the provision of medical cards.  Under the scheme a person suffering from any of the prescribed diseases or disabilities is entitled to free drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances and, in some cases, in-patient and out-patient hospital services.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to extend the prescribed list but the position regarding scoliosis will be kept under review.  Meanwhile, children requiring hospitalisation are now entitled to free hospital services and out-patient specialist services but where the parent's income exceeds £7,000 they are liable for the consultants' fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is already provision for health boards to assist parents visiting children in hospital, where the parents have full eligibility or, if not, where the chief executive officer of a health board assesses that there would be undue hardship if the <Col N="1688" /> parents had to meet the travelling costs.

They have been requested to initiate procedures, where they have not already done so, so that when adult travellers are admitted to hospital, admission staff notify the director of community care with responsibility for the family.  This will enable support to be given to the family while the parent is in hospital and will minimise the risk to these children.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension about the date of payment of old age pension in the type of case mentioned in his question.  A pension awarded on appeal following the stamping of a deed is paid from the date on which the deed was signed, and not from the date on which the deed of transfer was stamped, provided of course, the claimant was otherwise qualified on that date.</P>

    <P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of the Social Welfare Occupational Injuries Acts medical conditions certified as silicosis are included within the term &ldquo;pneumoconiosis&rdquo;.  As this is a prescribed disease all persons certified for silicosis are regarded as suffering from a prescribed disease.</P>
      <P>Injury benefit under the Occupational Injuries Acts is not payable in respect of pneumoconiosis or silicosis.  Disablement benefit under these Acts is, however, payable from the commencement of the claim to persons suffering from such complaints instead of after the expiration of 26 weeks from the date of injury or disease as in the case of other occupational injuries or diseases.  In addition, all such persons who are incapable of work are entitled to payment of disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts, concurrently with disablement benefit, from the commencement of the claim provided that they satisfy the contribution conditions for such benefit. Persons who are not qualified for payment of disability benefit are entitled to payment of unemployability supplement, which is at the same rate as disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While claimants, suffering from <Col N="1691" /> silicosis, receive less by way of disability benefit than they would ordinarily receive as injury benefit during the first 26 weeks of incapacity, the amount of disablement benefit payable in the majority of cases during this period, in addition to disability benefit, more than compensates for the non-payment of injury benefit.

Goggles are also provided for use when mixing the concentrate.  Workers are also provided with soap and towels for washing of exposed skin after using chemical compounds.</P>
      <P>The period during which forest workers might be involved in the use of the substance would not normally exceed four hours at any one time.</P>
      <P>The Department do not monitor the use of chemical compounds at particular sites.  However, my Department are in the process of making an inventory of the use of 245-T by forest district but this has not yet been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I am assured by my officials that the chemical 245-T in the formulation in use here by my Department poses no threat to man or his environment, the Research Branch of my Department are continuing to seek an acceptable substitute for the chemical formulation <Col N="1692" /> which is used in State forests for the control of woody weeds.</P>

      <P>Stamp vending machines are normally provided outside all main departmentally-staffed Post Offices&mdash;for example, all head and district post offices, branch post offices and the busier district delivery offices in Dublin. There has, however, been considerable trouble with the maintenance of these machines; the mechanism is delicate and the machines are vulnerable to vandalism. Maintenance arrangements are currently being reviewed with a view to improving the general standard of performance of the machines.  There are no plans at present for extending the use of these machines, but this aspect will be <Col N="1694" /> kept under review in the light of progress with maintenance arrangements.</P>
