      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 48, after &ldquo;Court&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not later than three months after service of the notice&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of a difficulty that was mooted by Deputy Fitzpatrick, <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> on the Committee Stage debate.  Although the amendment affects subsection (3) of section 24, it is designed to close a possible loophole that could arise out of the operation of subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that, in default of agreement, the rent fixed upon a rent review shall become payable on whichever of the following dates is the later: (a) the first gale day after <Col N="1454" /> service of the notice of intention to apply for the review, or (b) where the rent has previously been reviewed, five years after the first gale day following the previous review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick expressed concern that the operation of this subsection could in certain circumstances lead to an increased rent becoming payable retrospectively, and perhaps retrospectively for a considerable period of time. Subsection (4) has been examined in the light of that observation and this amendment is the result.  The possible loophole concerns only cases where the rent has previously been reviewed.</P>
    <P>The point can most clearly be conveyed by way of an example.  Take the case of a 35 year new tenancy granted under Part II of this Bill.  Suppose that the rent is reviewed after, say, five years of that term have run.  In due course the landlord serves notice of his intention to apply for a further review but he does not, in fact, proceed with an application to the court for that review until, say, a further seven years have elapsed.  Under subsection (4), as drafted, it would appear that the landlord would be entitled to receive up to seven years arrears of any increase in rent in such a case.  This is because in the kind of case that has been postulated both the date of service of the notice and the date that is five years later than the preceding review of rent are at least seven years in the past. This would, of course, be manifestly unjust.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 is designed to deal with this problem by requiring the person seeking review of the rent to follow up his notice of intention to seek that review with an approach to the court within three months of the service of that notice of intention.  In the example I have given this would have the effect of obliging the landlord to proceed to seek the second review of rent within three months of his notice or else to serve a further notice of intention and proceed from there.  In the latter case the reviewed rent would become payable, it accordance with 24 (4) (a), only on the first gale day following the service of <Col N="1455" /> that further notice, and the earlier notice would not come into the reckoning.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for bringing this matter to attention and thus enabling us to improve the Bill in regard to these provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am obliged to the Minister of State for introducing this amendment to a Bill with an obviously dangerous loophole as originally drafted, a loophole which, as the Minister says, could make a lessee liable retrospectively for several years' increase in rent of a very substantial nature.  I assume that the Minister has been fully advised on the amendment and its effect and I take it that he is satisfied that it closes a loophole and that it will not now be possible for the landlord to use the Act as a sort of moneybox which would enable him to accumulate a huge amount of arrears of rent and then collect it.  I do not suppose that a landlord would deliberately do that but his successor might, if this amendment had not been made, find that he could use the Act to claim an increase retrospectively.  I could see that happening in a case where somebody might buy the lessor's interest with appropriate legal advice as to his rights and with the knowledge that he could claim retrospectively against the tenant.  I am satisfied that the Minister's amendment will prevent that and I am grateful for it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 17, to delete &ldquo;one-eighth&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one-twentieth&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 35 as drafted is entirely contrary to modern thinking on ground rents and to the alleged thinking of Fianna Fáil on ground rents.  It is also contrary to the Fianna Fáil manifesto on this question. In order to understand the position which I seek to amend it is best to give an example.  A reversionary lease in simple <Col N="1456" /> terms is a renewal of a ground rent lease amongst other things.  The example which I will give is as follows: A lessor has granted a lease of a plot of land to A for a term of 99 years with the condition that A builds a dwelling house on that plot of land.  A duly builds the dwelling house on the plot of land which we will call the site and the 99 years expires. The 99 years will expire just the same as a week will expire.  A's successor is entitled to a reversionary lease or a new lease on the plot of land on which his predecessors have built the house. However, we find that under the machinery of this Bill the rent of the new lease is to be one-eithth of the gross rent.  The gross rent is to be the market rent of the plot of land plus the buildings which the present lessee's father or grandfather built on the land.  It would not be unreasonable of me to say that in this city, for example, the gross market rent of a modest semi-detached or detached house at present would be as high as £4,000 a year.  If that is so, the rent which the lessee would be required to pay for that premises would be increased from £10 to £500.  Call it what one likes that is in effect a ground rent.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to see that the Minister for Justice lifted section 35 out of the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act and planted it back in this Bill with the same fraction as was in that Act, as amended some time after it was introduced.  The rent of the reversionary lease is to be one-eighth of the gross rent.  I have taken the gross rent at £4,000 a year which is a modest rent when we consider that flats are being rented at £200-£300 a month.  If one divides £4,000 by 8 one gets £500.  That is a brutal increase for the site of the house.  That is all that the landlord owns because it was the tenant or his predecessors in title who built the house and maintained it.  That kind of thinking is absolutely contrary to the present alleged policy of the Government to get rid of ground rents.  I do not know why the Minister did not direct the drafters of this Bill to change that substantially. The section as it stands reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Subject to <i>section 34 (3)</i> and <Col N="1457" /> this section, the rent to be reserved by a reversionary lease the terms of which are settled by the Court shall be one-eighth of the gross rent.  For this purpose the gross rent shall be reduced, where appropriate, by the special allowance provided by <i>subsection (2).</i></P>
    <P>(2)  The special allowance for the purpose of <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be such proportion of the gross rent as, in the opinion of the court, is attributable to works of construction, reconstruction or alteration carried out by the lessee or any of his predecessors in title which add to the letting value of the land, other than works carried out wholly or partly in consideration of the grant of a lease or repair and maintenance during the currency of the lease.</P>
    <P>The rent is to be fixed on the basis of the letting value of the plot of land plus the house as it was originally built under the covenant in the lease to build and the repairs done to it during the term of the lease.  If something else is built by the tenant, such as another wing, that is not to be taken into account in fixing the rent. What is being done is to increase the ground rent because that is all that the landlord is really concerned about.  That is all he is entitled to and that is all he owns.  The buildings have been put there by the tenant.  The new rent is to be fixed on the plot of ground plus the buildings. That is out of line with the alleged policy of the Government in regard to ground rents.</P>
    <P>There has been controversy and agitation going on about ground rents for several years.  It seemed to be the alleged policy of the Government party to abolish ground rents.  There was a big controversy about whether before the last election Fianna Fáil said they would abolish ground rents free of cost to the lessees and tenants.  The present Minister for Justice denies he ever said that or that he even intended it.  ACRA and tenants' associations say they understood the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the Fianna Fáil Party promised&mdash;and they <Col N="1458" /> produced correspondence to substantiate this argument&mdash;that they would abolish ground rents free of charge.  That is the case against the Government.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Government say they did not promise to do any such thing but that they promised to introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents, and they rely on page 27, paragraph 9, of their 1977 manifesto, under the heading &ldquo;Ground Rents&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.</P>
    <P>ACRA say that means they will abolish ground rents free of charge and the Government say no.  Whatever it means, it could not be taken to mean that Fianna Fáil would introduce a section in a Landlord and Tenant Bill, such as section 35 of this Bill, which would facilitate the increase in ground rents from £10 per year to £500 a year or even more.  I am not abusing language or exaggerating when I make that case.</P>
    <P>To mount an argument here and try to get this into the open, I put down this amendment.  The effect of my amendment would be to say that the new gross rent shall be one-twentieth of the market rent instead of one-eighth.  I know that would not satisfy ACRA or the tenants' associations or that it would not implement the Fianna Fáil undertaking to introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents, but it would be a lot better than the present formula.  I only put down this amendment for the purpose of exposing the dishonesty of the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the reneging by the Government on their promises made before the election. Instead of lazily lifting a section out of the 1931 Act, which was enacted nearly 50 years before the campaign for the abolition of ground rents began, and putting it into this new legislation, there should be a new section inserted that would lead to the abolition of ground rent, instead of perpetuating ground rents for another 99 years as this legislation is doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> The Minister may say that the tenants could have bought out the ground rents under one of the Acts brought in some time ago but I am talking about the tenants who have not bought out their ground rents and find they have to go to the courts to renew their leases.  I made this case on Committee Stage when the section was being discussed and I was very confident that the Minister, having had his attention drawn to it&mdash;because I do not believe he had studied it carefully up to then&mdash;would have amended the Bill in accordance with the manifesto undertaking to provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  I thought he would do that but he did not.  He relied on the 1931 Act and said it was good enough notwithstanding the campaign against ground rents or the manifesto undertaking to introduce a scheme to lead to their abolition.  He introduced the same old section with the same old formula.</P>
    <P>It is true that section 35 (3) provides that</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order amend subsection (1) by substituting for the fraction standing specified for the time being therein another fraction.</P>
    <P>That means that the Minister may scrub one-eighth and put in one-quarter, or one-twentieth, or one-fiftieth.  Why did he not do that now?  Why did he not show some fresh thinking?  Why did he not avail of this Bill to implement paragraph 9, page 27 of the manifesto? Would the Minister tell us how long this fraction of one-eighth stands?  I think the fraction has only once been altered since 1931, and that was around 1958.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful performance.  It is the type of thing that will not get very much publicity because the Committee and Report Stages of a Bill are not very easy to understand or report.  If the average man in the street knew and understood the Fianna Fáil promise about ground rents as laid down in their manifesto&mdash;an undertaking to provide a <Col N="1460" /> scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents&mdash;and understood section 35 of this Bill in the light of that promise, he would take a very dim view of the Government's promises and of politicians in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was quite right in what he said in this connection in the course of the Committee Stage debate, that is, that the fraction of one-eighth of gross rent has been unchanged since 1967.  However, it does not follow that that fraction is now due to be changed, or that it should be changed here and now in this Bill before the Bill has become law, or that any change in the fraction should be downwards.</P>
      <P>In the first place one would have expected the Landlord and Tenant Commission to have had something to say if they considered that the one-eighth fraction had fallen significantly out of line with what the rents under the reversionary leases should be.  The commission have not put forward a recommendation for any change in that fraction.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Fitzpatrick's point that we are here to use our own knowledge and common sense and to make up our minds on the issues before us, and I am not saying that action cannot be taken until the commission have pronounced on it.  Nevertheless, I have to point out that the Minister for Justice must seek to be even-handed as between landlords and tenants and that is a requirement that comes into particular prominence in relation to such a basic matter as the question before us.  The absence of any recommendation for change from the commission is a serious consideration here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second place it is, of course, the case that section 35 of the Bill re-enacts the provision enabling the fraction of gross rent to be varied by ministerial order, subject to approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In other words, it is not the case that the kind of change the amendment proposes to make must be made either here and now, <Col N="1461" /> or at all.  The change, if a change were to become advisable, can be made at any time, and in this connection I have to say that none of the professional bodies that offered observations or comments on the proposals in this Bill had anything to say about the gross rent fraction.  If a professional body were to come out in favour of a change, or if the Landlord and Tenant Commission were to recommend a change, that would in my view be the time to look at the question and, as I have said, it is a question that is open to re-determination rather at any time.  At the moment it seems that support for any change is not very widespread.</P>
    <P>Section 35 of the Bill, in re-enacting the relevant provisions of section 18 of the 1958 Reversionary Leases Act, makes a substantive change in favour of tenants that already goes about as far as it is prudent to go here and now in the direction of favouring tenants.  That change is to provide that improvements made by a ground rent lessee to his property over and above the original building work in consideration of which the lease was granted, should not be reckoned in computing the gross rent for the purpose of arriving at the value of the one-eighth fraction.  That is, no matter how much the lessee's improvements have added to the rental value of the property, no part of the rental value attributable to those improvements will be reflected in the rent payable under a reversionary lease of that property.  This is already a considerable change in favour of tenants.</P>
    <P>However, on top of everything that I have said, there is the fundamental consideration that a person who is entitled to obtain a reversionary lease is a ground rent lessee, and, as a ground rent lessee, he has the right to buy out the fee simple of his property.  In comparison with that right, the right to obtain a reversionary lease must be regarded as being of considerably less importance.</P>
    <P>Where dwellinghouses are concerned, ground rent lessees can, of course, avail themselves of the purchase scheme provided by the 1978 (No. 2) Act to buy <Col N="1462" /> out the fee simple and get rid of ground rent, and indeed they are doing so.  In the case of ground rent properties other than dwellinghouses that purchase scheme does not apply and for one reason or another it may suit the ground rent lessee to sit out his lease and then obtain a reversionary lease rather than buy out the fee simple.</P>
    <P>However, since ground rent tenants can always buy out the fee simple if they choose, apart from those minor exceptional cases coming under Section 16 of the 1978 (No. 2) Act, it has to be said that the question of what fraction of gross rent should represent the rent payable under a reversionary lease is not an immediately pressing one and, in the face of the considerations that I have already adduced, I believe it is a question that we should not consider ourselves bound to try to settle here and now.</P>
    <P>What I would be prepared to concede in the face of the arguments that Deputy Fitzpatrick has put forward is that when the five-year purchase scheme for ground rents provided by the 1978 (No. 2)  Act has terminated, when the last purchase applications have been made, a time for re-consideration may have arrived.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has given his clear opinion that the new ground rents purchase scheme will work, but let us suppose that at that point it is seen that significant numbers of dwellinghouses are still subject to ground rent, that the ground rent tenants concerned have missed the bus, or rather have refused to pay even the nominal fare on that bus, and that their practical choice may be to look in due course for reversionary leases, then at that point it could be appropriate to look again at the one-eighth fraction.  However, I have to say that it would be premature to do so before we have seen the outcome of that ground rents purchase scheme.  I think I should also say that, even were a change in the fraction to be contemplated, the Minister for Justice would feel himself almost bound to seek first the views of the Landlord and Tenant Commission on the question of a change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> For these reasons, I do not think a case has been made for the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I have noticed that throughout the Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stages debates on the Bill the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State, when they found themselves in any difficulty or cornered in any way, have run for protection to the Landlord and Tenant Commission, saying that the commission had not recommended this, that or the other.  It leads me to pose the question, did Fianna Fáil and their back-up services consult the commission when drawing up their famous 1977 manifesto?</P>
      <P>That is my argument.  Had they consulted the commission before they wrote to ACRA in 1977 solemnly promising to abolish ground rents?  It is less than honest and a bit despicable now to start running for protection to the Landlord and Tenant Commission under the chairmanship of Judge Conroy when they are failing to implement a promise they made in 1977 without consulting either the commission or Judge Conroy. This is simply a shameful going back on promises made in the 1977 campaign, both in writing and orally.  It can be said that the introduction of a Bill to increase ground rents by several hundred per cent, thereby making it enormously more expensive to buy out ground rents, when they had promised to abolish them, is a shameful act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a scheme to consolidate and perpetuate ground rents and one which will make it much more difficult to buy out ground rents than heretofore.  In the case of a person who has a ground rent of, say, £5 or £10 and who, for some <Col N="1464" /> reason or another has not availed of the existing machinery to buy out that ground rent, he finds suddenly that when he comes to claim a new tenancy to hold on to his dwelling house that ground rent of £5 or £10 is converted into £500. That is an outrageous performance.  The Minister says that when the five-year period under one of the Ground Rents Acts has expired it is time enough to look at the question then.  Of course, many ground rents would have jumped from nominal figures of £5 and £10 to hundreds of pounds and the position of such lessees will become much more difficult, if not impossible.  It is no excuse to say that the Landlord and Tenant Commission did not make any recommendation in this respect.  Were they asked for a recommendation even post-manifesto? I know they were not asked for one before and neither were they consulted about the manifesto because they would not be party to such a document.</P>
    <P>I have made my point which I hope is clearly understood.  I shall conclude by charging the Minister for Justice, the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party with reneging on their election manifesto promise in regard to ground rents, constituting a shameful going back on a solemn promise given in that document and reaffirmed after consultation with ACRA in writing.  It is a repetition of their reneging on the solemn undertaking given by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch and his Ministers, at the hands of Deputy Denis Gallagher who solemnly undertook, after consultation with the front bench and the then Taoiseách to grant a new aviation licence in the west which, when they got into power, they did not do.  It is a complete repetition of that performance.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment which arises from the Tourism and Transport (Alteration of Name of Department and Title of Minister) Order, 1980 (S.I. No. 11 of 1980).  That order has the effect, <i>inter alia,</i> of giving the Minister for Tourism and Transport the new title of Minister for Transport.</P>
      <P>The functions in relation to the Commissioners of Irish Lights (Section 16 (2) (e) of (d) of the 1978 (No. 2) Act) and certain harbour authorities (Section 16 (2) <i>(e)</i> of the 1978 (No. 2 Act) that were exercised by the Minister for Tourism and Transport continue to be exercised by the Minister for Transport.  Under the terms of the Tourism (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 1980 (S.I. No.  of 1980), the functions of the Minister for Tourism and Transport in relation to tourism only were transferred to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  As a result of that change the order giving the Minister for Tourism and Transport the new title of Minister for Transport was made.</P>

      <P>In page 35, between lines 19 and 20, to insert:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> 73.  Where, immediately before the commencement of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, a person was, as respects any land, a person to whom section 3 of the Act of 1967 applied or would have been such a person if he had served a notice under section 4 of that Act, he shall as from such commencement be a person to whom Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, applies.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the classes of persons who have, as ground rent lessees or tenants, the right to purchase the fee simple.  The House has already approved of two amendments to the Bill which propose to add to the classes of such persons as set out in Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  A most unusual type of case has lately came to notice that, while clearly involving a ground rent tenancy type of relationship with the landlord, is not covered by the 1978 (No. 2) Act.  However, it appears that this type of case would have fallen within the type of ground rent leases and tenancies that were covered by the repealed provisions of section 3 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act; that is to say, what is in question is not a new class of ground rent lease or tenancy, but an unusual example of a class that had already been recognised in the law.  The classes of ground rent leases and tenancies set out in Part II of the 1978 (No. 2) Act are, of course, set out therein in an intentionally simplified form, and simplification always involves some risk of excluding unusual cases.  The principle of simplifying the extremely complicated categories of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and proprietary lease&rdquo; that is enshrined in the 1978 (No. 2) Act has had the support of all parties in the House and has worked well in practice: it does have the drawback that unusual cases may require special provisions.</P>
    <P>Here and now, no one can say whether some further new type of lease or tenancy may not come to light that <Col N="1468" /> would be seen, on examination, both to be a genuine ground rent lease or tenancy, and not merely a case that is marginally excluded, and also not to be covered by the legislation.  However, the amendment we are now discussing does seem to me to spread the net widely enough to bring in every outstanding type of ground rent lease or tenancy that has been identified.  In the nature of things one cannot be certain what the outcome would be were a particular case to come before the courts for decision but the advice I have is that the amendment will achieve that purpose.  Certainly, the amendment is correct in principle since it was never the intention that the repeal of the greater part of section 3 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act should result in the right to purchase the fee simple being taken away from persons who came within the classes of persons recognised by that Act as ground rent tenants.</P>
    <P>I will instance two types of cases that would be covered by this amendment, that are quite clearly cases where a ground rent tenancy situation exists and where the right to purchase the fee simple should clearly apply, and yet that do not come under the 1978 No. 2 Act as it stands.</P>
    <P>One case is where a lease has expired that would have been a &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; or a &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; as defined by the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, as amended.  Contact with the ground landlord has long been lost and no rent is being paid, hence a yearly tenancy has not been raised following on the expiration of the lease. However, the right to obtain a reversionary lease continues in being, in accordance with section 11 (1) (b) and section 12 (1) (b) of the 1958 Act (or at least will so continue until after the repeal of that Act) since no notice of termination of the previous lease has been received from the landlord.  Here we have one unusual type of case where the right to buy out should clearly apply and that was indeed covered by the repealed provisions in section 3 (2) (c) of the 1967 Ground Rents Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> Another type of case is where a sub-lease is made that transfers to the sublessee from the sub-lessor that sublessor's interest, as lessee, in a ground rent lease but where for one reason or another a monetary fine is not exacted on the grant of the sub-lease, or where that monetary fine represents less than the market value because of particular circumstances.  Such a sub-lease could fail to satisfy Part II of the 1978 No. 2 Act (which in such cases requires a monetary fine, or equivalent expenditure on the property, of not less than 15 times the annual amount of the rent payable under the sub-lease).  Nevertheless, if a genuine ground rent lease is involved the right of purchase could have been given by the repealed provisions in section 3 (2) (d) (i) of the 1967 Ground Rents Act.</P>
    <P>What the amendment proposes is that, if a person would have had the right to purchase the fee simple under the repealed provisions of section 3 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act, he shall continue to have that right under the 1978 No. 2 Act.  I believe the amendment covers all cases of genuine ground rent tenancies that have been brought to notice and that are not already provided for.  Again, I have to say, however, that since there is no definition in law of a &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo; no one can be absolutely certain that every type of meritorious case that may come to light in the future will actually be covered.</P>
    <P>A point I may mention is that, if this amendment were to be accepted, section 72 as it stands in the Bill would become strictly unnecessary since a very careful reading of the relevant legislation would show that the type of case covered by section 72 is also covered by the proposed amendment.  However, the draftsman is of the view&mdash;and indeed, I may say, so is the Minister for Justice and so am I&mdash;that section 72 should stand in the Bill.  It is useful as a clarifying provision and I think it important to try to keep this area of the law as clear and straightforward as possible, whatever difficulties this involves in catering for unusual cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> To go any further than this amendment proposes to go would involve bringing in an entirely new class (or classes) of ground rent leases or tenancies and, in accordance with the settled practice of successive Governments, this is something on which the Landlord and Tenant Commission would first have to be consulted.  However, as I have indicated, it is not necessary to go further than this amendment which fairly caters, as it stands, for every known case of merit that is not already catered for.</P>
    <P>One technical feature relating to the wording of the amendment that I should perhaps explain, since the significance of that part of the wording may not immediately be apparent is this.  The reference to a person being a person to whom section 3 of the 1967 Act would have applied if he had served a notice under section 4 of that Act arises from section 3 (2) (d) (i) of the 1967 Act.  One of the requirements to have been a person to whom section 3 of the 1967 Act applied was, in a case coming under subsection (2) (d) (i) of the section, that the relevant lease would not expire within 25 years after service of a notice under section 4 of the same Act.  That is, it could be argued that an essential requirement to enable section 3 (2) (d) (i) to be applied to any person is that the person has served a section 4 notice.  By reference to the date of that notice it could then be established whether his lease had or had not 25 years or more to run and hence whether he was or was not a person to whom section 3 (2) (d) (i) applied.  Had he not seved that notice that test could not be applied and hence it would not be possible to say that he was a person to whom section 3 (2) (d) (i) applied.  If that argument is not sound, that is if service of a section 4 notice was not necessary for the application of section 3 (2) (d) (i) of the 1967 Act, then the case is covered by the preceding provision in the proposed new section, which simply requires that the person be a person to whom section 3 of the 1967 Act applied (regardless of the question of service of a section 4 notice) before the commencement of the 1978 No. 2 Act.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> By and large this Bill re-enacts with amendments the 1931 Landlord and Tenant act and it also deals with reversionary leases but one thing sticks out like a sore thumb in the new Bill and that is that so far as there are any changes these changes are heavily loaded against the tenants and the lessees.  I will confine myself to three specific instances to illustrate my point. Section 4 of the Bill provides specifically that it shall not apply to the State as a landlord.  In effect, while all private landlords are obliged to renew the residential leases of lessees who bring themselves <Col N="1473" /> within the Act, the State as a landlord is not obliged to renew a residential lease. An ordinary citizen who may have been a tenant of the State for 50 years and may during that time have built up valuable goodwill in the premises may be thrown out of the premises without any compensation or consideration.  If instead of holding from the State a person held from a private landlord he would be entitled to a new lease on terms laid down in the Bill or to compensation for disturbance.  This is a disgrace and at best it puts the matter beyond doubt.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I raised a question about premises in this city with which we are all familiar, a premises in Henry Street known as the Post Office building.  When I raised the question I did not know that a dispute had arisen about those tenancies but I knew that certain tenants had occupied a portion of the post office building since the foundation of the State and I wondered if they would be turfed out.  Apparently a dispute arose and because at worst, as far as the tenant was concerned, there was a doubt in the law about this, the case was settled.  Now we are writing into this Bill that such a tenant will not be entitled to a new lease or compensation from the State.  From the passing of this Act the State will not be able to settle in such cases because it is put beyond doubt and of course whoever would settle would be charged or surcharged by the Auditor and Comptroller General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Í cannot see why the State should be in a different position from the private landlord.  A private landlord could be a poor man and might have a hardship imposed on him by renewing the lease and yet he has to do it.  The State is not a poor man and usually the State can operate as well in one building as another and the State is putting itself in a peculiarly privileged position by saying that while every other landlord must be reasonable to his tenants, the State can act the bully and throw out the tenant regardless of the loss that the tenant will suffer, which could be enormous, and regardless of the hardship caused.  I <Col N="1474" /> protest in the strongest possible terms against that.</P>
    <P>The second amendment which this Bill brings about and which emphasises discrimination against the tenant is section 23 which has the machinery for fixing the gross rent of residential premises. Ever since 1931 the section which dealt with the fixing of such rents provided that scarcity of premises was one thing that should not and could not be taken into account when fixing the new rent.  It was specifically written into the Bill that the court has to assume that there was a sufficient number of such premises to meet demand and that competition therefore was normal, a very reasonable position.  I picked that up on Committee Stage and thought I had convinced the Minister that the proposal to change it was wrong.  The words that have stood there since 1931 should be left in the new Bill or the Minister should put in new words that would have the same effect if he did not like the words that were there.  He consulted somebody and did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Now we find that the court is directed to fix the new rent of a residential lease&mdash;the Minister for State so admits &mdash;on the basis of the situation that exists; and if there is a scarcity of premises the court will have to take that into account and fix the rent on what I would call, for want of a better description, a black market basis.  That is a disgrace and is running contrary to what has been the position since 1931.  The rent of a new lease was always fixed on a reasonable basis assuming that demand was reasonable and that there was neither a glut nor a scarcity of such houses on the market.  Resisting to the bitter end attempts to improve a Bill is an example of bad use of Parliament.  It is an example of a Minister coming in with his civil service brief and refusing to yield one inch.  This Bill is so much the worse for that.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides for the renewal of ground rents.  If the country realised what is in this section they would be shocked.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977 on page 21, paragraph 9, states <Col N="1475" /> that Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  There may be a difference of opinion as to how that short sentence should be interpreted. ACRA interpreted it as meaning that ground rents should be abolished at no cost to the tenant.  Fianna Fáil and the Minister say that is not so.  It only means that Fianna Fáil undertook to introduce a scheme to lead to the abolition of ground rents.  Whatever else section 35&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If the Chair goes back to page 17 it states what a reversionary lease is and how the terms are fixed.  I gave a long sermon this morning about a man who took a plot of ground for 99 years for £10 a year and who built a house on it.  After the 99 years his successor seeks a new lease.  That is a reversionary lease.  He finds out that the ground rent has jumped from £10 to £500.  That is what I am grumbling about.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 9 on page 21 of the manifesto undertook to introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents.  ACRA say that meant that ground rents would be abolished at no cost to the tenant and Fianna Fáil say that it did not but only meant they would introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents.  The re-enactment of the 1931 Act, as has been done in Part III of this Bill, is a perpetuation of ground rents on a grand scale.  It is an escalation of ground rents from £10 to £500.  I protest against that in the strongest possible way.</P>
      <P>Committee and Report Stages of Bills are hard to follow but if the country knew that the party which had solemnly undertaken in an election manifesto to abolish ground rents or introduce a scheme to lead to their abolition were piloting through the House a Bill which will increase them by 100 per cent, extend them for scores upon scores of years and make it infinitely more difficult to buy them out, and that they were doing so by the lazy lifting of section after section of the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act and planting it back in this Bill, they would be shocked.  That is what happened and about that there can be no doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 4, 23 and 35 of this Bill worsen the position of the tenant.  Under section 4 the position of an unfortunate businessman could be worsened in an alarming way to the extent that he could be put out of business just because he happened to be a tenant of the State for 50 years instead of a tenant of a private <Col N="1477" /> individual.  Section 23 creates a black market situation for fixing rents and section 35 perpetuates ground rents.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the House for the help that Members have given with this Bill, particularly Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Legislation of this kind is very proper to Committee. Stage debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Any legislation concerned with the property rights of people needs to be looked at very carefully.  That is what the Oireachtas is for.  I think we should welcome constructive amendment of such legislation, and we have had some very useful constructive work where the present Bill is concerned.</P>
      <P>The only really substantial point of difference that arose concerns section 4 of the Bill.  At the conclusion of the Committee Stage debate the Minister for Justice gave an assurance that he would think about section 4 in the light of that debate.  That assurance has been implemented.  The re-examination of section 4 did not result in the tabling of any official amendment of section 4 for the Report Stage.  I do not propose to rehearse the arguments that were put on the one side and on the other; I am only sorry that we have not been able to arrive at an agreed view about the provisions of that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arguments were also raised in the course of the Committee Stage debate against certain other provisions that are contained in the Bill and those arguments have been considered very <Col N="1478" /> carefully.  In some cases it has been possible to concede to those arguments, as is shown by the official amendments that were tabled for the Report Stage.  In other cases it was not so possible. Nevertheless, I trust the House will appreciate that every case that was made was looked at very thoroughly and, even where no official amendment was tabled as a result, it is no bad thing at all to have had the proposals in the Bill subjected to that kind of scrutiny.  All in all. I think the debate on this Bill has been a most useful one.</P>
    <P>Assuming the early enactment into law of the Bill, it would be the intention of the Minister for Justice to bring it into operation at the earliest possible date. We can look forward therefore to having in the very near future a comprehensive, modern and, to a useful extent, consolidated code of landlord and tenant law.  The importance of having such a code may not be very apparent to the man in the street.  However, I feel sure that the business community generally and the legal and conveyancing practitioners in particular will appreciate the benefits of this legislation and will be greatly facilitated in their activities by its enactment.</P>

      <P>Agus an dara léamh á mholadh agam don Bhille seo maidir leis An Foras Náisiúnta um Ard-Oideachas. Luimneach, a chur ar bhonn reachtúil, measaim go mba chóir dom i dtús báire cúlra an scéil a thabhairt i láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar 12 Nollaig 1968 d'eisigh an t-iar-Aire Oideachais, Brian Ó Luineacháin, T.D., ráiteas ag foillsiú go raibh beartaithe <Col N="1479" /> ag an Rialtas institiúid den triú leibhéal a bhunú i Luimneach agus go mbeadh soláthar chaipitil ar fáil chuige sin.  Dúirt an tAire freisin ag an am go raibh sé tar éis iarraidh ar an Údarás um Ard Oideachas moltaí a chur ar fáil faoi conas d'fhéadfaí a leithéid d'institiúid a shníomh isteach sa structúr a bhí nó a bheadh ann i réimse an ard oideachais.</P>
    <P>Sa chéad tuarascáil uathu dár dáta 30 Márta 1969, dhein an tÚdarás um Ard Oideachas na moltaí seo leanas maidir leis an institiúid nua a bhí beartaithe do Luimneach:</P>
    <P>(a)  Cólaiste Ard Oideachais a bhunú i Luimneach;</P>
    <P>(b)  cúrsaí céime a chur ar fáil san institiúid seo maille le réimse leathan de chúrsaí a oirfeadh do mhic léinn nár comhlíon na coinníollacha a bhí leagtha síos ag na hollscoileanna nó nár mhian leo cúrsa ollscoile a leanúint;</P>
    <P>(c)  cúrsaí a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a bhí fostaithe cheana féin agus a theastaigh uathu a gcaighdeán oideachais a ardú nó a gcuid scileanna a fheabhsú nó cáiliochtaí breise a bhaint amach;</P>
    <P>(d)  mic léinn a mhealladh ó gach aird in Éirinn tré cúrsaí a chur ar fáil nach raibh ar fáil cheana féin in institiúidí eile, cé gur thuig an tÚdarás go mbeadh tromlach na mic léinn ag teacht on gceantar thart timpeall ar Luimneach;</P>
    <P>(e)  ba chóir go mbeadh an institiúid nua bunaithe ar na prionsabail seo leanas:</P>
    <P>(i)  institiúid náisiúnta a bheadh ann ag plé le riachtanaisí na tíre go léir agus le mic léinn ag teacht ó gach aird den tír;</P>
    <P>(ii)  cúram ar leith a dhéar mh san institiúid de riachtanaisí in cheantair;</P>
    <P>(iii)  udarás neamhspleách a bheith ar an institiúid ach í a bheith faoi chúram ginireálta an Udaráis um Ard Oideachas;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> (iv)  bunreacht so-athraithe a bheith ag an institiúid ionas go bfhéadfaí le riachtanaisí na tíre agus an cheantair de réir mar a nochtfaí iad san am a bhí le teacht;</P>
    <P>(v)  cúrsaí céime, cúrsaí diploma, cúrsaí teastais a bheith ar fáil agus iad á bhronnadh ag Comhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais;</P>
    <P>(vi)  Ar dtús, bheadh tromlach na gcúrsaí ag leibhéal an teastais agus an diploma agus thabharfadh na cúrsaí sin taithí do lucht stiurtha na hinstitiúide i bpleanáil cúrsaí céime;</P>
    <P>(vii)  an caighdeán iontrála do chúrsaí céime a bheith ar aon dul leis an gcaighdeán ins na hollscoileanna; do gach cúrsa eile a bheadh an tÁrd Teistiméireacht (Pas) no a comhionann ag teastáil;</P>
    <P>(viii)  bheadh obair na hinstitiúide bunaithe ar an dteicneolaíocht ach le réimse fiúntach den éigse.</P>
    <P>Mhol an tÚdarás um Ard Oideachas an cur chuige seo leanas:</P>
    <P>(a)  go mbunódh an tAire Oideachais Bord Pleanála le seisear baill ar a mhéid;</P>
    <P>(b)  go gceapfaí stiurthóir agus cuid den fhoireann sinnsireach; go mbeadh an stiurthóir ina chathaoirleach ar an mBord Pleanála agus go mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar an mbord na sochruithe cuí a dhéanamh maidir le suíomh d'fháil, foirgnimh a thógáil, troscáin agus fearais a chur ar fáil, cúrsaí a chur le chéile, agus mar sin de;</P>
    <P>(c)  go mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar an mBord Pleanála freisin dréacht de bhunreacht don institiúid nua a chur faoi bhráid an Udaráis um Ard Oideachas.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh an chéad tuarascáil seo den Udarás um Ard Oideachas faoi bhráid an Rialtais ar 2 Aibreán, 1969, sar ar leagadh é ar bhord Tithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> Ceapadh stiúrthóir don institiúid agus chuaigh sé i mbun na hoibre ar 1 Eanáir, 1970.  Cheannaigh mo Roinnse an suíomh ag Plassey i Mí Feabhra 1970 agus bunaíodh Bord Pleanála sa mhí céanna.  Seisear a bhí ar an mbord taobh amuigh de'n stiúrthóir-cathaoirleach. Chuathas i mbun deisiú Teach Plassey i 1971 agus bhí an obair sin críochnaithe i 1972.  Tógadh roint foirgneamh réamhdhéanta freisin.  Tugadh cead an chéad grúpa den fhoireann teagaisc a cheapadh i Mí Meán Fomhair 1971 agus faomhadh na cúrsaí a bhí le cur ar siúl sa bhlian acadúil 1972-73.  Tháinig mic léinn isteach san Institiúid nua den chéad uair i Mí Dheireadh Fomhair 1972.</P>
    <P>With the acceptance of the first group of 100 students in autumn, 1972, the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, came into being with programmes leading to diploma and degree awards in administrative systems, business studies, electronic engineering, European studies and materials and industrial engineering.  The accommodation provided in Plassey House and prefabricated structures was quickly supplemented by the first phase of permanent building which, with the aid of a World Bank loan, was commenced in 1972 and completed by 1975.  This provided accommodation for 1,100 students, 18,500 sq. metres.  The new buildings had many new design features and are described as follows in a booklet published by the institute:</P>
    <P>The buildings have been planned in the form of two blocks, one on the east side of Plassey lawn, the other to the south.</P>
    <P>Laboratories, such as the Machine Shops, Mining, Materials Testing, Foundry, Polymer Technology, Metrology, Thermodynamics and Fluids, and Data Processing are located on the ground floor.</P>
    <P>The first floor contains the major Communal Areas such as the Restaurant, Coffee Bar Area, Bar Area and Lecture Theatre.  The main circulation route is at this level, linking <Col N="1482" /> the main vertical staircases and service towers.  This floor also contains the Office Systems Laboratory and the Face to Face Teaching Rooms.</P>
    <P>A large Open-Plan Teaching and Library Area is located on the second floor.  The language Laboratories, T.V. Production Area, Physics and Chemistry Laboratories are also on the same floor.</P>
    <P>The third floor contains the Microscopy, Pollution Control Laboratories, Electronic and Electro-Technology Laboratories.  Music Cubicles and the Museum Area.  It can be seen that the buildings encompass a wide range of uses and it is intended that most future buildings should provide a similar wide range.</P>
    <P>Plassey House is linked to the new building by a bridge at first floor level.</P>
    <P>There are five Service Towers incorporated in the south and east blocks; two currently perform a linking function and the other three will provide linkage and services to the future adjacent buildings.</P>
    <P>Between the Towers are areas of useable floor space.  Considerable attention has been given to the problem of providing this space with as much &ldquo;servicing permeability&rdquo;, allowance for future change and freedom from structural columns as is consistent with economy.  A unique feature of the design is the 1.5 metre wide continuous service channel which runs in each direction within the floor structure between the columns, giving good routine, horizontal pipe and duct runs. Vertical ducts are also provided on this grid, thus allowing for complete flexibility in the most economical manner.</P>
    <P>The technologically orientated programme of study has resulted in a high proportion of large-scale semi-industrial laboratories with special servicing, loading and height requirements. The scale of these and their relation to the smaller spaces has required careful and imaginative treatment. <Col N="1483" /> The gradation of spaces from heavy laboratory and workshop through light laboratory, lecture areas and restaurant to small offices has made for a wide variety of scale.  This, together with attention to detailed design has resulted in a rich and stimulating environment.</P>
    <P>As large laboratories and workshops are difficult to accommodate in buildings of conventional width, deeper buildings of up to twenty metres or more in width have been provided.  By devoting particular care to the plan and section, it was possible to create areas of considerably greater depth than the 15 metres generally regarded as the maximum for naturally ventilated buildings of more than one storey.</P>
    <P>The growth of the institute since 1972 can be gauged by the fact that in the current academic year there are over 1,300 full-time students following degree courses in business studies, administrative systems, European studies, regional studies, public administration, electronic engineering, industrial and management mathematical science, material and production engineering, energy technology and chemical technology with diploma courses in business studies, banking, European studies, industrial electronics, instrumentation and control, computer engineering, materials and production engineering and industrial design.  There is also a certificate level course in data processing as well as post-graduate courses leading to the award of master's degrees and doctorates.  There are over 100 post-graduate students in the institute in the current academic year.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition Government's decisions of 13 December 1974 in relation to higher education included the following in relation to the National Institute for Higher Education Limerick:</P>
    <P>(i)  The National Institute for Higher Education Limerick shall be a recognised college of the National University of Ireland, with the <Col N="1484" /> capacity to evolve into a constituent college of the National University of Ireland or to become an autonomous degree-awarding institution.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The majority of the members of the Governing Body of the NIHE Limerick shall be nominated by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Education and shall include representatives from the trade unions, agriculture, business, industry and educational interests.</P>
    <P>(iii)  A Council for Technological Education shall be established to plan and co-ordinate courses and to validate and award non-degree third-level qualifications in the NIHE Limerick and other institutions.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The National Institute for Higher Education Limerick shall be a designated institution for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(v)  The Governing Body of the NIHE Limerick shall consist of twenty-five members.</P>
    <P>On 5 March 1975 the Government approved a list of names of persons to be invited to act on the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education Limerick.  The first meeting of the Governing Body was held on 19 June 1975.</P>
    <P>The National Institute for Higher Education Limerick was granted recognised college status by the National University of Ireland in 1976, and the university was the degree-awarding authority for students of the institute who graduated in 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>On 14 December 1976 the National Institute for Higher Education Limerick was designated by the Minister for Education as an institution of higher education for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>That, then, was the position when I became Minister for Education.  One of my first actions as Minister for Education was to restore to the National Council for Educational Awards its degree-awarding function.  I had discussions <Col N="1485" /> in the matter with UCG which was the college dealing with the NIHE Limerick on behalf of the National University of Ireland, with representatives of the Governing Body of the NIHE Limerick and with the National Council for Educational Awards.  On 18 November 1977, I announced that the NCEA was to be the degree-awarding authority in the case of students who successfully completed degree level courses in the NIHE Limerick and in the NIHE Dublin, the Thomond College of Education and the Regional Technical Colleges.</P>
    <P>As a result of my discussions with the bodies concerned, a smooth transfer of responsibility for degree awards from the National University of Ireland to the National Council for Educational Awards was achieved.  The NCEA was the degree-awarding authority for the NIHE Limerick from 1978 onwards.</P>
    <P>I now propose to summarise the main provisions of the Bill as it has been presented.  Section 1 deals with the interpretation of the various terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 establishes the Institute which shall be known in the Irish language as An Foras Náisiúnta um Ard Oideachas, Luimneach, and in the English language as the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick. Section 3 defines what is meant by membership of the Institute.  Section 4 provides for the functions of the Institute. The functions are:</P>
    <P>(a)  to provide degree level courses, diploma level courses and certificate level courses, and, with the approval of the Minister, such other courses in education as may seem appropriate to the Governing Body;</P>
    <P>(b)  to engage in research in such areas as the Governing Body may deem appropriate;</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to the approval of the Minister&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to buy, acquire, lease, maintain, manage, administer, dispose of and invest all the property, money, assets and rights of the Institute;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> (ii)  to accept from donors gifts of land, money, or other property upon such trusts and conditions, if any, as may be specified by the donor, provided always that nothing in any such trust or condition is contrary to the provisions of the Act;</P>
    <P>(iii)  to institute and award scholarships, prizes and other awards;</P>
    <P>(d)  subject to the approval of the Minister, to do all such acts and things as may be necessary to further the objects and development of the Institute.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the establishment of a governing authority for the institute, to be known as the Governing Body, and prescribes its structure and functions. More detailed provisions for the operation of the Governing Body are set out in the First Schedule.  The Governing Body is to consist of a chairman, the director and 23 ordinary members.  The chairman and the 23 ordinary members shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister. The manner of appointment of the 23 ordinary members is set out in section 5 (4) and is as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>nine</i> shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with the provisions of section 5 (5) which draws particular attention to the need for adequate representation of industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce and the professions;</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>three</i> shall be appointed who shall be members of the academic staff of the Institute who shall be chosen by the academic staff in accordance with regulations made by the Governing Body;</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>one</i> shall be appointed who is a member of the non-academic staff of the Institute chosen in accordance with regulations made by the Governing Body;</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>two</i> shall be appointed who are full-time students of the Institute <Col N="1487" /> chosen in accordance with regulations made by the Governing Body;</P>
    <P>(e)  <i>three</i> shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of Thomond College of Education, Limerick;</P>
    <P>(f)  <i>two</i> shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staff of Regional Technical Colleges;</P>
    <P>(g)  <i>two</i> shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the management boards of Regional Technical Colleges; and</P>
    <P>(h)  <i>one</i> shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the functions of the Governing Body.  The Governing Body shall manage and control all the affairs and property of the Institute and shall perform all the functions conferred on the Institute by this Act and shall have all such powers as may be necessary under this Act for this purpose.  The Governing Body may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as it thinks proper to assist it in such manner as the Governing Body shall direct and the Governing Body may assign to any Committee so appointed such duties as it thinks fit.  The acts of any such Committee shall be subject to confirmation by the Governing Body unless the Governing Body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a post of chief officer of the Institute, to be known as the director.  The Second Schedule sets out the conditions governing the appointment of the director.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the establishment of an Academic Board for the institute and prescribes the functions of the board.  The Academic Board acts as specialist advisers to the Governing Body on academic matters.  Its functions relate to the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the institute.  The <Col N="1488" /> membership and terms of office of the Academic Board are determined by regulations made by the Governing Body.  Section 8 (3) lists particular functions of the board as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  to design, develop and implement appropriate programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(b)  to make recommendations to the Governing Body for the establishment of appropriate structures to implement such programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(c)  to make recommendations to the Governing Body on proigrammes for the development of research;</P>
    <P>(d)  to make recommendations to the Governing Body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students;</P>
    <P>(e)  to make, subject to the approval of the Governing Body, and to implement the academic regulations of the Institute;</P>
    <P>(f)  to propose to the Governing Body the form of regulations to be made by the Governing Body for the conduct of examinations and for the evaluation of academic progress;</P>
    <P>(g)  to make recommendations to the Governing Body for the award of fellowships, scholarships, bursaries, prizes or other awards;</P>
    <P>(h)  to make general arrangements for tutorial or other academic counselling;</P>
    <P>(i)  to exercise other functions, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, which may be delegated to it by the Governing Body; and</P>
    <P>(j)  to implement any regulations which may be made by the Governing Body concerning any of the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>With the approval of the Governing Body, the academic board may establish such and so many committees either consisting wholly or partly of persons who are not members of the institute as it thinks proper to assist the academic <Col N="1489" /> board in the performance of its functions and may determine the functions of any committee so established.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables the institute to appoint such members of staff as are necessary subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance and to determine the conditions of service and the pay of such staff subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service.  This section, as drafted, includes a provision disqualifying members of the Oireachtas and representatives in the Assembly of the European Communities from becoming members of the staff of the institute and also providing for the secondment of any member of staff who is nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas or is nominated for election to or appointed to be a representative in the Assembly of the European Communities. Since the Bill was drafted and in connection with other Bills which will shortly be coming before the House, further consideration has been given to these disqualification provisions.  I wish to let the House know that I shall be moving an amendment on Committee Stage to eliminate section 9 (6) and section 9 (7) from the Bill and to eliminate from section 9 (5) the words &ldquo;Subject to subsection (6) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the staff serving in the <i>ad hoc</i> institute may be transferred to the service of the statutory body and protects the conditions of service, pay and pension rights of the transferred staff, which will not be any less favourable than the conditions they enjoyed while serving as members of the staff of the <i>ad hoc</i> body.</P>
    <P>Section 11 places responsibility on the institute to prepare and submit to the Minister, as soon as possible after the passing of the Act, a pension scheme for staff.  All provisions of any pension scheme submitted by the institute will be subject to the approval of the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service.  Every approved scheme will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> Section 12 requires the Governing Body to submit to the Minister annually a report of the work of the institute.  The section also provides that the institute will give the Minister any information about its operation that he may require from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that in each year there shall, in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, be paid by the Higher Education Authority to the institute, out of moneys received by the Authority under section 12 (1) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, a grant or grants of such amount or amounts as the Authority thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Section 14 requires the institute to keep accounts which must be submitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When received by the institute the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be submitted with the accounts to the Minister.  The Minister will lay the accounts before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables the institute to charge fees for admission to courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions or any other event held by the institute or for admission to any event held at the institute.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is the usual provision that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the short title and the commencement date.</P>
    <P>I should like to record my appreciation of the great service rendered by the Planning Board in getting the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, off the ground and overseeing its development in the early years of its existence.  I should also like to pay tribute to the work of the <i>ad hoc</i> Governing Body which has been responsible for the affairs of the institute since 1975 and whose term of office has been extended until the institute is established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> The decision of the Government, announced by my predecessor, Mr. Brian Lenihan, TD, in in 1968, was a difficult one, but in hindsight the right one.  It must have been tempting to announce the establishment in Limerick of a university college, modelled closely on those that were well established and well respected in Dublin, Cork and Galway, rather that the creation of a new, and, consequently, less understood concept. The latter was the course, quite consciously taken, in the interests of the people of Limerick and of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is satisfying, now in 1980, to see that the wisdom of the decision is evident; the graduates of NIHE Limerick are providing the country with a new range of expertise in disciplines ranging from Microprocessor Engineering to European Studies, and while providing existing Irish enterprises with the expertise necessary for the &ldquo;microchip age&rdquo;, their very presence serves to attract a variety of new industries into this country.</P>
    <P>In many senses the need to make a new start in Limerick arose from our success in the sixties in stimulating economic growth.  At that time we succeeded in both reawakening Irish business and industry and attracting a considerable amount of foreign investment. Initially, and quite understandably, our development frequently depended on a large labour force eager for work, but for the most part neither highly skilled nor with a background in business or industry.  The dynamic growth of the sixties made it quite evident that we had in Ireland qualities which few abroad had previously attributed to us: we could achieve high levels of productivity and rapidly assimilate new knowledge and acquire new skills.  Those industrial organisations which came to Ireland in the sixties discovered many of our latent strengths and built upon them.  Initially, of course, much of the newly generated employment was not particularly sophisticated or intellectually demanding.  However, <Col N="1492" /> the 1960s served to lay the foundation for a new era of development, which commenced in the 1970s and is now under way in the 1980s.  Ireland is no longer looked upon as a source of cheap, unskilled labour, but as one of the special locations where the engineering, business and scientific expertise necessary for the sophistication of the &ldquo;microchip era&rdquo; is available.  As an indication of this, employment in the electronics industry in 1979 was double the 1973 level, and during the same period the value of electronic exports has grown from £38 million to £305 million. Already there are over 70 companies in the industry in Ireland, including 12 out of the top 100 US electronic firms.  This would have been inconceivable ten years ago, and impossible had we not taken the initiative in the late 1960s to establish the regional technical colleges and to invest heavily in the major technological centre which has been created on the Limerick campus, soon to be followed by a developing Dublin one.</P>
    <P>Increasing numbers of our young people are now well equipped for challenging careers within their own country.  No longer must large numbers of our most talented youth go abroad for employment&mdash;the drain on our life-blood has been stopped&mdash;now our able young people make things happen here and industry is now coming to Ireland in order to avail of this talent.</P>
    <P>The NIHE, Limerick, Bill, 1980, is intended to make statutory a new and important component of the Irish higher educational structure.  It is not intended that NIHE, Limerick, should be inferior, or indeed superior, to the established universities within the State; rather it is intended that its work should be complementary and its standing comparable. Other countries have found need to introduce similar new institutions as their economies develop; I had the privilege of visiting one in Holland.  Indeed the parallel drawn with The Massachusetts Institute of Technology by my predecessor when in 1968 he announced the decision to establish the institute still stands.  The country is at a stage of <Col N="1493" /> economic development where we need a full contribution both from the established universities and the new NIHEs in Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The recently enacted legislation for the National Council for Educational Awards makes it clear that academic standards are set at levels comparable to those in the established universities, while any visitor to the Limerick campus leaves without any doubt that the facilities and equipment already provided compare favourably with the best found within this country or abroad.</P>
    <P>While equivalent in standard and standing to the established universities as a designated body under the HEA, the institute is expected to have a special relationship&mdash;I emphasise this&mdash;with the regional technical colleges.  Through interaction with the RTCs and in conjunction with the NCEA it is intended that programmes and regulations should be developed in a compatible way so as to ensure ready mobility of students.</P>
    <P>The capital investment and resources necessary to achieve levels of excellence in any discipline of engineering or science are great.  However, the best use of our available resources can be achieved only through close collaboration between the various institutions. With careful planning it should be possible to facilitate a student with ability to progress within the State from one centre to another&mdash;an old German custom&mdash;in order to specialise in his chosen field.</P>
    <P>In deciding that degree programmes operated at NIHE, Limerick, and accredited by the NCEA, should be both practically oriented and at the same time comparable in standard to those in the established universities, special constraints are placed on those planning and operating the programmes: not only must the programmes be career oriented but they must also be academically rigorous.  The two requirements are not, of course, mutually exclusive, but nevertheless special effort must be and has been taken to ensure that the sensitive balance is achieved and maintained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> While the institute was assisted by its own developmental consultants, and monitored by the extern examiners of the National University of Ireland, and subsequently by the extern examiners of the National Council for Educational Awards, it was recognised that the success and the standing of the institute would ultimately be measured by the performance of its graduates.</P>
    <P>It is now widely known that NIHE, Limerick, graduates are eagerly sought out by employers, and many individuals&mdash;particularly in areas such as electronic engineering&mdash;assess four to five attractive job offers even before they complete their courses.  As a result each year 80 per cent of NIHE graduates go directly into Irish employment, while of the remainder some 15 per cent undertake research or further study and fewer than 5 per cent go abroad for employment.</P>
    <P>Not as widely known perhaps is the achievement of the smaller number of NIHE, Limerick, graduates who have undertaken postgraduate study abroad in a number of leading university centres. Perhaps the most vivid example is the success of European studies graduates at the College of Europe in Bruges, where over the last three years they have distinguished themselves.  In fact in 1979 an NIHE graduate took first place in a class of 130 postgraduate students drawn from leading educational centres throughout the European Community.</P>
    <P>Various approaches have been adopted to ensure that NIHE, Limerick, undertakes work which is relevant to the needs of the community at large. Perhaps the most successful of those has been the co-operative education programme whereby every national diploma and degree student spends one or two six-month periods in employment off-campus.</P>
    <P>The co-operative education programme introduced in Limerick is new to the country and is perhaps the single most important element of the innovation on the NIHE campus.  Quite obviously the students benefit from their <Col N="1495" /> practical experience, and equally important perhaps is the fact that the faculty members of the institute have an opportunity while supervising students to visit and establish relationships with a wide range of Irish business, industrial, professional and State organisations. Through this interaction changes in the curriculum are brought about, the need to mount new programmes is identified and various consultancy and research projects are initiated.</P>
    <P>During the past year the institute's heavy involvement in the special manpower programme, designed to meet special manpower shortages, has led to a significant increase in enrolment to a total of 2,462 students of whom 1,302 are full time.  While the existing facilities have been modified to some extent to cope with the increased numbers, I was pleased to announce recently that a major expansion is at an advanced planning stage.  When complete this will more than double the available capacity.  In the interim I know that various arrangements are being made to accommodate the increased enrolment planned for the forthcoming academic year.</P>
    <P>Because of its special mission the institute has focussed on the disciplines of Engineering and Business and in 1979 over 350 new full-time students entered the College of Engineering and Science while over 280 entered the College of Business.  In terms of size alone the institute has therefore become the country's main source of engineering graduates and after UCD the country's largest source of business graduates.</P>
    <P>I have avoided entering into too much detail in relation to the provisions of the Bill as the Committee Stage will afford ample opportunity for discussion of such matters.  In this connection I may say that I intend to avail myself to the full of the opportunity afforded by the parliamentary procedure to consider carefully all recommendations and suggestions received by me since the publication of the Bill as well as the observations of the Deputies during the <Col N="1496" /> course of this debate.  One of the most pleasing things in the discussions on the National Council of Education Awards was the input that interested bodies, institutes and Deputies, had to make.  For that reason the early publication of the Bill gave me an opportunity of meeting personally many of those who are interested and of receiving correspondence from individuals and institutions that had a like interest.  I am prepared to move on Committee Stage such amendments as I see fit following a careful review of all proposals.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to achieve a fully satisfactory result in relation to consideration of this Bill as I attach great importance for the future of Ireland to the development of technological education through the National Institutes of Higher Education and the regional technical colleges which will be closely associated with them.  This Act for the establishment of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, will serve as the model for the legislation in connection with the National Institute in Dublin and for Thomond College of Education.  When the provisions of this Bill have been determined I propose to introduce the other two Bills without delay and would, accordingly, anticipate a speedy passage through the Oireachtas for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We all remember the tremendous campaign which was mounted by the good people of Limerick and the surrounding areas in the sixties to have a university established in Limerick.  It was as a result of that pressure that we had the concept of the National Institute for Higher Education and the establishment of the NIHE in Limerick.  The decision to establish it in 1968 was a good one.  The development of the NIHE has been worth while in Irish education.  It has to a large extent been the second arm of our third-level education system.  It has pioneered to a certain extent new types of learning.  Its inter-disciplinary structure is of interest. <Col N="1497" /> Its module system of courses is new to Ireland and experience will tell us how successful this American style of education will be here.</P>
      <P>The concept of inter-disciplinarity, which is the basic concept in the NIHE, is interesting.  I hope&mdash;I say this advisedly&mdash;that the standards obtained by the graduates will continue to satisfy the requirements of the National Council for Education Awards.  It is important that there be close monitoring of standards and of the graduates who come out of the institute.  The growth in student population from 100 in 1972 to the present figure of 2,462 emphasises the awakening of the demand for third-level education. This has become very evident in the past ten years especially.</P>
      <P>The pressure of space in all our universities and now even the NIHE is indicative of the demand for third level education in Ireland.  We have an obligation to ensure that there is proper planning, that their building programmes are brought to an advanced stage.  I am pleased to note that the Minister said that the expansion programme for the institute is at an advanced stage.  I must, of course, express serious reservations about the Government's commitment to an ongoing building programme for our third level colleges, institutes and universities. It is quite obvious from the budget that sufficient money is not being provided for a comprehensive building programme for our universities, regional colleges and institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister at his word when he says that he is &ldquo;pleased to note&rdquo;&mdash;and I welcome the fact&mdash;that there is a building programme at an advanced stage.  I would like him to give an undertaking to the House, because of the poor amount of money laid aside in the budget for the building programme, that there will be no financial constraints causing a delay to the ongoing building programme for the NIHE.  The institute is planned to take 80,000 students and it therefore meshes in with the overall programme needed to provide places for the students who will seek third level education in the coming decade.  There can be no delay in <Col N="1498" /> the provision of a building programme in that institute.  It is important that we meet the demands of our young population in this respect.</P>
    <P>The technological aspect of the institute has been emphasised.  Its involvement in technological and business studies is welcome.  It complements our universities and it is needed in our rapidly changing society and in view of the rapid technological changes which are taking place in industry and agriculture as well as in commerce.</P>
    <P>All that having been said in praise of the establishment of the National Institute for Higher Education, in praise of its development to date and in praise of its plans for the future it saddens me to have to say I am shocked and surprised that Deputy Wilson, Minister for Education, would introduce a Bill of this type to deal with a third-level institute of education.  I went to a university.  I qualified after a struggle, I suppose, like many other students.  I had the privilege of tutoring in UCD for a short while.  On reflection I have come to cherish the concept of independence and autonomy within an educational institute.</P>
    <P>There must be independence at that level.  There must be quite a degree of autonomy within any third-level institute. The spirit of a college or university is important.  Its direction is important. Its independent structures must be set down and understood by its members. If that is done, you can have an <i>esprit de corps</i> or a certain atmosphere, because everyone knows the college is the college is the college.  You understand your own place.</P>
    <P>Here we have an affront to any principle of autonomy and an insult to any concept of independence for highly qualified teachers.  We are not dealing here with a primary school or a secondary school.  We are dealing with an institute for higher education comparable with, as the Minister said, and on an equal footing with, any of our universities. When the former Taoiseach was opening the institute in September 1972 he promised something better than a university. We are not getting that in this <Col N="1499" /> Bill.  Deep disappointment and deep dissatisfaction about the Bill have been expressed by a number of people involved with the institute.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly the Minister has left himself open to considering amendments on Committee Stage.  He said that advisedly because he knows the volume of dissatisfaction with the Bill and the volume of suggested amendments to the Bill.  He knows in his heart and soul that this is not a Bill of which he can be proud. When the NCEA Bill was going through the House he said it could be a monument to him.  It may very well be.  It is now an Act and has the full support of this House and our good wishes for the people involved in it.  I doubt very much that the Minister would want the NIHE Limerick Bill to be a monument to him as Minister.</P>
    <P>I took some time to browse through the charters and statutes of our colleges under the NUI.  I did so out of curiosity and interest and because I want to examine the evolution of approaches to Irish educational institutes.  I should like to refer briefly to the charter for the constituent college of Galway.  I could do so equally in relation to UCC or UCD.  I completely accept that the Irish Universities Bill, 1908, is old and is about to be revised in accordance with the establishment of independent universities.  My understanding is that some of the colleges are quite apprehensive about what will be in the Bill establishing them as independent universities in the context of this Bill.  They wonder will the exercise be worth it.  Will their independence be threatened?  Is their autonomous position now in jeopardy?  Will we have a departmental university system instead of a university system?</P>
    <P>I should like rather quickly to go through this document entitled &ldquo;Revised Draft of the Articles of a New Charter for the Constituent College at Galway&rdquo;. I take it it is a statutory instrument under the Irish Universities Bill, 1908.  It is number 223 and there is a publication reference Cd. 4212.  The price was one penny at the time.  I should like to go <Col N="1500" /> through some of the regulations, not because they are necessarily valid now, but because they give us an idea of the attitude of the Government at that time to a third-level institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my contribution you will see that my comparison is valid.  In Part III dealing with the powers of the college the college is given power without interference&mdash;and this is the point I am making&mdash;to teach students, to provide teaching for other purposes, to provide facilities for original research, to institute and award prizes, to accept donors' gifts of land, money or other property for the foundation of professorships and lectureships, and to establish and maintain or license halls of residence.  That is a rather interesting point in this charter because there is no reference to halls of residence in this Bill. There is a need to meet the requirements of students many of whom are away from home and many of whom are exploited by commercial landlords.  The concept in 1908 of granting power to a third-level college to establish halls of residence is very interesting.  It is very far-sighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The college has power to &ldquo;do all such things in relation to the University as may be authorised by Our Charter founding the University or otherwise; To do all such other acts and things, whether incidental to the aforesaid powers or not, as may be requisite in order to further the objects of the College as a Teaching Body&rdquo;.  The point I want to make is that these powers are given without interference, without reference back to the Minister or the Government, to UCG, UCC and UCD.  I consider <Col N="1501" /> that a proper attitude to autonomy for third-level colleges.  The president in Chapter VI of the charter was seen as the head and chief officer of the college. We have now changed to the concept of director.  I will not quibble with words, it does not matter too much.  The president is given fair powers without reference back to the Minister.  This is the main difference between this Bill and NIHE.</P>
    <P>The governing body is discussed in Chapter VII of the charter and it has relevance to our present day director. Four people were nominated by the Government, four were appointed by the Seanad and the university. That is interesting in relation to having an input and a co-relation between the university and the NIHE.  Three people were professors of the college elected by the academic council and four graduates of the university who were members of the college and elected by the academic council. There was also a right to co-opt three people and the various councils adjacent to the college were allowed to nominate one person.  Membership of local councils has been criticised on a number of occasions and I do not know if it is valid to have elected members serve on governing bodies but I have an open mind on it.  I was a member of the governing body of UCC for a year when I was Mayor of Waterford.  It certainly gives a little insight to the persons serving on the governing body of the college, into the workings of the college and it gives a feeling that if, for instance, one is a member of Waterford in college, the Waterford students had recourse to him if they had a problem in relation to the payment of a grant or in relation to paying fees or even in relation to their ability to study. It is not a political thing but simply a matter of a student having a problem. There is nothing wrong with that.  There is a lot to be said for it.  The Minister in this Bill has power to directly appoint ten people, to indirectly appoint four and by ministerial influence controls the council. I do not agree with that control of the governing body.  The composition of the governing body should be independent of the Minister who should have the right to <Col N="1502" /> nominate a number of people because of the relationship between the Department and the institute.  The governing body should be elected from within the institute independent of the Minister. There is some attempt in the Bill to do that but the manner in which it is structured is not satisfactory and I would like to see a more open approach to the composition of the governing body and to the manner in which members are elected. I am not at all happy that students should be appointed in the manner set out in the Bill, but that is a matter for Committee Stage.  Surely the fact that nine members of the governing body shall be appointed by the Government on the advice of the Minister is overdoing it and is putting the stamp of politics on the governing body.  That is unsatisfactory and is damaging from an educational point of view and from the view of the NIHE itself.  Chapter VIII of the charter deals with the powers of the governing body and again we can see this comparison between interference and non-interference.  Here we have a simple statement:</P>
    <P>The Governing Body shall manage and control all the affairs of the College subject to Our Charter founding the University, to this Our Charter, and to any provisions in the Statutes of the University and the College, and shall direct the form, custody, and use of the Common Seal of the College.</P>
    <P>That was a statement of trust in the governing body.  The powers at the time said that the governing body were responsible for the management of the college and for its resources but now we have a situation where practically anything the governing body does is subject to the Minister's approval.  I would not be surprised if we saw a publication from the Department setting out the rules and regulations for the NIHE in Limerick in the style of the rules and regulations for primary schools.  That is the extent to which this Bill goes.  They could not suspend a porter or buy a table for the director's office without getting the sanction of the Minister.  That is not <Col N="1503" /> satisfactory and it is unacceptable to my party and to me.</P>
    <P>In relation to the academic council, they are given fair powers here but the composition of the academic board is not specified properly.  &ldquo;Academic Board&rdquo; are the words used in the Bill but they are the wrong words, they should be &ldquo;Academic Council&rdquo;.  Chapter II of the charter deals with the officers of the college.  They are specified as the registrar, the bursar and the librarian. We have now a director and a full-time chairman.  As I said in relation to the NCEA Bill there should be statutory protection for the office of bursar, librarian and registrar.  This is an academic body, a third-level education institute and there is need for these protected offices.  The whole body of students relies on a library as do the staff and research so the office of librarian should be protected.  They saw fit in 1908 to specify and protect in a statutory way, a registrar, a bursar and a librarian but we seem to have thrown that concept out the door.</P>
    <P>The question of the appointment of professors, lecturers and other teachers in the college is laid out in Chapter XII:</P>
    <P>(2) The Governing Body shall regulate the provision of Assistants and Demonstrators to the Professors and Lecturers.</P>
    <P>(1) Statutes of the College shall determine what Professors and Lecturers being heads of departments there shall be in the College.  The duties, titles, salaries, and tenure of these several teaching offices shall be respectively such as the Statutes determine.</P>
    <P>The attitude in the Bill is that everything must go back for approval.  Section 9 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Institute may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers (in addition to the Director) and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> This is not for a third-level institute or a college for education; it is more in keeping with a primary or secondary school. To say that the governing body, of its own decision, cannot employ servants and officers without going back to the Minister is an absolute insult to the people who are presently on the governing body and to those who will be on the governing body in future years, as if they would do anything to jeopardise the good standing of the institute.</P>
    <P>The position in respect of the recruitment of academic, teaching and lecturing staff is not really discussed at all in the Bill.  Structures in relation to departments of the institute are not mentioned in the Bill, that there shall be departments or faculties or whatever.  This is only a Bill that was manufactured by somebody, God knows who, but the Minister is responsible for it and all I can do is address myself to him, as the Chair is about to remind me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, being a former lecturer, is well aware of the structure of university colleges and institutes and I do not have to tell him about them.  This Bill does nothing to set down proper structures in the departments and faculties or the rights and responsibilities of lecturers and professors or the method of appointing them.  I do not know if they have to be members of a Fianna Fáil cumann to be appointed.  There should be a <i>modus operandi</i> set down in relation to academic staff in the institute.  There is a reference to transferred staff but there is a complete absence of reference in the Bill to the rights of lecturers, professors and to the method of appointment.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reason why I brought this to the attention of the House was not to recommend the old charter of UCD or UCG but to contrast the attitude that prevailed in 1908 to the establishment of an institute for higher education, as is UCG.  The attitude then in that charter was open, responsible, trusting, <Col N="1505" /> progressive and respectful.  People serving in colleges know where they stand. They have their independence and autonomy.  They are protected by contracts and by their own academic standing.  Any man in a university college who is not academically able for his job will eventually leave or get a nervous breakdown.  The attitude prevailing through the charter is completely ignored in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a monstrosity.  It sets up the NIHE, Limerick, as nothing but a new branch of the Department of Education. I can see inspectors coming to find out what the stocks of pens and pencils are, what stationery there is, making sure that the proper number of biros are there, that the electricity bill has been paid and so on.  That is the attitude in the Bill and it is despicable.  I am astonished that the Minister should come in with this kind of a Bill.  It is designed to downgrade the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority was set up by an Act of 1971.  Section 3 of that Act states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall, in addition to the specific functions given to it by this Act, have the general functions of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) furthering the development of higher education,</P>
    <P>(b)  assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment,</P>
    <P>(c) promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research,</P>
    <P>(d) promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education,</P>
    <P>(e) promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.</P>
    <P>That is very interesting.  The HEA is officially the funding vehicle for NIHE because under the Bill the institute is designated for the purposes of the HEA Act.  It works under the umbrella of the <Col N="1506" /> HEA.  If it does, obviously it must submit to the HEA an annual programme for current expenditure, the wishes of the governing body relating to the general development of the institute and the programme for development of the various faculties and disciplines, and the HEA will give it a block grant.  That is how it will be financed.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of this Bill specifies that:</P>
    <P>In each year there shall, in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, be paid by An tÚdarás to the Institute, out of moneys received by An tÚdarás under section 12 (1) of the said Act, a grant or grants of such amount or amounts as An tÚdarás thinks fit.</P>
    <P>The funding mechanism is from the HEA.  The development of the institute will be under the umbrella of the HEA. Why then in nearly every decision in relation to appointments, expenditure and acquisitions of property must the Minister's sanction be sought?  I can only conclude that the Government wish to downgrade the HEA for some reason or other.  I do not know why.  Perhaps it is because the civil service do not like power moving out of their hands.</P>
    <P>The HEA was set up for the specific purpose of funding and administering in a global manner the third-level sector. That is quite proper and correct.  It is the proper administrative structuring I like to see.  Why then in this Bill must everything be referred back to the Minister when already everything will have to be referred to the HEA?  I do not understand the Minister's attitude.  I do not understand why he cannot trust the Higher Education Authority to do the work they have been doing very commendably but which the Minister seems to wish to ignore in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The HEA were set up to monitor third-level institutions.  That was a half way house.  Over the last ten years I heard many criticisms of the independence and autonomy of the universities in the context of the amount of funding from central funds and it was said they <Col N="1507" /> were not accountable to anybody.  The Higher Education Authority Act was passed with the intention of having a controlling body to act as a buffer between the independence of our higher education colleges and the politicians and the Minister.  That buffer system would allow control by the HEA of the activities of the higher education colleges and at the same time it would be a link between the Minister who has to sign the cheques.</P>
    <P>I find it inexplicable that there are such repetitive requirements for sanction from the NIHE to the Minister on almost every aspect of their activities. That is very sad.  I am disappointed in the Minister.  I should have thought he would be proud to establish the NIHE on a comparable standing with our colleges, giving them comparable responsibilities and independence.  This Bill must raise fears in our colleges about their future under the Minister's intended legislation.  I would like to go through this Bill in detail but I do not wish to be involved in a Committee Stage debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My first major criticism which causes me to oppose this Bill is this: all the certificates, diplomas and degrees must be awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards.  That is wrong.  It is unnecessary and unwise.  I am aware of the controversy that arose in the seventies when the then Minister for Education, Mr. Burke, made NIHE, Limerick, a recognised college of the National University of Ireland.  The present Minister then felt that the NCEA should have power to confer awards.  He is now in power and is obviously adhering to this. <Col N="1508" /> I do not think it was ever envisaged that the NCEA would be given a monopoly situation in relation to the granting of awards.  In my view that is not healthy educationally; it is retrogressive to give the NCEA complete power to award certificates, diplomas and degrees.  It is unhealthy for the institute to be spancelled by this requirement.  By all means let the NCEA be involved with NIHE, Limerick, I will not cavil at that, but to actually forbid NIHE, Limerick, to seek awards from other places, such as universities, professional bodies or even international bodies, is wrong. Educationally that is unsound and it is most unsatisfactory that this should be enshrined in this legislation.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Educational Awards Act has given the NCEA certain powers.  The NIHE have been working through the NCEA.  I will not cavil at that, but it is most undesirable educationally to give complete monopoly to the NCEA in respect of the granting of certificates, diplomas and degrees to NIHE Limerick.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the drafting of this Bill in this respect, to let the NCEA retain their powers and to leave the present position where NIHE actually deal with Limerick, but he should not create a monopoly situation as is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 2 states that the institute shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession. That is necessary but it conflicts with another subsection which makes the governing body a body corporate. However, that is a matter for Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 3 deals with membership of the institute.  I take it that subsection (3), which allows the governing body to confer membership of the institute, means that the governing body may award honorary degrees to worthy people.  I would like some clarification of that point.</P>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the functions of the institute.  I want the Minister to clarify a point.  Section 4 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> The functions of the Institute shall be&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to provide degree level courses, diploma level courses and certificate level courses and, with the approval of the Minister, such other courses in education as may seem appropriate to the Governing Body;</P>
    <P>Why do the governing body have to go to the Minister for sanction for any course?  Under this subsection the governing body cannot introduce a course in education without seeking Ministerial sanction.</P>

The Minister's approval is also required for the acceptance of gifts of land, and so forth.  Why have a governing body at all?  Why not send down a civil servant to make the decisions?  Why appoint such a body unless you have confidence in them?  I do not think this Bill holds out much hope for the future of the NIHE.  The governing body will not be allowed to make their decisions about their own welfare without Ministerial approval. It is extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the composition of the governing body, which will have <Col N="1510" /> 23 ordinary members and a chairman. The first governing body will last for one year.  I do not know why.  I do not wish at this stage to comment on the number of members, which I regard as unsatisfactory. I seriously object to the Government, on the advice of the Minister, having the right to appoint nine members.  It is completely unacceptable to me.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the governing body, again with the approval of the Minister, shall appoint a whole-time director.  Why should the approval of the Minister be necessary?  Surely the governing body, like the governing bodies of universities, should not have to go to the Minister in this way.  One would assume that the governing body would advertise the job properly, process applications and have the ability eventually, and the integrity and the commonsense, to make a wise choice for the benefit of the college.  No, that is to be the job of the Minister.  I hope political influence will not be used but unfortunately it seems from the phraseology that there will be political interference in the appointment of the whole-time director.  At the moment the procedure is that three names go up to the Minister and he will pick his own man, for one reason or another.  I hope we will not have that situation of Ministerial interference here.  It would be anathema to the House, and I will be asking the Minister to remove this requirement of Ministerial approval from that section.  It is dangerous and could be damaging to the future of the college.</P>
    <P>There is provision in relation to the academic board, which I suggest should be called &ldquo;the academic council&rdquo;. However, I will look at that provision before Committee Stage and compare it with the situation in other academic institutions. Section 9 provides for the appointment by the institute of officers, again subject to the approval of the Minister for Education, this time with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  There is reference to &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo;.  What is the distinction? Will the academic staff, professors, lecturers, assistant lecturers or Grade 3 <Col N="1511" /> teachers, be regarded as officers or servants? A major flaw in the Bill is that it does not set out properly the methods of appointment of academic staff and the relationship of officers with servants.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the HEA will give a grant to the NIHE to enable them to carry out their functions and activities, but why go back to the Minister for sanction when it is obvious that the NIHE can appoint only the number of people they have money to pay?  Again, this Ministerial presence is objectionable. Such appointments are to be made with the approval of the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service, not the Minister for Finance in this case.  We are getting into a macabre situation with all sorts of people doing all sorts of things for all sorts of reasons.</P>
    <P>A further section provides that the institute shall not remove or suspend any of its officers without the consent of the Minister.  That is extraordinary.  As I said earlier, why have a governing body at all?  Who will monitor all this?  Surely it will take an enormous number of civil servants' time and paper to do this.  There will have to be duplicate copies of the relevant documents for the HEA, with courtesy copies for the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Public Service, the heads of departments in the college, members of the academic staff and the governing body, leading to an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that, in our university colleges, there is an accepted measure by which one can take one's seat; I think one is paid half salary and one does some work in the university.  That is a more modern concept than that of being completely isolated from the institute.  However I am sure there will be other opinions expressed <Col N="1512" /> on that.  I have a fairly open mind on it and I am pleased the Minister has made some reference to his intention in this matter.</P>
      <P>Section 9 (7) states:</P>
      <P>A person who is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein or entitled to hold office as a representative in the Assembly of the European Cummunities, shall, while so entitled, be disqualified from becoming an officer (including the Director) or servant of the Institute.</P>
      <P>That is unduly harsh and I would think needs to be looked at.  Section 10 deals with transferred staff and section 11 with superannuation where the presence of the Minister and of the Minister for the Public Service is very much in evidence.  I cannot cavil with section 12 dealing with report and information to the Minister, although I assume a similar report will have to be made to the HEA on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>The First Schedule deals with the Governing Body in respect of which I should like the Minister to clarify the wording of paragraph 1.(2).</P>
      <P>The seal of the Institute Body....</P>
      <P>What does &ldquo;Institute Body&rdquo; mean? It is not defined in the definitions section and I should like some clarification on it.  I do not wish to deal with a number of items in the First Schedule because they are matters for Committee Stage, although I shall have something to say about them then.</P>
      <P>We have here a Bill which is entirely unsatisfactory, in that it is one to establish a higher institute of education in this country.  It is a most disappointing Bill and I would never have expected the Minister to have put his name to such a niggardly and negative Bill, to one that does not give independence and autonomy to a higher institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to representation in Seanad Éireann for <Col N="1513" /> graduates of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  No specific reference was made by the Minister to this matter.  While I appreciate that his Universities Bill has not been processed there is a case for granting a seat to the National Institute for Higher Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely saying there might be a reference to it in this Bill and I am asking the Minister to state his position on it.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the interconnection&mdash;as recommended by the Minister&mdash;with the RTCs.  Of course there must be an inter-connection; there must be a vertical integration with students in our regional colleges.  They must be afforded an open opportunity to progress from one discipline in an RTC to a discipline in another RTC, or vertically to a discipline in the NIHE.  That is very important.  Of course this raises the question of admissions policy to which the Minister did not refer.  As laid down in the prospectus of the NIHE, by and large the degree requirements are similar to a university.  Indeed NIHE, Limerick, is involved with the central applications office in UCG.  I should like to feel that the policy of NIHE, Limerick, in relation to admissions would be a more generous one than that at present applying to our universities, especially when we are endeavouring to promote participation by RTCs up to degree level within the NIHE.  I should like to see overall policy in that respect spelled out in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I honestly feel this Bill should be withdrawn.  It is one that does not meet the requirements of a higher institute of education.  It is too restrictive.  Also the Minister's presence is unnecessary in view of the existence of the Higher Education Authority and I would ask the Minister to withdraw it.  My party will be opposing it on Second Stage, not because we do not want to see NIHE, <Col N="1514" /> Limerick, established on a statutory basis; of course we do; it is most important that NIHE, Limerick, is established on a statutory basis but it is much more important that, in so doing, the foundations laid in this Bill be sound and in my opinion, they are very unsound and will lead to a very unhappy relationship between the governing body and the Department of Education.  There is no need for the interference by the Department in the affairs of the Institute because the Higher Education Authority has that responsibility, the function to control and co-ordinate the finances and so on, and indeed the general development of NIHE, Limerick.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the Bill because it is not one suitable for an institute of higher education.  It is one which, if passed in this House, will put the cause of autonomy in our third-level institutes back many years.  I am sorry to have to oppose the Bill.  I am sorry the Minister has seen fit to introduce it in order to establish on a statutory basis such a tremendous concept, that of the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick.  It is a sad day that the Minister introduced such a Bill and perhaps he would consider withdrawing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here today legislating ostensibly for the establishment on a statutory basis of a new national institution.  In reality we are somewhat in danger of creating something more like the glorified community school.  I have no quarrel with the concept of community schools as I understand it&mdash;I have some quarrel with the Minister's concept of community schools.  Of the right kind, in the right place and doing the right job there is nothing wrong with them, especially if they are integrated into the kind of national administrative structure we in the Labour Party would like to see.  But community schools&mdash;and I shall not delay the House much longer on this&mdash;have complained with considerable justification for a long period of time about the incredible restrictions placed on their legitimate freedom of action <Col N="1515" /> by the fact that they are tied directly to the apron strings of the Department of Education.  Of course the apron strings about which we are talking are essentially financial.  In structural terms there is not an awful lot to choose between the subservience of the average community school directly to the Department of Education and the proposed subservience of this proposed National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick to the same source and font of authority, power and resources.  Of course it is to be a national institution.  It is essential that a national institution have a direct link with the Department of Education and with its political head, the Minister for Education.  To wrap it up as this Bill seeks to do in such a spider's web of approvals, sanctions and conditions runs the very real risk of strangling, not quite at birth, because it is a very lusty infant at the moment, but at a very early stage in its development what is substantially one of the most vibrant educational institutions in this country with the dynamism which must inform this stage of its development particularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before saying any more along these lines I would like to review briefly the background to the Bill we are discussing here today.  The original decision made by the Government of which Deputy Lenihan was Minister for Education was to resist the very vocal, well-organised pressure coming from the Limerick city and county regions for a university or university college.  It must have been a difficult decision for the Government of the day, especially for a Fianna Fáil Government who find it very difficult to resist popular decisions even though they are the wrong ones.  I must give credit to that Fianna Fáil administration and that Minister for having taken the right decision for that place and at that time.  If we look at the decision in a wider perspective we will see that it was absolutely inescapable that a national institution such as this NIHE of Limerick had to be established in order at the very least to complement the work proposed to be done by the regional technical colleges <Col N="1516" /> in the different areas.  It did not make much difference at that time where it was to be situated.  The important thing was that it should be situated somewhere and if it was situated in Limerick at least there was as good reason to situate it there as anywhere else.  The decision was good regardless of the political pressures being brought to bear at the time.</P>
    <P>In 1974 the previous Government decided to make the Limerick NIHE, in its <i>ad hoc</i> form as it then was and as it continues at the moment, into an institution which would have its degree qualifications awarded and recognised by a college of the National University of Ireland.  I opposed that decision at the time and I criticised it.  When I joined the Labour Party in 1975 it was in the full knowledge that any attempts that I might make within that party to bring pressure to bear to change that decision might not be successful, as indeed they were not.  I make this point not in any political sense and I am sure that the Minister will not seek to score cheap points off me when he stands up to reply. Anybody engaged in politics will know that when you join an organised political institution such as a political party, especially if you come into it from a position where you have complete freedom from any institutional associations as I had when I was an independent Member of Seanad Éireann, you trade a certain freedom, to speak publicly, in return for a much greater input into the democratic decision-making processes of the organisation you join.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I disagreed with the decision not to make the NCEA the degree-awarding body for the Limerick NIHE and was instrumental at the time in publishing large chunks out of a document which I gather was known within the Department of Education as the &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo; which showed very clearly the very high calibre of the advice presented to the Government of the day by the Department of Education of the day and rejected by that Government. This advice, if accepted, would have led to an earlier resolution of at least some <Col N="1517" /> of the problems in connection with the development of higher education that have bedevilled us for the past five or six years.</P>
    <P>I have already said that an NIHE was necessary in order to complement the work of the RTCs, but its work and the work of the RTCs themselves was made necessary by very much larger national and international trends which were creating substantial dangers for our industrial and commercial progress.  These national and international trends, particularly in industrial employment and technology, were helping to bring about a situation in which we in this country, with a rapidly growing young population, were educating that population in such a way that they simply were not fitted in many respects for the jobs that were available for them when they left education.  There is no point in going into this in any detail because it was a truism, and unfortunately still is today, that the educational system that we had then and still have to a substantial degree was, and is, over academic in character at a time when national investment in education should be mirroring employment, technological and developmental trends in our society generally.  We are not alone in this and we may be rather better off than some other countries, which might surprise some Deputies in this House, but there was a problem at the time the NIHE was established and it remains today.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the House the benefit of a few quotations from authoritative sources to indicate the dimensions of that problem.  The HEA, in their <i>Observations of the Higher Education Authority on Paragraph 7.33 in the Green Paper &ldquo;Development of Full Employment&rdquo;</i> have a particularly tart paragraph which is relevant here.  It is paragraph 4 of their comments:</P>
    <P>Ireland has no monopoly of natural talent and it would be native in the extreme to expect to meet competitors on equal terms if we are less highly trained than they are.  It is not in our interest, therefore, to make higher <Col N="1518" /> education less attractive for future entrants, or to limit even further the section of society which can afford to take higher education: it would be enormously in our interest to make higher education more attractive and to increase the provision of student places.</P>
    <P>Of course, the HEA did not say that on the assumption that expansion <i>per se</i> was all that was needed in higher education.  You could expand in the arts faculties in our universities until they provided places for anybody who wanted to go into them or virtually regardless of qualifications, but that would not be an answer to the problems of skilled industrial employment.  Expansion has to take place in a planned way and in a way that minimises the wastage of resources that higher education gobbles up in enormous quantities at an ever-increasing rate.  The moral discovered over the past few years is that very many of the traditional academic areas are wasteful of public resources and there is an intense need to direct investment in higher education into other areas.  Professor A. M. Ross, who is head of the Department of Education Research at the University of Lancaster and is the external examiner in education for the National University in Ireland gave an interesting paper to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in this area.  He commented, in particular, on developments in posts in secondary education and posts in compulsory education in the context of the division between academic-type education and technical-type education.  He said:</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to criticise adversely the efforts of those whose abilities are such that they are adept at theoretical analysis and all the other highly developed cognitive skills which lie behind academic work of high quality.  A society such as ours needs such people, especially those who are good at these pursuits.  There is, however, in most societies, a tendency to over-produce such people; <Col N="1519" /> this appears in socialist societies as well as in our own.</P>
    <P>He quoted the example of Hungary in particular and he went on to say:</P>
    <P>We have always served well those of our young people whose development comes best through advanced academic study.  We should recognise that there are other ways towards fulfilment and the path of advanced technical and vocational education offers for some the best way forward &mdash;including some who are at present taking degree courses of the more theoretical kind.  This is not, of course, to say that many degree courses in universities as well as in polytechnics are not vocational; the plea here is for the development of middle range courses declared by practical, certainly applied, but stopping short of that further development which turns the technical into technological and the practical into theoretical.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable statement of the situation.  I believe that sentiments like those, are obviously important in the overall decision to establish a national institute for higher education along the lines that it was established.</P>
    <P>The experience of the National Institute for Higher Education has borne out both the wisdom of the original decision to establish it and has continued to exemplify the problems which it faces.  It is ironic that even comparatively recently, according to my information, the ratio of applicants for courses at the Limerick NIHE was in inverse proportion to the employability of qualified people issuing from the areas concerned. All the courses of the Limerick NIHE produce highly employable people but it is a fact, deriving at least in part from the character of our second level education, that those courses&mdash;I am speaking here of a year or two ago&mdash;which had marginally more difficulty in placing their graduates or other qualified leavers in courses were actually among those in the Limerick NIHE which were most over-subscribed because, of course, they <Col N="1520" /> were the courses in the areas which bore most resemblance to the academic areas which have traditionally provided the bulk of the student population in third-level education and in second-level education as well.</P>
    <P>There is one good particular aspect at the work of the Limerick NIHE which I would like to pay a little attention to, which was referred to in the Minister's speech when he spoke about a co-operative education programme in which every national diploma and every degree student spends one, two or six month periods in employment off campus.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Co-operative Education Programme introduced in Limerick is new to the country and is perhaps the single most important element of the innovation of the NIHE campus.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure what the Minister means by &ldquo;the country&rdquo;.  I wonder if he is totally accurate in saying that it is completely new on this island?  I know that the Institute of Continuing Education in Derry, formally McGee College, has been doing research and innovation along those lines and although the content of its courses is slightly more arts-than technology-orientated, it is true to say that they probably have a work content as well.  I am aware of one post primary school in Derry which has elaborated a scheme which allows its pupils, even during compulsory school-going age, to spend some time in employment outside the class room as part of their general education.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that universities and other third-level institutions could learn a lot from this and perhaps Government Ministers and Government Departments could learn from it as well. The degree to which intelligent young people can spend vast periods of their lives without ever leaving the institutional boundaries of the educational system cannot be good either for the educational system or for them.  The former chairman of the Higher Education Authority, Mr. Sean O'Connor, suggested on one occasion that the initial <Col N="1521" /> years of higher education should be part-time. I believe that such a move would improve the quality of higher education. It might lessen the demand for places or at least allow it to be dealt with in a more flexible manner and I believe it would also be to the benefit of the students concerned and, therefore, to the country as a whole.  We should be looking for a far more flexible relationship between work and study not just at the third level but at the upper secondary level as well.  I pay tribute to the Limerick NIHE for what they have done in this area.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I visited the NIHE and went around it for a fairly extended period, talking to staff and student members about their work, the conditions under which they worked and about the plans they had for the future. Although I was treated with complete courtesy and openness it is true to say that the level of impatience and frustration experienced by the staff in particular, and by many of the students of the institute, at the delay and inertia of their lords and masters in the Department of Education was positively tangible. I was shown expensive equipment, equipment so expensive that it was one of two or three models only of its kind in the entire country, which had not been uncrated for months, or used, because there was no place to put it and probably not even a socket to put a plug into.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that some delays are necessary, but the people responsible for the control of the National Institute for Higher Education&mdash;and for four years a Minister of the National Coalition Government was in charge of that Department&mdash;have brought delay to a fine art.  The politics of inertia have come to be used more and more by Government Departments in general, but by the Department of Education in particular, as a way of deferring decisions about the allocation of resources, until the time comes when the job has to be done anyway and probably costs twice as much as it would have cost had the money been made available in the first place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> It is on the basis of this experience, I have no doubt, that such whispers as have reached me about the reaction within the institute to the Bill we are discussing today can be located.  They have had some very bitter experiences over the past eight years or so.  They looked at this Bill and asked: &ldquo;Will it make that much difference?&rdquo;  and concluded regrettably that it will not.  Before leaving this section of my speech I should like to say I think all Members of the House who contributed to the debate so far would like to pay a particular tribute to the director of the institute, Dr. Edward Walsh, for the work he has done since the setting up of the institute on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis some eight years ago.  It goes without saying that there are many components of the undoubted success which has attended the institute, despite its vicissitudes in the period since it was established, but, without a good director, the institute would not have been able to make the most of its advantages or, indeed, to overcome many of the disadvantages with which it was faced initially and during its first eight years of life.</P>
    <P>Dr. Walsh had to come into an environment in the city which, although welcoming, was somewhat cagey in its welcome for an institute which was not exactly what it had wanted.  I believe he is chief among those who have made the institution a showpiece now for the Limerick region.  The work he and his staff have done deserves to be honoured. In passing I would express the hope that, in their undoubted search for excellence, which I am sure they will achieve, especially at degree level, the institute will not neglect unduly the diploma and certificate levels.  I am well aware these are, to some degree, the greater responsibility of the regional and technical colleges. On the other hand, there are courses in the NIHE which would positively demand the establishment not just of certificate and diploma qualifications but of certificate and diploma qualifications which are nationally recognised as qualifications in their own right, and not just as stepping stones on to the degree level.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the question <Col N="1523" /> of the autonomy of the institute concerned. I confess I have some difficulty, philosophically speaking, with the concept of partial autonomy.  An institution either has automony or it does not.  I do not believe realistically that any institution of this kind, in receipt of such huge amounts of public funds, can legitimately look for or demand total freedom from all restraints in the spending of money.  Nor would I think for a moment that they are actually looking for it.  Of course they are not.</P>
    <P>All institutions in receipt of public funds, in the view of this party, should be subject to appropriate degrees of public control.  We can dispense with the word &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; as being a concept which is not particularly useful here. What we are talking about are the areas of legitimate freedom in which any third-level institution, and more especially one established and funded almost entirely by the State, may be expected to operate.  Looking at the Bill, I am struck by the contrast which occurs to me between the institutional arrangements for governing this institution and the institutional arrangements for establishing public accountability in other educational institutions in receipt of public funds.</P>
    <P>At the primary school level, for example, we have institutions which, as to current expenditure at any rate and as to the greater part of capital expenditure, are supported almost wholly from public funds.  Yet, the only direct public input into their immediate local government, as it were, is two elected parents on a board of management: 90 per cent plus public funding, and 33? per cent approximately public involvement.  Here we have a national institute for higher education which, quite apart from the question of the composition of the governing body, is to be so hedged around with rules and restrictions as to make effective working very difficult.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister may reply that he is thinking in terms of a national institution and that local institutions deserve different forms of public participation in <Col N="1524" /> management.  I do not think the argument holds.  The basic principle we hold to is that of appropriate public control for institutions in receipt of public funds. We believe the amount of public control written into this Bill for this institute is inappropriate and will be seen inevitably as such.  Already staff have criticised this aspect of the Bill's proposals.</P>
    <P>The Irish Federation of University Teachers say in a statement from which I quote that the structure of the governing body &ldquo;shows a total lack of faith in the future growth of an independent, dynamic institution at Limerick&rdquo;.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>The Bill states that there shall be an Academic Board but makes no specification as to the composition or structure of this Board.  Given the lack of an adequate academic voice at Governing Body level, I.F.U.T. believes that the Bill should provide that the Academic Board be composed of academic staff of all levels from different academic areas in the Institute.  It is only through the authority of such a body&mdash;and not through external control mechanisms&mdash;that the academic reputation of the Institute can be established and maintained.</P>
    <P>I might suggest to the Irish Federation of University Teachers that the student population also have a valid role to play on academic boards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins has already referred to the fact that under section 9 the Minister has power not just to veto appointments in general but to veto the appointment of particular people.  I have no doubt that on Committee Stage this is an area to which we will devote a great deal of attention.</P>
    <P>The NIHE group of the ASTMS which represent many of the staff there have also come out with some fairly trenchant criticisms, relating the Bill to what they have experienced in the past. Their submissions states:</P>
    <P>The Institute having no statutory existence, management has always had to seek the permission of the <Col N="1525" /> Department of Education before agreeing to any claim involving expenditure&mdash;which most do.  Such permission has been rarely&mdash;if ever&mdash; forthcoming, with the frequent result that the ASTMS has been compelled again and again to take to a Rights Commissioner, or the Labour Court, cases which an independent management would have conceded immediately. This was not the purpose for which our industrial relations machinery was established Moreover, since we eventually win most of the cases anyway, it causes quite unnecessary frustration and resentment among the staff involved.</P>
    <P>They go on to say:</P>
    <P>Two more results of the benign influence of the Department: in an institution now ten years old there is still NO properly-established pension scheme and NO mechanism for promotion.</P>
    <P>Regarding one very small point of detail, I would query whether the exclusion from the governing body of members of the European Assembly is entirely appropriate.  There may by occasions on which members of that Assembly who are not members of the Oireachtas may find membership of the governing body of institutions such as NIHE, Limerick to be of value to them in terms of keeping in touch with the local scene, which obviously they must do, and, in view of developments in Europe, of particluar assistance to the development of the institution concerned.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been made of the role of the Minister in all these appointments and the sanctions he may exercise. Deputy Collins raised the role of the HEA and suggested that this would be a more appropriate overseeing body than the Minister in relation to many of the conditions and sanctions in the Bill. There is probably a structural problem here in that the function of the HEA is to advise the Minister not to regulate institutions. Their function is completely advisory, so much so that they have not <Col N="1526" /> even been able to get from the Minister the staff needed to carry out their own functions in relation to urgently required research into higher education.  It is true to say, nevertheless, that over the years since their establishment the HEA have acted as a kind of honest broker between the institutions of higher education and the Department of Education and, ultimately, the Cabinet who make the final decision about the allocation of resources.  Though there might be a problem about writing it formally into the Bill, I see no reason why the HEA should not continue to exercise this brokerage function in relation to development, staffing policies, conditions of employment, development of courses and so on of the NIHE, Limerick.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that he has not a closed mind on this topic, but I feel that he could have given us a lot more than a commitment to amend that part of the Bill in relation to the rights of various people who are nominated for political office.  I would appeal to him seriously to rethink the content of this Bill as expressed in its details and provisions and to recognise that the establishment of the NIHE as a national institution does not necessarily mean that they must continue to go cap in hand to the Minister for every farthing spent.  The history of the last decade has shown the NIHE how frustrating and stultifying this process must be.  To pass this Bill in its present concept would be to condemn them to a life sentence.</P>

At the end of my introductory speech I promised the House that I would listen very carefully to the points made during the course of discussion and that those points, together with those made by the various interested parties, those whom I met personally and others from whom I had correspondence, would be taken into account on Committee and further stages of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little disappointed in the contribution made by Deputy Collins.  I <Col N="1527" /> would have thought he could have done some original thinking of his own and not depended on documentation which was received by all Members of this House who have an interest in this Bill.  He went back to the 1908 National University of Ireland Bill to make some points.  He was conscious of how inappropriate this was because, as everybody knows, at that time the percentage of the finances of a university subscribed by the State&mdash;in this case by the Crown&mdash;was very much lower than at present.  There seemed to be a certain line of thinking in the argument developed by Deputy Collins that if there were any great degree of State involvement in a third-level institution <i>ipso facto</i> this made for a third-level institution of inferior quality.  Had Deputy Collins studied the situation with regard to the third level institutions &mdash;and particularly those in the technological field in the European Economic Cummunity, for example&mdash;he would have seen that there are institutions there of the greatest excellence which are subjected to a degree of control by the State which is unbelievable in this country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the findings of a recent report <Col N="1528" /> that there is no safe lead air pollution level and if so, if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the report referred to by the Deputy is the Lawther report on lead and health published very recently in Britain.  I have been unable to find a statement in the report to the effect that there is no &ldquo;safe&rdquo; lead air pollution level. Paragraph 125 of the report, however, states that no firm evidence exists for guidance on what might be taken as a wholly &ldquo;safe&rdquo; level in the environment or the body.  This is a very different matter and, in fact, the findings of the report appear to be reassuring, in so far as they may be applied to conditions in Ireland generally.</P>
      <P>I might also mention that there is an EEC directive on the biological screening of the population for lead which defines reference levels for blood lead in members of the general population and requires remedial action to be taken if the reference level criteria are not met. The Department of Health, which is responsible for implementing the directive, has carried out the monitoring operations required by the directive and forwarded the results to the EEC Commission. I am informed that the criteria prescribed in the directive are met in Ireland.  Furthermore, the results of the monitoring at the Dublin stations in Dame Street and O'Connell Street are not unsatisfactory.  The annual mean concentrations on a 24-hour basis are below the level of 2 micrograms per cubic metre, which is the standard proposed in the EEC directive on air quality standards for lead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, it is a matter for local authorities to investigate instances of pollution and take any necessary remedial action.  I understand that a complaint concerning water pollution alleged to have been caused by effluent from this company's farm was investigated by Meath County Council in September last, when a bacteriological test on a water sample indicated that the water was fit for human consumption and that there was no indication of pollution.</P>
      <P>I also understand that planning permissions for agricultural buildings provided by the company in question at Connellstown, Enfield, have been granted by the planning authority, subject to conditions.  I am informed that the latest development by the company is currently the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>As to the particulars furnished by the Deputies with the Questions, I have sent a copy of this material to Meath County Council for attention and have asked them to communicate with the Deputies in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he not agree that this is a very serious matter which could possibly be fixed up quite easily?  It is a question of fact of whether or not there is pollution.  Would the Minister not agree that the suggestion made by the local people that, in fact, the sample of water which was analysed was taken out of a tap and not taken out of the river, if true, would be a very serious allegation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the circumstances, would the Minister ask Meath County Council to have the whole matter reviewed?  I am rather interested in seeing that this matter is straightened out.  Could he ask <Col N="1530" /> Meath County Council as a matter of urgency to look into this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Deputy's statement, I have no evidence that what the Deputy says is correct.  I have asked Meath County Council to investigate the matter fully.  I have also asked them, as I said in my reply, to communicate with the Deputies who have tabled the questions.  The matter is receiving urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently.  No report, as such, came to my Department as regards this matter.  It, however, came to our notice and we contacted Meath County Council, as the responsible body in this matter.  They have the responsibility as regards water pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is quite evident that the local people, unless they felt that there was something seriously wrong, would not have gone to the trouble that they have gone to?  Would the Minister not agree that, in the interests of the organisation concerned, he should try to get the matter cleared up as quickly as possible and not simply say the water was all right and that they would have to put up with it, even though the lives of people may in consequence, depend on whether or not it is all right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make the position clear to the Deputies.  I am sure both Deputies are well aware that Meath County Council are the authority responsible for the investigation of water pollution in their area and they carried out the investigation.  It is their responsibility to do so.  They have been asked by my Department to treat this as a matter of urgency and have been asked to report to the Deputies concerned.  I have confidence that Meath County Council will do this and have every confidence, also, that the Deputies will follow up the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that pollution from agricultural sources, including run-off from slurry-spreading on land, has been giving rise to problems in some areas, notably in the Lough Sheelin catchment and I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 367 on 27 February, 1980, in which I pointed out that the problem of over-enrichment in this lake and its feeder streams is largely an agricultural one, a solution to which is being actively sought by a number of bodies.  My Department is participating in these efforts.</P>
      <P>It is for the local authority to take any necessary action in relation to offences under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  Officers of my Department have visited the Lough Sheelin area and reported to me on conditions in the area.  My Department wrote subsequently to the Cavan County Council, drawing attention to their responsibilities in the matter and requesting that every effort be made by the council to prevent pollution of the lake from any source and to secure appropriate evidence for prosecution of offenders.</P>
      <P>As regards the operation of the 1977 Act generally, I have, on two recent occasions, publicly expressed dissatisfaction at the limited extent to which the wide ranging powers under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 have been availed of by local authorities and I have indicated that I expect a more positive approach to the implementation of the Act.  I am having the matter pursued with local authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to possible further legislation in the water pollution control area, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 310 on 11 March, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed information as to the number of prosecutions taken under the Act, the location of the areas or waters in respect <Col N="1533" /> of which any such prosecutions were taken, or the outcome of such prosecutions, is not available to me.  In this connection, I might point out that prosecutions for some of the primary offences under the Act may be taken by any person. As to prosecutions by authorities, I am aware of four prosecutions in 1978, one in County Wexford, two in County Limerick and one in Offaly.  A fine of £200 was imposed in the Offaly case.  No fines were imposed in the other three cases, where the defendants gave undertakings to discontinue the polluting discharge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State say what action, if any, his Department have taken in relation to Lough Sheelin since the Taoiseach gave his personal undertaking to have the matter rectified and can he tell the House whether his Department have had any communication from the Taoiseach in relation to that undertaking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the pollution of Lough Sheelin, as I said in my reply, is getting the attention which it needs.  Again, it is entirely a matter for the local authority and we have been pressing them for action as regards this matter.  As I said, I am not satisfied that the Water Pollution Act, 1977, is being administered by the local authorities in the way we would expect.  The Taoiseach is keeping in close touch with the situation because, like everybody else, he is interested in preventing this kind of pollution, which is all too prevalent.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is it not a fact that there is a committee consisting of representatives of the Departments of Forestry and Fisheries, Environment and Agriculture dealing with this matter and investigating ways of facilitating the disposal of slurry?  Further, is it not a fact that a Minister of the Taoiseach stated that in the national interest and in the interest of the economy of County Cavan the disposal of the slurry would be facilitated by grant aid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

With the help of agricultural advisers they are trying to find ways of dealing with the matter to the satisfaction of all concerned.  Allegations that Cavan County Council are not accepting responsibility with regard to this matter have been investigated.  It is not an easy problem to deal with.  It is an urgent matter and I can assure the House that everything possible has been done to find an acceptable solution.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I take it the Minister is aware that piggeries in the area in question were constructed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Department of Agriculture and with the assistance of grants provided by the Department.  Finally, I suggest to the Minister, as would appear from his original reply, that there are other offending agencies contributing to the pollution. Town sewage is finding its way into the lake.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give permission to local authorities to purchase houses from private builders where a surplus of such houses exist in their area and where the demands for local authority housing cannot be met within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 422 of 8 November last.  As indicated in that reply, the basic aim of the Government's housing policy is to ensure that, as far as the resources of the <Col N="1540" /> economy permit, every family can obtain a dwelling of good standard located in an acceptable environment at a price or rent they can afford.  A secondary aim is to encourage owner-occupation.</P>
      <P>The private housing sector is encouraged by various subventions from public funds to provide as many as possible of the required dwellings.  The local authority housing programme is geared to meet the housing needs of persons and families who are not in a position to build, purchase or rent suitable private accommodation for themselves.</P>
      <P>Housing construction by local authorities is intended to be additional to the maximum output which can be encouraged from the private sector.  It is planned, designed and built to specific standards to meet the ascertained needs of applicants on approved waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Dwellings are built in locations and to plans chosen to meet these needs appropriately.</P>
      <P>The programme provides an important source of well-spread and steady employment additional to the work force engaged in the private housing sector.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are, therefore, required to construct their new dwellings themselves, or to have them designed and built to the approved standards, normally on the basis of open competitive tendering.</P>
      <P>Occasionally, and in exceptional circumstances, authorities may propose the acquisition of individual existing private dwellings to meet some special requirement. Such proposals are considered by me on their merits and in the light of the capital resources available to me for the construction of new local authority houses generally in any year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>While that reply is very interesting it does not really answer the question.  Would the Minister agree that the amount of money allocated by the Department for the construction of local authority housing in 1979 and 1980 was inadequate last year and is inadequate this year also to meet the demands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the question on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there was available in 1979 and again in 1980 more money than has been available in any other year to meet the requirements of local authorities, perhaps not in full, but this is due to our having a growing and young population which means that the demands are increasing all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any need for the Minister to be on the defensive. He knows that the moneys are not adequate and that every local authority are passing resolutions seeking extra money. Would the Minister agree also that because of the downturn in the economy many builders cannot dispose of houses in the private sector and would it not be a good idea to match the demand and the funds on the one side with the surplus of demand on the other side and to allow local authorities to buy houses that have been built by the private sector as a means of reducing their housing lists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that that would not be a good idea but sometimes it is something that is very difficult to operate.  However, I am prepared to consider any proposal that comes from a local authority concerning the purchase of private houses.  Any such houses would be considered from the point of view both of suitability as to location and from the point of view of standard. This happened in my former constituency in relation to houses at Ballingarry which were taken over by the local authority to meet local needs. There is not any objection to this being done and if any local authority has a proposal of this kind, we would consider it.</P>

    <P>The Government's employment maintenance scheme under which official assistance was provided for the textiles, clothing and footwear, including tanning, industries terminated on 31 March 1980 in accordance with the terms of our agreement with the Commission of the European Communities. Employer and industry organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have agreed under the provisions of the national understanding to finance a new temporary scheme of assistance for <Col N="1545" /> firms in place of the employment maintenance scheme.  The new scheme&mdash;the employers' temporary subvention&mdash;will operate from April until the end of December.  Under the terms of the scheme a subsidy payment of £5 per week will be made to firms for a period not exceeding 26 weeks and a payment of £4 per person for the following 13 weeks.  The scheme is being operated by a steering committee of employer and congress representatives, and the Department of Labour are acting as agent for the committee.  Firms employing more than 100 persons must submit development plans as a condition of qualifying for the full benefits of the scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will make a statement on the recent instruction to the colleges of education to increase student fees, and the percentage of students in such colleges currently in receipt of some form of grant assistance, with similar figures for 1979.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees for students in the colleges of education will be £390 in 1980-81 as compared with £300 in the current academic year.  This fee covers not alone tuition but also board and accommodation.</P>
      <P>In the present school year 1979-80 approximately 45 per cent of the students in the colleges are in receipt of grants.  The percentage in the school year 1978-79 was also about 45 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the £90 increase is a harsh additional burden for students in these colleges to bear and that the need to bring <Col N="1557" /> students into these colleges especially from the less privileged sectors of our society to teach children who may be equally disadvantaged should indicate special treatment in relation to their fee structure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The value for money obtained by the students in the training colleges is second to none not merely in this country but in Europe.  Apart from the 45 per cent who are in enjoyment of third-level grants there is a loan scheme available to students, unlike those in other institutions, of which they may avail.  There is no hardship or exclusion of anybody on grounds of means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The training course involves of necessity practice teaching in the class room.  It is well known that we have a very sound basic qualification for secondary teachers.  What improvements are to be made are, in the first instance, a matter for the various education departments in our universities that are providing the training for students.  I know from experience that in those <Col N="1561" /> departments there are men of high competence. I am sure if there is any weakness in the training system itself or in the practice in the schools they will take steps to improve the situation.</P>

      <Col N="1570" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we reported progress I had mentioned that I was disappointed with Deputy Collins's analysis of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and felt that he relied for too much on the circulars sent to Members of the House with regard to the Bill.  The point I was making was that there seemed to be a very serious lack of logic in Deputy Collins's argument. He claimed that if there were a fairly strong degree of State control with regard to third-level institutions the education provided by, and the graduates of, that institution would necessarily suffer in quality and standard. I was also making the point that this was not so and that, in certain European institutions, the degree of control was beyond anything envisaged in our society and yet the standard of graduates and the input they made into the economic life of the country was very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the secretary of my Department I had the privilege of visiting Eindhoven technological university in Holland some time ago.  Not merely did I find one stratum of control there but there were two, one representing the Queen of the Netherlands and the other representing the Department of Education.  It is generally agreed that the standard of achievement in that university is of a very high order.  One of the points that became very obvious was that the old problem in Ireland of being anxious to be finished quickly with and to be qualified from third-level&mdash;and second-level&mdash;education was not something the Dutch people agreed with.  The average period spent in that technological university before graduation was six-and-a-half years, although the scheduled period was five years, and those students <Col N="1571" /> started university much later than our students come to university or to our technological institutes.</P>
    <P>Many points made by Deputy Collins, as were observed by the Chair, were matters for the Committee Stage.  As I said in my opening speech, I will deal with those minutiae and with the representation in the Seanad and in the Assembly of the European Communities on Committee Stage.  I think I heard, if not a note of approval, a grunt of approval from somebody on the Opposition side.</P>
    <P>One point I thought Deputy Collins might have developed more because of his experience in the administration of a regional technical college was the linkage between the RTCs and the NIHE, Limerick&mdash;the same will apply to the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, which we are getting under way this year.  Some people who wrote to us about the Bill had vested interests in certain angles, but I have to look at the matter from the national point of view, although individual rights, claims and expectations have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The question of the National Council for Educational Awards, of which Deputy Collins made a great deal, was one I thought had been sufficiently debated and the air had been cleared.  I want to put on the record that it is my clear and unequivocal determination that the NCEA will be the awarding body at certificate, diploma and particularly degree-awarding levels for the NIHEs.  It is important the House should have a clear statement on that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general tone of the Deputy's contribution and his fears of interference from my Department, I would like to make the point I made at the initiation ceremony at the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin. We are a small country of limited resources.  We are a little late in the field of technological education, although the colleges in Dublin, the RTCs since they were established, and NIHE are making up ground fast.  We should keep an eye <Col N="1572" /> on what happened elsewhere and learn from the mistakes of others.</P>
    <P>At Ballymun I referred to the dangers of academic drift, of institutions moving away from the primary objectives for which they were established.  I repeat that this is a luxury we cannot afford, that the regional technical colleges and the NIHEs are firmly grounded in the technological and business areas, and consequently we look at them as having that field to themselves, not exclusively of course, and that any drift away from that will not necessarily be for the benefit of education in Ireland or the institutions themselves.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Horgan agrees with the decision of the Fianna Fáil Government at the time not to bow to pressure, which was high and for the very best reasons, in regard to the Limerick university project.  The decision was a far-seeing one.  As I said in my opening remarks, the decision to have an institute for the development of technological education has been more than validated by the passage of time and from experience of the performance of those who have graduated from the institute in its short history.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that Deputy Horgan is pleased with the co-operative education programme.  McGee in the North has made great progress, even though the area was snubbed in not getting the second university.  There they have made great progress particularly in the adult education field.  They have the advantage of having the great Philips factory nearby and there is a strong link with that and other factories.</P>
    <P>The importance of vertical mobility is something I will come back to again and again.  We have a wide spread of regional technical colleges and the intention to have an even wider spread, and it is important that the road should be open to students to go into the national institutes and progress to degree and post-graduate studies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan gave considerable thought, at the usual deep level he gives to these things, to the question of autonomy.  The function and role I see <Col N="1573" /> for the institutes in Limerick and Dublin are motivated not by any ideas of pseudo freedom.  They must not be allowed to divert to a role for which they were not originally intended.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for the interest they have taken in the Bill.  I look forward to the Committee Stage being taken at an early date.  I know from experience in putting the National Council for Educational Awards Bill through the House that Members will have a contribution to make.  Their points and suggestions <Col N="1574" /> in this debate have been listened to and if necessary they will be incorporated by way of amendments.  I myself have a number of matters to be added and I will be relying on the House to support me in them.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil arís leis na Teachtaí a labhair.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few brief words on this Bill and I will not detain the House and the Minister very long. Although it might appear that this Bill is primarily or even exclusively of concern to people who might identify more closely with the agricultural sector than with an urban area, there are dimensions of it which give national concern.  As our spokesman, Deputy Bruton, has already pointed out, possibly the Bill is necessary in order to give certain protection for people involved in research and development in that area, but obviously a word of caution needs to be brought into the debate in order to ensure that any tendency towards monopoly of exclusiveness with regard to proprietorial rights of ownership of genetic diversity in seeds would be guarded against.  The experience of Third World countries in this regard or with regard to the exploitation which some of them have suffered from multi-national conglomerates who have abused the privileges which this type of legislation has allowed them <Col N="1576" /> to avail of should teach us to be very wary about legislation which is fundamentally restrictive or which would tend to curb rights to the freest possible access to the freest possible standards of enterprise or basic independence.</P>
      <P>Therefore, this Bill has to be dealt with very gently from this point of view and with a certain amount of concern. Accordingly, an attempt must be made to underline that concern in the Bill, perhaps necessarily by way of amendment. This type of legislation under some circumstances can give undue power of an unnecessarily restrictive nature to organisations and interests whose concerns may be far removed from the concern which is at the heart of the Minister's Bill.  We have access now to new insights and new experiences arising from the heightened focus of attention which Third World countries are experiencing at present and which show that many of the apparent improvements and innovations of a technological or developmental nature, often imposed from outside and often without regard to local culture or local agricultural&mdash;or even in some cases demographic&mdash; implications, can be more damaging than good.  Accordingly, we must understand that this is not just simple technical legislation.  It could under some circumstances be argued to embody a basic principle, that of the right of people to develop, to research, to experiment and to own the seeds of the earth which, after all, are the heritage of every man and woman regardless of nationality or colour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that this House would act sensibly to ensure that these concerns would find expression in amendments if necessary which would ensure that the kind of excesses and exploitation that we are talking about would not occur.  The Minister knows that some voices have been raised in opposition to a principle.  They are timely in the sense that they alert us to the kind of abuses to which this sort of legislation could lead. People who spend years in this area of research are entitled to certain protection and guarantees, but we can <Col N="1577" /> endeavour to insist that these minimum safeguards which are seen to be necessary should never become a source of manipulation by perhaps much greater conglomerate interests than the kind of individual whose concern is at the heart of this Bill would suggest.  If, for example, a situation were to be potentially possible where a virtual monopoly with regard to genetic diversity in seeds or specific of variety of seeds would allow a pricing structure to be dictated by individual companies or by a small cartel of companies, clearly it would be much to the detriment of not just the Irish grower, developer, farmer and citizen but to the interest of the whole nation.</P>
    <P>These safeguards are not yet insinuated into the Bill as fully as some of us would like.  Apart from the basic question of ensuring safeguards, there are other perhaps subordinate but, nevertheless, important elements to which it is appropriate to draw attention and I would be grateful if the Minister would refer to them in his concluding remarks.  For example, what are the administrative costs of the Bill and who is to pay them?  Is it those who would benefit from such an innovation who would be expected to contribute?  Could these administrative costs in some cases be unhelpful to the growers whom evidently the Minister is endeavouring to protect?  Would there be specific evaluation of individual cases which would allow for flexibility in relation to the administrative costs?</P>
    <P>Also, it is important that we ensure that in our endeavour to protect the domestic situation we do not precipitate a situation which would encourage the royalties from such seeds to flow out of the country or into the coffers of large companies.  It is not that we have anything in principle against large companies, but the kind of moneys to be made from intense experimentation and development in this area and their application and assignation are matters of concern, and we should be able to give reasonable estimates of the outcome of the benefits accruing from this legislation in the course of the discussion we <Col N="1578" /> are having here on the Bill.  I understand that the Minister has not yet taken the opportunity to advert to these matters of finance which it would be appropriate to consider.  Obviously, it would be less than appropriate if this House was to spend undue time in considering legislation which might do little more than give a substantial bounty or bonus to the coffers of multi-national companies far removed from these shores. These aspects of the Bill are important.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is talking in financial terms, perhaps he might also mention if any fee which is charged in the context of this Bill will be index linked or keep pace with inflation in some other way as an analagous fee structure in the Patents Office.  This does not appear to have been done.</P>
    <P>I wish to endorse the views of our spokesman, Deputy Bruton, in this area who put our party view on the record.  I simply rose to express concern that this type of legislation in some circumstances could become a weapon of exploitation rather than the enlightened law reform measure which I know the Minister wishes to have.  The experience of some Third World countries clearly indicates that we have something to learn in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister might do us the courtesy of commenting on the couple of points I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed to this very useful and informative debate.  I am very pleased to note that there is general agreement with the objective of the Bill which, when enacted, will put our plant breeders on equal footing with their counterparts in other UPOV countries.  Agriculture is much too important to us to allow any of the services to the industry to be disadvantaged <i>vis-á-vis</i> our competitors.  For too long our plant breeders have not been able to enjoy the advantages afforded by this kind of legislation.  When this Bill is enacted it will provide reasonable protection for their rights in respect of any new plants they may create while at the same time require them to maintain <Col N="1579" /> certain standards as regards quality and so forth.</P>
      <P>With regard to the urgency for this Bill, this stems from the necessity to safeguard our new plants and to secure our use of foreign varieties.  I propose to reply to a number of the points made during the course of this debate.  As regards beneficiaries of the legislation, this Bill will benefit farmers, breeders and the country generally through the availability of improved varieties, protections of Irish-bred varieties and through better access to foreign-bred varieties.  At the moment we have access to foreign-bred varieties because we have been attending UPOV meetings and were considering joining.  If we ever have to withdraw we are satisfied that it would be very unlikely we would continue to be accommodated in this way. We have already experienced some difficulty, in fact, in the potato sector.</P>
      <P>With regard to external association up to the present time we have, in effect, been operating on this basis but for the reasons already given are satisfied that we must now join UPOV.  There are no provisions for derogating in part from the UPOV Convention and still becoming a member state.  Up to the present we have, in effect, been operating on this basis but for reasons already mentioned we are satisfied that we must now join UPOV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compulsory licences were mentioned by some of the speakers during the course of the debate.  The experience in the other UPOV countries has been that the existence of this provision has acted as a deterrent.  Under this provision the controller can issue a compulsory licence and attach any conditions he thinks suitable and if any complaint is received that a breeder charges excessive prices or in any way imposed unrealistic or restrictive conditions and this is sustained, a compulsory licence may be granted.  In the United Kingdom only one compulsory licence had been granted in 16 years.  The experience in relation to patents has been similar. Only a handful of applications for compulsory <Col N="1580" /> licences have been received. There is no known evidence in Ireland or elsewhere that either complexity, difficulty or proof has deterred people from applying.</P>
    <P>I understand the worry of Deputies Bruton and Bermingham about the rights given to breeders.  I would also worry if I saw them as a monopoly but I am satisfied that the compulsory licensing provisions can be operated to counter this effectively.  By joining UPOV we would with other member states have a voice in monitoring developments and evaluating the position in the light of our own and other members' experience.</P>
    <P>With regard to the exclusive right to use the variety, while there must be reasonable organisation of the marketing outlets to ensure the breeders' royalties, there must also be close organisation to enable the breeder to control these so that he in turn can meet his obligations of maintaining the reproductive material up to the standard on the basis on which he got his rights.  The exclusive rights are for 15 years.  This is the minimum period allowed under the UPOV Convention. This also is reasonable because often it takes up to five years from the time rights are granted for a variety to take off commercially and the financial returns in the early years can be poor.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision in the Bill for fixing a maximum period and this will be by regulation under section 4 (10).  The basic UPOV idea includes plant breeders' rights for hybrids and these are provided for in other UPOV countries.  I consider this reasonable, because a breeder may have gone to considerable trouble and expense to develop a hybrid and he is deserving of equal treatment with his counterpart who develops a new plant.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the protection of the rights of the breeders of the parents of the hybrids.  However in many cases it is probably unlikely that the breeder of the hybrid will seek rights.  This has been the experience in countries where this kind of legislation already exists.  There are dangers in concentrating on highest <Col N="1581" /> yielding varieties.  While I am unclear about the connection between this and plant breeders' rights, I am satisfied we have nothing to fear from availing of the high yielding varieties being created.  If we were not to avail of them, we would soon find that Irish farmers' yields were way below those of their competitors.  If we are to remain competitive we have no choice but to use the best seed available. Before a variety may be sold as seed here, it must have been cleared under a national seed certification scheme and must satisfy EEC standards.</P>
    <P>As regards a reduction in the number of plant varieties, there is no direct connection between the number of plant varieties extant and the existence of plant breeders' rights.  It is a fact that member states have been moving progressively towards an EEC common catalogue for plants and that many synonyms used to denote plants are being dropped.  As many as 20 of these have been used at some time for some plants. This was most confusing for the purchaser.  These are now registered under the one name.  The number of distinct varieties dropped from the catalogue has been insignificant and, indeed, many new ones have been added. In 1972, we in Ireland had two varieties of barely in use.  We now have 19 available and registered in the national catalogue as suitable for this country. The number of varieties of spring wheat has also increased substantially over the same period.</P>
    <P>The possibility of a foreign takeover because of plant breeders' rights and maintenance of public funding was also mentioned.  This legislation will attract foreign plant breeders to Ireland, because they can be satisfied that the right to new varieties they might create will be protected under this legislation. We would be very pleased to see more plant breeding done here, particularly by Irish interests.  We would not or could not exclude foreign plant breeders.  In introducing this legislation it is not the intention to reduce the level of Exchequer assistance for plant breeding.</P>
    <P>Fees obtained by the controller were <Col N="1582" /> mentioned by Deputy Keating.  In the early years the controller's office received application and examination fees only and was unlikely to be self-supporting at that stage.  Later it collected fees and renewal fees.  The intention is that, in time, it will be self-supporting in its day to day operations.</P>

      <P>I am not sure.  The contribution to UPOV, I suppose, and buildings and fixed assets.  At present royalties are received on some Irish-bred varieties which are registered in the United Kingdom.  Royalties are paid on imported protected varieties, which constitute a large proportion of our seed imports. With regard to the possibility of a rise in the price of seeds because of plant breeders' rights, it could be argued that the existence of plant breeders' rights in other countries has meant that because of royalties there have been consequential increases in the price of seed.  We have had to pay these, even though we had no plant breeders' rights system. The proposed legislation will not affect the royalties situation.  Most seed imported into Ireland is covered by plant breeders' rights, and a significant amount is payable in royalties by Irish farmers each year.  This legislation will mean that Irish plant breeders will enjoy the same facilities as their counterparts in other countries, including the right to charge royalties and security in their right to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of wild plants, if a person applies for and is subsequently granted plant breeders' rights in respect of a wild plant, all this means is that the person has rights in respect of its commercial propagation.  It does not mean others can no longer enjoy it.  Indeed, they can continue to take samples with a view to propagating it.  The only thing <Col N="1583" /> they cannot do is to propagate it commercially. To apply for plant breeders' rights, a person would have to be in a position to submit a quantity of the reproductive material, anything from one to eight kilos depending on the species.  If rights were granted in respect of a wild plant, propagating material previously unavailable would be on sale to the public.  The initiative of the person granted the rights would be rewarded, but that person could not simply pick up a wild plant and send it to the controller with a view to obtaining plant breeders' rights.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of staff tied up in testing, the work arising following an application for plant breeders' rights should not create problems.  We would always have the option of doing the testing ourselves, or having it done by arrangement with another UPOV country at a fee to be recouped from the applicant.  This could hold either for initial tests or tests already in existence.  In the latter case, it is likely that we would purchase the test report.  A decision as to whether we should do the tests ourselves would depend on the circumstances in each case.  We would be influenced by such things as the variety, whether it was being registered for the first time, or whether it was already widely in use here, in which case it is likely that we would buy the test result.</P>
    <P>The UPOV Convention provides that contracts may be concluded between members with a view eventually to having members specialise in the testing of particular varieties.  This would dispense with the need for members to assemble the full range of necessary reference collections, and so on.</P>
    <P>On the question of the manipulation of Third World countries by nationals and the FAO position, the suggestion that multi-nationals involved in plant breeding might abuse their position in an attempt to create a market for their other produce, that is, pesticides, does not hold water.  Plant varieties come under critical examination by public authorities for resistance to disease, <Col N="1584" /> pests, and so on, before they are approved for marketing.  The improvement of plant varieties has played, and is continuing to play, a very important part in providing food resources in the Third World.</P>

      <P>The FAO have not expressed any opposition to the concept of plant breeders' rights.  I understand that an individual employed by the FAO has expressed opposition to the concept on a personal basis.  Indeed, it is only natural that this would happen.  An attempt has been made recently, in the press and elsewhere, to discredit the internationally accepted system of plant breeders' rights.  A number of grossly inaccurate statements have been made, such as that the system is against the best interests of the Third World, that it is a factor in the decline of world genetic resources and that it is being promoted by multinational companies to increase their sales of agro-chemicals.  None of these contentions stands up to critical examination. <Col N="1585" /> We can look at the experience in Britain where legislation like this was introduced in 1964.  Third World countries have been able to avail of many of the advances in plant breeding and the existence of plant breeders' rights has been a major factor in providing an incentive to breeders to improve plant quality, with the consequent dramatic increase in food resources in many less developed countries.  No link has been established between the existence of plant breeders' rights and a decline in genetic resources. While a number of multinational companies are involved in plant breeding, much of this work is still undertaken by Government or semi-Government bodies.</P>
      <P>The fact that a dealer is accorded rights under this system simply means that if the new variety of plant is successful he is assured of a fair return for the work he puts into breeding that variety. At the same time the breeder is required to ensure that the standard of future supplies of the reproductive material is maintained.  There is no obligation on any person to purchase a variety for which rights have been granted and the granting of rights to a new variety does not force any existing variety off the market.  Existing material will continue to be demanded in so far as it meets the needs of the purchaser.  Many of the old varieties we hear about as being lost are not separate varieties but simply synonymous.</P>
      <P>These remarks cover most of the points raised during the debate.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that compulsory licensing has not been availed of in Britain or in many of the countries where it has been inserted in legislation as an alleged safeguard against abuse.  He thought there was no evidence that this was because of the complexity of the provisions for applying for a compulsory licence.  Would the Minister investigate more fully between now and Committee Stage the exact reasons that this facility has not been used?  We should know this so that we can reach a mature decision as to <Col N="1586" /> whether the provisions of the Bill are sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can do that.  It is a very important safeguard in the Bill that if a breeder is abusing his rights or charging excessive prices the controller has the option of issuing a compulsory licence.  Since the legislation was introduced in Britain 16 years ago only one compulsory licence has been issued. I will try to ascertain if there are any specific reasons why more compulsory licences have not been issued.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Superannuation) (No. 2) Bill, 1979 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide that the superannuation conditions of employees of local authorities and certain other local bodies will be regulated by superannuation schemes.  At present these superannuation conditions are set out in enactments, principally the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, with the result that any changes in superannuation conditions can only be effected by way of amending legislation. This means that improvements in pension conditions, which have been agreed with staff interests and may be needed to avoid hardship, must be postponed until the legislative process is completed unless, as an alternative, local authorities are authorised by the Government to introduce the improvements in anticipation of amending legislation.  The latter alternative has been followed under successive Governments but I think the time has come to put matters on a more secure basis.  The present Bill will enable changes in the conditions to be dealt with in future by statutory schemes supplemented where necessary by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> The change to the system of superannuation schemes was recommended by a working party representative of employer and employee interests set up by the then Minister for Local Government in June 1976 to carry out a general review of the superannuation arrangements applicable to local authority employees.  The working party furnished their recommendation in an interim report in June 1977 in which they also recommended a number of significant improvements in superannuation conditions which were accepted by the then Minister and were subsequently implemented by the incoming Government. As the House is aware, procedures for the setting out of superannuation terms in statutory schemes rather than in legislation are already in operation in the public service generally, including the Army and Garda Síochána, and in the case of the secondary and national teacher and it is also being applied in the case of civil servants by way of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976.  The Bill, therefore, is essentially an enabling measure in line with the recommendations of the working party under which the more flexible approach to the administration of superannuation benefits already in operation in the civil service can be extended to local authority employees.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the most important section in the Bill and will enable the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to make schemes setting out the rules governing superannuation conditions. It will also enable the making of amending schemes.  Thus, it will not be necessary to go through the elaborate procedure of legislation every time it is found necessary to introduce changes or improvements in the superannuation code, although under a later provision, in section 5, every scheme must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House.  Initially, schemes, together with regulations made under section 3, will provide retrospective authority for improvements already introduced.  The <Col N="1588" /> ultimate aim is to have a comprehensive or consolidated scheme or schemes containing all the pension terms relating to local authority employees and on the making of such consolidated scheme or schemes the existing superannuation enactments will be repealed under section 11 of the Bill.  As and from that time, future changes found necessary in the superannuation code will be effected by amending schemes.</P>
    <P>It will obviously not be possible to move immediately from a situation where all pension conditions are governed in detail by statutes to one where all will be regulated by schemes. A transitional period will be necessary during which the necessary changes will be made.  During this period conditions will be regulated partly by statutes and partly by schemes.  To facilitate these transitional arrangements, section 3 will enable the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to make regulations to amend or repeal the enactments which are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill or any statutory instrument made thereunder.  These regulations may be made only in the period between the passing of the Bill and the repeal of the existing enactments which will be effected when section 11 is brought into operation. In other words, they may only be made in the interval before the consolidated scheme is made and are, in effect, a transitional device to provide retrospective authority for improvements already introduced and facilitate the making of the initial schemes in the interim period before the repeal of the existing enactments.  Under subsection (3) there is provision for the making of regulations extending the list of enactments contained in the First Schedule to the Bill if this should prove necessary. This provision is essentially precautionary but since it would involve an extension of the scope of the First Schedule, subsection (5) provides that regulations effecting such an extension must first be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in draft from and would require the positive approval of each House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Under subsection (9) of section 2, the present position whereby the local authority superannuation code also applies to employees of health boards is being continued.  In the subsection there is also a provision under which other health bodies administering public health services may be brought within the scope of the Bill if they are so designated by the Minister for Health with the consent of the Minister for the Environment. In addition, sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill provide for the continuance of the position whereby the local authority superannuation code may be applied, with or without modifications, to the employees of certain other statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, superannuation awards are made in respect of pensionable service.  However, under section 4, regulations may provide for the granting of retirement gratuities in respect of non-pensionable service in appropriate cases.  Section 6 provides for the saving of pension rights under existing legislation.  Taken in conjunction with subsection (4) of section 5, it provides that where changes are being made in superannuation conditions, an employee other than a newly appointed employee will have the right to exercise an option to come under such new superannuation conditions or, alternatively, to decide to remain subject to his existing conditions if he deems these to be more favourable in the circumstances of his particular case.  Section 12 includes provisions relating to the commencement of certain sections with retrospective effect.  This is necessary in order to ensure that retrospective effect can be given to the improvements in superannuation conditions already referred to.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> As the Minister of State has told us the purpose of this Bill is to provide that superannuation conditions of employees of local authorities and certain other local bodies will be regulated by superannuation schemes.  I emphasise &ldquo;will be regulated by superannuation <Col N="1590" /> schemes.&rdquo;  Now, if that were exactly what the Bill proposes to do, and to do it in future, it has a lot to commend it. However, having regard to our system of parliamentary democracy and having regard to the necessity for all payments of public moneys to be made with statutory authority, or with the authority of this House, the Bill is an alarming one.  It is a Bill which would shock any parliamentarian.</P>
      <P>For example, it is stated, in section 12 of the Bill, that sections 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10 of the Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on such day or days prior to the passing of this Act as may be fixed therefor by order of the Minister.  It would have been quite possible for the Minister to have written into that section the date on which these various sections would come into operation but I am not surprised that he did not do so.  I believe that, in fact, these sections will be deemed to have come into operation several years ago.</P>
      <P>Let us have a quick look at what is involved in sections 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10 which will be deemed to have come into operation on some day prior to the passing of the Act, as the Minister may decide.  I repeat that some of them will be deemed to have come into operation several years ago.  Section 2 confers power for the making of superannuation schemes, that is, schemes to grant pensions, to pay lump sums.  Section 3 confers power to amend existing superannuation schemes.  Section 4 confers power to award gratuities to non-pensionable officers.  Section 9 confers authority to amend the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act of 1971 and section 10 confers authority for the payment of expenses and for the payment of pensions and gratuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that these superannuation schemes are being operated without any statutory authority of any description, and that these pensions and gratuities have been paid&mdash;that the schemes which we are now giving authority to amend have long since been treated as having been amended.  The gratuities to non-pensionable <Col N="1591" /> officers which we are now asked to give authority for granting have long since, I am sure, been granted.  I am also sure that the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act of 1971 has been treated as having been amended some considerable time ago. Of course, the payment of expenses and of pensions for which section 10 of the Bill grants authority has long been made.  That is an alarming state of affairs. I do not doubt for one moment that what we are being asked to validate now are all admirable provisions and all payments and pensions that have been carefully negotiated between the managerial side on the one hand and the staff side on the other.  But the principle involved is shocking and the precedent which has been established is frightening as to the future.  We are establishing here a precedent whereby, without any statutory authority, just because it is inconvenient or too cumbersome to validate these by way of a general Act, these things have been done in the past without any authority from anybody. Parliament are now asked to validate them and to give legal effect to them.</P>
    <P>This Bill which we are now asked to pass, in my opinion, could be best described as a blank cheque for the future and a general absolution for the past.  Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, a scheme under this section may have retrospective effect.</P>
    <P>Certainly that would frighten an oldtime parliamentarian but when one looks at the measure it is obvious the provision is necessary to regularise the irregularities that have taken place for a number of years.  This is a well-drafted Bill for the purpose for which it was introduced. Section 12 provides that the all-important sections, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10, will come into operation at such time in the past as the Minister decides and section 11 will come into operation on such date in the future as the Minister <Col N="1592" /> decides.  Section 11 repeals all the Acts we are working under at the moment but which do not do the job which they have been used to do.  They will continue to be used until the Minister gets the other sections into operation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a classic example of how public business should not be done.  It is an invitation to public servants and to people in public life to become careless. It is an invitation to civil servants and to local authority employees to take matters for granted, to take the attitude that it is all right to do certain things because authority will be given in the future to cover them.  What is the real value of the local government audit system?  A local government auditor is charged with seeing that everything is in order with regard to payments and so on, and he will have to close his eyes to many matters as a result of the provisions in this Bill.  It is putting people on the slippery slope and I deprecate in the strongest terms what is happening.</P>
    <P>I realise that there have been dramatic changes during the years.  I know that if we do not authorise or approve certain measures people will be left without money or without pensions but surely a Bill of a temporary nature could have been introduced.  Two major measures, the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948 and the Act of 1956&mdash;neither of which was passed during a Fianna Fáil administration&mdash;were the last major measures on this matter.  Since then we have had the five-day week which created a substantial problem for local authorities because they had to count up the number of days an employee worked during the year and decide whether he had worked enough days to qualify for a pension.  In order to operate that they had to make many assumptions.  When the working week was reduced they assumed that the officer would have worked on the sixth day if it had been a six-day week even though he might not have done so.  The local authority had to make this assumption or else they could not have operated the scheme.  The schemes we are dealing with now are being operated on a hit-and-miss basis. <Col N="1593" /> When the marriage ban was lifted, another problem was created for the local authorities and they have operated on all kinds of assumptions.</P>
    <P>I am spokesman on the environment for one of the Opposition parties and it is necessary for me to state the situation as I see it.  What happened before should not recur.  As I said, how can a local government auditor audit the books of a local authority if he takes on the job with the attitude that a whole category of payments have been made without authority with somebody hoping that future legislation will cover the matter? Perhaps he reports on the matter with a reservation that what has been done is wrong but with the hope that matters will be rectified.  The whole position is wrong.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with this aspect.  The Minister has told us the Bill is the result of the efforts of a working party that had been set up before his Government took office.  The report was delivered to the Minister's predecessor in 1977, about the time the Government changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought permission to raise on the Adjournment this matter which is of serious concern for the people of Birr and the surrounding area.  The first factory concerned is operated by the firm Birr Fabrics who have been in existence for about 35 years and who had exports totalling about £1.25 million and an employment content of 84 people.  On December 21 last I was informed that notices were being sent out in the post that evening to the effect that employment was being terminated because of the closure of the factory.  I arranged for deputations to meet the Minister for Finance and his officials to talk about the situation.  Immediately we were able to meet officials of the Department and at the same time a deputation <Col N="1594" /> from Birr Chamber of Commerce met the Minister at his office in Nenagh.  In addition, a deputation from the town met the Minister of State, Deputy Burke.</P>
      <P>We did everything possible in regard to approaching Government Departments and Ministers.  In addition, we approached the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and the other State agencies concerned as well as approaching the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, but all our efforts proved futile and the factory closed.  We are told that discussions are still taking place but the fact remains that the people who had been employed at the factory remain unemployed.</P>
      <P>The situation in the town has been aggravated further in that the other main employer in the town, Erin Peat Products Ltd., a factory situated about three miles from the town and which employed 55 people, declared 19 employees redundant on 11 April and I understand that the majority, if not all of the remaining employees, have been served with protective notices.  In other words, it appears that the closure of that factory is imminent.  While the permanent staff at the factory was 55, 100 people and sometimes more were employed there on a seasonal basis.  In the case of this factory about 90 per cent of production is for export.  That, in itself, is of great benefit to the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The situation in Birr is that there are 260 people in receipt of unemployment benefit.  Therefore, in a population of 3,361, 260 are in receipt of unemployment benefit but if we include those in receipt of disability benefit and unemployment assistance, we find that more than 10 per cent of the population of the town and the surrounding area are unemployed.  This is a frightening statistic.  Perhaps it is the most alarming statistic for the entire country in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to make the Minister aware of the anxiety of all those concerned in regard to the closure of the first factory I have mentioned and of the imminent closure of the other one.  One IDA advance factory has been completed <Col N="1595" /> in the town and another has been announced.  I urge the Minister to ensure that industries are provided without delay for these two advance factories. He must ensure that every effort possible is made by his Department in conjunction with the IDA and with Fóir Teoranta to ensure that Erin Peat Products are maintained as a going and as a viable concern.  It is of the utmost importance that the factory be taken over as a going concern.  I call on the Minister to ensure also that a major effort is made to facilitate those at present negotiating, to ensure that all possible meetings take place and that every effort will be made by the Government to have this factory taken over as a going concern. This is of tremendous importance because this factory was exporting its products and was of benefit to the economy.  It is also of great importance to the people in Birr.  I hope some of the interested parties will take over Erin Peat Products as a going concern.  I am not fully satisfied with the efforts made to date.  I have been in touch with a number of Government Departments and State agencies and I am concerned that some more positive results are not evident by now.  There has been plenty of time to secure some positive result.  We must try to ensure the positive result of getting the factory taken over as a going concern.</P>
    <P>The IDA in their plan for 1978-82, as set out in their programme for the midland region, have a target of creating 550 new jobs in the west Offaly area. This includes Birr, Banagher, Ferbane and Kilcormack.  There is one empty advance factory in Birr and one being built or in planning process; there is an empty one in Banagher but none in Ferbane or Kilcormack.  I suggest to the Minister that 550 new jobs for this area will not even leave us standing still because there is a total projected job loss between Birr Fabrics and Erin Peat Products of 139 people in Birr town alone.  Already 84 have been let go in Birr Fabrics and 19 more in Erin Peat Products.  The remainder will be under notice from this <Col N="1596" /> evening that they will be let go.  Irrespective of the IDA plan we shall not even be at a standstill with that position; we shall be losing ground.  Therefore it is important that the Minister ensure that the projections for this area are enlarged because 550 jobs are not sufficient&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will fully investigate the matter.  I call on the Minister to ensure that an area which has 10 per cent of its total population unemployed be declared a designated area immediately.  If the Minister has the goodwill he has the power to do this so that higher grants will be available for industrialists coming to the area.  I urge him to take this positive step immediately. I have to say that up to now, apparently, no steps have been taken or, if they have, no results are obvious to me or to the people of Birr.  The whole social fabric of a community is at stake.  I appeal to the Minister not to allow that social fabric of the town and its surrounding area to be permanently damaged by the closing of these two factories. Ten per cent of the total population are out of work.  The figure would be even greater if you took adults alone. The only answer to the problem is for the Government to declare this a designated area so that the increased level of grants will be sufficient to attract industry to the town.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that this is outside the Minister's scope but I would ask him to make representations for an automatic telephone exchange to be provided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to treat this case seriously as a matter of grave urgency.  First, we should give every possible assistance to Birr Fabrics and to the receiver there at present to obtain an alternative industry.  Secondly, he should ensure that the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and his Department and every other Government Department that he can communicate with, will give every assistance in ensuring that Erin Peat Products are taken over as a going concern. Thirdly, I ask the Minister to ensure that Birr for the present difficult period at least be declared a designated area.</P>
      <P>I had to voice my concern this evening and call for alternative manufacturing industries to be channelled into Birr immediately to provide jobs for the unemployed there.  This is a matter of serious concern to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government and the IDA share his concern at any unemployment taking place in the Birr area.  It is always a source of worry when one hears of unemployment whether the loss is of one job or 100.  It is our duty as public representatives to do what we can to ensure full employment at home.  Deputy Enright has highlighted this evening the problems of two factories in Birr, Birr Fabrics Limited, which is closed, and Erin Peat Products which is having difficulties. Deputy Cowen and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, have also mentioned this problem and I am glad that they are taking such a keen interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that one cannot say everything in the House if one does not want to breach confidentiality. Without breaching confidentiality I would like to put the House in the picture. Since Birr Fabrics Limited decided to go into liquidation at the end of last year the IDA have been making special efforts to find an alternative project for that factory.  Through their overseas offices <Col N="1598" /> the authority have been in contact with a number of possible promotors and a number of prospective interested parties have visited the factory.  Outline projects are being prepared by some of the interested parties for this factory. People within the country are also interested in this factory.  I cannot go into the negotiations which are taking place as they are confidential but I assure the Deputy and the House that negotiations are very live at this time.  I know that negotiations can break down at the last minute but there are a good many possibilities for the establishment of the project in the vacant factory.  It is hoped that something concrete will emerge in the near future in relation to the Birr Fabrics factory.  The IDA have informed me that within a matter of weeks they hope to be able to say something in the matter.  If I dwelt further on this aspect I would breach confidentiality and I hope that Deputy Enright understands that.</P>
    <P>In relation to Erin Peat Products that firm is not in liquidation but employees there are under protective notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Nineteen were let go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime discussions on a broad scale are taking place in relation to providing employment there.  It would be unwise to say what has taken place as that prerogative belongs to the IDA.  If private companies make proposals and disclose their assets we cannot announce it from the rooftops but the Deputy can take it that no stone is being left unturned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to designating an area, the principal advantages conferred by designation as far as the promotion of new industrial development is concerned is that it empowers the IDA to offer a higher maximum grant towards the cost of assessable fixed assets.  Most projects with the exception of small industries do not in practice get the maximum percentage grant and that should be borne in mind by Deputy Enright, and everybody else who talks about looking for designation.  The capital grant is only one element in the range of <Col N="1599" /> incentives available for designation. Other facilities such as the availability of sites, suitable accommodation, infrastructural services and manpower availability and the tailoring of a packet of incentives to meet the needs of a project can be more important in securing a project for an area.  This is the type of comprehensive approach that the IDA are adopting in the case of Birr.  A decision may be made on the argument for designation but we will see how things are going.</P>
    <P>Something which appears to be overlooked is that prior approval of the EEC Commission is necessary.  We cannot rely on our own go ahead and designate an area for the higher rate of grant and Deputy Enright will appreciate that when a decision is made it will have to go through the EEC for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister strongly consider that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am worried that while all that procedure progressed, time would be passing and people would be out of work.  The IDA are confident that before we engage in that process there will be further employment in Birr. The IDA have given a lot of attention to <Col N="1600" /> Birr which has an increasing population and the first advance factory of 22,000 square feet is occupied and a second advance factory of 24,000 square feet was recently completed and is being promoted.  I do not know who will occupy that factory but the IDA are intensively promoting the second factory.  The Minister recently announced a further 7,000 square foot advance factory that is part of the 1980 programme.  The construction of that factory will probably commence in mid-summer or early autumn.  On that the County Council have got a 35-acre site which is available for industrial use.  I cannot go further than that at the moment.</P>
      <P>I looked up the figures for manufacturing employment in the town of Birr and on 1 January 1977 the manufacturing employment was 574, in 1978 it was 636, in 1979 it was 679 and on 1 January 1980 it was 669.  With a bit of luck and with the IDA working hard I hope that any losses that have taken place recently will be more than made up.</P>

In the event the board undertook the funding of a particular microelectronics project costing approximately £30,000 which was carried out under contract by the enterprise for the board.  Some 75 per cent of the fees for <Col N="1564" /> this project were paid in the year ended 31 December 1979.</P>

There is, of course, no bar on the return of Irish citizens to Ireland where they have free entry but in general no Exchequer funds exist specifically for such a purpose.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if statistics on the addresses of jury persons are retained in his Department, if so, if any assessment of the socio-economic or geographic implications of such information is carried out and if such data could be made available to give a regional insight into the selection of jury personnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of juries is provided for in the Juries Act, 1976 (No. 4 of 1976) and is carried out by the county registrars. The Act provides that each county shall be a jury district but that the Minister may by order divide a county into two or more jury districts or limit a jury district to a part or parts of a county.  The Jury Districts Order, 1976 (S.I. No. 57 of 1976), as amended by the Jury Districts Order, 1977 (S.I. No. 59 of 1977), makes provision for districts on this basis in some counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure for the selection of juries is set out in a manual dated February 1976 which, as I indicated in my reply to parliamentary Question No. 444 of 18 October 1979, is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The only records are those kept by the county registrars.  Since the system is designed expressly to ensure the random selection of jurors, an assessment of the kind mentioned could not be expected to reveal any local variations in the composition of juries other than those that must inevitably arise from such factors as the proportion of rural to town dwellers <Col N="1567" /> which can vary from jury district to jury district.</P>

      <P>Members of the judiciary are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government but it is not possible for me to say what criteria have been taken into consideration by successive Governments down the years.  An obviously relevant factor is that membership of the legal profession from which judicial appointments are made has been mainly made up of men.</P>
