    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress I was dealing with the arrangements that have been made by the Government to stave off a fodder crisis similar to that which we had in 1974 and 1975.  I was complimenting the Minister for Agriculture and the Government for the efforts they made, unlike their predecessors in 1974 and 1975 when thousands of livestock died from starvation.  Was it not a pity that the men with the superior intelligence in 1974 failed to anticipate that situation in the same way as the Minister for Agriculture and the present Government anticipated it in 1980?  That in itself has been a major contribution in assisting farmers in overcoming problems caused not by the Government but by our climate in 1980.  That scheme has been well received by the farming community and particularly by the smaller farmers who have been able to avail of a silage-making grant for the first time.  The success of that scheme will become more evident when figures are produced for the number participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme is another major step in assisting the smaller farmers in the west, in the north-west and in parts of north Leinster.  I would like, and it is not just a pious hope, to have that scheme broadened so as to cover livestock producers in the midlands and the Munster area because while the scheme is of enormous advantage to the small farmers in the west and north-west it does not have the same effect in the midlands where farm inputs tend to be more costly and farm rates very much a factor at the present time.  I ask the Minister&mdash;there is no better man to do it&mdash;to use his good offices in Brussels and elsewhere to try to devise ways and means of <Col N="1216" /> extending the scheme to include other areas.  The scheme is of tremendous advantage to those who can avail of it to the full.  It is one of the best schemes that has come on the agricultural scene for a long time.  It is clear evidence that we still have people in charge of agriculture who are capable of seizing an opportunity when it arises.</P>
    <P>The sheep subsidy scheme is another major step forward.  I am delighted that it is working so well in the west where we have such a large sheep population at present.  That scheme should be continued. Together with the outlets on the French market, I am confident that it will play a major role in stabilising the income of those engaged in sheep production. The scheme is an excellent one and anything that I could say would be inadequate in terms of doing justice to it.  Perhaps it will be found possible to extend the scheme further but in this regard we must bear in mind the constraints on the Government.  In addition, constraints are being created from day to day in Brussels. However, if it had not been for that scheme, agriculture would be in a worse position than it is.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in being able to find markets for all our agricultural produce. This situation is unlike that of 1974 and 1975 when, for instance, it was impossible for farmers to dispose of dropped calves.  We have all heard the story of the farmer at the mart at that time who, on returning to his trailer in which he had left a dropped calf that he was trying to sell, found another calf had been left in the trailer.  That is an indication of how bad the situation was then.  The improvements that have been brought about are the result of the corrective measures taken by this Government.  That is why the Minister should be given every cooperation in his efforts to improve the lot of the farming community.</P>
    <P>We have many critics but there are very few who are able to put forward an alternative and workable solution.  I was saddened to note recently that even farm leaders were unable to put forward any effective policy on their part which would lead towards an improvement in our agricultural scene.  Their contribution <Col N="1217" /> was by way of asking for greater subventions from the State.  I was one of those people who was convinced that our accession to the EEC would bring about a situation in which farmers would be able to operate both economically and profitably without the help of State subventions. Unfortunately, due to the hardening of attitudes on the part of consumers throughout Europe, it has been necessary to revert once again to the subvention system.</P>
    <P>This year I have had the opportunity of visiting some other countries and during those visits I made special efforts to explore the farming scene.  My most recent visit was to Greece and from what I found there I am convinced that that country will not be a serious competitor with us in our efforts to sell our produce on the European market.  Instead, I expect Greece to become a customer of ours.  Recently the Greek Minister for Agriculture, together with our Minister, signed an agreement creating another outlet for Irish dairy produce.  In this connection I should like to pay tribute to Bord Bainne for the efforts they have made down through the years in marketing our dairy produce.  The dairying industry has made a major contribution to our economy but had it not been for the establishment of Bord Bainne in the first instance, we would not have found it possible to achieve the success that has been achieved in this area.  The board have explored markets throughout the world and they must be encouraged to continue to do so because we have an enormous capacity in the area of dairy produce and this produce is easier to dispose of than is beef, for instance, because milk is capable of being converted into milk powder and other products. It can be disposed of in countries in which it would not be possible for us to dispose of beef.  The board must be given every encouragement to explore every market throughout the world.  Dairying is an industry that is capable of quick expansion and at a time when there is retraction all over Europe it is encouraging for our farmers to know that there is a demand for their produce.  Many of our co-operative creameries are urging <Col N="1218" /> farmers to increase their output and they are being encouraged in this regard by increased prices.  I urge all dairy farmers to respond to this request.  In this way they will increase their incomes to an extent that would not be possible otherwise.</P>
    <P>On the question of the marketing of our beef and beef products, a more dynamic marketing board is required.  I should like to see a situation in which all our beef exports would be in packet form, whether vac-packed or packed through the refrigerated system.  Markets should be properly organised so that farmers would be aware a year in advance of the numbers of livestock that they could safely produce in the following year in terms of marketing.  If farmers knew in advance the potential of each market, not only throughout Europe but throughout the world, they could plan accordingly. We are lucky in having intervention to fall back on but that is not the answer to the problem of surpluses in Europe. Properly organised marketing would represent a major step forward and would be of enormous benefit to the farmers who produce the raw materials.  In this context the meat marketing board must step up their activities and explore the markets further.  There is great potential in Germany in particular for Irish beef which is very much in demand there.  The German consumers are pleased with this product but if the beef could be shipped direct to the German supermarkets and the other outlets, there would be the twofold benefit of our getting the maximum price for the product while the German consumer would be availing of a very fresh product.  This is the sort of marketing programme that we must embark on if we are to meet the challenge of the future and if we are to ensure a future for our farmers.  Just as Bord Bainne have assured a future for our dairying industry, the meat marketing people must ensure a future for the beef producers.  I know that the Minister and the Government are concerned about this whole area and that they are anxious to streamline our marketing system so that our farmers may look forward to the future in the knowledge that there will be a market for <Col N="1219" /> their produce and that that produce can be disposed of at an economic price</P>
    <P>Mention of prices brings me to the question of the more intensive areas of marketing.  There is a hardening of attitude on the part of housewives in Europe towards paying higher prices for beef and beef products.  That is a serious situation so far as the farming community is concerned because farm inputs have increased enormously during the years. Therefore, it is essential that greater emphasis be put on farm efficiency and in this connection the role of ACOT is becoming more significant.  Farmers need expert advice if they are to become more efficient.  Farm incomes will be improved only if there is more intensive production. I think an increase will be granted to agriculture when the Brussels package is hammered out this year.  We do not know the extent of the increase but we realise it may not be adequate to compensate Irish farmers for the high cost of inputs.  I have no doubt that this matter is receiving the close attention of the Minister, of the new agricultural bodies and of all of those people who are interested in improving the lot of our farmers.</P>
    <P>If the farm organisations want to play their full role in improving the lot of their members they should face up to realities. They should get down to negotiations and try to hammer out the best deal.  It is no use saying to the Government it is their problem.  The farm organisations must be realistic.  I am a member of such an organisation and I want to say to them that they have an opportunity now to show courage and leadership.  The best way they can do that is to maintain the lines of communication between the Government, the Department of Agriculture and the various European bodies concerned.  There is no use in shouting, in campaigning or in marching.  That will achieve nothing.  The Government are aware of the problems facing agriculture. They are sensitive to the needs of Irish farmers.  There is no doubt that agriculture is our greatest single industry.  If it thrives thousands of additional jobs can be created.  The welfare of agriculture should be the concern of every section of <Col N="1220" /> society. In the past there has been far too much farmer bashing by the trade union movement which is well organised.  There is little evidence that they have a clear understanding of the enormous problems faced by people engaged in agriculture. Now is the time to show responsibility. Now is the time to demonstrate leadership. Now is the time for action.  Everyone concerned with agriculture must work together to get the best deal possible for Irish farmers in order to guarantee them and their successors a future on the land.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we still have a serious problem, namely, the continued incidence of brucellosis and TB in our livestock herds and this has greatly hampered the progress of agriculture.  For almost 20 years farmers have been battling with these diseases and they have cost the Irish taxpayers millions of pounds.  The end is not yet in sight.  Everyone concerned with the welfare of our national herd should leave no stone unturned to guarantee an end to those diseases.  They have wiped out many farms.  I know from my own experience of cases where farmers have had clear herds but unfortunately when they bought in additional breeding stock the disease returned.  The greatest loser in such a situation is not the taxpayer but the farmer because he is deprived of an income and is not able to borrow money. In many cases the banks or lending institutions have put pressure on the individual farmer to make the repayments and sometimes the lands were put on the market by the lending institutions.  That disastrous situation should not be tolerated in the case of disease eradication because the farmer has no control over such matters. He is the loser in such a situation and, therefore, he is very conscious of the need for complete disease eradication.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the Government are intent on eradicating those diseases as quickly as possible.  The farmers who suffer grave losses in such cases need more sympathetic compensation arrangements than exist at the moment.  It takes them years to get back into business.  A form of low interest loans should be made available without any strings attached.  I <Col N="1221" /> am satisfied this matter is receiveing serious thought from the Government and possibly in the near future there will be a scheme that will go a long way towards solving the needs of the farmers who are in financial difficulties at the moment. There are thousands of farmers in such a situation.  They availed of the money that was literally thrown at them between 1976 and 1978 by the lending institutions. Those institutions have decided now to call in the loans but the farmers are not in a position to pay them.  As a result there is a crisis in agriculture.  I appeal to those lending institutions to adopt the same lines as similar institutions have done in other countries and give the farmers a moratorium.  They will have them in the end.  They are good customers of all the banks and lending institutions and their successors will continue to deal with them.  The banks and lending institutions should look upon them as their best customers and try to deal with them accordingly.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for all of us engaged in agriculture to show courage.  It is the time for farm leaders to give leadership and tell the Irish people what can be done. There is little use in complaining about a situation unless one can come up with a solution.  Thousands are writing in agricultural journals and newspapers about the problems of agriculture.  They are campaigning against the Government but they are unable, or incapable, of putting forward an alternative to help solve the serious situation in the farming industry. Those people should direct their attention to that because we must get together to ensure that our greatest industry continues to thrive in the years ahead</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cúpla focal a rá ar an Meastachán Forlíontach seo.  Os rud é go bhfuil trioblóidí agus deacrachtaí ag feirmeoiri na hÉireann agus ins an tionscal talmhaíochta faoi láthair, tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an Meastachán Forlíontach seo.  Tá imní mór ormsa tar éis ráiteas an Aire maidir leis an package seo, agus caithfidh mé a rá, ar an gcéad <Col N="1222" /> dul síos, go bhfuil sé soiléir ón ráiteas seo nach dtuigeann an Rialtas agus nach dtuigeann an tAire Talmhaíochta an staid uafásach ina bhfuil an tionscal talmhaíochta faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Looked at against the background of the very severe and serious economic and social problems that confront the Irish agricultural industry at present the Minister's speech, and the package of measures which the Supplementary Estimate is designed to finance, clearly reflects an appalling lack of understanding and appreciation on the part of the Minister and the Government of the extent, significance and frightening national implications of the serious agricultural crisis. This Supplementary Estimate, and the so-called rescue package, displays an incomprehensible lack of understanding by the Government.  The Minister, in his speech, referred to the fact that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and himself had several discussions during the year with the main farming organisations. He stated that in recent months the Government had taken a number of measures to help farmers overcome their difficulties. It is hard to understand the response of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture to the crisis that now confronts the agricultural sector.  Surely the Minister for Agriculture, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance must have been made fully aware in the course of their various meetings with the farming organisations of the fact that we are faced with an agricultural crisis of a gravity and a magnitude unprecedented in the past half century.  If the Minister and the Government understood the situation correctly&mdash;I have no reason to doubt but that the leaders of the farming organisations presented their case clearly, unambiguously and emphatically to the Government&mdash;it is difficult to understand the puny and, as has been described by some Members, Mickey Mouse response by the Government to a case put so effectively by representatives of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is grave disappointment throughout the country at the weak response by the Government to this serious matter.  The result now is&mdash;it is an inevitable and unfortunate one&mdash;that <Col N="1223" /> after months of painstaking, reasoned and patient presentation of their case to the Government and the various Ministers, farmers are now taking to the streets to present their case to the people of Ireland.  I do not understand the attitude of the Minister.  I should like to ask him a question which I hope he will reply to at the conclusion of the debate: does he, and his Ministers of State, seriously think that the package of measures outlined in the Supplementary Estimate are adequate to meet the crisis in the agricultural industry?  I challenge the Minister to answer that fair question.  If the Minister answers in the affirmative and states that this package is adequate to tackle the crisis I will have to tell him that he is living in cloud cuckoo land and he does not have any appreciation of the extent or the magnitude of the social and economic implications that will result from this crisis.</P>
    <P>Statistics have been put forward in the course of this debate and I do not intend to repeat them.  Suffice it to say that no section of the economy can survive or tolerate indefinitely a situation where the primary producers have to suffer a reduction in income or up to 50 per cent over the last couple of years.  I gave figures recently in relation to the decline in farmers' incomes and the average family income of farmers.  I am convinced that we are facing a serious situation in relation to this industry.  If this is not tackled realistically and in a proper manner we will see repercussions that will last for many years.  Farmers, as a result of a continuous fall in their income and as a result of rising costs and declining prices for their produce, are now faced with severe financial difficulties.  It is a well known fact in Munster that farmers are selling breeding stock in order to meet current debts and liabilities.  In the light of the fact that the dairy industry is the foundation of our agricultural economy the repercussions from such wholesale slaughtering of our breeding stock will be felt not merely in the agricultural sector but, directly and indirectly, in many other facets of our economic life.</P>
    <P>Apart from the serious financial situation  <Col N="1224" /> which most farmers find themselves in at present we are faced with an imminent and serious problem in that there will be massive redundancies in the food processing industry.  Within the last 24 hours I heard of a major dairy processing plant which will be letting a substantial number of workers go over the next couple of weeks.  Inevitably there will be a large number of redundancies in the food processing sector.  Irish industry is going through a very difficult situation with a resultant number of closures, redundancies and so on.  We cannot allow a situation to develop where the industries which process our primary produce are faced with massive redundancies or, perhaps, closures.  Most shopkeepers in provincial towns&mdash;and this applies to my own city of Limerick&mdash;supply and service the agricultural industry.  This is called the agri-business.  This sector too, is being affected.</P>
    <P>In recent months I heard of a young man who set up a small agricultural service industry five years ago.  It proved very successful and he employed 20 or 25 people. This business has now gone into liquidation because of the catastrophic decline in farmers' incomes.  They do not have the money to buy the machinery and equipment necessary for an expanding industry.  The ramifications of this situation are very frightening.  If there is a reduction in farming output, there will be continuous slaughtering of breeding stock; the processing industry will be affected and redundancies will take place.  The supply and service sectors are feeling the brunt of this situation.  I spoke to many people in the agri-business in recent weeks and they are all feeling the pinch and fear the present situation will inevitably lead to redundancies.</P>
    <P>A number of ideas were put forward in this debate.  I listened to yesterday's debate and read the opening speeches made last Thursday.  I want to state emphatically &mdash; I am sure every farmer will agree &mdash; that this Supplementary Estimate and the measures contained therein, represent a mere token response, a cosmetic exercise, by the Government to a very severe crisis which is hitting our agricultural industry.  The <Col N="1225" /> present crisis confronting that industry cannot be effectively tackled by this halfhearted response.  The Minister referred to silage subsidies, the Euro-loan and so on, which all add up to £50 million.</P>
    <P>I support the case made by our spokesman, Deputy Bruton.  He estimated that the real and meaningful rescue package necessary for the agricultural industry should be for a minimum of £300 million. Nothing less will do, and certainly not the miserable £50 million supplied in this Estimate.  This will not solve the problem. Farmers are not fools and the farming organisations know their jobs.  They are not taking to the streets for fun.  They have enough problems without leaving their farms to protest at the gates of Leinster House and parade in the streets, but they have no other option.  This is a sad reflection on the policies of a Government elected in 1977 with substantial electoral support from the farmers.</P>
    <P>I cannot help comparing the present developing agricultural crisis, particularly the manner in which the Government are handling it, with the way a Fianna Fáil Government handled a similar situation in the sixties.  Then, instead of responding realistically to the legitimate demands of the farming community and their organisations, the then Government had them carted away in the &ldquo;Black Maria&rdquo; as they appeared at the gates of Leinster House, and farmers were left sitting in front of the office of the Minister for Agriculture for nine weeks.  I was in the House at that time and recall that occasion very well.  The difficulties confronting the agricultural industry at that time were by no means as serious as the situation confronting them now.</P>
    <P>Over the past six or seven years, particularly since we joined the EEC, there has been substantial investment by the farming community in the improvement of their holdings, massive investment in equipment and gearing their farms to the most efficient level of productivity.  The farmers were aided by the financial institutions, lending agencies and so on. Unfortunately, and perhaps the most serious aspect of the present crisis is that the most progressive farmers who invested most by way of time and money <Col N="1226" /> in developing their farms in the past seven or eight years, who had to incur enormous indebtedness, are now hit most severely.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that after months of pleading by the farming organisations drastic action has to be taken.  I fully support the demands of the farming organisations.  Every Deputy in this House, especially those representing rural constituencies, must be aware of the real situation.  What can be done?</P>
    <P>I have been in this House for the past 20 years and I believe that the role of an Opposition, in addition to criticising Government policy, is to put forward constructive suggestion.  Let us be honest and admit that this package cannot solve the problem.  This cannot be denied and I challenge the Minister to try to deny it.  This package is only scratching the surface of the problem confronting the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the European Economic Community.  The Minister referred to various subheads.  He referred to the Euro loan and the new sheepmeat policy.  It is only natural that in any discussion in Irish agriculture inside this House or elsewhere reference should be made to the EEC.  Since we joined the Community the lives and fortunes of our farmers have been determined to an ever greater extent by decisions taken in Brussels and in the Councils of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I have said that I accept the figure of £300 million put forward by the spokesman on agriculture for this party as the amount needed to bring the industry out of its present crisis and put it on the road to progress again.  A rescue and recovery package to the tune of £300 million is needed to implement a realistic policy.  I have the honour to be a Member of the European Parliament and I believe that the Minister must look very seriously at the possibilities of securing a substantial part of this money from the EEC.  The money can be obtained if the case is properly presented.  I accept that the Common Agricultural Policy is coming under concerted and continuous attack from many quarters in the European Parliament and many sections throughout <Col N="1227" /> the Community.  In addition to the fact that Irish farmers are suffering from the results of national inflation, we are also faced with the grim possibility of the CAP being revised, reviewed or rearranged in a way which could be seriously detrimental to the welfare of Irish farmers.  I believe the only way the Government can deal effectively with this crisis is by the formulation of a comprehensive rescue package to be presented to the EEC.  At least 50 per cent of the cost of that package could and, I am convinced, will be forthcoming from the EEC under various instruments and agencies.  In the Protocol to the Treaty of our accession to the EEC definite commitments were given and the entire island of Ireland was recognised as an under-developed area.  Not only is this the case but agriculture is the mainstay, a fundamental and integral part of the economy.  Resources not only under the agricultural instruments but from the regional and social funds should be sought by the Government to support a realistic rescue package for the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the whole EEC situation at present is absolutely crazy and becoming more crazy with every day that passes.  There is a very severe budgetary crisis which will have serious implications for our agricultural industry.  A new country is joining the EEC on 1 January and there is no proper financial provision in the mechanism of the EEC to cater for the additional demands which will be put on the budget.  The Minister will have to adopt a hard and tough line in his negotiations at EEC level during the next six months.  He must vigorously resist the idea which is gaining momentum that we must slash the resources allocated to the CAP in order to formulate a realistic regional and social policy.  In such a situation we have the worst of both worlds because any type of regional policy in relation to this country which does not include agriculture as an important and integral part is not a regional policy at all.</P>
    <P>Many suggestion have been put forward in the course of this debate in regard to finding solutions to the serious agricultural  <Col N="1228" /> crisis.  I deplore the appalling lack of imagination, understanding and dynamism clearly reflected in the Minister's speech.  Desperate situation of this kind demand new thinking, new ideas and new attitudes and they also demand the formulation of a comprehensive rescue package.  The Minister is justifiably under severe attack from the farming organisations, the farming community and those involved in ancillary activities related to agriculture.  The criticism is fully warranted and the Minister must face up to the situation now.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that aid could be obtained from the EEC and all of us who are members of the European Parliament, irrespective of the parties to which we belong, will give our support to his case for aid.  I am sure there will be unanimous consensus among all my colleagues. We will fight within the various committees and within the Parliament itself for justice for the Irish case.  Failure on the part of the Minister will have frightening repercussions for the national economy.  Unfortunately the crisis in our agricultural industry is occurring at a time when the whole national economy is in serious trouble.  We have had a disastrous tourism year and every day there are redundancies and closures affecting manufacturing industry, and now, on top of it all, our most fundamental industry, agriculture, is in a situation which is unprecedented over the past 50 years.  I would support any steps the Minister might take to find the finances both from national resources and from European resources.  From the research I have done over the past few months and from my knowledge of the workings of the EEC I know that aid is available.  It should be available if the EEC means anything to us at all.  I would go further and say that if the EEC is not prepared to recognise the serious situation in agriculture here we will have to re-think the whole question of our continued membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to the agricultural situation which the Minister mentioned and which I have a personal interest in.  One matter was the recent developments in the EEC in regard to <Col N="1229" /> sheep.  Agreement was recently reached after many years of negotiation to have a common organisation of the market for sheep meat.  I concur with the Minister in expressing the hope that sheep producers can now look forward with greater confidence to the future.  The Minister is hopeful, and indeed so are the rest of us, of the opportunities of a community-wide market in relation to the production of quality lambs.  In this respect I want to pay special tribute to my colleague, Deputy Mark Clinton, who is a member of the European Parliament and a member of the Agricultural Committee who played a leading part both in the Agricultural Committee of the European Parliament and in the various debates in the Parliament itself on the formulation of this new sheep meat policy.  I am sure the Minister will join with me in that.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the question of mountain lambs.  A very interesting pilot experiment was carried out with which I had the honour to be closely associated.  That was the concept of co-operative lamb fattening stations, the first of which was opened in Achill Island in 1975.  Subsequently there was a very large one opened in Connemara at Maam, and the largest and perhaps most successful one is at Lispole near Dingle.  This concept of bringing the lambs down from the mountain into a central factory unit was pioneered by the Department of the Gaeltacht in 1974 and 1975 following advice and research by the Agricultural Institute.  Dr. Tynan in particular was the man who played a leading role in that and I want to pay a special tribute to him.  The Minister should look at this concept of co-operative lamb fattening stations.  They could be extended to various other mountainous regions.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to read in some newspaper over the past week about the move by sheep farmers in a certain part of west Cork towards this concept as well. The reason I want to draw the Minister's attention to it is this: in relation to the Achill lamb fattening station, the Maam Valley one and the Lispole one, the finance came from the Department of the Gaeltacht following consultation with the Department of Agriculture and with the <Col N="1230" /> Agricultural Institute and there was a grant scheme available through the Department of the Gaeltacht.  But there may be farmers outside the Gaeltacht who are contemplating the possibility of introducing this idea&mdash; I hope there are many such groups of farmers&mdash;and the Minister should look at the possibility of providing grant aid similar to what is available for the projects that have been established in the Gaeltacht.  Perhaps such aid is available from the Department of Agriculture in the non-Gaeltacht areas.  But I would respectfully draw the attention of the Minister to the possibilities. There are enormous possibilities; there are mountainous areas and there are mountain sheep farmers in areas other than Gaeltacht areas.  I can accept the idea of special aid being available for projects of that kind in the Gaeltacht but the economic arguments outside the Gaeltacht are equally strong.  I am not saying that this is ideal, that all is rosy in the garden and that these projects were perfect but they were pilot projects, new ideas and they have worked overall.  The most recent report was on the Lispole project in respect of which a substantial grant of about £75,000 was sanctioned by me as Minister for the Gaeltacht and it is working very effectively and very well.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to another very interesting topic, the question of Irish food exports.  He refers to the need for more co-ordinated and better marketing of Irish food products.  The whole question of the Irish food industry is coming more and more to the forefront in recent times.  We are beginning to recognise something that we failed to recognise properly since the foundation of the State, that we are an agricultural country with the soil and the climate and the natural conditions conducive to the development of a major food processing sector.  The situation up to now has not been satisfactory at all.  It is ironic that an agricultural country such as this imports a substantial amount of food products that could be produced at home.  I came across a report recently in relation to that.  It was a clear indication of the manner in which we have failed over the years to develop a proper food industry.  Food <Col N="1231" /> imports have increased in value by £21 million in the last year alone; this is an increase of 32 per cent in all.  Among the items here I see that imports of frozen vegetables have increased from just £200,000 in 1970 to over £8 million in 1979.  In the meantime the vegetable growing acreage in Ireland has dropped from over 10,000 acres in 1974 to just under 7,000 acres in 1979 and it is even less now.  This is an appalling reflection on the attitudes and the policies of successive Governments to the type of production tnat we are most fitted for.  I believe that despite the difficulties that confront the agricultural industry at present, the situation can be solved if it is tackled realistically, if the Government will recognise the real problems and the real crisis confronting the industry, provided they respond in an appropriate manner to the present crisis by formulating a comprehensive rescue package to be jointly financed by them and the EEC. This will restore confidence to the farming community.  The Minister made a most extraordinary statement in the light of present circumstances when he said that farmers were continuing to invest in their farms, improve their output and increase their stock.  I live among farmers and meet them every weekend.  I have met only one farmer in the last 12 months who told me he was buying a new piece of equipment.  Every week-end I meet farmers who tell me they are at their wits end to try to meet urgent debts.  I do not want to be contentinous regarding this.  I am as concerned about the future of the agricultural industry as I am sure the Minister is.  We must put our heads together and face the fact that we have a serious crisis on our hands.  We must utilise all the resources available to us to implement a comprehensive, realistic rescue package for our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I make a plea that no more reports be produced.  We have had experts of all types from the State agencies involved in agriculture to various voluntary organisations producing documents; we have had various policy documents, reports and suggestions produced in recent <Col N="1232" /> months.  I suggest that we need realistic action.  Ba chóir don Aire, an Rialtas agus go háirithe ba chóir don Taoiseach beart a dhéanamh do réir ar mbriathar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the impact he is making on the people engaged in agriculture.  He is a most acceptable Minister to farmers and to farmers organisations.  He knows the problems which they have in this very difficult year because of international events and our weather.  Many farmers are not in a healthy financial state.  They are a very level-headed category of people who are becoming much more business-like. They have confidence in themselves, the Government and in the Minister and are confident that he is making every effort possible to improve their lot.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk about the oil which we may have in the future but we have an important resource in our agricultural land.  Farmers are becoming better educated and better able to produce that wealth and to turn it into what for us is oil.  In Cork and in Munster generally dairying is our biggest industry.  We must ensure that every effort is made to contain the present size of the dairying herd and to see that cow numbers are increased.  Milk testing and recording facilities should be used by farmers.  We should ensure that all farmers know that those facilities are available.  They should be shown comparisons between the people who are recording, the average yield they have as against what the people who do not record have.  ACOT should give every assistance and advice to ensure that production is increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creamery co-operatives and the meat processing co-operatives have a big part to play.  They have a very big investment in the agricultural industry.  Many of the creamery co-ops have enough investment for years ahead and will not need to build new processing plants.  We need to get herd numbers up and milk supplies up to make those processing plants an economic proposition.  There is a great spin-off from milk production not <Col N="1233" /> only in milk, cheese and other products but also in beef.</P>
    <P>With regard to beef marketing, it is very important that employers and employees get together to see that those plants are made very efficient and to ensure that there is an inducement for farmers to sell to the meat plants.  The people involved in their operation must be made aware of the importance of the beef industry to our economy.  Selling and exporting beef on the hoof is an outlet for farmers who cannot always get cattle easily into factories.  I believe if farmers were given the right incentive they would prefer to sell at home and see our beef ready for marketing to our housewives rather than see it going out live to other countries.  I appeal to everybody concerned to see how efficiently those factories are being run elsewhere.  Management and the trade unions should go abroad to see what our competitors are doing.  It is a national disgrace that we are exporting raw material for processing in another country when there is a crying need to retain existing jobs and to provide new jobs for our young people.  Here is an obvious way in which we can give employment, and very good employment, and add to the wealth of the nation.</P>
    <P>We here have the land, the climate, the know-how and, I believe, the will to produce the best vegetables in the world. I urge that the most up-to-date processing and marketing facilities, which we already have in some cases, be adopted. These are not as efficient as I believe they could be.  Every day of the week in the supermarkets and the food stores more and more foreign produced and packaged vegetables are to be seen.  We see them advertised as health foods.  The best health foods are fresh vegetables.  Housewives should support their own country markets and their own farmers, thus helping in some small way our balance of payments.  We must change people's attitudes regarding what is available.  Our supermarkets and food stores should have an Irish corner.  At times it is difficult for people who want to buy Irish to find Irish produce in the stores because there are so many foreign items on the shelves.  I look forward to the day when <Col N="1234" /> we may have an imports corner, because our own Irish products would be so well packaged, presented and of such high quality and good value that they would take the majority of space in all the Irish food stores.</P>
    <P>The repayment of high interest loans is probably of most concern to farmers today, especially the most progressive ones who have expanded, on the advice available from the banking organisations, agricultural advisers, the finance houses and their own county committees of agriculture. Due to the fluctuation in interest rates farmers who borrowed at 12 to 12½ per cent find themselves at times paying up to 20 per cent interest repayments. Farmers with whom I have discussed this problem during the last year would borrow again in the future if they were guaranteed a lower rate of interest.  They do not want anything for nothing.  If they get a service they expect to pay for it.  The Minister should consider a level rate of interest and over a much longer period, as in most businesses.  Too much pressure should not be put on anyone who may hit a lean period, which is what has happened in the past year.  A number of things went wrong and farmers found themselves in difficulty.  I am only adding my voice to many others who are asking the banks and money lending agencies to see the present situation as an emergency which will not readily occur again.  Farmers are a very sound proposition and will get out of this difficult situation.  They do not let their difficulties pile on top of them.  They are prepared to get to work and can see that there is a future in the farming industry, particularly here with our tradition of the farmer's family following in his footsteps.  The banks and lending agencies should realise that farming is a peculiar industry and needs a particular type of attention.  I hope that the Minister, the Government and the finance organisations will work out something which will be in the long term most beneficial to the country.</P>
    <P>Looking at the number of farm modernisation grants which have been or will be paid out this year one sees that they have increased over what was budgeted for, from £36.5 million to £59.5 million. <Col N="1235" /> Speaking from memory, last year it was £22 or £23 million.  This is a vast increase, which shows the investment and improvements made by farmers over the past number of years.  The farmers and the Minister should promote a continuity of investment with the emphasis on increasing stock.  No matter how we increase our stock, whether beef or dairy, we have a long way to go before we reach our full potential.  Every possible incentive should be given to farmers.  It should be pointed out to them that, as far as increase in production is concerned, the sky is the limit.  We have the markets, but must look after them.  We have the facilities for intervention and for processing. The opportunities are there, given the proper encouragement and facilities.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Department on the continuous efforts being made to eradicate disease. Although animal disease breaks out here and there occasionally for some reason, I do not think it will be long until we have got rid of the scourges of TB, brucellosis, warble fly and all the others, because farmers are getting the message that disease eradication is for their benefit.</P>
    <P>I shall deal briefly with the conditions in my constituency.  I should like to see the expansion of the agricultural colleges, if we cannot get new ones.  Every facility should be given to ACOT to do the job they were set up to do.  I should like to see farm centres throughout the county properly staffed, with clerk-typists and with a telephone service so that agricultural instructors would be accessible to farmers in these difficult days.</P>
    <P>The agricultural colleges are being used extensively by farming boys and girls who are anxious to be educated to the highest standards.  As a result, our farmers are becoming a well-educated sector of the community.  We should not deny them the opportunity to spend at least one year in an agricultural college. However, due to the unprecedented demands from boys and girls, the places available are not numerous enough.  I make a special plea to have ACOT offices properly staffed so that the expensively <Col N="1236" /> trained agricultural advisers can get out in the field to do their work among farmers.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Department on the introduction of the fodder scheme this winter.  Because of the efforts of ACOT staffs many farmers made silage this year for the first time and because farmers have been made aware of the benefits of silage they will continue to make it in the future.  I should like to pay a tribute to the Department and the Minister for introducing a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers.  We should look carefully at the international price structures of this valuable nutrient so that our farmers will be able to buy it at the right price.  Nitrogen is the final push that will give increased production and make the additional few pounds that will render farming economic.</P>
    <P>In these difficult days it is important that the agricultural scene be kept reviewed constantly and I compliment the Minister on his efforts in this respect.</P>
    <P>He should keep in close contact with the farming organisations so that there will not be any breakdown in communications. Given the right conditions farmers will respond.  The present Minister for Agriculture is the right man for the job and I wish him well in his important post. I hope he will have every success in his negotiations in Brussels in the coming year and that as a result our farmers will have a bright 1981.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Supplementary Estimate.  I will bring a few facts and figures to the attention of the Minister of State now in the House who, I hope, will convey them to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of me as a Deputy from south Tipperary, the Golden Vale, if I did not bring to the attention of the Minister the plight of farmers there.  I will do so in a cool, objective way.  The Minister should not be under any illusion about the feelings of the farming community in south Tipperary.  This Supplementary Estimate is totally inadequate, too little, too late.  It gives me the impression that the Minister has not got any perception of the real difficulties affecting  <Col N="1237" /> farmers and the industry in general. To my mind, this Supplementary Estimate is only a piece of shadow boxing, window dressing, gimmickry.  It does not attempt to deal with the real crunch issues.</P>
    <P>It has been said quite often by Deputies on this side that there is a crisis in agriculture, and I re-emphasise that.  Farmers have not experienced such a crisis since the bad black days of the Economic War. There are feelings of deep despondency and loss of confidence among farmers and once a farmer loses confidence it is very hard to restore it.  Older farmers still recall the Economic War.  Now, unfortunately, progressive young farmers are being caught in this crisis and I have no doubt it will leave an indelible mark on their minds which will prevent them from doing anything new or progressive, that will stop them from seeking the guidance of agricultural instructors or departmental officers.  Once bitten, twice shy.</P>
    <P>The Government are totally insensitive to the real feelings of farmers.  That seems strange because the Minister must have been given advice by rural Deputies on his side and therefore he cannot be unaware of the feelings among farming organisations.  He has seen the marches. To say the least of it, this Supplementary Estimated, depicted as a cure for present ills in agriculture, is highly insulting.  Perhaps the picture the Minister would like to paint could be sold to the National Gallery, but I doubt that it could be sold to the farmers of south Tipperary.  To me in that picture there are no warm hues of rose and pink.  To me it is black, grey and sombre.  I take no pleasure in being gloomy about the situation.  That is how I find it.  If I were to describe it otherwise I would be misleading the House and the Minister who has overall responsibility for agriculture.  I should like to bring to his notice once again some of the harsh realities which have been described more eloquently many times from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted and undisputed that in the past two years farmers' income in real terms has dropped by 50 per cent. That is accepted by all sides of the House. Unfortunately, it is also expected that in <Col N="1238" /> the coming years farmers' income will fall by a further 10 per cent.  That is against the background of industrial workers and other workers getting an increase of 6.7 per cent in real terms over the past two years.  There is the crunch, in my opinion. The farming community are one of the hardest working elements in our economy. They are not afraid of hard work. They are prepared to work hard and take a gamble.  All they expect is a fair return for their money and their efforts.  In sharp contrast to the largesse of the Government to other sections of the community, particularly in subsidising semi-State bodies, they see the meagre allowances given to the farming industry, and rightly they have reason to crib, to be disillusioned and to be fearful of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are also told that in the past two years input into agriculture increased by over 30 per cent.  I find it very difficult to accept that the Government have no long-term plan for agriculture.  These are all stop-gap measures.  An ordinary farmer has to have a five-year development plan to get the grants available to him from the EEC.  If a farmer has to have a plan extending over five years, surely the Government of the day should at least have a long-term plan for agriculture to indicate to the farmers in what direction they should go.  When farmers compare themselves with their industrial counterparts in the EEC they see that agriculture is blossoming and blooming in the EEC countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be serious in our attitude to agriculture and its importance to the economy.  I will give a quotation of the NESC report, No. 26.  The prelude to planning states that in the growth process the key sectors are agriculture and the manufacturing industry and the agricultural sector, including its associated supply and processing industry, accounts for 48 per cent of the total value of output with the remaining 52 per cent being contributed by manufacturing industry.  We must establish the importance of agriculture to the economy and, having established it, we must go about rescuing it when it is in a state of crisis, as it is at present.  Unfortunately the rot has set in in this year's budget.</P>
      <P>In the golden years, when Deputy Mark Clinton was Minister, farm increases accrued yearly at the rate of 12 to 15 per cent and farmers enjoyed a certain amount of prosperity.  Unfortunately that era did not last.  The Government were not aware of that and in this year's budget introduced a multiplicity of measures against the farming community to extract from them their hard-earned money and they have left the farmers totally unprepared and under-financed to meet these difficulties.  From a milk account of a co-operative creamery I found that there is an EEC levy at 1.3740p per gallon to be deducted, a dairy inspection levy at 0.1p per gallon, a research levy of 0.5p, a Board Bainne levy of 1 per cent and an IFA/ICMSA levy.  A farmer recently gave me the deductions that he had to pay on each animal.  There was insurance of 75p, a contribution of 0.1 per cent to the IFA fund&mdash;that might be because he is a member of that organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>None of these things are in the Supplementary Estimate.  The Deputy is getting a lot of latitude but he is going to town on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; there is also the Department of Agriculture vet examination  <Col N="1242" /> fee of £1 per animal, the Department of Agriculture disease levy of £3 per animal and a CBF levy of 50p per animal amounting to approximately £5, leaving out cartage and other things. These levies are imposed on farmers by the Minister and his Department.  If the Minister is serious in his attempts to rescue the farming community he should abolish most of these levies thus doing something positive and concrete for the farming community.  The Minister is crying crocodile tears that he is concerned about the plight of the farmers when, at the same time, he insists that these levies be deducted from the milk or meat cheque.</P>
      <P>I cannot speak in golden terms about subhead D.10, the £600,000 given as assistance to the farming community. One allowance is £20 per ton of fertiliser and the other is £3 per ton of silage up to a maximum of £50.  It has been represented to me by the farmers that a subsidy of £20 per ton for a farmer who has lost his meadow of hay is an insult to his intelligence.  There are many farmers in that position in South Tipperary.  That £20 is only the cost of 10 to 15 bales of hay.  That puts it in its proper perspective and likewise the £3 per ton to a maximum of £50.  It is only a drop in the ocean to compensate farmers for their loss of silage of hay and it is so way out that it is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the division between urban and rural Ireland.  Both sections should be complementary to each other.  Will the Minister do everything he can to bring the two sections together?  They are interdependent and should not continue to be suspicious of each other.  We are all in this together and if we have a rich agricultural community the money will percolate into everybody's pockets.  If things are going well for the farming community the processing industry will be maintained, there will be extra employment and the supply and other services will be maintained.  I urge the Minister to try to defuse this ongoing row between the urban and rural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the disadvantaged areas.  I regret there <Col N="1243" /> is no financial provision in the Estimate to include the Slieve Felim area of County Tipperary despite the promises of the present Minister for Finance three-and-a-half  years ago that the area would be included.  Will the Minister have another look at this to see if he could use his bargaining powers in the EEC to have it included?</P>
    <P>Our best efforts should now be directed towards a short-term policy to help the farmers out of this present crisis and we should then develop a five-year plan for farmers so that they can plan ahead.  What is needed at the moment is for the Minister to fight tigerishly in Europe as did his predecessor, Deputy Mark Clinton, to have a minimum of a 10 per cent increase.  I note in this week's issue of the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> that already there are attempts to undermine this minimum of 10 per cent.  In the initial debates on the 1981 budget the parliament have passed a series of resolutions limiting farm price rises to a maximum of 5 per cent.  Some farmers' organisations in Europe are looking for a 15.3 per cent increase in order that their incomes will not fall.  On top of that our farmers are looking for an extra increase of approximately 19 per cent to bring them up to the levels of their industrial counterparts. The Minister must go to Europe with a well prepared plan and ask for assistance as we have not enough resources of our own.  If we put forward a plan and agree that the Irish Government will give £for £ the EEC Ministers will help to tide us over this short-term crisis until our farmers find their feet.</P>
    <P>A proposal put forward by Macra na Feirme was that a green £ devaluation could compensate for our high inflation from Brussels.  We are told that there is flexibility of the 1.53 per cent allowable for the devaluation of the green £.  I would urge the Minister to see if that is feasible.  I have no doubt from discussions with members of the farming organisations that the devaluation of the green £ would be to our advantage.</P>
    <P>As regards a Government subsidy on farm inputs, especially interest rates and fertilisers, the Government removed the <Col N="1244" /> subsidy on fertilisers which the interParty Government had.  The Minister should have another look at the matter. We are told that the French Government are about to take certain precautions to ensure that the income of French farmers does not drop.  In this week's issue of the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> we are told that the most likely way the French Government will assist farmers is by a major VAT refund, a range of interest rate subsidies and, in some sectors, retrospective price increases.  The decision of the French Government is a dramatic indication of how conscious they are of the need to maintain agricultural confidence and increase production.  If the French Government can do so our Government should, especially as our economy is much more dependent on agriculture than the French economy is.</P>
    <P>Other short-term ways in which we can help would be to pay off all outstanding grants.  I know the Minister has made provision in the Estimate for this but I have known cases of where farm modernisation grants were outstanding for six to eight months.  The farmers in question came to me time and again and I made repeated representations to the Minister. All I got were promises.  Eventually most of the grants were paid.  This is no concession to the farming community because they were entitled to the grants.  The work had been contracted for and many farmers had to borrow at high interest rates to pay off the contractor while waiting for the final payment of the grant.</P>
    <P>As regards marketing, we are told that the butter market will remain static for the next ten years but for the beef, veal, mutton, lamb and pigmeat sectors there is an expected increase in sales of 50 per cent and cheese will go to 75 per cent.  An all-out effort should be made by the Department to avail of this hope for an increase in outlets for meat and cheese. I am glad that in Tipperary town a cheese plant is currently being erected.</P>
    <P>It was brought to my notice recently that a person who went into a supermarket was appalled when he saw the rows and rows of imported foodstuffs.  This is something the Government must look at seriously.  We import about £20 million <Col N="1245" /> worth of foodstuffs that we could manufacture here.  This should be of great concern to the Minister.  He should set up a marketing board which would market our existing products in a more attractive way and set out to counter the temptation to import foodstuffs that we could manufacture with our own raw materials.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the possibility of having a fixed rate of interest. This is one of the major causes of the present crisis especially among young progressive farmers.  When they undertook farm development work they got loans at the rate of 12 per cent from bank managers or the ACC.  All their future projections were based on 12 per cent. When the interest rate increased to 19 per cent and 21 per cent all their projections went awry and their expectations were completely disrupted.  I know there are difficulties in getting fixed interest rates but it would be worth pursuing.  If a farmer enters into an agreement with a bank manager to borrow £40,000 at 12 per cent, the rate of interest should be fixed at 12 per cent for the duration of the loan.  If the following day he got another loan at 18 per cent he would have got it in the full knowledge of what the repayments would be.  When there is flexibility in the interest rate there cannot be positive planning.  The Minister and those in the Department of Finance should look at this.</P>
    <P>The major task is to restore confidence, especially among young farmers, in the industry.  That confidence has been eroded.  Perhaps in 1982 things will improve.  Confidence must be restored if we are to encourage them to progress and avail of the opportunities that undoubtedly exist in the EEC.  At present they are disillusioned and are looking to the Minister for guidance.</P>
    <P>We could remove a lot of the nationally imposed levies.  We could do away with the base for the resource tax and rates which perhaps will be established in the European Court as an unjust and iniquitous type base for assessing people's ability to pay.  We are told that there is a poor law valuation shock for the Cabinet because indication are that in the European Court this 150 year old system will <Col N="1246" /> be found unconstitutional.  That will have many repercussions for the farming sector.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister in the short-term, in order to get out of the crises situation and the predicament that the farming community are in, to come forward with a more realistic package of help.  From that he could go forward, in association with the farming organisations who are experts in the field and know the feelings of their members, and plan ahead so that agriculture can give the economy the return that is there.  I have always stated that our greatest asset is the nine inches of topsoil we have.  Oil fields may or may not be there but we are sure and certain of our fertile nine inches of topsoil.  The Government, the Opposition and the farming organisations working together can capitalise on that but the farming community must be given the wherewithal, help and confidence.  Until that confidence is restored and the financial help is given we will only go on with this stop-gap planning with no overall plan to make Ireland what I feel it could be &mdash; the real garden of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of contributing to this debate especially since the main Estimate relates to the farm modernisation scheme.  The bulk of the Estimate, £23 million, is going towards the payment of grants in connection with farm development and that indicates that there is confidence in the long-term ability of the industry.  That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first nine months of this year £51 million was paid out in grants relating to farm buildings and land reclamation. That is an indication that the farming community themselves are confident that this depression we are experiencing is only short-term and it is caused by a number of factors, some of them within our control, some outside our control.  I am glad that the Government have taken steps to ease the burden and make this depression as short-term as possible.  I do not have to go into the various items which were included in recent packages of incentives and aids for the farming <Col N="1247" /> community to help them overcome this short-term problem.</P>
    <P>It is important that additional moneys be made available to encourage farmers to develop their enterprises.  It is very important for the farming community, and indeed for the whole community, to find people engaged in our primary industry modernising their farm and reclaiming their land.  It is estimated that half of the land in Ireland is considered marginal. If half of it is marginal we have a very big job of work to do to bring that into useful production.  At every seminar and lecture concerning agriculture we hear that efficiency is the key word, efficiency in production, processing and marketing.  Efficiency of production will be helped by the reclamation of land and the improvement of farm buildings.  Generally the farmers are making tremendous strides towards having their end of the industry efficient and progressive.</P>
    <P>After the produce leaves the farms or production areas I am not sure about the efficiency of the processing end of the industry.  I am glad that in the recent package of £300 million, £150 million of which is coming from FEOGA and £150 million from the Exchequer, that emphasis is put on improving processing.  In the west of Ireland in disadvantaged areas a FEOGA grant of 50 per cent is available to anybody who wishes to improve his plant or equipment for processing efficiency. As well as that he will get 25 per cent from the IDA.  That makes a total grant of 75 per cent for firms, factories and industries, who want to modernise their plant and improve their processing ability.  We have heard speaker after speaker talking about the amount of imported products, foods particularly, and asking why we cannot do this processing ourselves.  We have natural advantages in production, we have hard-working farmers, and there is no reason why that production should not be converted into profitable products.  Unfortunately, a number of the areas of processing have been neglected and run down and the money has not been put back into plant and equipment to provide these convenient and up-to-date types of food for the <Col N="1248" /> modern housewives, who in increasing numbers are working away from home and do not have a great deal of time to spend preparing raw foods.  They want convenient products and are opting for the imported ones.  Therefore, we have no option but to modernise our plant and equipment.  If we can produce it we should be able to process it.  I compliment the Minister and the Department for the emphasis they are placing on the processing end of the industry.</P>
    <P>For the disadvantaged areas the headage payments on both sheep and cattle have been increased.  The average farmer now in a severely handicapped area can get up to £1,000 per year in cattle headage payments.  This is a tremendous help to enable people to carry on in very critical circumstances.  Regarding disadvantaged areas, I hope that additional areas of west Cork in particular would be included in the revision of these areas.</P>
    <P>I hope also that under that £300 million group water schemes will be improved and that the contribution from the applicants will be reduced from 33? per cent to 20 per cent.  I have been involved in a number of group water schemes and I think they are an outstanding example of what can be done by local effort.  They are a tremendous advantage to people in rural areas, because without a continous water supply one cannot really be involved in enterprises such as dairying, where so much water is required for sanitary purposes, for washing of milking equipment and so on.  Therefore, this package will be of tremendous benefit in extending the possibilities for farmers within the poorer or more difficult areas.</P>
    <P>One big advantage of the farm modernisation scheme is the fact that farmers have to plan and develop their enterprises in a coherent way; they have to know what they are about to do and then go ahead and do it.  They have to keep farm accounts which will enable them to know where they are going.  I am glad that the time to avail of the grant under farm accounts has been extended from three months to six months, because farm accounts are a fairly new enterprise for many farmers.  They have to get help from accounts and various other agencies <Col N="1249" /> and in many cases they cannot get back the accounts in time to avail of the grant. It is a pity if they have to lose out on grant aid for one of the most important aids to farm development, namely, the keeping of accounts.  Even with the six months if people are a little over the limit &mdash; I know of a few such cases &mdash; the Department of Agriculture could be lenient towards the farming community.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the number of people participating in the milk recording scheme.  It has not been going well up to now.  Only 1,000 or 1,100 dairy farmers participate in milk recording.  If they do not record their animals how are they to know what animals are productive.  We have the lowest milk yield in Europe.  If we want to double the yield, the first thing we have to know is what individual animals are yielding at present and take it from there.  I urge the Department of Agriculture to take another look at the milk recording scheme to see if it could be improved and if additional dairy farmers could be encouraged to participate in it.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that dairy farmers are being asked to converts their herds into beef herds.  It is a pity to find good dairy herds being slaughtered, with incentive aids from the EEC.  It has been shown over and over again that the most profitable farm enterprise is dairying.  It is under developed here and everything should be done to improve it.  Dairy farmers who might see a short term advantage in getting out of milk and opting for some of these schemes might have another look at it and remain in the most profitable enterprise in farming.  Dairying is the cornerstone of the whole agricultural industry. Without dairy cows and calves one cannot build any type of beef herd or general industry.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on holding out against the introduction of a super levy.  We have had a difficult year but it could have been worse if we had had this type of disincentive and penalty.  More recently, I was glad to see the Minister resisting importation from third countries such as New Zealand.  If we have restraints within the Common Market some format should be found to restrain <Col N="1250" /> third countries who are not even members of the Community.  It is difficult to talk to hard working milk producers who cannot get a good return for their income because of competition from third countries. The Minister should get every support and encouragement in resisting this inflow of competitive products from third countries while we are trying to build up our own dairy and agricultural industries.</P>
    <P>During the last 12 months ACOT was introduced and there was an improvement generally in aids towards educating farmers, young and not so young.  Training programmes in the Cork area are going very well and the participation in and completion of these courses has been over 95 per cent.  Demand for the courses has been beyond the expectations of the advisory service and, in the long run, this will be a great help to the whole agricultural industry.  I support the other speakers who have asked for these new farm training centres, which are so helpful to the farming community.  Farmers are able to meet in centres which are comfortable and well-heated.  Some years ago these courses were held in closed-down schools and draughty halls and there was no encouragement for people to participate in them.  It is unfortunate that we have not at least one clerical assistant in each farm training centre.  It is not a good economic proposition to have agricultural science graduates answering telephones. It does not make sense.  I urge the Minister and the Department to sort out this problem because the farm modernisation scheme is taking up a considerable amount of time.  There is a lot of paper work involved without having to spend additional time answering the telephone. That is not what they were educated for.  They should be able to spend more time on the farms in order to monitor the plan and the programme under the farm modernisation scheme.  If there is a five-year programme it should be planned with the assistance of the advisers and, to do that, the adviser must pay regular visits.  At present, unfortunately, that is not possible.</P>
    <P>We had difficulties with some farmers in the disease eradication programme. They had breakdowns in their herds. <Col N="1251" /> During the early part of last year we had tremendous difficulty in Cork with the return of cards for farmers who wanted to take animals to marts and dispose of them and with the return of samples generally from Dublin.  I am glad that blood testing facilities are being made available at last in Cork.  It should not have taken the length of time it did.  A temporary laboratory could have been set up in a building in the city which would have saved a lot of frustration for farmers.</P>
    <P>Two years ago some farmers paid too much money for additional land&mdash;and for land in the first place&mdash;and it has caused financial problems.  That situation has been eased somewhat by restructuring of loans and additional moneys made available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the banks, but there is still a problem.  Rather than looking for additional loans for restructuring or development, which the hapless farmer has not even time to think of, there should be an extension in the length of time of the loan.  If a five or seven year term loan could be extended to 12 or 15 years it would allow farmers to get over their temporary difficulties.  It is high capital payback which is causing most of the problems and perhaps that could be considered in negotiations with financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The pig meat industry has been going through a difficult time.  The pigs and Bacon Commission and industry generally should look at the marketing performance of Bord Bainne in the dairy industry, which has set a headline for those other sectors of the food industry that have a go-it-alone, fragmented approach to marketing their products.  As far as the pig industry is concerned there has not been any co-ordinated effort to modernise the processing and marketing of that sector.  I am glad the Minister has been negotiating with the people concerned. I hope they will be able to reduce the slide in that industry because in areas like west Cork the pig industry is very important to the whole economy of the area.  In the last few years it has declined very rapidly.  If it is to remain in existence something will have to be done very soon. <Col N="1252" /> I am glad the Minister is negotiating with the people concerned at the processing and marketing end of the industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to an Estimate which is mainly to support the development of the industry.  It does show that there is confidence at farming level in this enterprise. I see no real point in Opposition members emphasising the depression.  We know we have had a difficult year but emphasising depression will not do anything for those concerned.  Constructive suggestions would be more helpful.</P>
    <P>Anybody in town or city over the past six months will agree that activity in their area has not been as good as previously because farming activities have not been as great but, seeing that farming is the most important sector of the economy, serious consideration should be given to the inclusion of farming representatives in any future negotiations for a national understanding.  I hope that when the next round of negotiations comes up the farming community will be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to Deputy Walsh's appeal at the end of what I regard as a very good contribution to this debate, I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that there is a crisis in the agricultural industry.  I would not be adequately representing farmers in my constituency if I did not avail of the opportunity of bringing to the attention of the Minister and the Ministers of State that there is a crisis in this industry.  Without apportioning blame we should avail of this discussion to try to find ways and means of restoring confidence in the agricultural industry as a whole because there is a lack of confidence over the last 12 months.  What disturbs me more than anything else is when one finds even in Deputy Walsh's constituency and Cork county as a whole a new generation of young farmers who will travel to Dublin and congregate outside this house for no other reason than to attract the Minister's attention to their problems.  That speaks for itself.  We must find some means of restoring the confidence that is no longer there.  More serious is the effect this lack <Col N="1253" /> of confidence will have across the whole economy.</P>
      <P>I come from the south and I do not seek to minimise the magnitude of the problems of the Minister or his Minister of State.  It is an enormous job because of the importance of the industry to job creation when so many are unemployed and this is an area in which we can create work and which has potential.  I can understand the difficulties in trying to make sure that the maximum benefit will be got from this industry so that the whole country will benefit.  Without going into detail, but talking in particular about the dairy industry, I think Deputy Griffin mentioned the number of levies and taxes of all sorts on agriculture.  I want to draw attention to the fact that many of these taxes and penalties were imposed on the farmer's income at a time when farmers were doing reasonably well.  In 1977 it was better than 1978; 1978 was better than 1979 and 1979 better than 1980. There is a continuing drop in farming incomes.  All those taxes were there in 1978, the disease eradication levy, the Bord Bainne levy, the inspection levy and a number of others that I do not need to mention.  How has the price of dairy produce fared since 1977?  It has gone up a few pence a gallon for milk.  The cost of inputs has gone up in some instances almost 100 per cent.  Herein is the problem particularly of the dairy farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we must first examine how we can do an emergency job on farmers' income.  Nothing will restore confidence better than a little profit at the end of the day.  The same would apply to any industry or to any worker.  A little profit or improvement in income will restore the confidence necessary to get the maximum out of the individual or the industry.  Perhaps we were a little over enthusiastic &mdash; I refer particularly to the advisory services &mdash; in the mid-seventies when we encouraged farmers to expand and create jobs.  More milk was produced, more jobs created in production, transport, processing and marketing and things were going reasonably well.  We encouraged, through the advisory services, expansion in building, land reclamation and drainage. We encouraged the borrowing of <Col N="1254" /> money for these purposes where young farmers took over the business from their parents.  Young farmers who in many cases were educated and gained much experience through organisations like Macra na Feirme invested pretty heavily in the industry at that time.</P>
    <P>The point has already been made about the rate of interest at which they borrowed. The problem is that the rise in the cost of servicing their borrowings is crippling. While we have a Suplementary Estimate here &mdash; and let us accept that it is a step in the direction of trying to rectify a serious situation &mdash; I do not believe it goes far enough.  I think we need an emergency measure such as a year's grace in the repayment of loans, a removal of the taxes imposed on income for a year.  Something of that kind would restore the confidence which is very necessary for this valuable industry.  I should be grateful if the Minister would consider something of that sort because it is no exaggeration, and I take no pride or particular satisfaction in saying it, that some dairy farmers in the categories I have already mentioned are very close to bankruptcy as a result of doing what we encouraged them to do in the mid-seventies, borrow heavily, improve their holdings, improve their land.  Now they cannot meet their commitments.  I could give the Minister names and examples but this is not necessary because the Minister is aware of it.  Deputy Walsh and everybody living in a rural constituency must be aware of these problems.  However, it is something that will pass over.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Keegan talk of a recession in 1974.  We had such a recession; we will probably have more recessions in years to come but the difference between the 1974 recession and the present one is that this is a long-term recession. The 1974 recession was short-term. Talking about thousands of cattle dying of starvation in 1974 is disgraceful exaggeration because even in this much more serious crisis and with much more serious depression of farm incomes generally, when there is much more despondency and lack of confidence you will not have cattle starving or dying of hunger.  Anybody who talks in those terms in this <Col N="1255" /> House is not aware of the capacity and intelligence of the farming community.  It has not gone to that stage and I sincerely hope it will not.</P>
    <P>We had a change of Government in 1977, a change of Ministers.  Since the last election we have had two different Ministers for Agriculture but people are asking whether we have as much muscle in Europe now in terms of fighting for the retention of the benefits of the CAP as was the case in the past.  In fighting a measure such as the super levy, for instance, I am confident that the Minister would have the widest support possible should he be confronted with that sort of situation again but it is necessary for him to have some muscle in the Council of Ministers and to point out to his counterparts there how vital is the agricultural industry to our economy.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing to find that milk production has fallen here while it has increased throughout Europe but what is worse is that, as mentioned by Deputy Walsh, some of our highest-yielding dairy cows are being slaughtered because of the many incentives for joining the EEC conversion scheme.  I would support Deputy Walsh in his views in that regard but what is worst of all is that we should introduce a scheme which is resulting in this slaughter so that we may induce our farmers to move away from milk production. Taking into consideration all the difficulties relating to the industry, I would accept Deputy Walsh's point that dairying is the most profitable enterprise in the agricultural industry.  It is the area in which there is the highest labour content and the greatest expertise but it is also an industry in which there is a daily erosion of profits and incomes.</P>
    <P>We have lost some ground in Europe during the past number of years.  We do not have the tenacity that we had in the past.  We do not have the strength that we had when the National Coalition were in office.  This is accepted also by the farming community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements in regard to those areas that are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme but when may we expect an anouncement of the <Col N="1256" /> extension of this scheme?  I would remind the Minister of State that at a meeting which I attended in Cork last year we were promised that the extension of the scheme would be effected by the following November.  A year has now passed and we have not heard any more about it.  But, of course, the promise of an extension was made long before last year. It was made during the election campaign iln 1977 when we were told by Fianna Fáil that if they were returned to power those areas in the constituencies of mid-Cork and south-west Cork, the areas which were not included in the scheme, would be included, that all that had to be done was to make application to Brussels. We were told that because an application had not been made up to then, these areas could not have been included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>On the subject of disease eradication, I would be critical of the policies concerning it, though I am not confining this criticism totally to the present administration.  It is disturbing to find that despite the many millions of pounds we have spent in this area we still have a situation in which one herd in 40 produces reactors.  This is 20 years after the <Col N="1259" /> eradication of TB in our national herd.  If we are to get anywhere in terms of our agricultural industry we must have a totally disease-free herd.  There is not enough emphasis on the requirements in regard to achieving a total disease-free situation so far as the various people involved are concerned.  I refer to the farmers, to the agricultural inspectors, to departmental officials and particularly to cattle dealers and people in the cattle haulage business.  There is a considerable degree of looseness in the method of disease eradication.  My county has been declared a clearance area for brucellosis. I know of the high incidence of the disease in Munster.  Ultimately it will interfere with the income of the farming community but many farmers do not realise that.  There is too much looseness in the movement of cattle.  I have no time for people who try to make a fast buck while ignoring or circumventing the regulations. Transport and other aspects must be watched.  It is a good question to ask what progress has been made.  Will the same thing happen with regard to the programme to eradicate brucellosis as happened to the programme to eradicate bovine TB?</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of work has been done during the years under the farm modernisation scheme but it is a cumbersome scheme in that it involves a lot of paper work.  Much of the time of the agricultural advisers has been taken up with this work.  With Deputy Cogan, Deputy Walsh and others I appeal to the Minister to provide some clerical assistance to deal with this scheme.  The agricultural advisory officers are better employed to advise people with regard to land reclamation, crops and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land of Ireland is a valuable asset. We can talk about oil finds but here we have a valuable but scarce commodity.  A considerable amount of land could be reclaimed and brought into production. Some people who are not availing of the benefits of the farm modernisation scheme could be advised to utilise that scheme in order to bring their land into production.  More farmers should be encouraged to improve their land in <Col N="1260" /> order to produce more food that will be demanded in the world markets.</P>
    <P>The poultry and pig industries are valuable assets.  It is sad that more than one-third of the eggs consumed here are imported and more than one-third of the poultry being supplied under contract to institutions such as health boards is imported also.  It may be of poor quality but I do not think we are educated to that extent.  Surely it is possible to give incentives to poultry producers here to produce sufficient for the home market?  I tabled some questions to the Minister on that matter because I was concerned.  I am glad the Minister is meeting some of the interests involved in pig production because this is a valuable asset particularly to small farmers.  I know that there are considerable constraints imposed on pig producers in relation to pollution but that is inevitable.  Another area of concern relates to vegetable production. There is something wrong when we import vegetables to the extent now prevailing or when we see farmers queueing up in shops in towns in order to buy vegetables.  All of these areas must be examined.</P>
    <P>However, there is a more urgent requirement, namely, to deal with the crisis that exists in the farming community. This cannot be left for the future; it needs urgent attention now.  Only the Government and the Minister for Agriculture can ensure that the industry does not collapse.  When we joined the EEC agriculture was under-capitalised and that still remains the position.  Is there any way in which there could be a stabilisation of finance, that once a farmer borrows money to improve his holding he will know what that capital will cost him.  The uncertainty is frightening farmers and it militates against further expansion.</P>
    <P>There has been mention about the cost of fertilisers and the subsidy of £20 for one ton of nitrogen.  There was so much ballyhoo about it one would think the subsidy was wonderful but, in fact, the amount is not much.  The Minister referred to one matter and I would support him completely on it, namely, the incentive to the farming community to <Col N="1261" /> move from hay-making into silage.  As this year has proved, our climate is not suitable for hay-making.  In addition to having a bad Government we had bad weather and both factors hit the farmers severely.  Farmers should be encouraged to concentrate on silage-making rather than on any other kind of fodder.  In many areas this year farmers lost much of their fodder because of the bad weather and they had to sell some of their cattle.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of all other things, the dairying industry is the most important because it provides the raw material for the entire industry.  Everything should be done to encourage dairy farmers to expand their cow numbers because by expanding they will provide more jobs and a better income for themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Raising the 1 per cent VAT limit would require unanimous agreement in the Council of Ministers, as well as the involvement of other Community institutions, and ratification by the member states in accordance with their constitutional requirements.  The issue is related to the examination now under way of the restructuring of the Community budget, on which the Commission have been asked to produce proposals by next June.  This restructuring, in turn, poses a fundamental challenge to our interests, particularly in relation to the common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>Both the Ministers concerned and I have been aware of the serious consequences for Ireland of this development and have used every opportunity available to us to win support for our viewpoint and will continue to do so.  It would not be appropriate for me to give more detail at this stage about the Government's approach.</P>

      <P>Why is it inappropriate for the Taoiseach to say what discussions he has had on this matter with various governments?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that it would not be appropriate for me to give details of the Government's approach.  The Deputy knows that there is a continuing process in these matters and opportunities arise from time to time which are availed <Col N="1264" /> of as they arise.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's suggestion that matters of this kind are dealt with in an orderly way as occasions arise is a reflection of inertia in the negotiations. Would the Taoiseach not agree that this matter is of at least equal importance to the issues of regional and fisheries policies, in the negotiations of which I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited many countries in Europe and sought and received varying degrees of support from different governments?  Why is this less important?  Why are the Government not as active as we were on issues of national importance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>The Deputy will understand that this matter can be regarded at two different levels.  I have no doubt that the general economic and financial situation of the Community will be discussed at the forthcoming Council.  Side by side with that, the Deputy is aware that the Commission are engaged in examining the entire structure of Community finances with a view to bringing forward proposals before next June.  The area in which most activity is called for on our part is in the Commission's examination of the proposals, but we will also be raising and discussing the general economic and financial situation at the forthcoming Council.</P>

      <P>The adequacy of facilities at Cork Airport is kept under continuous review by Aer Rianta and my Department so that any improvements necessary to cope with traffic growth or changes in aircraft types proposing to use the airport can be introduced in good time.  A major extension of the terminal building was completed in 1978 and a new helicopter base is at present nearing completion.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta's long-term plans for Cork Airport include provision for extension of apron, taxiway and runway facilities. The question of the timing of the implementation of these plans will depend on the development of traffic at the airport.</P>
      <P>The cost of developments to date at Cork Airport has been borne by the Exchequer and no aid has been sought from the EEC in respect of such works. The possibility of seeking aid from EEC sources can, as appropriate, be examined in consultation with the Minister for Finance in relation to particular development projects that may arise in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Simultaneously with the publication of the report of the tribunal of inquiry, the Government announced that it would give effect to the recommendations contained in the report, which the tribunal had made having regard to its findings, so far as the recommendations came within the sphere of the Government's functions. The report recognised that a number of the recommendations could be given effect to only by international action, and recommended that the Government should seek the co-operation of the appropriate international organisations in having the recommendations in question implemented.  The Government indicated that it would take the necessary steps in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subsequently wrote to the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO), which is the specialised United Nations agency responsible for safety of life at sea, and to various other international organisations concerned, requesting their assistance in the implementation of recommendations which call for international action.  The organisations in question have offered full co-operation <Col N="1271" /> in the matter and have undertaken to carry out detailed studies of the recommendations, while maintaining liaison with IMCO, so as to ensure co-ordination of effort.  Officers of my Department have discussed the question with IMCO and with the other bodies, and arrangements have been made to have the recommendations and the report discussed at the forthcoming meeting in December of IMCO's Maritime Safety Committee, which officers of my Department will attend.  IMCO have indicated how implementation of a number of the recommendations could be promoted by the various technical subcommittees.</P>
    <P>I propose to introduce shortly legislation to enable effect to be given to the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, and the 1978 protocol thereto, as well as providing for heavier fines on unsafe vessels entering Irish ports, as recommended by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recommendation concerning conditions at oil terminals, which make up the majority of the recommendations in the report, most of these are already given effect to in the Dangerous Substances (Oil Jetties) Regulations, 1979, or can readily be implemented under the powers conferred by the regulation on the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendation that tankers should be required to complete a check-list before entry into port, the EEC have already prepared a directive to this effect and a draft order implementing the directive has been sent by my Department to Brussels for clearance before making.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is examining the question of the introduction of legislation concerning the jurisdiction of fire authorities, as recommended in the report.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place between the Departments of Tourism and Transport, Labour, Environment and the Public Service about the implementation of the recommendations generally, and about special arrangements for co-ordination of activities and the monitoring of <Col N="1272" /> continuing progress in the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The recommendations have also been brought to the attention of harbour authorities, oil companies, and other oil importers, for implementation by them as appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the question appertains to what steps were being taken as far as the Department were concerned with a view to implementing <Col N="1273" /> the recommendations.  As I pointed out, there are a number of measures being taken nationally, and also internationally, to bring about a situation where the recommendations will, have full effect in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, in relation to that part of his extensive reply if, since circulating the report to the oil companies and harbour authorities, he has seen fit to inspect whether some or all of the recommendations contained in that report have actually been implemented by both the oil companies and the various harbour authorities and, if so, if he could give the approximate dates and times of when such imspections were made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give that information, except to point out that legislation dealing with Safety of Life at Sea, will be before the House in the very near future and will be comprehensive in dealing with the matters referred to.  The Department of Labour would, in effect, be the more appropriate authority for dealing with the second part of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister reads his brief fully, he will find that the legislation SOLAS will have nothing to do with the question of administration of jetties.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he proposes to establish a single State authority, namely his Department, which will have sole responsibility for licensing oil jetties throughout the country; if this single authority would be responsible for the regular inspection of all oil jetties; and if he will ensure that the maximum amount of co-ordination takes place between the various authorities having responsibility for the operations related to and in connection with the operation of oil jetties, i.e. harbour, fire brigade and planning authorities and Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whiddy Tribunal Report has recommended that a single State authority should be responsible for licensing oil jetties throughout the country, that this single authority should likewise be responsible for the regular inspection of all oil jetties, and that it should be a Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Transport are currently in consultation with other interested Departments, including the Departments of Labour and the Environment, on the question of the measures to be taken for the implementation of the various recommendations in the report <Col N="1276" /> and in particular about the recommendation about co-ordination between the various authorities involved.  I am confident that it will be possible in the near future to take specific steps for the implementation fo this recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to confine my question specifically, in view of the seeming difficulty of reply on the other side of the House.  Since the recommendations were published has any inspector from the Minister's Department been down to Dublin Port to inspect whether any or all of the recommendations circulated have been implemented and, if so, could he give the approximate dates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy in answer to the previous question, the question of inspection by and large is the responsibility of the Department of Labour under the Dangerous Substances (Oil Jetty) Regulations, 1979.  That Department have wide powers to licence and inspect oil jetties.  I understand that they are in constant consultation with the Department of Transport concerning these matters.  The interdepartmental group sitting and discussing the recommendations of that tribunal and the measures to be taken to implement these recommendations are very conscious of the matters raised by the Deputy.  The Department of Labour are the chief licensing and inspectoral authority in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it will hardly be much consolation to any potential or future victims that his Department are not responsible and that the Department of Labour are responsible for this inspection?  Arising out of his reply to Question No. 8, could he indicate to the House if he is in a position at this stage, as a result of his Department taking responsibility to circulate to harbour jetties around the country, if inspection has been made and if he knows the outcome of those inspections, whether they were made by officials of his Department or of any other Department, since they seem to be talking to <Col N="1277" /> each other in the interdepartmental meeting?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the investigation under the Railways Acts into the accident which occurred at Buttevant on 1 August 1980 is expected to be completed early in 1981. The report will be published as soon as possible after completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE have confirmed that on main lines the operation of new points awaiting connection to signal cabins is prohibited except where the use of such points may be essential in connection with installation or maintenance works.  In such circumstances the points may be operated manually subject to compliance with rules and regulations under which there would <Col N="1278" /> be a stoppage of general railway traffic over the section of line concerned during the period when the points were being used.</P>
    <P>The extent to which safety conditions of this kind were adhered to at Buttevant is, of course, one of the matters coming within the scope of the formal investigation. I have at this stage an assurance from CIE that they have taken all steps to ensure that the conditions I have specifically mentioned are fully observed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if, in view of criticisms of airport landing charges, he will publish such charges for the airports under his control with comparable estimates for a range of United States, British and continental European airports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Landing charges at Irish airports are reviewed annually by Aer Rianta in consultation with the airlines and then submitted for my approval prior to implementation.  Since Irish airports are in competition with UK and European continental airports for air traffic, especially North Atlantic transit traffic, my practice in considering proposals for increased charges at Irish airports is to take into account not only the cost considerations <Col N="1282" /> on which the proposed increases are based but also the competitive effect on Irish airports <i>vis-à-vis</i> their UK and continental competitors.  The relevance of the level of charges at foreign airports varies considerably in this context. The economic and organisational environment of US airports, for example, is different and also varies from one US airport to another, depending on ownership and other factors, so that any comparison with Irish airports is unrealistic. In the European context Irish airports are well down the league table of European airport charges.  In this connection, and with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I am circulating with the Official Report a statement elaborating on the position.</P>

    <P>The foregoing figures reflect the position at November 1979.  Since then, Irish airport charges have been increased by 11 per cent from 1 April 1980 but charges have also risen at other European airports, so that the net position of Irish airports in the table has not materially altered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport the number of private bus operators licensed by his Department charging fares (a) above, (b) equal to and (c) below the standard CIE provincial bus fares; and the average fare charged by such operators as a proportion of the standard CIE provincial bus fare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in the case of annual renewable passenger licences, it is not the practice to regulate the fares of private bus operators.</P>
      <P>Under the system of regulation which applies to holders of annual renewable licences, the operators are free to vary their charges as they wish within prescribed maxima which are higher than CIE fares.  The actual fares charged are not monitored on a basis which would enable me to give the Deputy the information sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would be in the public interest, and essential for the Minister's information, if the charges were monitored?  The Minister can hardly regard the present situation as satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheduled operators &mdash; there are about 22 bus operators providing some 71 scheduled services &mdash; operate within the maxima permitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the charges of the scheduled operators or the charges of all those who operate bus services, privately and otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>If possible I should like to know the charges of all operators but if that is too much to ask for I would be obliged to receive the information in relation to the scheduled operators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They operate within the maxima laid down which is a certain percentage <Col N="1284" /> of one penny per mile over the CIE fare.  They operate within that limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if the financial difficulties encountered by other jetfoil operators have been encountered by the B and I shipping line; and if the project is still considered a sound investment of public money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The British and Irish Steampacket Company is forecasting a loss of £2.8 million in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company, in common with other transport companies, has been affected by the general economic situation, high fuel costs and the decline in tourism.  In addition the strike at Liverpool last spring cost the company almost £1 million. The unremunerative level of rates <Col N="1287" /> and fares due to keen competition on cross-channel routes was also a contributing factor.</P>
    <P>As regards the Jetfoil, the craft was introduced on the Dublin-Liverpool route in May last, and in its initial season has had to operate in the difficult circumstances which affected transport operations generally in 1980.  Carryings have exceeded 70,000 passengers and the B and I company have told me that they expect the service to make a positive contribution once the initial development period is completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to No. 20, the operation of the Jetfoil, I should like to ask the Minister if, in view of the capital cost of this project, he or his senior Minister, has seen fit to ask for a detailed report from B and I on the operation of that service, particularly with reference to the number of accidents which put it out of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal practice for all matters concerning that service to be made available to the Department.  Any accidents, or alleged accidents, are reported in the normal course of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that it is not normal practice to introduce a new service with a new type of craft at a capital cost estimated in the region of £6 million.  I should like the Minister to be a little abnormal in this instance. Could he ask for a specific report in relation to the operation of Jetfoil in its first season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to get that information for the Deputy.  I made the point about 70,000 passengers being carried.  It is laid up now for the winter season.  It will be brought back into service in the late spring.</P>

Will the company be in a position next year with trained personnel to make sure that they do not recur?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The lifeboat service around the coasts of Ireland and Britain is provided and operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, who are an independent voluntary organisation.  In taking decisions about the service, including the establishment of new stations or the modification or withdrawal of existing stations, the institute have regard primarily to the safety needs of vessels in the area and to previous casualty statistics, as well as to feasibility and suitability of location.</P>
      <P>The institute are at present re-assessing the question of a lifeboat station on the Mayo coast and I hope to be informed of the outcome at an early date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Most definitely I would be in support of such a measure.  Indeed, I took the initiative in this regard earlier this year when I had discussions with the RNLI about the possibility of establishing a further boat on the west coast.  This is an independent body as the Deputy knows.  The Department gave a grant of £30,000 in 1980 towards its funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for me, but I should like to point out that the establishment of such a lifeboat service would cost in the region of £750,000, and it would cost in the region of £50,000 a year to maintain it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he is aware of the growing <Col N="1292" /> concern at Shannon Airport as a result of the substantial decline in traffic there during 1980; if he proposes to initiate any new plans to generate additional traffic in 1981; and if he will make a statement outlining the future prospects for this airport in relation to aviation, tourism and ancillary activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of, and indeed share, the concern at the decline in traffic at Shannon Airport this year.  This decline is largely the result of a sharp reduction in 1980 in transit traffic which has shown a downward trend since 1977. I am hopeful that this trend will be reversed next year and that we can expect a modest growth in both transit and total traffic at Shannon.  Aer Rianta and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company with primary responsibility in this area will of course vigorously pursue all opportunities to increase traffic to and through the airport.  They will be supported in their activities by the efforts of Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte to attract tourists to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government are fully committed to the continued development of Shannon as Ireland's sole trans-Atlantic gateway, and with the efforts of the specialised agencies I have no doubt that traffic at Shannon will shortly resume a pattern of growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

For example, what is the position regarding the proposed aviation training school?  What is the position regarding the proposal for an aviation engineering complex there?  What is the position regarding other proposals which were put to the Minister over the past 12 months by many groups and by me?  Could he be specific about the aviation college and the aviation engineering complex at Shannon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable activity by SFADCo and Aer Rianta at Shannon. <Col N="1293" /> Specifically, so far as Aer Rianta are concerned the development of the Soviet fuel farm is going ahead and is quite successful with about 175 transits this year and it is hoped to have that increased to about 500 next year.  It might be possible to have that facility extended to other eastern bloc operators.  That would be of enormous benefit to the Shannon area.  It is hoped that the US customs pre-clearance arrangement which is the subject of considerable negotiations at this time may be finalised.  That would be of enormous benefit to Shannon.  Hopefully it will be possible to bring that forward in the not too distant future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

From the information at present available, however, it is estimated that the interest element of the gross loan charges payable by local authorities to service their capital indebtedness in 1979 was of the order of £99 million.  Portion of this sum would be met from the Exchequer through subsidies towards loan charges and portion of it from other receipts such as repayments of house purchase loans.  The balance which would fall to be met directly from local rates is estimated to be the equivalent of the produce of a rate of about 73p in the £ on a national basis but about 60 per cent of this would be met by the Exchequer through the operation of such grants as the agricultural grant and the grant in relief of rates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 30, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the incidents in question and I have received details of the investigations carried out and the remedial action taken to mitigate the effects of the pollution.</P>
      <P>The pollution which affected the Gradogue and Funcheon Rivers occurred on 10 June 1980 when liquid waste disposed of into a ditch near Mitchelstown County Cork subsequently reached both rivers with major consequential destruction of fish life and other aquatic species in the river.  No public water supply sources were affected.  Local authority investigations revealed that the material discharged was highly toxic with a high acidic reaction.  The source of the liquid waste was traced to a firm in the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30 July 1980 the local authority <Col N="1298" /> obtained by consent a High Court Injunction prohibiting the agents of the firm disposing of the waste and also the waste disposal firm employed by them from discharging polluting matter into waters contrary to the provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána have also conducted their own investigations into the case.  I understand that these investigations have now been completed and that they have submitted the matter to the law officers for a decision as to whether criminal proceedings should be instituted.</P>
    <P>The more recent incident involving the river Shannon occurred on 12 October following the fracture of a joint in a pipe carrying slurry from mining operations to an adjacent tailings pond.  The mine management notified Tipperary (NR) County Council in whose functional area the incident occurred and the local authority in turn alerted other local authorities concerned. Two public water supply intakes downstream of the spillage were turned off and were not brought into use again until monitoring showed that it was safe to do so.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that there should be public concern at any threat of contamination of public water supplies.  I would point out, however, that local authorities have wide ranging powers under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, including in particular the power to take urgent measures to mitigate or remedy the effects of any polluting discharge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's detailed reply.  In relation to the first part of Question No. 30 and in relation to the waste disposal company, in view of the fact that the source of this pollution was carried by that company from a company in the midlands to the Gradogue river, could the Minister's Department get a list from the company of all the toxic wastes which they are contracted to dispose of and the location where they are disposing of these wastes?  Since this question was put down, has the Minister heard from the law officers in the relevant local authority if they have decided to initiate <Col N="1299" /> proceedings against the company in addition to the High Court action to which the Minister referred?</P>

      <P>In the case of the Gradogue and Funcheon rivers, it was a highly toxic spent chromic acid which destroyed the fish life in a stretch of about eight miles of river and resulted in 40,000 fish killings.  As far as the Shannon is concerned the pollution arose following the fracture of a joint in a pipe carrying slurry from mining operations to an adjacent tailings pond.  In relation to the damage to human life, I cannot give an answer but I assume that it would not do one a whole lot of good if one had highly toxic spent chromic acid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Tully suggested in their contributions that the present mortgage rate should be subsidised by the Government.  Let me remind the House how the subsidy which this Bill provides for came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from a proposal by the Irish Building Societies Association in April this year to recommend to their members an immediate increase in their mortgage and interest rates, the Government decided, on foot of a report by a working group set up to examine the matter, to subsidise the interest rates by 1.75 per cent.  The circumstances obtaining at the time were that inflows to societies were at such a low level that the Government accepted that there was justification for an immediate increase in the investment <Col N="1369" /> rate to enable societies to retain even their existing funds, not to mention attract new funds.</P>
    <P>The Government's action had the effect of pegging the mortgage interest rate at 14.5 per cent.  Without a subsidy all mortgagees would have had to pay 16.5 per cent.  Subsequent reductions in interest rates generally and a substantial increase in the inflow to societies in the months July to September made it possible for the subsidy to be terminated with effect from 1 October.  The high rate of inflow has continued throughout October and the early part of this month.  The Deputies are now suggesting that the mortgage interest rate should be reduced by way of a further subsidy.  I agree that the rate should be reduced but I do not agree that that should be brought about by an injection of public money into societies.  The circumstances applying now are quite different from those which applied when the subsidy was introduced as is evidenced by the very high inflow of funds to societies in recent months and the continued general downward trend in the interest rates of other investment agencies.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that I have urged strongly on societies to effect a reduction without delay in their mortgage interest rates, in view of the present healthy state of their net inflows and in view of the discrepancy between their present interest rates and those of other financial institutions. In these circumstances it makes little sense to talk of a further Government subsidy.  The societies' representatives for their part have undertaken to consider these points at their next council meeting in early December and to inform me without delay of the outcome.  Societies have been made aware that the Government will have to give serious consideration to failure on their part to respond in a positive manner to the Government's request for a reduction in their interest rates.  I was interested to hear a representative of the societies' association on the radio on Sunday indicating that they would respond to the Government's initiative in this matter at an early date.  I hope that it will be an early date.</P>
    <Col N="1370" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It is the desire and ambition of all of us to see the mortgage interest rate brought down.  We are not in dispute with the Minister about that.  That is common case and I wish the Minister luck in his negotiations and trust that they will end in a reduction of interest rates.</P>
      <P>However, I share with him also the view that the present rate of interest, 14.15 per cent which is a record, is too high.  I was taking this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that if it is not possible to persuade the building societies and if the building societies can convince him that the result of a reduction in the mortgage interest rate would be a reduction in the deposit rate with a reduction in the inflow of deposits, then the Minister should subsidise.  That is the case we make and it is clear.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the month of October something like £18,330 million was invested as compared with £18,215 million in September and £17.289 million in August in what are known as the big five.  It is not my business here to make a case for the building societies and I am not doing that.  I am sure that they are well able to look after themselves; they are professional people at this sort of business and if they reduce their interest I will be happy.  If they can convince the Minister that the end result of a reduction of the lending rate would be a reduction in the deposit rate, a reduction in deposits and a falling off in the amount available for house building, then the Minister should bring about a reduction by a subsidy. That is all I have to say on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Fitzpatrick has said makes a lot of sense.  Not alone is the interest rate being charged by the building societies the highest ever, it is an appallingly high rate.  I do not want the Minister by waving a big stick &mdash; which could turn out to be a very small switch &mdash; to try to enforce a reduction.  The authority which the Government have over the building societies, apart from doing something about the question of income tax, is not very much.  I would hate to see action taken for the purpose of getting publicity and giving the impression <Col N="1371" /> that the Government are doing something.  The result would be that very much less would be available for house-building.</P>
      <P>Despite the Minister's statement to the effect that the house-building industry is in a tremendous position and doing very well and there would be record house-building this year.  I was informed by the CIF only 10 minutes ago that that is not so.  They believe, as I do, that every assistance that can be given must be given to the house-building industry.  I am glad that the banks did as I suggested here on the Second Reading of this Bill. Obviously the Minister has prodded them into coming up with an extra £20 million. I am glad that the Minister apparently has taken the hint and has got at least that much done, and there are other sources from which he can get money.</P>
      <P>As far as the building societies are concerned, with the present cost of building a house and, therefore, the present high cost of borrowing for the purpose of building a house, the number of loans being given are not nearly as much as would be required to keep the building industry and the supply of houses in a healthy state.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, it is not purpose to try to make a case for the building societies but there is an onus on us to ensure that they do not, as a result of some action mistakenly taken and by being able to say, as they have done previously, that they are closing their books, that there will be no loans available for a period or that they require a person to have £1,000 on deposit for a year or two before giving a loan.  Some people &mdash; not only the Minister's party &mdash; seem to imagine that the building societies are financed by wealthy people &mdash; but it is my experience and belief that they are mainly financed by small savers, people who put in a small amount of money and leave it there because it is handy as much as anything else.  For that reason we should be very careful about how we handle building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government made a mistake in removing the subsides so quickly. I know they are very short of money and <Col N="1372" /> saving the subsidy on interest was one way of economising but I doubt if it was a wise decision.  If the Minister has the figures available now for the actual number of loans issued this year month by month as compared with last year I should like him to let me have them.  If he has not the figures now perhaps he could let me know later.  That would make a very interesting comparison.  We have heard of the increase up to now in money invested in building societies but traditionally from now until about February the movement is the other way. People seem to consider that around Christmas the money should be taken out of building societies and the net inflow is likely to drop considerably.  For God's sake, let us not create the situation where the relatively small amount of money going to house building will be cut again.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading I mentioned &mdash; I do not know if anything has been done about it &mdash; that I would like the Minister to let me have his views on this: I consider that if the building societies are not competing with each other for money it is wrong that they should spend so much money, not so much on advertising although some of them are spending a lot more than they should on advertising, but in subsidising certain sporting events in a big way.  That is very galling to the person paying 14.15 per cent on a building society loan.  The societies have not been given money to give it away and that in effect is what is being done.  They are supposed to be non-profit making and to be there for the purpose of assisting people to build houses and in no way should they be entitled to do this other sort of thing.  All of us are interested in seeing a flow of money for house building. Local authority houses are not being built; SDA loans are not available.  They have been promised but the money has not been forthcoming and I suppose that at most about 50 per cent of the money required by local authorities has been made available in the case of any that I know of.  In case the Minister is doubtful about the number of local authority houses being built this year, most authorities are down to less then 100 and God knows what will happen next year.</P>

It would be foolish and stupid if in this House we were confined to talking about something in a watertight compartment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not giving me very much latitude now if you want to rule out <Col N="1374" /> my comparison with the situation when there was adequate money available under other headings for house building. If you are ruling that it is wrong for me to compare a situation now when that money is not available with the situation existing when the money was available, I think your ruling is unfair.  However the facts are that the building societies are now charging 14.15 per cent interest.  I consider that excessive.  It would not be so high if the Government had not taken away the subsidy which they were giving until October.  If that had continued the present rate could be reduced by that amount.  The Minister should be satisfied that whatever he does about the interest rate, if he is persuading the societies to reduce it themselves, should not be done in such a way as to affect the amount of money available for building houses over a two-year period.</P>
      <P>The cost of building the ordinary three-bedroom house, as the Minister knows, has increased from about £13,000 to approximately £27,000.  That means that people borrowing money must borrow very much more &mdash; if they can get it &mdash; than they would borrow two or three years ago.  To compare the amount of money now going into the societies with the amount being taken in two or three years ago does not give the whole picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me the number of loans issued?  I think that is the whole question.  I would be very glad to see the interest rate being charged to borrowers substantially reduced but I would be very careful about considering whether such a reduction would affect the amount of money available to lend to borrowers. There are two types of people, those who want loans and those who have loans. Those who want loans, particularly those who have to go to a bank for bridging money do not know the facts always and think if they can get money and build a house that is all that matters with the result that their outlook is entirely different from that of a person living in a house and who has a building society loan and is unable to repay it with interest. Very little can be done about this but it is our desire and, I am sure, the Minister's, to try to keep the rate of interest to <Col N="1375" /> borrowers as low as possible.  If it cannot be done by the building societies then the onus is back on the Government; they must do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points I wish to bring to the Minister's notice regarding loans and building societies.  First, there is the question of paying out portion of the loan by instalments. The majority of building societies absolutely insist on paying the loans only when the person goes to reside in the House.  I should like the Minister to comment on the suggestion that building societies should be forced by legislation to pay out portion of the loan after a certain part of the work has been completed because people are being forced to go to the banks for bridging loans which are very costly.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is bringing in matters that are not relevant to the section; it deals only with the question of a subsidy in respect of interest on loans.  The section is only authorising the Minister to pay this subsidy in certain circumstances.  We cannot go into the whole area of the administration of these subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are paying subsidies, should the Minister not have some control as to how the building societies operate in respect of loans?  Another matter that concerns me relates to the privileged position of the building societies compared with the other money-lending agencies.  We must give the Minister credit for requesting the societies to reduce their interest rates but so far there has been a more or less negative response to his request.  The societies are talking in terms of a possible reduction of 1 per cent but such a reduction would still leave them in a privileged position.  The Minister has referred to the possibility of bringing in certain legislation.  He would be correct in doing that and I should like to hear of his plans in this regard and what would be the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other money lenders.</P>

      <P>In the first ten months of 1980 also building societies made available 13,555 loans to the value of £215 million compared with 12,511 loans valued at £167 million last year.  Since the Deputy raised the question of SDA loans, a question which I appreciate is hardly relevant to the Bill, I would remind him that in the first nine months of 1980 local authorities made available 5,493 house purchase loans amounting to a total of £57.22 million as against 4,193 loans valued at £29.76 million in the first nine months of 1979.</P>

      <P>That is not so.  The figures show an increase.  The same situation applies in the case of the building societies.  They made available 13,555 loans valued at £215 million compared with 12,511 loans last year.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful of succeeding within a matter of weeks in relation to what I am attempting to do in respect of the building societies.  I am basing my optimism on the statement from the spokesman for the societies to the effect that both deposit and mortgage rates will be reduced.  I look forward to developments in that area.  However, there appears to be some conflict in the minds of Deputies opposite on this whole question.  They seem to be telling me that, instead of asking the building societies to reduce their interest rates, the Government should subsidise them.  This is at a time when every other investment agency are reducing their rates.  But, having said that, I share the concern of the Deputies in that the inflows to the societies should not be damaged.  There is a conflict in this area and the Government are of the opinion, an opinion based on the best advice available to us, that the inflow situation should not be damaged by reason of the suggested cuts in interest rates.  The relationship in interest rates as between the societies and the other investment agencies has been distorted in favour of the societies in respect of interest rates on deposits.  I am attempting to have that relationship restored to its normal level.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy raised the question of phased payments.  I discussed that matter with the societies and it is being considered. While I accept much of what the Deputy has said in this regard there are problems involved for the building societies in terms of legal and other difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 2 is drafted specifically to enable the Minister to regulate if necessary the inflow of money to the building societies.  I use the word &ldquo;regulate&rdquo; because by way of subsidy the Minister can either reduce or increase the deposit rates and that would have the effect of regulating the inflow of money and, in <Col N="1378" /> turn, the amount of money that will be available both for building houses and for buying houses that have been completed.</P>
      <P>There has never been such a necessity as there is now for the societies to have a liberal amount of money available to lend because, as Deputy Tully has said, since 1976-77 the price of the average house has doubled &mdash; from about £13,000 to about £26,000.  These are not my figures. They are the figures supplied to me every three months with the compliments of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Obviously, there is a shortage of finance in the housing sphere.  One need only drive through the country to realise that this is the case.  Large numbers of new houses have been on the market for some time.  Within a mile of where I live ten houses have been completed and there has been a for-sale sign on them for the past six months.  These are not houses in the upper income market.  They are modest type houses.  Within a few hundred yards of where I live there have been a couple of houses on the market for several months.  In a situation in which there was an adequate amount of finance available at reasonable rates of interest, houses such as those would not remain unsold for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the question of SDA loans might not come directly within this section, it comes within the argument that because money for these loans is not available one is told by county councils that they will pay the loans when the Minister gives them the money.  There was a time when they were reluctant to say that but now we have got to the stage that they say they will pay the loans when they receive their allocation.  That being the situation, it is important that we have an adequate supply of finance available to the building societies.  They believe it will take an additional £50 million to finance the same number of houses in 1981 as they financed in 1980; in other words, they expect to lend about £250 million in 1980 and they calculate it will take £300 million to finance the same number of houses in 1981.  Given that situation, we should not do anything that might slow down the amount of money the public will invest in building societies. <Col N="1379" /> I do not believe the building societies should have a bonanza or that they should make too large a profit.  Friendly societies are not supposed to operate on a profit basis.  I am wholeheartedly with the Minister in getting down the interest rates one way or another.  Certainly the building societies should not charge more than is necessary to enable them to operate and to attract deposits.</P>
    <P>It should be stated that the interest rate can be regulated in more ways than one. For example, some building societies only charge interest on a loan from the date the loan is released to the borrower or his agent but other societies charge interest from the date they write the cheque. However, because of title difficulties or delay in completing a house that cheque may not be released for several months afterwards and the building society concerned uses the money represented by that cheque and, at the same time, gets interest on it.  That is not fair. There is no use in representatives of such a building society saying they must have money ready to be drawn.  Surely they can have an arrangement with their own solicitor that he will notify them when the cheque is released and then they can make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>There have been quite understandable complaints that borrowers are compelled to pay the costs of two solicitors &mdash; their own costs of purchasing the house and the costs of the building society solicitor. With commonsense and an arrangement between the building societies and the Incorporated Law Society, I believe one solicitor could be used to clear the title for the purchaser and to issue a certificate of title acceptable to the building society. I agree it is not all plain sailing.  There may be obstacles to be negotiated but it is high time that some arrangement was made in order to save time and money.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasted that more houses were completed in the first ten months of this year as compared with last year.  I should like him to tell us the position regarding new house starts in the local authority sector and in the private sector.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I agree with the Chair that the subsidy should be provided if it is considered necessary.  I am arguing it is necessary. I am saying that this year new starts have fallen dramatically and that some <Col N="1381" /> new houses cannot be sold, whether they be small schemes of houses or individual houses.  I am saying the Minister should be careful.  Like him, I was glad to hear Mr. Malone on the radio last Sunday state that there was some scope for reconsidering the matter.  However, my information is that the increase in deposits for the past three months has been negligible. Perhaps the Minister will give the House figures in respect of this matter. My information is that the figure was £17 million in September, with a subsequent increase of approximately £1 million.  I appeal to the Minister to make sure he does nothing to slow down housing finance.  There is also the necessity for a reduction in the cost of money.  It was stated in the housing section of the manifesto that it would be made easier and cheaper to get houses.  I know that that is one of the things which the Minister is trying to do here but, in doing that, let him be certain that he does not slow up investment in building societies and, as a result, also slow up the building of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>All sides of the House must agree on three things, the first being that the interest rates are too high.  That brings us to the section to which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has referred so often, the right to subsidise interest rates.  We are agreed, if the occasion arises, on having interest rates subsidised.  One should not have to do it semi-illegally for a while and eventually get legislation passed in this House.  We are not in agreement on whether or not at present the interest rates should be subsidised.  The Minister seems to be living in cloud cuckoo land. If he thinks that the building industry is flying, that there are plenty of houses and that there is plenty of money to buy them, then his argument that there is no necessity for subsidising the building industry is correct up to a point.  But I definitely claim that that is not so.  I claim that there is a grave shortage of housing finance.  I am not in the position I was in some years ago and I am not sure whether or not a reduction in the interest rates would result in a drop in the net inflow of building society finance.  The Minister should <Col N="1382" /> be in a position to know, but he has not convinced me that he is sure that this is the position.  He has given me figures about loans.  I have asked him for the figures and I am grateful to him for giving these figures, but they refer to houses which were started 12 months or two years ago and which have been completed this year.</P>
      <P>What I am interested in &mdash; and this is a point which Deputy Fitzpatrick touched on &mdash; is that people applying now for loans, and to whom the interest rate will apply from the time they apply, are talking about building houses and they are the people who are interested in what is being started now and being built now. The difficulty we are all in is that we do not know whether or not the building societies will have enough money to keep giving out loans.  They have given a certain number of loans but will they be in a position to keep this up?  The outrageous thing is that the cost of housing has increased so much and of course the size of the loan affects what people have to pay out by way of interest.  Here we have the vicious circle.  Very often the person starts off with starry eyes, picks his or her house, gets the loan and then finds, with dismay, what the interest rate on that loan will be.  I have come across some people recently who are hurriedly trying to arrange for somebody else to take the house off their hands.  They are tied up in a legal knot because of the building society loan involved.  If they go through with it, it will take ever so long.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether one solicitor should handle those cases, I would be opposed to that.  I know that it costs more to have the solicitor looking after one client, but I have seen too many cases where a solicitor who was dealing with a case for his client and the client who comes in subsequently is a client in a different way and may eventually finish up, even though everything appears to be legal and above board, not getting what he is paying for.  I am sorry to say that, but it appears to be so.  In a recent case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to develop it.  As it has been brought up, it is fair to make a comment on it.  This is all I propose to say on that subject.  Good luck to the Minister if he can get the building societies' mortgage rates down.  Those who are paying mortgages very much need a little assistance.  The building societies may persuade him that to do that will leave them very short of money and that their other incomes are not sufficient. Possibly, a tightening up on the spending of money by building societies on other than house building might put just a little more money in.  Whether in Government or in Opposition, I am interested to get houses built for those who need them.  If the Minister finds that there is no way to continue the inflow of funds necessary to have the number of houses required, then the State must begin to look at the whole question of subsidies. For that reason, I support this section of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer some of the points made.  The situation is that the Government are looking to the societies this year to provide £250 million for loans for house purchase.  In fact, the societies will have over £325 million available for loans in 1980.  This must answer the case made by both Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Tully that in some way, with the action which I have been taking with regard to the interest rate and particularly the mortgage situation, this will cause damage to the inflows into the societies.  These figures speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that there has been a shortage of house loan finance.  Again to give some figures, 20,207 loans were paid in the nine months to 30 September, amounting to £275 million, by all lending agencies.  The figure for the same period last year was 17,087 loans, totalling £198 million.  I am constrained again, regretfully, to refer to SDA loan situation, but it is necessary <Col N="1384" /> for the record to correct the misrepresentation by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  This year the Government provided £58.75 million for SDA loans and, as part of their input to the national understanding the Government have increased this to £65.75 million.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It transpired during the course of the debate on this section on the last occasion that it is proposed to operate the Bill through a map referred to in the definition section and other sections.  It also transpired that the map had not been circulated with the Bill, that it was tucked away in the Valuation Office or the Ordnance Survey Office but was not available to Members.  I pointed out that the Bill without the map was meaningless.  The Minister then produced a map which was available to him but not to any other Member.  I thanked the Minister for that gesture but pointed out that the map should be circulated to each Member. The Minister told me that he had no intention of circulating the map to each Member but would give the map to those he considered interested in the Bill. Apparently, he had decided that only Members representing the constituency of Wexford had any interest in the Bill and, consequently, a right to a copy of the map.  He picked me out for VIP treatment and sent me a copy of the map.  He also sent a copy to his three colleagues in the Wexford constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to record in a serious way my view that this is no way to treat this <Col N="1387" /> House.  The Minister of State, or any Minister, in charge of a Bill does not have a right to decide who is or is not interested in a Bill.  The Minister must take it that every Member is interested in what is taking place in the House.  If Members are not they are guilty of a dereliction of their duty.  I am moving that Committee Stage be adjourned until such time as the map is circulated to all Members.  I ask the Chair to rule accordingly.  Without the map the Bill is meaningless and unintelligible. Members cannot consider it in a sensible, reasonable or rational way without the map.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Chair is the costodian and guardian of procedure in this House.  If Members of the House are to be deprived of this map today, how do we know that next week or the week after we will not be taking the Second Stage of a Bill without the Bill having been circulated?  How do we know that on another day the Committee Stage of an 80 or 90 section Bill will not be taken without Deputies having the Bill before them?  If I point out to the Chair on the Second Stage of a Bill that Members of the House have not got the Bill, the Chair is bound to <Col N="1388" /> take note of that and protect Members of the House.  This is no joke.  In all seriousness, without the map this Bill is meaningless.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9 of the Act of 1959, section 14 (3) of the Agriculture (An Foras Talúntais) Act, 1958, shall apply to&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is the reference to the map.  With the best will in the world I could not discuss this Bill without that map.  If all Members of the House got the Bill without the map, they might as well have torn it up and thrown it into the waste paper basket.</P>

      <P>In relation to the football pitch for the St. Martin's Club the Minister has stated that it is a matter between An Foras Talúntais and the St. Martin's Football Club.  Having a certain amount of experience in dealing with facilities such as football pitches I feel it is only right that we should recommend to An Foras Talúntais that they sell this to St. Martin's because for development purposes it is essential that the club have proper ownership. What will the Minister recommend here?  This is marked on the map as a portion for St. Martin's Club but how it will be disposed of is not specified.</P>

      <P>By way of explanation, the inclusion in section 2 of a general power in future to make a lease to the State &mdash; for example, in the case of a request for a site like that for the meteorological office referred to earlier &mdash; is to avoid the need for similar legislation at a later date.  At the same time the power is sufficiently narrow to ensure that there is no danger of the wholesale erosion of the estate as a single entity.  Such a development would, of course, be at variance with the spirit of the donation and acceptance of the lands as a free gift to the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 35 and 36 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Minister may, notwithstanding the said section 9 of the Act of 1959 and after consultation with the Institute, prescribe by order that section 14(3) of the Agriculture (An Foras Talúntais) Act, 1958, shall apply to such part or parts of the Estate as are not referred to in subsection (1)(a) of this section.</P>
      <P>(3)  Every Order made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the Order is laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason that I have brought in this amendment is to give the Minister the necessary powers to enable the Agricultural Institute to sell portion of this estate either to the county council or to the State itself.  In 1970 Wexford County Council made application to An Foras Talúntais for a portion of land for house construction within the Murrinstown area.  We found that this was physically impossible without the introduction of this Bill.  Three Ministers for Agriculture have been through this House since then and each Minister promised to Wexford County Council the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as presented to this House seems very simple.  Nevertheless, it has <Col N="1404" /> taken approximately eight years to get it brought before the House.  We have heard the arguments for the Bill and we have seen a number of problems attached to it particularly in relation to the map. As far as this Bill is concerned it is really only the areas which are marked on the map that the Minister has any control over.  I believe that the question of Johnstown Castle is now the responsibility of the State.  In plain language it is the responsibility of An Foras Talúntais.  Its development is important to the State and I believe that it would make an excellent agricultural college.  In view of the impossible position in which we find ourselves looking for suitable premises for agricultural education, the State sooner or later will turn to its own resources and one of the best resources it has and one of the best areas of information is Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>I would not like to give the impression that I want to deface Johnstown Castle in any way, because it is a beautiful castle. However, there is land in the possession of an Foras Talúntais within a six-mile radius of Johnstown Castle.  The Department of Agriculture are and should be in a position to build an agricultural college on those lands.  Through the county committee of agriculture we have offered several properties which we thought were suitable and each property has been turned down time and time again by the Department of Agriculture on the grounds that it is not suitable.  Still they have in their own possession an area of 1,000 acres of land which is used solely for research.  I have always thought that research and education should go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>If we have to spend another nine years before we can secure a Bill for the sale of any portion of Johnstown Castle it can be seen that we are wasting time.  I move the amendment just to make the operation simpler but nonetheless to secure the preservation of the property.  As stated in the amendment An Foras Talúntais will have the right to apply to the Minister for the sale of a certain portion of the estate but at the same time the order before being put into operation would have to be laid before both Houses of the <Col N="1405" /> Oireachtas.  This safety measure is absolutely essential.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment in the interests of Johnstown Castle and the resources available there.</P>

      <P>In support of Deputy D'Arcy we should always bear in mind, particularly those from the constituency, the desirability of establishing an agricultural college on the estate.  There is sufficient space there to accommodate it.  I gather from Deputy D'Arcy, although it is not in the amendment, that the Minister should have power by order to permit the sale to the county council.  I would agree fully with that and I presume that any Minister for Agriculture would break up the estate.  It is a very laborious and, as we see, time-consuming process to make any changes in regard to selling or leasing by means of an Act of Parliament. I do not think the Minister would be offending against the conditions laid down by the donor if this amendment is accepted.  I think the Minister and An Foras Talúntais would find more flexibility in disposing of or leasing land.  Above all, although it is not within the ambit of this Bill we should bear in mind the possibility &mdash; we hope probability &mdash; of the establishment of an agricultural college at Johnstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason for the delay in getting the Bill to the House was the delay in getting the parties to submit the necessary maps so that this matter could be finalised, the areas of land that have to be marked off for road widening and so on.  Deputy D'Arcy knows that Wexford County Council changed their minds a few times regarding where the road should go.  Secondly, although it was not a great delay, there was the delay of getting the consent of the donor to dispose of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy's amendment cannot be accepted for a number of reasons. First, Johnstown Castle estate was donated as a free gift to the nation in 1944 and acceptance was ratified by the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act, 1945.  The Donor's main object in <Col N="1406" /> making the gift to the State was to ensure that it would remain a single entity and not suffer the fate of many similar estates in Ireland.  We all know what happened in the case of many of these estates which were sold off and are now forgotten.  This was the main reason for the making of the gift to the State and the State subsequently had to give certain guarantees regarding the future of the estate.</P>
    <P>It was a condition of the gift that the estate to be known as Johnstown Castle Agricultural College would be used exclusively for the purpose of a lay agricultural college and for no other purpose whatever.  The college was subsequently transferred to An Foras Talúntais under the terms of the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act, 1959, again on condition that it would be used as a lay agricultural college including agricultural research and for no other purpose.  Also, in keeping with the spirit and conditions of the gift, the 1959 Act precluded the Agricultural Institute from selling or leasing any part of the estate. It would be clearly contrary to the spirit of the gift and its acceptance now to make provision for the disposal of further parts of the estate.  The proposed amendment would in effect repeal section 9 of the 1959 Act which deliberately precludes this.  In addition sporting and other rights on the estate were reserved by the donor, his heirs and assigns for ever as a personal right under the conditions of the gift. During the preparation of the Bill the Attorney General whose advice was sought gave his opinion that as regards the sale of parts of the estate to Wexford County Council the donor's consent was necessary as some restriction of the sporting rights might be involved through the change in usage of the land in question.</P>
    <P>The donor subsequently gave his consent to the disposal of the lands but made it quite clear that no further land should be sold in future.  This effectively precludes the disposal of any further part of the estate.  I should add that An Foras Talúntais are satisfied with the provisions of the present Bill.  Finally, may I draw the Deputy's attention to the inscription on the deposited map in section 1.  This map is endorsed as follows: &ldquo;Deposited <Col N="1407" /> for the purposes of any Act of the Oireachtas passed in the year 1980...&rdquo; If this Bill is not passed before the end of this year a new Bill will have to be initiated thus causing further delays in the whole matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion when we discussed this Bill I had made a number of observations to which I hope the Minister will give some consideration. Perhaps he has had an opportunity to do so by now.  I was just about to come to one of the important points raised in the discussion on this Bill.  It relates to the question of what up to some years ago was a particular provocation and which more recently has been somewhat ameliorated but is still causing concern to many women's organisations and to many fair thinking men and women, the question of the composition of juries in these cases.</P>
      <P>The proposition has been made that there should be a minimum number of women on juries and the Minister has discounted that possibility.  I would agree with him that as baldly presented it is not the best way of tackling this problem. Nevertheless, there is an area of concern here and I do not think we can just pretend that everything is satisfactory.  It is assumed now that jury selection is at random.  Logically, it would follow that on average there should be a reasonable proportion of women, probably 50 per cent, roughly representing the population pattern.  That does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since our last discussion I saw a case in County Sligo recently in which the jury was totally male.  Unless some filtering process is taking place, the likelihood of this is extremely improbable and should not be occurring.  The problem stems <Col N="1408" /> from the fact that objections are lodged to would-be jurors on the basis of their sex, though that is not stated, in the context of what are known as peremptory objections to jurors.  I am asking the Minister to consider some way of circumventing this problem because it is obviously both unjust and unfair that a jury in any case but particularly in a case concerning the most serious and essentially repugnant violation of the rights of a woman, should be composed of people of one sex only.</P>
    <P>The question is one of trying to overcome the problem.  The Minister might consider some way of ensuring that any process whereby a would-be juror is in the position of being objected to on the grounds of sex, is excluded by law or else, that the reasons for the objection are spelled out.  But even that would not guarantee a total degree of satisfaction in this respect because it would not exclude the possibility of someone saying, for instance, &ldquo;I do not think that person would be a good juror in this case because she is from the same county as one of the people involved&rdquo;, when what the objector is saying is that a woman is not wanted on the jury.  This sort of thinking is most unjust and unfair to women.  It implies that in some way they would be more hostile, more prejudicial and, therefore, less just to the defendant than a male juror would be in the sort of case we are discussing.</P>
    <P>On 17 April last I asked a question of the Minister regarding the composition of juries.  I was prompted to ask the question because one hears now and again the suggestion that there is a whiff of jury vetting about the process of selecting juries. Loath as we are to believe that there is any such process, the figures and the statistics seem to indicate that everything is not satisfactory in this respect.  As reported at column 1566 of the Official Report for the day in question, the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>The selection of juries is provided for in the Juries Act, 1976 (No. 4 of 1976) and is carried out by the county registrars. The Act provides that each county shall be a jury district but that <Col N="1409" /> the Minister may by order divide a county into two or more jury districts or limit a jury district to a part or parts of a county.  The Jury Districts Order, 1976 (S.I. No. 57 of 1976), as amended by the Jury Districts Order, 1977 (S.I. No. 59 of 1977), makes provision for districts on this basis in some counties.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph was the kernel of the Minister's reply.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The procedure for the selection of juries is set out in a manual dated February 1976 which, as I indicated in my reply to parliamentary question No. 444 of 18 October 1979, is available in the Oireachtas library.  The only records are those kept by the county registrars.</P>
    <P>I had asked if there were in operation any socio-economic exclusion clause.  I asked this because it appeared that people from some areas of some cities had never been members of a jury though very often they were the people in the defendant's box. The Minister's reply continued:</P>
    <P>Since the system is designed expressly to ensure the random selection of jurors, an assessment of the kind mentioned could not be expected to reveal any local variations in the composition of juries other than those that must inevitably arise from such factors as the proportion of rural to town dwellers which can vary from jury district to jury district.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister is equivocal about this.  When he says that an assessment of the kind mentioned could not be expected to reveal any local variation or, I presume, any other variation, he is saying that there has not taken place any such analysis of the composition of juries which would ensure that justice is being done and that not any category of people, for instance, local authority tenants or women, are being excluded from jury service.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here, particularly in the context of trials pertaining to rape cases.  I would suggest, though my suggestion may evoke some protestations from the legal profession, that the situation  <Col N="1410" /> whereby the current practice of someone being able to lodge an objection to a would-be juror on the basis solely of that would-be juror being a woman, should be outlawed.  I do not know how this could be done but it is not my responsibility to concern myself with that part of the problem.  Obviously, one way of making greater progress in that area would be to insist that wherever a would-be juror is objected to, the reason should be given either publicly or, in the event of the possibility of embarrassing or offending the person concerned, to the judge in private.</P>
    <P>In passing I should like to draw attention to the great debt of gratitude we owe to the many people who are called day after day for jury service and who render this service at great inconvenience to themselves.  They are prepared to suffer this inconvenience in the interest of the State.  Therefore, it is very infortunate when people are objected to and are ruled out merely because, as in the case we are talking of, they are women.  On the other hand, it would be extremely wrong to reverse the process of discrimination and to include people on the jury merely because they were men or because they were women as the case may be.  Not only would that be unjust and difficult to operate but it would lead to a series of requests from various interested groups to be involved as jurors in various cases.</P>
    <P>Because the situation in relation to juries is not dealt with adequately in the Bill, I urge the Minister to consider if further.  The position I have outlined represents a glaring omission in view of the sort of situation which occurs now and then whereby, despite the law and despite our understanding that random selection is the process that prevails, all-male juries still operate.  That can only happen as a result of the law being either circumvented or abused.  The Minister should investigate the situation urgently with a view to bringing in any necessary amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that in future juries in the type of case we are talking of will not be either chosen or rejected on part on the basis of their sex.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> There is the question also of medical examinations in rape cases.  For a variety of reasons the unfortunate alleged victim in an alleged rape case needs immediate medical attention in order to ensure that the level of trauma may subside as rapidly as possible.  It has been represented to me in this regard that the facilities for such medical attention are not readily available.  The proposal has been put forward that the appropriate medical attention should be available at Garda stations. I have qualms about that, having had the opportunity of commiserating with some gardaí on the conditions in which they work.  I cannot imagine any place less suitable for the storing of the necessary treatment equipment for rape cases than some of the Garda stations that I have visited.  At the same time there is the problem that a doctor called to examine a patient may not have the necessary equipment for treatment.  Perhaps some sort of compromise might be reached whereby the necessary facilities would be made available at least within specific regions and within a radius of so many miles so that there would not be delays of days or even of weeks in providing the necessary treatment and so that the victim would not have to travel some distance to receive treatment.</P>
    <P>There have been comments also about the necessity for improvements in police regulations and training in respect of rape cases.  These comments are not fundamentally germane to the Bill, but whether they should be is another question.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that, despite the best efforts of the gardaí and the banghardaí involved in handling such cases, there may be deficiencies in this respect. That is something that should be considered and, if there is any evidence to suggest so, the necessary remedial practices should be introduced.  For example, the police investigation should be carried out by a ban-gharda &mdash; unless the woman involved wishes otherwise &mdash; especially with regard to taking a statement.  Clearly that is a traumatic event, one that I think neither the Minister nor myself could <Col N="1412" /> ever understand fully.  It must be a very depressing and distressing event and it is likely that the taking of such a statement by a ban-gharda or an appropriate woman officer would help.  Some consideration should be given to that point of view.  There is a suggestion also that not all women in such situations are informed of their right to be examined for forensic evidence by a doctor of their own choice. I understand that may not happen in all cases, and I can understand that in the immediate aftermath of such a crime. However, people should be made aware of their rights in this respect.</P>
    <P>It has also been represented to me that preparation for the procedures in court could be more comprehensive and more sympathetic to the victim in particular. For example, the barrister representing the State from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the solicitor from the Chief State Solicitor's Office could hold consultations with the witness well in advance of the hearing.  The excuse in such cases is that this provision does not apply in other criminal cases and that the preparation of witnesses in this way could not be accepted in the special and unique circumstances applying in rape cases.  There is a fair amount of strength in that, but we are dealing with an extraordinary crime, one that unforttunately is on the increase.  We are also dealing with a crime that because it does not relate to physical property at a remove from the defendant tends, because of the subjective nature of the evidence involved, to give it priority for this kind of treatment.  There is no reason why the woman, the victim in this case, should not be consulted earlier on and be prepared to give her story.  The suggestion is that quite often the woman in the case feels little more than an exhibit.  We know of unfortunate cases where people have broken down in the witness box and we know of the subsequent results.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the Bill that anonymity will prevail is welcome because presumably it will increase the chances of more women coming forward and also will reduce the sense of trauma involved. I look forward to the time when we will conduct proceedings openly in court, <Col N="1413" /> when we will be sufficiently mature as a nation, when, whatever the crime, people will not feel they will be ostracised because their names were mentioned. Every time we obscure from public gaze any element of the court system, whether it be the proper examination of the defence or the past history or the name of the defendant in a case like this, we do some degree of injury to the concept of justice.  Some of that injury may have to be accepted in the short-or medium-term because of the fact that women in many cases are quite terror-stricken about what will happen in the trial, almost as much as they are about the crime itself.  I look forward to an improvement in that area.</P>
    <P>The request that the woman involved in such a case be consulted about the proceedings is unique in this context because she will be put in the position of being cross-examined in a very intimate way about her behaviour in an area of activity that is extremely difficult for any of us to deal with publicly.  Some degree of sensitive handling prior to the trial is the least we should give in the context of a humanitarian treatment of a person who is, after all, the victim.  In many cases it is the victim who tends to break down and who tends to feel alienated from the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister struck an important note in his final remarks on Second Stage when he said:</P>
    <P>Changing the law will not in itself lead to eradication of the crime of rape. What we can do by legislation, and what we are endeavouring to do in this Bill, is to remove certain features which may at present inhibit rape victims from bringing their complaint to the Garda and thus create a situation where there would be a greater likelihood of rapists being brought to justice.</P>
    <P>That is a worthy aim but, with a little amendment, I think we could go beyond that.  We could have a Bill that will not just accept that rape is inevitable, that it will increase, that there is nothing we can do about it, that the best we can do is hope that more people will come forward and report it and that the convictions <Col N="1414" /> obtained will be more secure.  We can do better than that.  We can ensure that people involved in the crime of rape will be dealt with properly, that women will feel they are being safeguarded and that people who are the defendants in such cases will be taken out of public circulation and will be dealt with in the appropriate manner. I do not accept the defeatist attitude that is implicit in the Bill and I hope on Committee Stage to show that we can do better.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill has given us an opportunity to discuss the matter it is welcome.  There are good provisions in the Bill but there are some deficiencies. I suggest to the Minister that rape is too narrowly defined.  At this stage it is the traditional definition of sexual intercourse. The forms of injury caused to women in this context are much wider.  I believe some are by utilisation of objects of various kinds and these should be open to the charge of rape.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask that the definition be broadened to include these cases.  Secondly, the area relating to the anonymity of the defendant is to some extent regrettable but I think it is necessary. There are other possible areas to which anonymity should be extended, where people involved are often visited afterwards by great loss and damage to their character and their integrity in the community.  Even though it goes against the grain, to some extent, that any part of a court proceedings should be obscured or hidden away it is necessary in this case and I support it.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts a greater onus on judges than heretofore in these cases.  We must have a certain sense of understanding and, indeed, almost compassion for some of the exigencies which we are expecting of them.  This is a difficult Bill and a man &mdash; or indeed a woman, and I hope there will be more of them in the future &mdash; sitting on the bench would be in a very demanding and emotional position.  We should ensure in so far as we can that what I might respectfully call the education of the judges in that respect would <Col N="1415" /> be the best possible and that they would be helped by the readily available help of the appropriate witnesses and other means to be as expert in this as is possible.</P>
    <P>Another point which I mentioned earlier but do not think I made quite clear is the question relating to so-called marital rape.  I want to make clear our thinking about this.  Rape is a crime.  It has a clear definition.  We know what it means.  In a sentence, it is the unwanted sexual violation of one human being by another. Marital status has nothing to do with it and whatever obstruction, hindrance or inhibition rests at present on a married woman taking such an action where she thinks it is justified, should be removed. It to me is as illogical and irrational as to disallow the possibility of that kind of charge being brought as it would be for example, in any other criminal case.  Take the case of a mugging.  For example, if one were to suggest that a teenager who mugs old ladies in fact is not open to being charged if the old lady he mugged is his mother, it would be nonsensical.  I do not understand the rationale or justification for the suggestion that it is impossible for a woman to be raped by her husband.  This is a delicate case because it comes into the area of family relationships. I know that it would be very difficult for a woman to prove that.</P>
    <P>I hope and pray that there would not be too many charges of that nature brought forward and we would all hope that, but there have been, and are, and will be such cases.  In common justice such a woman has the same right to protection as any other person and should not have her rights circumscribed by virtue of the fact that for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, she got married to some man some years ago.  Indeed, I believe that under the Constitution such a woman would have a case because the rights of all citizens should be equal under the law and such rights are not circumscribed by virtue of marital status, for example, in a case like this.  I do not want to over-emphasise this or speak too long about it.  The crime of rape is, and should be, repugnant to us.  We should be able to eradicate it from our society and all <Col N="1416" /> women should have the right to take an action if they believe that they have been so dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is also concern in the area of delays in trials.  Some suggestion has been made that a statutory limit would be put, some said of three months, and that the case would have to be taken within that period.  I sympathise with the views of such people but I can see the utter impossibility of it.  It could very well go quite against the victim in such a case, because a defendant could quite rightly claim that the task of his lawyers and people defending him is made more difficult&mdash;and bear in mind that a conviction of someone in a case like this is an extremely serious matter.  We do not want to be unfair, either to the defendant or the victim, in a case like this.  All we do is urge that the appropriate court facilities, appropriate number of judges and witnesses are made available, so that these trials can take place as immediately as possible.  It is not unfair to say that at present some trials take too long to come to execution, as it were.  From that arise demands for some changes in the law, but that is another day's work.  The answer is not to say that at three months there must be a trial. Clearly that cannot be entertained and would not serve the purpose of the administration of justice if it could be shown that more weeks were needed to prepare a case, either for the prosecution or for the defence.</P>
    <P>These are the basic points and we shall be tabling amendments.  Having been able to deal with the Minister across the floor previously, I know that he will be receptive, will listen and take the courtesy of reading and considering what we have said.  I feel sure that we can make some progress and that there may be a meeting ground somewhere in the middle so that some of the honest interest taken by all sides of the House in this Bill could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>This Bill is non-party political.  It is timely.  I hope that we can bring about even further improvements in this very important area without undue delay and show the women of this country that this Parliament is very concerned about respecting and protecting them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad, indeed, to see this Bill before the House.  There are three main points in this Bill: the restriction of admissibility of evidence of any sexual experience of the complainant with men other than the accused, anonymity of the complainant and the accused, and an increase in the maximum penalty for indecent assault from two to ten years.  That cuts the Bill down to a narrow significance indeed.  The incidence of rape, which has increased considerably over the past couple of years, particularly in the city of Dublin but indeed around all parts of the country as well, calls out for more legislation than this.  The legislation before the House deals with the specific definition, the old-fashioned definition of rape.  In this day and age, with all the various crimes committed, both on men and women, it should have another definition.</P>
      <P>I commend the Government and the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House at this stage but I do not think that any Government would have brought forward any legislation if the women had not been so incensed by what was happening that they marched in this city of Dublin two years ago in their thousands. The Rape Centre was initiated after that to try to help women who found themselves in this predicament.  Women raised their voices very loudly indeed and that is why the politicians realised that something very concrete had to be done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are assuring us, and I believe them, that a lot of legislation for women will be brought before this House in the years to come and legislation has been brought in the last year or two. However, unless and until our women put extreme pressure on the Government, very little will be done for them. With all due respect to the men in Parliament, only a woman can really understand and explain what a dreadful thing it would be to be raped.  How would the men feel if they were raped?  It is quite on the cards that a weak man could be raped by a strong man.  Such cases do not reach the courts very often but they occur.  I should like to know how men <Col N="1418" /> would react to such an occurrence.  Men sneer and laugh at such occurrences where women are involved and often comment that women ask for it.  They do not take the crime of rape against women very seriously.  I am glad the Minister is taking it reasonably serious by deciding to bring this legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>Most women are terrified about the crime of rape against themselves or their daughters.  I am aware of many cases where young girls are not allowed to attend dances or go to the cinema unless they are brought there by one of their parents and collected when the dance or film is over.  Many young girls are not allowed to get a late bus home at night because their parents are so terrified of their being raped.  The provision in the Bill in relation to evidence is an improvement.  Up to now a woman who was the victim of rape was questioned about her past sexual experiences with other men.  I am glad this will not happen again except in cases where the judge is specifically asked to permit such evidence. The fact that a woman was liable to be asked such questions was one of the reasons so few of them complained to the Garda after they had been raped.  They considered the horrific experience of being raped bad enough without having to submit themselves to cross-examination about their past sexual experiences or relationships with other men.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that in future the names of victims will not be published. The fact that names were published was also a reason why women did not make complaints to the Garda.  They were anxious to keep such occurrences from their parents, in some cases, and their neighbours and friends.  I also welcome the increase in the penalty for indecent assault from two years to ten years. That was the term of imprisonment as far as males were concerned and it was only right that it should be the same for indecent assault on women.  When a woman makes a complaint to the effect that she has been raped she should be questioned by a ban-gharda.  The complainant's family doctor should be called and every assistance given to that woman.  There is <Col N="1419" /> little use in bringing her to a Garda station simply for the purpose of getting a statement from her, because after such an attack her recollection is likely to be haphazard.  A woman is likely to be in such a state that she is not coherent.  At that stage she needs someone who can reassure her and help her.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of rape within marriage.  This is a very difficult area.  Generally speaking women did not bring such complaints against their husband but in recent times more and more such cases come to light. It happens in cases where the husband is an alcoholic.  There is no relationship, love or tenderness in most cases and the husband when he comes home drunk seeks what he calls his rights.  That is rape.  Women in such cases take into consideration their children and are in such a distressed state that they often suffer a mental breakdown.  In many cases they must seek treatment in a mental hospital. Very often it is the woman who is regarded as being ill in such cases, as the person in need of treatment.  In fact, it is the man who should be sent for treatment for his alcoholic condition.  I do not know any doctor who will say in such a case that it is the man who must go for treatment. It is always the woman who is sent to hospital for treatment, but she must go there because of what is being inflicted upon her by her alcoholic husband.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult area also because after quarrels women may get themselves into such a mental state that they accuse their husbands of rape but about three or four days later they make up and are happy again.  The case can arise of a woman in a fit of anger making such a complaint against her husband and having to go through with it.  I realise the difficulties in this area.  But, notwithstanding them, there are cases of rape within marriage. In such cases women should have the same facilities of making a complaint as those who are raped outside of marriage.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister has taken into consideration a situation which arises where there is common law marriage.  Can a woman in that situation bring a complaint of rape against the man <Col N="1420" /> she is living with?  Is she regarded as being married or will her accusation be considered? There are also many couples living together without being married.  That is a fact of life we have to face.  There are numerous other cases of sexual cruelty which take place but which are not accepted as rape.  Hopefully, another Bill will be introduced in the near future to deal with such problems.  I should like the Minister to consider introducing an amendment to deal with the case of a father who rapes his daughter.  What category will such a crime come under?  It is happening in our society.  Would the father be accused of rape or would it be treated as only indecent assault?  In my view it should be classified as rape and come under the terms of this Bill.  There are other terrible crimes that young boys commit against young girls.  Generally speaking those boys are of a tender age, under 14 years, and they cannot be charged with rape although they have committed the crime of rape.</P>
    <P>Young girls in this city are being destroyed for life.  I am not exaggerating. About two years ago there was a dreadful case which caused many women to march in this city.  It was an appalling case where a group of young boys attacked a young girl.  She was hospitalised and she almost lost her life.  I wonder why that is not defined as rape.  Even young boys are quite aware of what they are doing and should be so charged.  The fact has also been mentioned that men use various objects such as sticks and bottles.  This is also rape.  Men who are impotent and cannot perform the sexual act use these methods.  They are committing rape against a woman and they should be so charged.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate censorship.  Adults should be allowed to read or see adult literature and programmes.  Much of the literature young people read in magazines, and so on, and many of the programmes young people see on television are the cause of an increase in sexual crimes at the moment.  Young people take these programmes seriously and say: &ldquo;We will try that&rdquo;, and go out and attack young girls.  About three days ago there was an appalling case where a young boy <Col N="1421" /> of three years of age was attacked by a gang of older boys and left half dead in the outskirts of the city of Dublin.  How will these young boys be dealt with? Apparently at the moment nothing will happen to them.  If they are found, they will be brought to court and let out again. They could have killed that little boy. Even though he is only three years of age, the memory of that will probably stay with him for the rest of his life and affect him in his relationships with other people in his adult life.  These incidents which occur so frequently at the moment have a lasting emotional and psychological effect on the people involved.  This Bill may help to bring more of these cases before the courts and to achieve more convictions and longer sentences, but we should be trying to prevent them from happening.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that he might consider setting up a special section in the Garda to deal with these matters.  We have the Drug Squad and various groups who deal with certain problems.  Would the Minister consider setting up a special group, or division, or squad in the Garda, consisting of a number of ban-ghardaí who would be available to deal with these cases and try to prevent them if possible?</P>
    <P>Gangs of men in the city are planning these crimes.  One of them meets a young girl at a dance and is very nice to her.  He leaves her home and makes a date with her for the next night.  She thinks he is a nice young man and she goes out with him.  He takes her out two or three times. One night they are going home and his pal has a car.  He asks his pal to give them a lift home.  He tells the girl this is his friend.  The next thing is that two or three of his pals are in the car.  They drive out to some country lane and all his pals rape the girl.  He tries to defend her so that she will not know what is happening, but it has all been planned.  The following week one of the other men takes over and the same thing happens.  The man who took the girl home the previous week will be in on the rape session the following week. This is happening.</P>
    <P>Surely the Garda can investigate these matters.  Surely they can locate the people <Col N="1422" /> who are planning this type of activity. They should be known to the Garda. They can find out where people are selling or pushing drugs, and they should be able to find out where these gangs are operating and who they are.  I appeal to the Minister to investigate the feasibility and the possibility of setting up a special squad in the Garda to deal with rape. They could also be very helpful when a rape victim was brought in.  They would be properly trained to deal with victims of rape.  They would be properly trained to question them.</P>
    <P>Recently I have been rather concerned about the women who say they are looking after women's affairs and activities. They are the women's libbers, so to speak.  I am very distressed because I think some of the so-called do-gooders and women's libbers are doing more harm than good.  They are alienating men from being sympathetic to women's problems. They do this by bringing up stupid and silly situations which have nothing at all to do with legislation for women.  The ordinary average woman should not take them seriously.</P>
    <P>In legislation like the Bill before the House today, women should have the sympathetic ear of men as well as women. We do not want these women do-gooders to force men to say: &ldquo;We are fed up listening to women.  We do not want to know anything more about them.&rdquo;  I am beginning to worry about the women's movement because they are inclined to do that.  Basically, men are the legislators, the judges, the Garda.  Everywhere you look they are in positions of power and judgment.  Women must realise that men must fight their causes as well, and men must be sympathetic to them.  In the case of rape men are very sympathetic.  It is up to men to be as involved as women. Men must realise that it is their wives, their daughters and their mothers who can be involved in the dreadful crime of rape.  They must realise that they have to be totally sympathetic to the woman in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have been quite worried on occasions when the judges acquitted persons or gave sentences of two months in jail in <Col N="1423" /> cases where I was totally convinced that the man was guilty of rape and where on the evidence available I would have given a life sentence.  I am not being vindictive or over reacting but I have been horrified when certain judges have let the guilty man away.  I know judges would not want to be regarded as uneducated but they should be given some indication or reading matter to make them realise what a woman feels when she is raped and what a dreadful thing it is, so that they will have sympathy for her case.  Most of our judges are men and perhaps they are on the side of men.  I am not accusing them but all things being equal this could be the case.  In future I hope male judges will take into account the terrible trauma and emotions through which a woman goes in these circumstances and will allow for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill before the House but I would have also welcomed a few extra provisions, and perhaps amendments can be made on Committee Stage.  Rape has increased out of all proportion in recent times and women are growing more frightened of being assaulted.  One does not have to be young nowadays to be raped.  Old ladies living on their own in flats and bedsitters are being attacked.  A determined effort should be made to bring more cases to court, to get convictions and to impose realistic sentences on those convicted.  A bigger effort should also be made to protect old people particularly, by posting more gardaí to the vicinities where old people live.  At least a young woman would be strong enough to sustain an attack of that sort even if it leaves an emotional mark on her for the rest of her life but it is appalling to hear of old people being attacked in this way. It must be stopped.  I would stress to the men in the House, all the politicians the judges and the gardaí concerned that this is a terrible crime against women, which should be stopped.  People who commit this crime should be brought to justice and judges should not pussyfoot around saying that perhaps it did not happen, that perhaps the woman was at fault and that the man was encouraged.  In the past judges were on the side of men and men <Col N="1424" /> were allowed to get away with what they did. I hope that the Minister will look further at this Bill and will introduce a few amendments.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government for introducing this Bill to try to protect women in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keating and Deputy Lemass for their welcome for this important Bill.  In the course of his remarks Deputy Keating made some specific suggestions for changes in certain sections of the Bill as did Deputy Lemass.  I will deal with these later in my reply but first I will refer to Deputy Keating's more general comments.</P>
      <P>The crime of rape has unfortunately always been with us; the first reference to it is to be found in the Book of Genesis (34:1&mdash;2).  The Deputy has said that there should be a more fundamental attack on the causes of rape.  The Deputy might agree that that is not a matter for this Bill.  The reality of the situation is that this is a crime, one of the most reprehensible of crimes, that has always been with us and must be dealt with.  Our immediate concern in this Bill is to eliminate those factors that may have enabled offenders to secure acquittal by bringing up irrelevant matters against the complainant and that have discouraged women from reporting the crime and thus create the situation where there will be greater likelihood of rapists being brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to say from the statistics we have available whether or not the incidence of the crime of rape is on the increase.  Deputy Keating expressed the view that the number of unreported cases is increasing.  The opposite view has also been expressed, that in recent years there has been an increasing tendency to report the crime to the Garda because women may be less inhibited now about bringing these dreadful assaults on the person to the attention of the Garda.  For Deputies' information the numbers of cases known or reported to the Garda in respect of the last three years are as follows: 1977, 60 cases; 1978, 47 cases and 1979, 50 cases and in the period up to 31 July this year <Col N="1425" /> 37 cases are known or have been reported to the Garda.  The highest number of cases in the previous six years was 42 and that was in 1973.  It is not possible to say what is the real incidence of the crime but I would expect that as a result of this legislation whatever tendency there has been not to report cases to the Garda will be greatly reduced.  The number of cases of indecent assault on females reported or known to the Garda has averaged about 110 per year in the last nine years and the number of such cases from 1 January to 31 July 1980 was 36.  There seems to be no discernible trend up or down in these figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating also referred to the problem of group rapes, or, as they are more commonly known, gang rapes.  This was also referred to by Deputy Lemass. This type of case is the most horrific and subjects the victim to unimaginable pain, trauma and humiliation and the victims of such terror are entitled to all the sympathy and compassion we can give them.</P>
    <P>Of the 37 cases in which proceedings were recommended in 1978 there were 30 cases involving one accused, four cases involving two accused, one case involving three accused and two cases involving four accused.  The figures for 1979 were as follows, 27 cases involving one accused, eight cases involving two accused, and one case each involving three, four, five and six accused.  As can be seen from these figures the number of gang rapes, in particular those involving three or more accused, is, thankfully, low.</P>
    <P>Moving to the specific points made by Deputy Keating he referred to what he regarded as two deficiencies in section 2. The Deputy is confusing a number of issues and a number of offences when he says that the meaning of rape should not be defined in terms of gender.  Rape can only be committed by a man on a woman, except of course that a woman can be guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling, etc., and that is why it is defined as it is in the Bill.  A sexual assault involving anal penetration by a man on another man or on a woman is not rape but constitutes the separate offence of buggery.  The Deputy suggested that it may not be possible  <Col N="1426" /> under the Bill to charge a man or woman with being an accessory to a rape, but that is not the case, because the ordinary criminal law will apply under which whenever an offence is committed any other person who has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the offence is equally liable as an accessory</P>
    <P>The other point raised by the Deputy on this section refers to the question of extending the meaning of rape to include serious cases of sexual assault, which do not amount to rape at present.  As I stated in my opening remarks, this recommendation was also made by the Council for the Status of Women.  We do not think it is desirable to change the meaning of rape in this way, for to do so would be to change completely the legal definition of an offence which has been part of our law for centuries.  We recognise the seriousness of the problems that have led to this suggestion but we feel that the proper way to deal with it is in the context of the offence of indecent assault, by increasing the maximum penalty for that offence. This we have done in section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the penalties be the same as those for rape?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalty for rape is life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for indecent assault was much less than is now provided for in this Bill.  It is ten years in the Bill.  They are two separate offences.  One is rape and the other is indecent assault.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of rape within marriage, this is a very difficult and contentious area.  As I said in the course of my opening speech, the existing law provides protection for a wife in the situation where her husband uses violence against her in order to force her to have sexual intercourse with him.  Although the law does not in the normal course allow a husband to be convicted of the specific crime of rape, this does not mean that a wife who has been subjected to violence has no legal remedy.  Nothing could be further from the truth in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic question at issue here is whether we should enact any provisions <Col N="1427" /> which would force the courts to get involved in closely scrutinising the intimate relations between husband and wife in marriage.  The Government do not consider that it has yet been shown that there is any clear case for altering the law so as to require them to do so.  One must also take into consideration that rape is a crime which is easy to allege but difficult to prove unless there is corroborative evidence.  I can see that there would be great difficulty in proving that rape on a wife had taken place as there would normally be no corroborative evidence unless the rape was accompanied by violence. In such a case the husband would be liable to a charge of assault which, depending on the circumstances, could leave him open to serious penalties. Some countries have, it is true, abolished the husband's immunity but in some of these cases a charge of rape is possible only if the rape is accompanied by violence. But while some countries have abolished the husband's immunity this is the exception rather than the rule.  I am not satisfied that there would be general support for a change of this rule and the Government consider that, pending further study of this very difficult matter, we should make no change in the present Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, with the permission fo the Chair, to ask the Minister one brief question.  He may not have the answer and I understand if he does not.  Where precisely is the actual bar on the possibility of a wife taking such an action?  Does it rest on Common Law or is there a specific statute?  It does not seem to be in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The remedy for a wife at present is one where she can report the assault and he can be charged with assault causing serious bodily harm or possibly indecent assault, although I am not aware of any case involving the charge of indecent assault on a wife by a husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keating also made reference to section 2 (2) and questioned the reason for its inclusion.  The need for the rule in this subsection arises from the fact that a defence that can be adduced against a charge of rape is that the accused believed that the woman consented to the intercourse &mdash; in other words, a necessary ingredient of the crime, an intention to have intercourse without her consent, is lacking.  It then becomes a matter for the jury to decide in the circumstances of the case whether that alleged belief of the accused was genuine or not.  The present law is that, while it is not necessary for the purpose of this defence that the belief should be based on reasonable grounds, the presence or absence of such grounds is a matter to be taken into account by the jury in deciding whether or not the accused's belief in the woman's consent was genuine.  Subsection (2) merely restates the present law.  I think it useful to have the rule stated clearly in statutory form.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 3 of the Bill, about which Deputy Keating expressed some worry, what we are proposing, in effect, is that evidence which is irrelevant to an actual issue in the trial should be excluded.  There have, understandably, been complaints about the freedom with which questions as to a woman's previous sexual experiences with a person other than the accused have been asked during rape trials even though this evidence, and sometimes it has no foundation in fact, may be irrelevant to the question at issue. What we propose is to set down a definite guideline for the courts in this regard. Our most important consideration has been to strike a balance between the rights of both the complainant and accused.  The aim is that if the evidence is relevant it will be admitted.  If the judge decides it is not relevant it will not be admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> I should like to set the Deputy right in regard to section 6.  We are not in the words of the Deputy &ldquo;passing the buck to the Judiciary&rdquo; in relation to the exclusion of the public as he suggested.  What we are providing for is that during an application arising out of section 3, 4 and 5, the judge must exclude the public, with the exceptions mentioned in subsection (2) of section 6.  I would emphasise that the public will not be excluded from the trial itself &mdash; the exclusion operates only when applications for the adducing of evidence, or cross-examination, about the complainant's sexual experiences with others are being dealt with.  If the application is granted the evidence will then be adduced or the cross-examination conducted in open court.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that a trial for rape might be conducted, as some family law cases are, wholly <i>in camera</i>.  The analogy with family law cases is not apt.  It can obviously be contended that there is no public interest in having the intimate affairs of individual families debated in public.  A rape trial, however, involves a very serious criminal charge and there is a very fundamental public interest which requires that such trials should be open to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>There is no basis for the fear the Deputy expressed in relation to section 7, that an anonymous person could destroy the character or livelihood of an innocent person for the simple reason that the accused will remain anonymous unless and until he is convicted.  This was one of the reason for granting anonymity to the accused under section 8.</P>
    <P>In regard to the circumstances under which a judge might authorise the disclosure of the name of a complainant or accused in the public interest, it would not be possible to list in legislation the different circumstances under which this might happen but we do give an obvious example of such a circumstance in the explanatory memorandum, paragraph 17, where the identity of the complainant is already a matter of public knowledge, and this would also apply in regard to anonymity for the accused.  It could not be contended, as the Deputy seemed to imply, that the existence of widely read <Col N="1430" /> salacious publications would be evidence of a public interest requiring anonymity to be lifted.  Public interest, of course, means what is for the benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned delays.  The position is that while there are delays in the hearing of rape and other cases before the Central Criminal Court there are no such delays in criminal trials in the Circuit Court either in Dublin or throughout the country.  The problem in relation to the Central Criminal Court is that a high proportion of rape trials are transferred to it from the Circuit Courts, principally from the Dublin Circuit Court.  Section 6 of the Courts Act, 1964, provides that cases may be transferred, on the application of either the accused or the Director of Public Prosecutions, from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court. At present the delay in the hearing of a rape case in the Central Criminal Court is on average seven months.  This matter is receiving consideration in my Department with a view to remedying the existing situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of a set number of women on juries in rape cases the Deputy, while agreeing with the arguments I put forward in this regard, has, I think, misunderstood the point I was making that the practice of objecting to female jurors in so far as it exists will die out quite soon.  The point is that there was the feeling that all-male juries were more sympathetic to an accused in a trial for rape.  This, however, is not now true if it ever was.</P>
    <P>In that regard very recently in Dublin Circuit Court in two rape cases the juries comprised of an equal number of men and women, six of each involved in each case, acquitted the accused.  It is interesting to note that there were six women on both juries, and this trend is to be welcomed. While I take the Deputy's and Deputy Lemass's point in this regard, there is certainly a very enlightened improvement in this area.  It is important to make the point, in case it would be implied in his suggestion that women would be more impartial than men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a clarifying point in that connection and I suggest that the proposal that there be a set number of women on juries in rape cases might be described as having discriminatory overtones.  For that reason it is important to make the clarification.  I am sure the Deputy will welcome it, particularly in modern times when not alone do we wish to ensure the equality of women but also equality as between men and women and the Deputy would be more than anxious that that would seem to be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Men and women are entitled to serve on juries and, unless we have clear evidence pointing one way, we should be slow to assume that either sex is likely to be more or less impartial than the other.  The view that men are less impartial than women when they serve on juries in rape cases is not now accepted, as instanced in the two examples I gave of cases which took place recently in Dublin Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the definition of rape was mentioned by Deputy Keating and Deputy Lemass.  In that regard they suggested that we should not retain rape as it is defined at present as a distinct and separate crime but that we should extend the definition to cover a whole range of other sexual offences.  One important point to which the Deputies did not advert is that rape, a most horrific and heinous crime, is unlike other offences. There is a very fundamental difference between the crime of rape and the circumstances for which the Deputy would seek to have provision in an extended definition.  The difference is that pregnancy can result from rape.  The extension of the definition of rape so as to include the use of certain items such as sticks or bottles in circumstances such as have been referred to by Deputy Keating and Deputy Lemass would interfere with what the Government and I are trying to <Col N="1432" /> achieve in this Bill, that is, to deal with the crime of rape.  Not only is it on the one hand a very serious crime but also for very obvious reasons it can have this other very traumatic experience as a result, that is the possibility of a pregnancy. That is a very fundamental difference in the crime of rape as opposed to the crimes the Deputies have in mind.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion in this House Deputy Keating gave some American statistics.  He was quoting from <i>Sex Crime and the Law</i> by Donal E.J. MacNamara. The position in this country cannot be regarded as comparable with the situation in the US.  I doubt if any conclusions relevant to this country can be drawn from the statistics quoted by Deputy Keating.  The figure for rape cases reported in the US in 1975 was something like 56,000.  If we were to make comparisons here on the basis of population we would have 1,000 known or reported cases here in that year.  The figure was 38 cases known or reported to the Garda in 1975.  It would have been 1,000 in 1975 if I were to accept that a comparison could be drawn.  Also there are differences in the law relating to rape in the different states in the US and a difference in the compilation of rape statistics in the different states.  American society is totally different from ours, and I hope that the valuable attributes of our society would be a feature of protection for the future.</P>
    <P>Marital rape has been mentioned by both Deputies.  If a husband has intercourse with his wife and uses violence, while he will not be charged with rape he can be charged with assault.  If grievious bodily harm has been caused the penalty would be life imprisonment, which is the same as the penalty for rape.  Some sexual assaults on a wife could amount to indecent assault and in those circumstances the husband could be charged with indecent assault for which the maximum penalty is being increased to ten years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating also referred to the non-availability of ban-ghardaí and called on us to ensure that ban-ghardaí would be available.  Because of the exigencies of the calls on the Garda Síochána it is not feasible to have a ban-gharda available at every Garda station throughout <Col N="1433" /> the country.  It might be desirable in a perfect situation but it is not practicable for a number of reasons.  While rape does not necessarily confine itself to any one location and can occur in not alone the likely locations but in the most unlikely places, there are circumstances where it would be most helpful if the services of a ban-gharda were available.  Where they are not available in such circumstances, the Garda have ensured, and it is hoped that they will continue to do so, that a friend or another female, with the consent of the victim of course, would be available to provide whatever assistance was necessary.  This has also been the practice of the Garda in relation to other offences where the services of a person other than a ban-gharda have been availed of and people who are capable and responsible in society and in the locality have from time to time been invited to assist in this regard.  I am satisfied that the Garda will make every effort to ensure that the maximum comfort is available to the victim.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating also mentioned preparation of the victim for appearance in court.  There may be some merit in what he says but if he is suggesting that counsel or solicitors should be in a position to meet the complainant or victim before the court case there could then be the allegation of undue interference with witnesses or the allegation that they were being coached.  However, I take the point that they should be acquainted with the procedures involved in going to court. That would be desirable and helpful and could be described as counselling in preparation for an appearance in court, having regard to the sensitivity to the type of crime involved and the traumatic experience of the victim.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned that men are raped and that cases have never come before the courts.  That is not correct.  If a man has unnatural intercourse with another man against his will &mdash; or, indeed, with his consent, because consent is not a defence &mdash; it constitutes the crime of buggery.  Such cases are brought before the courts and the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also mentioned the <Col N="1434" /> rape by a father of his daughter.  If a father has intercourse with his daughter without her consent he could be convicted of rape; if he has intercourse with his daughter with her consent he would be liable to the charge of incest.  The younger the daughter the less likely it is that she would be in a position to consent.</P>
    <P>The matter of gang rapes was also raised and I have given some statistics in that regard.  Thankfully the number of gang rapes is not too high.  However, the fact that they occur makes me consider seriously suggestions made by Deputy Lemass as to ways to prevent such attacks, particularly when they arise due to such factors as drug abuse.  The Deputy referred to the provision of a special Garda corps or a special unit to deal with this type of offence.  I presume she had in mind a unit which would deal with different sexual offences, including gang rapes and rapes by individuals.  This is a matter which I will bring to the attention of the Garda at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also suggested that judges are too lenient in dealing with rapists and I should like to give some figures in this regard.  There are 26 offenders at present serving sentences for rape.  The length of sentence in the case of one offender is 12 years, while in the case of four offenders it is 10 years.  Eight offenders are serving eight years, three are serving seven years, six are serving five years, one is serving four years, two are serving three years and one offender is serving two years.  To summarise, 16 offenders are serving seven years or more and ten are serving five years or less.  In addition, three offenders are serving sentences of five, four and two years respectively for attempted rape.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to the medical examination of the complainant which can be carried out only with the victim's consent.  She always has the option of being examined by her own doctor.  In rural areas this will normally coincide with the Garda choice of doctor.  The complainant will not be medically examined in the Garda station but in the doctor's surgery or else she will be taken to a local hospital.  These are procedural <Col N="1435" /> matters which I consider are not suitable for inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also the very important matter of rape within marriage to which Deputies Keating and Lemass have referred. The obvious example of an exception to the rule that a man cannot be charged with the rape of his wife would be in the case of a judicial separation.  The cases in which the UK courts have held the husband liable include cases where there are separation agreements with a non-cohabitation clause, a decree of divorce, a decree of judicial separation, a separation order of a magistrate's court containing a non-cohabitation clause, an injunction restraining a husband from molesting his wife or having sexual intercourse with her, and an undertaking, in lieu of an injunction, by the husband not to molest his wife.  These are situations in which the UK courts have held that the husband would be liable for the charge of rape.</P>
    <P>We have the situation here where the crime of assault can be prosecuted within marriage and a husband can be taken to court if he assaults his wife. We are aware of cases of assault within marriage.  In many instances where such cases of assault have occurred within marriage and have been reported to the Garda by the wife or somebody acting on her behalf, the Garda have subsequently been requested or invited by the woman to desist from proceeding to prosecute. When we speak in terms of the definition of rape itself being provided for in a marital context we do so in an area that is very complicated and must be concerned with the intimacies of married life in order to obtain the necessary proofs.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy FitzGerald on Tuesday.  25 November 1980:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> Recognising its responsibilities as the primary democratic forum of this State, Dáil Éireann notes the allegations made in <i>Magill</i> magazine, in relation to present and former members of the Government, and seeks clarification of the matters raised by these allegations.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;considers it expedient that a Commission of Inquiry be established under the chairmanship of a Judge of the High Court to inquire into and report on the veracity of the allegations made in <i>Magill</i> magazine in relation to present and former members of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night when progress was reported I was about to make the point that the Opposition had not only a right to raise this issue at this time and in this way but indeed a duty to do so because of the serious allegations recently made in articles published in <i>Magill</i> magazine.  The subject matter of this motion being raised by us now, with all its gory details, is surely of more than academic interest.  It has been raised because of the serious nature of the allegations made in the articles referred to, allegations made against people of influence, against people in this House and indeed against members of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even more important than all that is the fact that this public, topical issue has what must be seen as a direct bearing on our relationship with our fellow Irishmen in the North.  One would have thought that this debate was a glorious opportunity for the Taoiseach, against whom allegations have been made, to shed from himself the ambivalence out of which, for political reasons, he has made a virtue. This same ambivalence is anathema to the people with whom we must do business  <Col N="1437" /> on the basis of mutual trust if we are to solve the unfortunate problem here at any time in the future.  Yet despite this opportunity afforded to him, the Taoiseach saw fit to stay away from this House during the debate, and we complain that Dáil Éireann is becoming more irrelevant every day.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in our naiveté some of us expressed surprise at this development. I wonder now if we should express surprise because here is an issue where this House ought to involve itself, and yet the people of influence against whom allegations have been made see fit to absent themselves from this House.  What we have witnessed so far &mdash; and I refer in particular to the contribution last night by the Minister for Justice &mdash; is an exercise in what I would call arrogance and indeed contempt for the traditions long held in this House, traditions which have been established down through the years, where, when an opportunity was given to a Minister or indeed to any Member of this House to clarify ambiguities, that opportunity has normally been taken. Indeed, in many cases it was initiated by the Member himself in order to clarify his position.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, is not involved in this sordid affair at all, good, bad or indifferent.  But the Minister for Justice had in front of him last night a very serious allegation that the gun used to murder a member of the Garda Síochana had been illegally imported through Dublin Airport.  In the course of his statement last night the Minister castigated former Ministers from this side of the House who, he said had the same documentation and files available to them in their time in government and yet saw fit to keep their mouths shut on these matters at that time.  That is a fair point.  But they had not in front of them this recent allegation which arose out of the publication of the <i>Magill</i> articles, an allegation which should have been answered by the Minister, and I would hope that before this debate closes it will be replied to by him.  By his failure to do so last night and his avoidance of this issue, he has struck a severe blow at the morale of the Garda who in the recent <Col N="1438" /> past, suffered three further murders within their ranks.  It was unfortunate that the Minister chose to avoid this issue which pertains directly to his Department.</P>
    <P>There are people here who, like the Minister for Justice, see this debate as totally irrelevant and feel that the time could be better spent in discussing the economy, security and other pressing matters.  But surely, despite the fact that the matters being discussed took place over ten years ago, the consequences of what happened then are still with us and the legacy of dissent is still with us.  One has only to recall last night's performance and to count the number of Deputies who sat in the Fianna Fáil benches and to name them to be in no dount as to the degree of dissension which still exists in the Government as a direct result of what took place over ten years ago so that the relegation of this issue to the dim pages of history which was being attempted by the Minister for Justice last night does not solve that problem and the consequences of not solving that problem are that we all suffer.</P>
    <P>To me, the most amazing aspect of last night's debate &mdash; and I am not long in this House &mdash; was a quotation and a statement which followed the quotation made by Deputy Noel Browne.  Having listened to the reaction, or the non-reaction, to that statement one could not but express amazement at what kind of Parliament or what kind of Government we have at this time.  I quote Deputy Browne's statement from last night's debate when he said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey on May 25 said: &ldquo;I now categorically state that at no time have I taken part in any illegal importation or attempted importation of arms into the country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne went on:</P>
    <P>Does anybody believe that now? Does anybody now seriously doubt that he was lying then and that he lied and perjured himself later on in the court?</P>
    <P>Here was Deputy Noel Browne standing <Col N="1439" /> in an Irish Parliament accusing the Taoiseach &mdash; my Taoiseach and yours.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; of perjury in the courts and yet not one of the Taoiseach's colleagues was prepared to stand up and defend him.  This is the most amazing reaction or non-reaction I have ever witnessed.</P>
    <P>Do we take it that the allegation made was incontrovertible because that is the interpretation of the ordinary man in the street &mdash; indeed it is mine.  In the normal course of events you.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would not allow that allegation to go unchallenged from your point of view.  In this case &mdash; I am not blaming you &mdash; all I am saying is that the silence from the Fianna Fáil benches to the allegation that their leader was a perjurer is nothing short of amazing.</P>
    <P>One would have expected that even that would have provoked our Taoiseach into coming into this House tonight to listen to this debate and &mdash; hopefully &mdash; participate in it before its closure at 8.30. I would hope that he will be present.  It would seem now that even that will not provoke our Taoiseach into coming into the House and that this policy of ten years of silence is still to be pursued by him leaving in its train the many doubts that now linger in the minds of many people.</P>
    <P>This motion was put down in order to facilitate the people directly challenged to clear their lines and make some effort to rescue their characters.   Fine Gael, it would seem, have not succeeded in what they set out to do.  I say that more in sadness than in any other tone simply because the principals involved have decided to continue in their silence to the allegation made by Deputy Noel Browne.  To me this performance is nothing short of amazing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party at their Parliamentary Party meeting in discussing this motion before the House decided to leave it to me as to whether we participated at all in the debate for the reason that we have no light to shed on this sad and sordid affair.  We cannot tell who told lies, who committed perjury, who was or was not involved.  We do not know who <Col N="1440" /> the victim was and who was the perpetrator of the act against the other.  We decided that because it was a three-hour debate, a limited debate, we would give the maximum time to any member of the House who could throw any light on the issue.  That included members of Fianna Fáil and Deputy Blaney.  They are the only members who could state what the truth is &mdash; we could not.</P>
      <P>I want to make clear at the beginning &mdash; I stated this in a previous debate in the House &mdash; that as far as the arms trial itself is concerned and the charges that were made and the people who were in the dock this party are not attempting and will not attempt a retrial.  We accept that any man who was brought before the courts and acquitted is acquitted and that is the end of the matter.  We would not lend ourselves to a retrial of any person.  Taoiseach, Minister or ordinary individual. What we are discussing here is other new matter that has come to light and which was not considered at the trial and was not the subject of a verdict by a jury.  In fact one of the reasons why I rose to speak was the utter contempt with which the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Government have treated the Dáil and, through the Dáil, the people of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a situation where, as was mentioned previously, a Member of the House stood up last night and said it had been established that the Taoiseach committed perjury.  One of the new issues which it was sought to discuss in this motion was the <i>Magill</i> articles which stated that as a result of looking through the Berry papers one could not escape the conclusion that the Taoiseach had committed perjury.  Can anyone envisage any other Parliament in a democracy where the Prime Minister is openly in Parliament accused of committing perjury and he treats that Parliament and the people it represents with such utter contempt that he does not even attend the discussion not to mention that he does not see fit &mdash; or at least has not up to now &mdash; to come into the House and <Col N="1441" /> refute the charge made both inside and outside the House?</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any libel action pending against the editor of <i>Magill</i>, the author of those articles, and I find it staggering that in a parliamentary democracy a Taoiseach and a Government could believe that they would get away with treating the whole Parliament and the electorate with such utter and total contempt.  That is one of the reasons why I rose to speak.  A number of questions were asked last night by Deputy Garret FitzGerald and repeated by Deputy Browne and other speakers.  They involve very serious charges against Members of the House.</P>
      <P>In addition to perjury there were involved such matters as a meeting between the man who is now the Taoiseach, but who was then facing criminal charges, with the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, and also charges concerning the former Taoiseach who knew, before he claims to have known, of the alleged conspiracy to import arms. There were all sorts of charges.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what Fianna Fáil have tried to make us believe, there are no good guys or no bad guys in that party. In the light of last evening's performance, it is possible that all the members of that party concerned told lies and are continuing to tell lies but what has emerged very clearly during the past ten years &mdash; and this was highlighted last night in this House &mdash; was that both individually and collectively those people will put party before country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>When one has regard to the subject matter of the trial that took place, to the subject matter of this debate and to the circumstances that exist in this country at this time, can anyone think of a more serious charge against a public representative and a member of a national parliament?  I have heard the comment on radio that the whole episode could be compared with the question of who shot JR. Last evening's scene reminded me far more of Sicily than of Dallas.  No-one on this side of the House <Col N="1442" /> is in a position to throw any further light on the subject but there are a couple of observations that should be made.  We know without doubt that either the present Taoiseach or Deputy Gibbons was guilty of perjury.  Deputy Lynch knows which of them is the guilty party in this respect.  As Taoiseach he was in possession of this information but he appointed both men to the Cabinet.  Was that the act of a responsible Taoiseach?</P>
      <P>Let us consider the position of the Taoiseach who tonight stands charged, both inside this House and outside it with perjury and let us consider also the position of Deputy Gibbons.   We are talking not only about the Dáil but about membership of an Irish Cabinet.  If the Taoiseach is the man who committed the perjury. Deputy Gibbons knew that because the perjury would have been committed against him.  Yet he saw fit to sit in the Cabinet with the man who is now the Taoiseach.  On the other hand, if Deputy Gibbons was the man who committed the perjury.  Deputy Haughey saw fit to accept office and to sit in the same Cabinet as Deputy Gibbons.  This is all very elevating for the Irish people and for our young people in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot come to a conclusion in regard to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  In the <i>Magill</i> articles and in this House also the charge has been made that as Minister for Justice he had a meeting with the man who is now the Taoiseach two weeks before the beginning of the trial in respect of the conspiracy to import arms illegally. There has been an allegation of a secret meeting between the two men but so far the Minister has not come into the House to deny this charge.  I hope that he will intervene before the debate concludes. We cannot say who is telling the truth and who is telling untruths but if the people involved wish the truth to be established and if they have nothing to fear, they should support the amendment in the name of Deputy Browne calling for a public inquiry with a member of the Judiciary as chairman for the purpose of attempting to establish the truth.  Any Member of this House who was involved in this whole sordid mess and who, irrespective  <Col N="1443" /> of party, fails to walk through the lobbies with this party in support of the motion in the name of Deputy Browne, should be condemned so far as this matter is concerned and should be regarded as not wishing the truth to be known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It had not been my intention to intervene in the debate and I would not intervene were it not for the fact that I consider it necessary to register my protest in the strongest possible terms against the arrogance and contempt with which this House and, as Deputy Cluskey has said, the country generally have been treated during this debate both by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>This debate arises out of an alleged attempt to import arms illegally.  As a result of that attempt four people, including the Taoiseach, were brought before the Central Criminal Court.  To use a hackneyed expression.  I do not think that any trial since the foundation of the State evoked such public interest and disquiet. It transpired that the four accused were acquitted by a jury but since that trial the Irish people have been suffering in one way or another from the events of 1970.</P>
      <P>The Government have been in office for about six years since then and during that time many Cabinet Members suffered the ill effects of those 1970 events as a result of which they were not in a position to give of their best in government. However, the country had to put up with that type of service from those people.  The matter continued to smoulder until this year when the <i>Magill</i> journal published three articles in which were made, both by implication and directly, very serious allegations against a number of people, the most important by far of whom was the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became evident that far from having lost interest in the 1970 arms trial the people were very interested to find out the truth.  They hoped that the diaries of the late Mr. Berry, which it was said would solve the problem, would bring out the truth.  I do not think there was ever such a demand for any publication <Col N="1444" /> as there was for the <i>Magill</i> journal.  Last week very many people were wondering who killed J.R. but that was nothing to the intense interest in the <i>Magill</i> magazine. The magazine was passed from house to house.  The articles in the journal made exceptionally serious charges against a number of people, both by implication and directly.  It is not pleasant to have to say it but it must be said that they accused the Taoiseach of perjury. An article in the magazine stated that a member of the Garda Síochána was murdered by a gun that was illegally imported through Dublin Airport.  It is not necessary to spell out all the accusations and allegations.  They are well known.  The general public expected that these disclosures would bring forth explanations or clarification of what happened in 1970.</P>
    <P>Very little was said.  Nothing was said by the man who had by them assumed the most important political position in the country, the Taoiseach.  There was a deafening silence from that front bench and from that man.  He was not elected Taoiseach by the people: indeed, although he was elected in the general election with a substantial vote it was not certain he would even become a Minister. However, after the resignation of Deputy Lynch he became Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It was in order to clarify the position and to put an end to the rumours, the disquiet and the unsettled state of affairs that this party put down the motion we are debating here.  Our motion stated that &ldquo;This House seeks clarification of the matters raised by these allegations&rdquo;. What did we find when the debate began and when the leader of Fine Gael put a number of very pertinent questions?  The Taoiseach did not see fit to come to this House during the debate and he has not yet come in.  He is not a shy man, he is not a man who shuns the limelight or the public.  Nevertheless he has not come here during the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, in a short and arrogant contribution, treated the House with contempt and relied on the verdict of the jury in a criminal prosecution.  We know that such a verdict of a jury in a criminal prosecution simply means that the State has failed to prove its case <Col N="1445" /> beyond all reasonable doubt.  It does not give its reason for acquittal, just as it does not give its reason for conviction.  There might be many reasons but we do not know what they are.  Extremely serious charges have been made since that trial and they have been made in the <i>Magill</i> magazine.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice leaned heavily on the acquittal by the jury and on the respect that should be had for the courts. If what was printed in the <i>Magill</i> magazine is incorrect it is highly libellous, but as far as we know there has not been even a solicitor's letter sent to the proprietors of that magazine asking for a withdrawal of an article or for denial.  We have no knowledge that any proceedings have been brought in the High Court by the Taoiseach to exonerate himself and to clear his name.  He has not even come here for this debate.</P>
    <P>As has been said here, the learned trial judge at the hearing stated that there was no question of doubt that either one of two people had committed perjury.  He said to the jury there could not be any other way out.  At least one of the two men had the guts to come to this House during the debate and stood up, even if only for a few minutes, to tell the House he had repudiated the charges against him on several occasions and that he stood over that repudiation.  That was what was meant by the contribution of Deputy Gibbons.  However, there has not been one solitary word from the other man who was included in the judge's remarks.  If that is not treating this House with contempt, I ask what is it.</P>
    <P>Democracy can stand a lot.  Democracy has stood a lot from time to time but there is a limit.  The treatment of this House by the Taoiseach, his Minister for Justice and by the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; because they are all behind him, as far as we know &mdash; is damaging democracy and is reducing the institutions of the State and this sovereign Parliament to a very low level.  We are experiencing difficult times.  The economy is in shambles, unemployment is increasing, inflation is double what it was a few years ago, for the first time in living memory county council roadmen are being dispensed <Col N="1446" /> with or are put on a three-day week.  We have in charge a Government who are more concerned with their internal troubles than they are with solving the economic problems besetting us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, spoke long about the courts and respect for the courts.  Since being appointed, the Taoiseach tried, without any jury and without any court, Deputy Gibbons, the former Minister in the previous Government, and sentenced him in connection with the arms trial.  I ask you, how could a Government who are labouring under troubles like that do the country's work?  I shall sit down on this note. I believe a very bad day's work has been done for the democratic institutions of this country, for this Dáil and for democracy by the fact that a man, head of this Government, who is charged subsequent to the trial with the offence of perjury, does not see fit to come into this House to take part in this debate, or to deny the charge, and will simply walk around here, with the force of feet, in a short time and say to our people &ldquo;You will get no clarification. You will get no explanation.  I will not tell you whether <i>Magill</i> is right or <i>Magill</i> is wrong, but I am here and I am going to stay here.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the firm conviction of not participating in this debate whatsoever but, having heard a little of what has been said here tonight and being aware of a great deal that has not been said here tonight or last night.  I come in to ask all three parties in this House this question: ten or 11 years after the event have they nothing better to do, with 200,000 odd unemployed in the entire country at the moment and the position worsening gradually?  Should we not be devoting the time of this House to trying to find some ways of curing the economic chaos which has now overtaken us?  With seven hunger-strikers dying above in Long Kesh should we not be concerning ourselves in this debate about what the future of this country will be if those men are allowed to die?  Instead of this there seems to be a competition, particularly from the two main Opposition parties, in regard to how much blame they can put <Col N="1447" /> on the Fianna Fáil Party or individual members of it for their alleged participation in what has been written up in a glorified sort of way in order to peddle the circulation of a particular magazine, subscribed to by a journalist who has not in the past been particularly concerned or anxious about getting to the truth, but rather about getting the sensationalism across to the public.  Should we not be thinking about what these things imply? Should we not be asking ourselves here tonight, who of all of us, who of any party in this House can stand up and say that back at the end of 1969 or the beginning of 1970 they did not encourage what they now condemn?  I say this from my knowledge of that time, not from hearsay or from what somebody has told me to say.</P>
      <P>When the delegations came down from Belfast after August of 1969 they did not just visit a few of the people then in Government.  They visited the leadership of each of the other parties as well.  I, as a northerner, had more contact with those people because of my being from the North than almost anybody else, particularly in the early and late days of 1969 and I was careful when they came not only to direct them to my colleagues in Government but to direct them to the leadership of each of the other two parties. In no case were they turned away. In no case were they told to get back up there again and behave themselves, as apparently they would be told today if they came down.  No, they were encouraged to go on and to press the Government of the day.  Fianna Fáil, to give them the assistance and the aid which they then so badly needed and which everybody in this country then recognised that they did need if they were not to be wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have this approach, ten or 11 years later.  They were not satisfied, a year or almost a year ago, with damaging the country by the personal attacks then being made on the incoming Taoiseach. whom I am not here to defend &mdash; far from it &mdash; but if you were outside the country, as I was, at the time that debacle <Col N="1448" /> of a debate took place here you would be ashamed that you belonged to this House, as I then was.  I am ashamed tonight that I am a Member of this House, listening to all this hypocrisy which is being talked here by those who now accuse others of attempting to help our own people in the Six Counties at that time.  And what was wrong with that? How has it become unfashionable?  Why is it not the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing which it was 11 years ago?  I shall tell you why and how. The British propaganda machine which has engulfed this country and all around and outside it has got through to the minds of so many of you that you are now almost afraid to recognise the fact that you are Irish.  We have here a Parliament calling itself Irish which is not prepared to stand up, as the Constitution dictates it should, and talk for its citizens, whether they are in the North or South, whether they are in British jails, Six County jails or Irish jails.  We are not prepared to do this now.  It is not fashionable any more, because the great British propaganda machine has brainwashed the lot of you.</P>
    <P>I have said that I am ashamed of being a Member of this House.  I am thoroughly ashamed of being a Member of this House to find that we have nothing better to do than to try to apportion blame, to try to blacken the people at this particular time, out of total context, with no regard to what the atmosphere then was or what encouragement of each of the parties was given to those who came South at that time looking for our assistance and, if that assistance was ours, who said to them that they should not have it?  How many of the parties that they visited told them to go back and have sense, as they would do now, and take credit and make a virtue out of it as they would do now?</P>
    <P>We are totally and absolutely removed from the realities which we faced in 1969 and 1970.  This whole sorry debate has taken place here now against the background of economic near chaos and a background in which we may be facing greater turmoil and trouble in this country than we have even dreamt of in the <Col N="1449" /> past.  Still we have time here to talk about who did what and about whether or not the accusations, innuendos or otherwise in the <i>Magill</i> magazine are correct and that it is an admission if one does not come into this House and deny it or come in to explain.  The court before which I was not charged and by which, therefore, I was not exonerated is of course, sacred when it comes to using it in the way that you would wish.  If it will support your cause you would be all clamouring over there about what it decided should be left untouched and unhindered in any way.  Surely the fact that the court, whether by jury trial or otherwise, found the case unproved, should be enough for those of you who either did not have any knowledge of what went on at the time or have changed their minds since because of the brainwashing they have got from the British?  How many Gerry Fitts have we got here in this House at the moment, the man who could not go to bed at night without four of the Provisional IRA being present, one at each corner of his house, and not so many years ago?  We have a lot of those at present, those who forget what has gone and forget entirely.</P>
    <P>I heard a Member speak about the non-justification for the actions of the people who are on hunger strike today and the organisation they allegedly represent. He said they had no justification for waging war and that any political recognition given to them as prisoners by this House would be authorising them to continue to wage that war.  Who declared war?  Was it not muddling Maudling who declared the war that he has never called off?  Who did he declare in on except the Irish people of the north-east of this country? Who were the people who had to try to defend their rights and themselves against muddling Maudling and his declaration of war?  Who was it who came down here and visited the heads of the three parties on several occasions in 1969 asking for help and asking for arms for the defence of the defenceless in the Six Counties?  Are they the people, or the descendants of them, who are today rotting in Long Kesh?  Many of them are. <Col N="1450" /> They were encouraged then by the leadership of all our parties, and rightly so. We then had a proper grasp of things but we have lost all that since.  We now seem to see a virtue in securing the very Border brought about by Partition that should never have been put there.  It is now virtuous to look after that, to secure as others have said, and as I have said on many occasions, the Border we do not want with the money we do not have and which we have to borrow in order to continue.  We clap ourselves on the back and tell the British what good boys we are.  That is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing today.  It is as wrong today as it would have been in 1969, 1920, 1921, 1922 or 1925.  It has been wrong all that time.  The sooner the better that this House collectively gets around to the idea that if we are worthy of the name of an Irish Parliament we should act as an Irish Parliament on behalf of the Irish people making our demand and our claim &mdash; our rightful claim &mdash; that Britain get out of this country and give us the opportunity once and for all &mdash; an opportunity which was denied to us 60-odd years ago &mdash; of finding our own solutions as to how we are to live together without the overbearing intimidatory presence of the British and their army and all that goes with them.</P>
    <P>We know all about this.  Those of us who live beside it come through it daily, weekly and yearly.  Many are more fully alive to the sort of situation that exists there.  However, there is this creeping paralysis brought about by the almighty propaganda of the Lisburn machine manipulated by the British Government that has blinded us completely and absolutely to the fact that in all these things we are dealing with an enemy that has been occupying our country for more than eight centuries and still does not have, apparently, any reason to go.  We in this House are certainly not asking her to go.  We do not want to do that because we might upset people if we did it.  We might not appear to be good boys in the European Community or in some of the other international forums we like to strut around and talk in.</P>
    <P>Let us cop ourselves on.  Let us realise that this country of ours, this Ireland of <Col N="1451" /> ours, is one country and that our people are one people.  Let us realise that it is not impossible for our traditions to live side by side.  I have lived among mixed traditions.  I come from an area that is of mixed traditions and it does not make that part of the country any more unbearable than any other part of the country. If it can be done in parts why cannot it not be done throughout the country? Why are we not pointing that out to the British?  Why is it that we do not have anything explaining our stance for world circulation when in every embassy of the British throughout the world there is the outpouring of propaganda handed out in order to cultivate the nations of the world to Britain's point of view that we in Ireland are an impossible lot, that we have never been otherwise, that we never will be otherwise and that they must keep a fatherly eye on us so that we do not do away with ourselves?  Why can we not put our case?  Why is it that we cannot in our embassies, fewer though they are than Britain's, put our case?  Why is it that we do not have available our side of the case?  Why is it not being put around? Why do we not put it in type and print? Why do we not give our version of what is wrong with this country as far as Britain and ourselves are concerned?  Why should we take all the propaganda from behind all the time?  Why is it that we do not have some of our embassy staff in the United States &mdash; I am not talking about the person the House might think I am talking about &mdash; putting our case?</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that on being asked for anything on the national question or the partition of this country people in America are being told that the embassy does not have anything but that if they went to the British embassy they might get something.  That is a sad fact. It is that sort of thing we should be talking about, if we have the time to devote to such matters.  We should be trying to get an understanding of our case across.  We should be trying to get the influence of the world's people to bring to bear on Britain that her role in Ireland is long since past, that she cannot continue and has no reason or justification to be here <Col N="1452" /> and that no matter how she might stupidly continue to incarcerate, jail and torture Irishmen because they will not accept the British yoke she is only prolonging the agony, not curing it.  Those of us in the South who have been misled into joining her in that attitude are further adding to the time it will take to get Britain to see the light and declare and decide that she is going before drawing herself from here in a nice orderly way. She has never done that anywhere she left.  She has gone out of everywhere else except here and everywhere else she stayed too long and left too hastily.</P>
    <P>Candidly, I do not give a damn if she goes out tonight.  I would choose that rather than that she continue with the chaos she is creating at present.  In order to try to be helpful I have over the years consistently asked &mdash; I ask this Parliament and Government to ask now &mdash; that she not only declare her intention to go but that she make it known a short time in advance, that she set the date of her withdrawal and that the interim period be devoted to finding out how we in the new circumstances of having to live without her &mdash; many of us could live a damn sight better without her; there may be a few who feel they could not &mdash; can govern our country.  North and South in the future.  That is a request, a demand that any Government, any Parliament describing itself as Irish should be making to the Premier of Great Britain, Mrs. Thatcher, and those around her.  That way would lead somewhere.  Our present attitude is not leading anywhere.</P>
    <P>I can say &mdash; I have been all too accurate in the past &mdash; that if things continue as they are at present, if the men on hunger strike are to die because they are not given the human rights that are their entitlement, then we all will regret the time we have wasted fiddling, as Nero did, while Rome burned, fiddling in this House about who did what in 1969 or 1970, or told the truth, or told all the truth or has all the truth been told.  At this stage I submit to the House that that is not important.  What is important is that we get on with trying to secure our <Col N="1453" /> own social and economic ills and at the same time with the greatest possible haste bring to the attention of the British that their treatment of our Irish citizens in this and in their own country is wrong.  It is of a nature which would not be allowed to happen in any other country in the world without there being an outcry about it. We talk about what is happening in Chile, Nicaragua and so on and so forth.  When we hear what is said about those things, we wonder why do we not apply the same strictures to what is happening in our midst here?  Why allow our people to die for a cause for which so many others have died in the past?  Surely that is what this House should stand for, instead of rattling each other to see who did what, who can be blamed, and what political advantage can be gained.</P>
    <P>I can see no political advantage in this debate.  I can see a great deal of disadvantage outside the country.  I can see a great deal of propaganda being made of it by the hard-line unionists who are ready to grasp at any straw to justify their not-an-inch attitude.  I can see it being used by the enemies of this country far and wide.  I can see it being used by those in Britain who want to retain their presence here, and we gladly give it to them when we come in here and take each other apart about something that is long gone and that is little understood now and of no consequence whatever when we are away from the realities of 1969.</P>
    <P>We should be joining together in this House demanding rights for the prisoners who are on hunger strike and in Long Kesh.  We should be joining together to try to pull our country together economically. As the lone voice of somebody who does not belong to any party in this House, and owes no allegiance to any party in this House, that is the plea I make here tonight.  It was to make that plea that I took up the time of the House. I consider the whole episode of this debate, its setting, its tone and its attitude, as a total, complete and absolute waste of the time of the House which could have been better used.  It will do damage to us outside the country in a manner we do not foresee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We will return to the subject of the debate from the wide <Col N="1457" /> periphery to which Deputy Blaney has brought us.  We sought in this debate to provide an opportunity for those in Fianna Fáil, against whom fresh allegations had been made concerning the events of 1970, to challenge or rebut those allegations and to vindicate themselves or, if they refused to do so, to demonstrate by their silence their inability or unwillingness to clear themselves.</P>
      <P>How was this opportunity used?  It was used by the Government to put in the Minister for Justice who demonstrated by his words and demeanour a lack of conviction in everything he said which did him and his Government no credit.  He attempted to suggest that we were retrying 1970.  The issues raised were fresh issues which were not tried in 1970.  They include from one Deputy a charge of perjury which had been made in the <i>Magill</i>articles.  The Minister spoke as if he were unaware of the fact that both witnesses and defendants in a trial who give evidence on oath and who perjure themselves are guilty of an offence.  That can be a fresh charge unrelated to and quite separate from the original trial.  I will not waste my time on the Minister.</P>
      <P>With regard to the people to whom questions were put by me through the Chair, arising from allegations made, several of them chose to speak.  Deputy Lynch dealt in detail with the Berry hospital incident and made a statement which we note that he had no knowledge of these matters from any source before 20 April.  We might have wished for a more detailed rebuttal of individual points put forward, but the Deputy made that overall statement and we note it. Deputy Lynch added one new fact to our knowledge, the fact that he had never heard of or known of the meeting between the then Minister for Justice, now Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, and the present Taoiseach, then Deputy Haughey, on 9 September 1970, until he read about it in <i>Magill.</i> That is the only new element that has emerged from this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons chose merely to stand on his previous testimony and did not under the privileges of this House develop it.  We are left to wonder why, <Col N="1458" /> and another question is added to those that surround this whole mysterious affair.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, who I understand is back in Ireland from Australia, and the Taoiseach, have chosen neither to appear nor to speak.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has chosen to remain silent about his meeting with the present Taoiseach on 19 November 1970 about which he did not inform his Taoiseach either before or afterwards despite his recent declaration of loyalty to that Taoiseach.  So long as the team opposite choose to hang together rather than hang separately we will have to wait perhaps for quite a while to find out whether this silence on the part of this Minister was felt by him to be necessary in order to avoid compromising himself or his Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's absence and silence speak for themselves.  The Taoiseach's absence demonstrates his contempt for the Dáil and for the people whom the Dáil represents.  It is ironic that on the same day the Taoiseach was involved in exchanges about proposed interparty discussions on how to make the Dáil more relevant, a Dáil which he treated with the contempt of his absence, content to sit in his room and listen to the debate on the loudspeaker without showing his face in the House.  It will be interesting to see if the Taoiseach comes down here for the division in due course when the speeches are over and there is no opportunity to say anything more, to vote with his feet against the amendment put forward by Deputy Browne.  The Taoiseach's silence leaves us to draw our own conclusions.  I do not attempt to spell them out.  I can only say that I cannot conceive of myself or of anyone in my party innocent of perjury failing to proclaim and vindicate such innocence if the charge of perjury were levelled against me or anybody behind me.</P>

      <P>The net effect of this debate, the silence from the key figures, has been to sustain the pattern of ambiguity  <Col N="1459" /> which is the hallmark of this Government. It is an ambiguity which is maintained for presumed political advantage, an ambiguity we saw demonstrated here yesterday over the H-block question, an ambiguity that was demonstrated in Donegal after Deputy Sile de Valera's speech.  This ambiguity is concerned exclusively with political advantage inside what Deputy Blaney calls this 26 county State.  The Taoiseach must realise &mdash; and if he does so he clearly does not care &mdash; something of the effect of this constant ambiguity on issues of this kind within Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach must know that in seeking political advantage by ambiguity here he is having a deadly effect on relations between North and South, between us and the Unionist community with whom we have eventually to come to an accommodation.</P>
      <P>The contrasts in our Government are striking enough for anyone whatever their prejudice towards us and whatever their views as to what they feel are the mistakes we made.  Nobody was ever in doubt as to where we stood, for example, on the issue of hunger strikes.  That is why no hunger striker died in Ireland while we were in government or has died here since 1946 when Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach maintained the position which was maintained by successive Governments. Everybody knew since then where Irish Governments stood, until now.  No one has ever died on hunger strike, or has attempted to push it to the extreme.  Will that still be true in the future or will there be unnecessary deaths not merely in Northern Ireland but here because of the decision to choose ambiguity rather than clarity on this crucial issue where the lives of people are at stake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also ambiguity in our approach to the North.  There was none when we were in government.  No one was in doubt about where we stood.  It was the clarity of our position that brought people to the conference table and brought us as far as Sunningdale, which at least for a period, until wrecked by British weakness in the face of what <Col N="1460" /> was effectively a rebellion, got the two sections sitting down in government with each other.  Can anyone imagine a Sunningdale with the participation of the Northern political parties, the British Government and the Irish Government taking place so long as this administration remain in power with the damage they have done to the credibility of this State?</P>
    <P>The distrust that has been created during the past 12 months may long outlive this Government.  It may take their successors years to get back to where we once stood with some measure of confidence existing between the Government here and at least a significant part of the Northern majority.  To those of us who care about peace and unity here, whose involvement in politics derives from that commitment and to those of us who would put it before anything else, before the interests of any one part of this island be it this 26-county State, all this is an unutterable tragedy postponing, God knows for how long, the day when real progress can be made to bring the two parts of Ireland together.  That is something to which many in this House on the other benches give lip-service and to which many of our people give lip-service, but it is something in which some of us actually believe and care about and wish, and have tried in government to do something about.</P>
    <P>After this debate nobody can fairly say that the issues raised in it are dead.  No one who saw the little band of Fianna Fáil Members who defied the anti-Whip to be here last night when Deputy Lynch and Deputy Gibbons were speaking could be in any doubt about the depth of the divisions of Fianna Fáil.  How many more were there in Fianna Fáil who would have liked to be here but who had not the courage to defy that anti-Whip? We provided an opportunity for people to clear themselves if they wished.  Two, notably rejected this opportunity.  As a result, all the doubts and suspicions remain.  The divisions in Fianna Fáil remain so deep that it has not been denied that the Taoiseach is not trusted by his own, with control over the two key security posts, so deep that many of his colleagues make no secret to the rest of <Col N="1461" /> us that they regard him with a loathing that transcends anything that has existed even between parties in this State since the embers of the civil war died down half a century ago, so deep that they are hopelessly at odds in economic policies at times, the State's finances are in ruins, its agriculture is in crisis and its economy stagnant.  Given the contempt with which the House has been treated by the Taoiseach and the cloud that he has allowed to hang not just over himself but, through him, over all in public life, we shall support the amendment to our motion proposed by Deputy Browne.</P>

      <P>I have given permission to Deputy Harte to raise on the adjournment the amalgamation of Birdstown school and Bridgend school in County Donegal.  The Deputy has eight minutes and the Minister four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because of the problems existing in a housing estate in Donegal known as Burnfoot. The children from the families in that area originally went to Birdstown school, and that school was amalgamated with Bridgend National School a few years ago. A promise was given that school transport would be provided, and that promise has not been honoured.  I have been trying to get information from the Department of Education as to how this problem can be resolved.  On the order Paper for one day last week I had a question down to the Minister for Education for written reply asking for some information and I was told that the children were to be accommodated in Saint Muras school.  However, there is no accommodation in Saint Muras school and we have about 40 children in the Burnfoot area at the moment who have been on strike since the beginning of the school term but because of the anxiety of the parents they have gone back to school now.  It is costing the parents about 50p per week for each child to be brought to Bridgend school by private transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told by the Ceann Comhairle that I cannot talk about school transport in this debate, but I understand that when schools are amalgamated one of the schools is closing down and amalgamated with an existing school at which accommodation will be provided.  There was no accommodation provided in St. <Col N="1467" /> Muras school.  The accommodation was provided at Bridgend school which is a new school and these children live three miles from it.  It is an injustice and a discrimination against these children that the Department of Education will not provide school transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I understand what the terms of allowing this question were.  But nobody can tell me that the amalgamation of schools means just providing accommodation at another school without providing transport.  I do not know of any other part of this State where this is happening.  It is grossly unfair of the Chair to put such restrictions on me.  The problem is not accommodation in St. Muras school, it is accommodation in Bridgend.  There is no problem about accommodation in Bridgend.  The problem is transport.  How can I talk about amalgamation, of children in Birdstown school being accommodated in Bridgend school without bringing up the problem of transport?  I have been trying, since the beginning of the summer, to get a decision from the Minister; I have been pushed from one civil servant to another; I have been trying to raise it in the House and I have been blocked in all directions, and now, because I talk about the basic problem in relation to the amalgamation of two schools, the Chair tells me that I can talk about amalgamation but not about transport, although the real problem is transport.</P>

      <P>Why cannot the Department of Education honour the promise made when Bridgend school was amalgamated with Birdstown?  I do not want to be heated about this but there are 40 children of poor families in a housing estate in Burnfoot who have been deprived of this basic right while children living between Burnfoot and the school they attend have been given tickets for free transport.  I am not saying a word against the children that have been given the tickets.  But I am appealing to the Minister to do something about these other children.  There is nothing difficult about resolving this.  It is simply a matter of someone taking the decision to provide a school bus to take 40 children to Bridgend school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of a Supplementary Estimate to put on a bus that is to travel three miles is ludicrous.  How ridiculous can we become?  It is ludicrous putting such restrictions on me.  The reason I am raising this in the Dáil now is that I can have no other means of raising it or making my complaints known.  I appeal to the Minister to do something.  These are ordinary working class people.  They cannot afford to pay more than is necessary for their children's education.  They are entitled to accommodation.  The Department of Education cannot accommodate them in St. Muras school which catchment area they are in.  For the last four or five years they have been attending Bridgend school where there is plenty of accommodation and it is only half a mile or a little more in the opposite direction. The children have been going to <Col N="1469" /> Bridgend school since Birdstown school closed and there has never been any difficulty about it other than the transport problem and the Department promised that free transport would be provided some time.  Up to now the people have been paying for that and the parish have been collecting the money to help to pay for it.  Would somebody in the Department of Education listen to the voice of reason?  Would somebody of some sympathy do something for these ordinary working class people, who are now being forced either to keep their children at home or pay for them to go to Bridgend or make them walk the very dangerous main road between the town of Buncrana and Derry?  Those are the facts and I am asking the Chair to allow me make this appeal to the Minister.  The accommodation provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, in deference to his wishes I shall give the history of the case.</P>

      <P>The background to this amalgamation goes back to the mid-sixties when efforts were being made to effect a rationalisation in the educational facilities in the Bridgend area of County Donegal.  Following a report from an inspector of my Department in which it was recommended that a new national school should be built at Bridgend to replace the existing schools at Bridgend, Moness, Carrowen and Birdstown proposals to this effect were made in April 1966 to the then manager of the four schools.  The manager replied to the effect that while he felt Birdstown should be left out of the scheme for the present the proposed arrangement for the amalgamation of the other three schools in a new school at Bridgend was acceptable. At that time there were 225 pupils and nine teachers in the four schools, with two teachers and about 45 of the pupils being in Birdstown school.</P>
      <P>In July 1966 the manager was requested to secure a site in Bridgend for the proposed new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1967 the manager, who by then <Col N="1471" /> had four possible sites in mind for the proposed school requested that they be inspected.  One of the sites was accepted and the Manager was asked to furnish the necessary legal title.  In January 1970, the Department fixed the level of grant which was adjusted to a higher figure following representations to the Department.</P>
    <P>In 1971 the principal of the one-teacher, 25 pupil school at Carrowen died and it was agreed between the school management and the parents that the school should close and be amalgamated with the two-teacher school at Birdstown in which there was accommodation for the pupils.  Free transport was provided for the parents of the closed school district to Birdstown school.</P>
    <P>In March 1972 the manager furnished legal title to the proposed school site at Bridgend which was accepted as satisfactory. In April 1973, following the preparation of sketch plans and working drawings a tender was accepted and a contract placed for the building of the new school.</P>
    <P>Since Carrowen school, which it had been agreed would amalgamate with the new school at Bridgend, had closed and amalgamated with Birdstown the question of the inclusion of Birdstown in the central school was raised with the Manager in April 1973.  The manager replied in his letter of 25 April 1973 in the following terms:</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion and would voice the approval of the parents on the proposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> Arrangements were then made to provide an additional classroom in the central school.</P>
    <P>In April 1975 the new school opened and the three existing schools, two of which were in very bad condition closed. At the time of amalgamation the combined enrolment of the three schools was 225 pupils and the seven teachers in the three schools were retained in the new school under a special arrangement applicable to the teachers employed in the schools at the time of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>At present there are 308 pupils enrolled in the Bridgend central school and a principal and 8 assistant teachers employed there.  The accommodation comprises 6 classrooms, a general purposes room and one prefabricated building.  On the basis of forecasts of future enrolments it has been decided that an additional three permanent classrooms and a new enlarged general purposes room of 1,200 square feet should be provided.  Sketch plans of the proposed scheme have been prepared and in addition to the accommodation which I have already mentioned it is planned to adapt the existing general purposes room to provide a principal's room, a remedial teaching room and a library.</P>
    <P>When these works are completed the school will provide first-class facilities for the present and future needs of the area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 November 1980.</P>

      <P>The grant of this rates relief, which supplements the various incentives to industrial development made available from the Exchequer, is entirely within the discretion of the local authorities concerned. There are no funds at my disposal from which the full cost could be recouped to these local authorities.  Portion of the cost would, however, fall to be borne by the Exchequer which through the various general grants in relief of rates meets about 60 per cent of the amount which would otherwise fall to be met by the general body of ratepayers in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from a number of sources to the effect that the building industry in Galway has <Col N="1306" /> been particularly affected by the difficulties which were experienced by the industry generally in the first three quarters of this year.</P>
      <P>This Government, fully appreciating the primary importance of the building industry in the economy, have given particular consideration to it in the context of the new national understanding including a commitment to maintain employment in the industry up to the end of 1981 at the high level obtaining in December 1979.</P>
      <P>The recent decision to provide substantial additional capital for the 1980 Public Capital Programme is an indication of the Government's commitment in this regard.  Of the £97 million provided, £66 million will be related to expenditure affecting the building industry.</P>
      <P>Galway city and county will have a share in the greater building activity generated by this capital investment and will benefit appropriately from the Government's commitment on the maintenance of employment.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the building industry was allowed to collapse between 1974 and 1976.  Public capital expenditure affecting the industry declined by 4.5 per cent in 1974, a further 7 per cent in 1975 and a further 6 per cent in 1976.  Direct employment also dropped by 9,000 between April 1974 and April 1976.</P>

It is not possible to state the percentage of the total income the persons in each category receive since income arising in industry and services is distributed to persons (including employers, self-employed and employees) in other sectors and also to persons not in the labour force and abroad.

      <P>Provision is being made for expenditure in this area in next year's Estimate in a separate subhead.

    <P>There is an on-going programme of improving all occupied military properties in so far as resources permit.  Details of improvements recently carried out in the Dublin properties are being compiled and will be communicated to the Deputy, together with an indication of other improvements in hands or proposed to be carried out in the near future.</P>
    <P>The accommodation is generally adequate and of a satisfactory standard. There are no plans at present to replace any of the barracks.  The question of providing a new military complex outside Dublin to replace one of the Dublin city barracks was studied during the period mentioned.  However, a Dublin barracks would not be available for disposal until all the personnel, equipment and stores <Col N="1330" /> there and the families of personnel occupying married quarters at the barracks had been accommodated elsewhere.  The financial and service implications of this would have been onerous.  Because of these considerations and the increased strength of the Permanent Defence Force the question was not pursued.  All military barracks in the Dublin area are required for use by the Defence Forces and will continue to be so required for the foreseeable future.</P>

    <P>Costs only are available in the following cases:</P>
    <P>Farm Modernisation Scheme&mdash;The provision of an extra £15 million under the farm modernisation scheme (including the western drainage scheme) to enable claims under this scheme to be cleared up to date was announced last September.  In the Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture introduced in Dáil Éireann on 20 November provision was included for a further £8 million for this purpose making a total extra provision of £23 million this year.</P>
    <P>Headage Payments in disadvantaged areas&mdash;The increase of £10 flat on the previous rates of £22 and £18 for cattle and beef cows will add £10.8 million in a full year to the gross cost of the scheme of which 50 per cent will be recouped later through FEOGA.</P>
    <P>Sheep&mdash;The increase in the subsidy from £1.50 to £3.00 per head under the mountain lamb extension scheme will cost approximately £90,000.  Under the common organisation of the market introduced on 20 October 1980 a compensatory premium estimated at approximately £7 per ewe in a full year but depending on the actual level of market prices, will be payable on good quality ewes.  At £7 per ewe this would amount to about £11 million.</P>
    <P>Aid for Warble Fly Campaign&mdash;The assistance being provided to keep the cost <Col N="1333" /> of warble dressing to farmers this year at last year's level will amount to £600,000.</P>
    <P>Farm Relief Services&mdash;The annual grant to Macra na Feirme is being increased by up to £20,000 per annum for five years to enable that body to organise and co-ordinate the establishment of local farm relief services on a group basis.</P>
    <P>Rates&mdash;The removal of the obligation on farmers in the £40 to £60 RV (approximately 20,600) to pay the second moiety of rates this year will cost £6 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing it was also indicated in the package that, arising out of Government discussions with the four associated banks and the ACC, the latter bodies would (a) take a constructive and positive approach to the restructuring of existing loans on a case by case basis where farmers are faced with serious repayment problems and (b) make available  <Col N="1334" /> at lower interest rates for productive investment in agriculture up to £100 million from foreign borrowings.  Information as to the number of cases dealt with under (a) and (b) above is not available to my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of births in the State for the last 20 years indicating the male/female breakdown and the geographic and county-by-county distribution; and if he will make a statement on the implications of the known trends in these respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested is contained in the following tables.  The main trends illustrated by these tables are:</P>
      <P>(a)  There was an overall increase in the number of births, from 60,735 in 1960 to 72,352 in 1979.</P>
      <P>(b)  The increase was not consistent. There were some periods of decline. In particular, there was a continuing decline from 1964 to 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  The increase was unevenly distributed between counties.  For example, comparing 1960 with 1979, the counties which had a greater than 20 per cent increase in births were Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow, Limerick, Clare, Louth, Meath, Donegal, Waterford, Wexford and Cork.  Counties which had a decline in births in 1979 when compared with 1960 were Laois, Longford,  <Col N="1338" /> Offaly, Cavan, Leitrim, Tipperary (SR), Mayo and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>(d)  The male/female ratio has remained fairly consistent.  It was 1.052 in 1960 and 1.060 in 1979.</P>
    <P>It may be implied from these trends that a number of factors were involved. Some of these factors tended to increase the number of births; some acted as a constraint on this increase.</P>
    <P>1.  The increase in births over this period was in step with the increase in population.  The birth rate &mdash; number of births per 1,000 total population &mdash; was 21.5 in both 1960 and 1979.</P>
    <P>2.  The number of marriages taking place increased from 15,465 in 1960 to 20,864 in 1979 with a peak of 22,833 in 1974.  The marriage rate &mdash; number of marriages per 1,000 total population &mdash; was 5.5 in 1960 and 6.2 in 1979.</P>
    <P>3.  The average age of the bride has decreased.  It was 27.1 years in 1960 and had decreased to 24.1 years by 1976.</P>
    <P>4.  There was a change from net emigration to net immigration during this 20-year period.  In the period 1961 to 1971 estimated net emigration amounted to about 135,000 while in the period 1971 to 1979 estimated net immigration was about 109,000.  The great majority of the emigrants during these periods were in the child-bearing age groups.</P>
    <P>5.  Internal migration had an impact in the distribution of births between counties. Inward migration was experienced particularly in Dublin and the surrounding counties.</P>
    <P>6.  The age specific fertility rates of married women have declined, particularly in the case of the older women in the child-bearing age groups.  This has resulted in a general decrease in average family size.  An illustration of this decrease is that in 1960 22 per cent of all births were to mothers who already had 4 children while the corresponding figure for 1976 was 9 per cent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the serious financial position of farmers at present, in particular small farmers, he will direct county councils to give the same percentage refund of rates to farmers under £40 valuation as has been given to farmers between £40 and £60 valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers with land valuations between £40 and £60 have been relieved of half the current rates on their holdings under the terms of the recently announced relief measures.  Farmers with land valuations under £40 already qualify for relief of rates on land under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts, 1939 to 1980 as follows: rated occupiers of holdings with land valuations of £20 or less receive full relief of rates; rated occupiers of holdings with land valuations of more than £20 and less than £33 receive full relief of rates on the first £20 valuation; rated occupiers of holdings with land valuations of £33 or over but less than £40 receive relief of 80 per cent <Col N="1368" /> of the rates on the first £20 valuation and 30 per cent of the rates on the portion of the valuation over £20.</P>
      <P>Thus for farmers with land of under £40 valuation, the relief given exceeds half the rates which would otherwise be payable on the land valuations concerned.</P>
