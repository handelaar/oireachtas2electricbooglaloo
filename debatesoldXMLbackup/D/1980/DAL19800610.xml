      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will be making any references at the forthcoming European Council meeting, which he will be attending, to (i) the proposed settlement of Britain's EEC budgetary contribution and (ii) the effect of the settlement on Ireland's EEC contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he proposed to indicate the Irish Government's decision on the person to be nominated as Irish member of <Col N="2" /> the EEC Commission for the next four-year term, at the forthcoming European Council meeting; and if, in this context, any indication has yet been given to our EEC partners of the area of policy preferred by the Irish Government for our new Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>It would not be in accordance with normal practice to indicate in advance what I may or may not say at the next meeting of the European Council or, at this stage, to give the other information sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the second portion of the question, would the Taoiseach agree that from the accounts given so far of the settlement of Britain's contribution, the implication of that settlement in future years will be a rising contribution from this country?  In these circumstances would he agree that it would be important and necessary, from a national point of view, that reference would be made to this aspect of Britain's settlement of their contribution at the next meeting?  In relation to Question No. 3, would the Taoiseach agree that, in the present circumstances, the person holding the office of Commissioner to the European Community is holding an office of as much importance to the future of this country as the person holding the office of Taoiseach and would the Taoiseach agree that it is important that at this early stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A brief question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the Taoiseach has to be brief I suppose I must be a little long-winded to get a brief reply from him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in order that I ask this important question.  Because of the importance of that post for the future of our economy, would the Taoiseach agree that, at this early stage, we should now be seeking an important policy area of responsibility and also perhaps at this stage, though not as important that we should be clearing our minds as to who the person to fill that post should be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the settlement of British budgetary problems will not be on the agenda or will not be discussed in Venice, but I agree with the Deputy that the implication for us, in monetary terms, is important.  We shall have an opportunity of discussing that <Col N="4" /> here on another occasion.  When the Deputy was elaborating that the post of President of the Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Commissionership. When he was elaborating that this was as important as the Office of the Taoiseach, I was speculating that he might perhaps be considering going on to suggest that I might go myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Levity apart, could I attract the attention of the Taoiseach? Would he agree that it has been the experience of previous Governments that early indication of the area of policy responsibility preferred by the Irish Government is probably the means best conducive to getting an important policy area?  Experience has been, in our membership of the Community so far, that we have achieved peripheral area of responsibility in the Commissionship.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that early indication of the area of responsibility is the means best conducive to getting an important area rather than simply a token area responsibility, as has been our experience in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, questions have started and at this stage I am raising a point of order which arises from the fact that there are two questions on the Order Paper relative to the same matter which is dealt with in Question No. 3 to the Taoiseach to-day. These questions, Nos. 99 and 100, were put down by me three weeks ago, asking the Taoiseach to outline the Government's attitude to the appointment of the new President to the Commission and also making reference to the appointment of the Irish Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>While the construction of the road along the shore at Killybegs is a matter for the Donegal County Council, the site of the road lies for the most part within the Fishery Harbour Centre which is under my control.  The granting of permission for the provision of entrances to the road to adjoining property owners would require the approval of the Minister and council and each application would need to be considered on its <Col N="26" /> merits.  I understand that, whereas the granting of pedestrain access would be in order, the provision of openings for vehicular traffic might create problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

      <P>Property owners would need to establish by documentary evidence their title to access.  I am informed that Donegal County Council have refused planning permission in some cases for certain reasons to do with access.  There would be a certain amount of difficulty in providing for the access of vehicular traffic to this road because it might cause congestion in an area which has been laid out specifically for berthage piers and a boatyard.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer the Deputy to the Adjournment debate of 23 April 1980&mdash;column 1980 of the Official Report&mdash;where Deputy Quinn asked a question concerning that matter. On that occasion I informed the House that we had changed the system of answering representations to a new format, whereby we introduced the idea of forecasting.  Certain allegations were made by Deputies on all sides of the House&mdash;I think correctly&mdash;that when they went to the Departments local offices regarding the installation of a telephone they were told the file was in Dublin in the Minister's office.  Constituents then asked Deputies to make further representations on their behalf. We have now changed the system and I hope it is working reasonably well.  It may not be completely perfect initially but we hope it will be successful in the long-term.  When I was speaking in this House on 30 May 1980 in the debate on the Estimate for my Department, I said at column 1305 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I will be impartial to the best of my ability with every elected member of this and the <Col N="34" /> other House.  When they make representations on behalf of individuals in their constituencies, they are entitled to that service, irrespective of which side of the House they are on.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies are aware of the efforts I am making in this matter to ensure that there will be no confusion at local level.</P>

While I appreciate the difficulty with regard to files being referred to Dublin, I should like the Minister of State to deal with the matter of a query made to the secretary of the Department in Dublin.  I should like to know why such a query is referred to the Minister and replied to by him?</P>

I have tried to do my best in the most impartial way.  When any Deputy, irrespective of his party, makes representations concerning a constituent I always reply to such correspondence.  I have tried to be impartial but if the Opposition are not satisfied with the new system we can revert to the old situation.</P>

If a Deputy makes representations on paper to me or to any official in the Department it will be answered through my office.  Do Deputies want it that way?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a point of order earlier which the Chair invited me to raise at the end of Question Time.  The point related to the transfer of questions and it is highlighted by the fact that two questions now listed as numbers 99 and 100 on the Order Paper relative to the appointment of a President and a new Commissioner to the EEC were put down by me two or three weeks ago to the Taoiseach.  Today I find on the Order Paper a question relating to the same subject matter from Deputy O'Leary which is apparently accepted by the Taoiseach.  On what basis are these questions accepted or rejected by the Taoiseach?  Is there some suggestion that <Col N="72" /> if the Taoiseach wishes to evade a question that he does not want to reply to, he can merely direct it from his Department to some other Minister's Department? This is a very serious matter that should be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has no responsibility in this matter. The Chair sends the questions to the Minister to whom they are addressed.  If the questions office are informed afterwards that the question has been transferred to another Minister, the Chair takes no further part in it.  The rulings all down the years have been that the Minister to whom the question is addressed may transfer it to another Minister to whose administration he feels the question is more relevant.  The Chair has no power to compel a Minister to answer.  That ruling has been given on various occasions in this House.  The Chair has no further responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Chair's point of view but in the light of this situation which is highlighted by these questions today, will the Taoiseach comment on the position, as it is he or his Department who presumably redirect questions, seemingly at will?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I have any function in the matter either but as I understand the position questions are directed to the member of the Government who has statutory responsibility for that area.  If a question comes into my office or the office of any other Minister and is, in accordance with ministerial regulations, the responsibility of some other Minister, then the question is transferred to that other departmental person.  I assure the Deputy that I have no wish to evade answering any question.</P>

When I was practising as a solicitor stamp duty was paid if one applied for a temporary dance licence, annual dance licence, special exemption or an extension of hours for a club.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different matter. What is being introduced is an excise duty on these licences.  I have indicated that there has not been an excise duty hitherto.  As regards what Deputy Barry said, I indicated in the budget statement that I intended to introduce a provision of this nature.  I also indicated the reasons and, having regard to the rates of revenue in the areas in which it is to be collected, I indicated clearly that it was my opinion, as distinct from the amount of money involved which is not a major element, that it would be approiate <Col N="81" /> and in accordance with the socio-economic climate to look to this and other areas.  I saw this as being an element of the pursuance of equity in the taxation code generally and that it would be appropriate that areas such as those I am now making provision for should be subject to some such charge.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that this might have been announced in the Finance Bill earlier.  In view of the extensive nature of this year's Bill and the matters to be covered in some of the resolutions I have introduced by way of ease and concession&mdash;there will be further resolutions of that nature&mdash;it was not possible to have all these included in the original text of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Some parts of the duties being imposed are very much a tax on the young.  I am particularly concerned about the one in regard to a dance licence.  There are annual dance licences in respect of which £100 will be levied.  There are also monthly licences in respect of which the Minister proposes to levy £15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many small clubs, tennis clubs, GAA clubs and so on that run one dance in the year.  They obtain a monthly licence even though it is only for one dance.  The Minister should bear in mind that this will be an additional <Col N="82" /> charge on top of what they have to pay from the point of view of court fees and so on and it will make the running of such dances a very uneconomic proposition. I suggest to the Minister that some extension or way out should be provided for clubs and organisations running a single dance in the year.  The effect of the present situation is that the Minister may rule out that possibility for them altogether.</P>
    <P>The other charges are very high from the point of view of the annual dance of local Fianna Fáil cumainn.  If they want an exemption, apart from the present court fees to be paid, they will be paying £25 for the special exemption, which will materially increase the cost.  I accept that many special exemptions are obtained because the Acts dealing with intoxicating liquor, which we would be better off without, have not been updated. There are many organisations who run an annual dance and this charge will affect them.  The Minister's statement that he is merely introducing equity in the tax system rings hollow.  In many cases these additional levies will amount to a tax on young people and the Minister should think twice before proceeding with this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sports organisations rely for their finances on this kind of dance. The Government are giving substantial sums of money to sports organisations. It seems to be silly and very much a circular payment situation for the Government to give out money to clubs to establish facilities and then, by imposing a tax on dances, deprive them of an independent source of revenue.  It would be better to encourage them to finance themselves by giving them the opportunity of running dances without this kind of tax rather than involving them in the bureaucracy of giving grants and at the same time taking taxation from them.  The Minister should consider exempting sports clubs from these taxes. He is a man who is interested in encouraging sports and I am sure he is aware that these dances are one of the ways they get revenue to enable them to do their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected that £400,000 will be collected under this tax from people who are not in a position to pay it.  The Minister should bear in mind that many of the dances held on an annual basis are held for charitable purposes and the promoters of such functions must now pay the usual stamp duty together with this new excise duty.  There is no doubt that the admission charges to such functions will have to be increased as a result of that.  Many sporting organisations run dances to get them out of financial difficulties which arose because they crected halls to cater for such games as badminton and table tennis and they will now be penalised. The only source of revenue for such organisations was through dances.  Taking into consideration the additional tax imposed on mineral waters and this tax in relation to dances, the budget has hit young people very hard.  We should be helping clubs involved in promoting games for our youth instead of discouraging them.  This tax on dances will be a disincentive to them.  It is unfair and inequitable.  The Minister spoke of bringing equity into the tax system but he has not done so in relation to this matter.  It is, in fact, unjust.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is an evil taking place at present in the form of dancing in licensed premises such as hotels and restaurants.  Legitimate dance halls which operate on the lines stated by Deputy Enright are under pressure from such licensed premises.  Rural and urban halls that do not have a liquor licence are finding it difficult to carry on because of competition from licensed hotels and lounge bars.  I appeal to the Minister to exclude halls that do not have a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor from his proposals.  I am sure the Minister will agree that there is a big demand for such an amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Deputies opposite and they should give me an opportunity to deal with the points they put forward.  This provision is in respect of four different areas, the first of which is the annual public dancing licence for dance halls.  The proposed duty will be £100 for the year.  For a shorter period, which normally amounts to one month, the charge will be £15. That is the only element that relates to dancing as distinct from the main characteristic of the provision, occasional licences, special exemption orders or authorisations under the Intoxicating Liquor Act&mdash;the other three elements I spoke of.  The dance hall licence will cost £100 per annum and £25 for occasional licences granted under sections 11 or 13 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  The latter entitles a publican to sell intoxicating liquor at a place other than his own licensed premises on the occasion of a special event such as a convention or dinner dance.  I understand that this licence, apart from allowing for the sale of intoxicating liquor outside normal drinking hours, can be for a period of up to nine days.  The third element imposes an excise duty of £25 on every special exemption order issued under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts permitting late drinking.  Those orders are issued only to hotels and restaurants in respect of special occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not taking on the role of the Minister for Justice but I should like to mention that in 1979 more than 42,000 special exemption orders were issued. These proposals are directed, not against dance halls, but in respect of exemptions and extensions of late night drinking authorisations in clubs.  In my view they are matters which call for an appropriate contribution.  In my budget statement I made it clear that while I do not present myself as a killjoy&mdash;from my habits or otherwise I do not think I can be seen as <Col N="85" /> such&mdash;I feel that there are areas of life, whether it be racecourse betting, late night drinking or exemptions for dances and discos or otherwise, which should make an appropriate contribution.  My proposal is geared towards that.  I do not accept that this is a tax on the young. There may be the exceptional case, but if the Opposition persist in suggesting that this represents a tax on the young they might as well go further and acknowledge that it is the young who are engaged in late night drinking.  That may be true, but as far as my responsibility goes I want to ensure that all those areas are subject to an appropriate contribution. I do not think I have imposed an impossible position on dance halls by raising the licence fee to £100 per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us of the three elements but I should like to know what the position is in relation to the fourth, clubs and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be £25 on authorisations issued under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts to those clubs that are registered under the Registration of Clubs Act to sell intoxicating liquor outside the normal hours. Each club is entitled to a maximum of 15 authorisations per year.  This is for the sale of intoxicating liquor outside normal hours.  I want to make clear that we are not talking about charities, about voluntary organisations being crucified.  People may say that, but anybody who attempts to bring in any amending provisions here will find, as was found in the course of other discussions, that you can always say what you want in plain language but when you begin to put it down either in a resolution or in legislation you find that while it covers 95 per cent of the cases you have in mind there may always be the 3 or 4 per cent of cases that are not specifically what you are concerned with also included.  The reality is that in dealing with the issue, sometimes the problem, you may find that some very exceptional cases are also covered.</P>

They have to apply for a temporary dance licence.  They have to pay about £10 in respect of dance duty, court fees on application and so on.  Now they will have to pay a separate £15.  I suggest to the Minister that this is the worst aupect of the matter as I see it. Apart from the fact there is no drinking involved, young people are involved <Col N="87" /> and local voluntary organisations are involved and there is a strong case to be made to remove those categories from this levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When I reported progress I was pointing out that I disagreed very violently with the proposed resource tax. This tax seems to be contrary to the explicit intention in the budget which stated that the Minister proposed through the budget to introduce greater equity into the taxation system.  This resource tax does exactly the opposite.  It is based on an inaccurate and discriminating yardstick, the poor law valuation system.  I do not have to argue that that system is unfair, out of date, and discriminatory as between one holding and another.</P>
      <P>As an example I pointed out that County Monaghan is one of the most heavily valued counties notwithstanding that in modern times and for all State benefits it is included in the 12 western counties which are regarded as underprivileged counties.  County Monaghan is valued more or less as equal to County Kildare.  I hardly need say more.  A 70-acre farm in County Monaghan has £100 valuation while a 70-acre farm in County Kildare has £95 valuation.  It is unbelievable that any comparison could be made between the two counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resource tax seeks to consolidate this unfair and inequitable system of rates by removing the agricultural relief grant and thereby increasing rates from £200 to £500 on a poor law valuation of £40 and at the same time introducing <Col N="88" /> this resource tax, which is another form of rating.  In my opinion this resource tax is a direct repudiation by Fianna Fáil of their solemn promise given through Deputy Lynch, the former Taoiseach, not to transfer rates removed from private houses to land or business premises.  When the manifesto was published and when the promise was seen to be made by Fianna Fáil to deal with private houses, the Opposition and others said: &ldquo;If they do that, they will transfer the rates foregone in this way to business premises or to land.&rdquo;  Deputy Jack Lynch, then leader of Fianna Fáil, gave a solemn assurance that there would be no such transfer of rates.  What is this other than a transfer of rates from private housing to land?  In addition to abolishing the agricultural relief grant in three stages since they came to power down to £40 valuation, thereby saving the State £17 million, they now introduce what I call a two-tier rating system by imposing a rate of £3.50 per £ on valuations of £70 or over.</P>
    <P>This resource tax has no regard to the capacity of a person to pay.  I know and the Minister knows a farmer in County Monaghan with a valuation of £81 who has a very large family and who last year was in such poor circumstances that he had to be paid a disabled person's allowance by the North Eastern Health Board.  That same farmer will now be called on to pay a resource tax this year of £280.  Deputy Leonard also knows about this because the Minister wrote to Deputy Leonard saying that it was a hardship case but he could not do anything about it.  That is the one hardship case that we may be able to point to in such clear terms but it is an example of the inequity and injustice of this tax.  Of all years that the Minister might choose to impose a resource tax on farmers, an additional tax, surely this is not the year, because farmers' incomes this year, according to all the reports and studies that have been made, will be well down, down by at least 10 per cent.  I am sure they will be down by more than that.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to develop all these points, but another point is that <Col N="89" /> this resource tax is a direct discouragement to agricultural production because if the farmer has to pay hundreds of pounds on top of additional rates he will have less money for artificial manure, for lime and for stock, and never in our history was an increase in agricultural production more necessary.  Looking at the most recent report available, that of the Central Bank, we see that the most alarming aspect of our economy at present is our balance of payments.  This year it will be over £700 million again. What will this tax do for our balance of payments?  It will depress agriculture, reduce agricultural production, reduce agricultural exports and exacerbate the disastrous state of our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>This is a reckless performance.  The Minister has told us that the reason he is introducing this crazy system of taxation is to put an end to avoidance of taxation. He apparently looked back and saw that last year or the year before some farmers did not pay as much as they should have, but he has the income tax machinery to deal with that.  He is simply saying that, regardless of income and regardless of their capacity to pay, farmers will have to pay £3.50 per each £1 poor law valuation.</P>
    <P>We all know that evasion of tax goes on all over the country but I have not seen any Minister come in here with a proposal to put a flat rate of tax on professional men because it was thought some of them evade taxation.  I have not seen any proposal from the Minister to put a flat rate resource tax on business people because some of them do not pay all the tax they should pay.  Why has the Minister picked out the farming community this year in direct denial of the promise made to them by the former Taoiseach that this sort of tax would not be paid?</P>
    <P>Several Ministers have said that farmers are prepared to pay the same tax as everybody else and the Minister for Finance tells us that this is what he is doing with this resource tax.  The resource tax is a unique tax, a rate upon a rate, a method of taxation which has not been <Col N="90" /> applied to anybody else.  There are 82 Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who could come in here to give their views on this tax but I have not heard any of them coming in here to defend this tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed to see the Minister, who represents a rural constituency, bring in this resource tax.  People who live in rural Ireland who meet farmers are aware of the great difficulties the agricultural community are facing at the moment.  The people I discuss agricultural matters with are seriously concerned at the disastrous trend in <Col N="91" /> agriculture during the past 12 to 18 months.  The Minister's predecessor made a very grave blunder in bringing in the 2 per cent levy.  Members of the Fine Gael Party asked the Government at that time to withdraw the 2 per cent levy. In spite of every warning from us and from the IFA leaders as well the introduction of the 2 per cent levy went ahead.  Forecasts were made that there would be a drop in production and in livestock numbers but pleas to the Government went unheeded.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now brought in the resource tax.  Would the Government not consider the livestock figures which were published earlier this year?  Those figures show a serious drop in cow and heifer numbers.  This is the first occasion on which I have seen those numbers drop. The numbers rose over many years and now instead of a levelling off there is a drop in numbers.  I am in touch with the farming community and they are being pressed on all sides by rate collectors, banks, the ACC and people in all business demanding that they meet their debts.  They are unable to meet those commitments because of the unprecedented difficulties they have experienced.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that this resource tax would not be a permanent tax. Nobody said how long it will be there.  I forecast that it will be the deathknell of the Government.  If that resource tax is on the Statute Book when Fianna Fáil go to the country instead of the 82 Deputies they have at the moment they will be lucky if they come back with 40 Deputies.  The resource tax has the most serious implications for our agricultural industry.  Any Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party who has any common sense must realise the grave blunder the Government are making by introducing this tax. I ask the Government, in the interests of Irish farming, to remove this tax.  If they have not withdrawn it by the time they go to the country the people will show them their dislike of it.  The system on which the tax is worked out is unjust and it should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I dealt with this at great length on the last day and I do not intend to go back over it, but a few points have arisen today upon which I should comment, particularly in relation to the valuation system as a basis for taxation.  Deputy Fitzpatrick particularly commented on this at some length.  He emphasised the anomalies of the rateable valuation system.  There are anomalies in the system of which we are aware.  I was impressed by the conviction and almost vehemence with which he delivered his case against valuations as a basis of taxation in any event, but I think back to when the taxation of farming profits first came in and the Government of which he then was a member adopted the rateable valuation system as the criterion for farm tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me finish because I do not want to be cross-examined in my speech.  When I sit down the Deputy may cross-examine me. There are anomalies in the PLV system <Col N="93" /> of course, but farm organisations, farm leaders and farmers generally&mdash;I am talking about the vast majority of farmers because, as Deputies opposite have said, I live amongst farmers and have done so for a considerable time &mdash;recognise that if you were to iron out the anomalies by a new system it would probably be found that for the vast majority of farmers it would work out worse than the present system.  That is not the view of the Opposition Fine Gael Party.  They have said that they propose to change this but I do not believe that that proposition is supported by farmers generally because they recognise that, while there are anomalies and some limited number may be at the wrong end of the anomalies, the vast majority of farmers benefit from the anomalies.  Farmers are more conscious of that than the Fine Gael Party seem to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section marginal relief in respect of resource tax will be available to persons in the range of £70 to £79 valuation.  Those on £70 rateable valuation will pay only £24.50 under the resource tax.  That is one-tenth of the full tax charged.  Those on £71 rateable valuation will pay two-tenths, and so on.  The full charge under the resource tax will not come into operation until one reaches £79 valuation, at which point the charge will be £276.50.  I should say that a substantial number of farmers, approximately 3,000, will benefit from the marginal relief provisions under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This marginal relief should have extended up to £100.  There are farmers in certain parts of the country with valuations of up to £100 who have quite low incomes.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick illustrated, there are instances of farmers with this valuation in particular parts of the country who have practically no income at all.  Therefore the marginal relief should be extended higher than £80.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 27 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very strongly opposed to this.  When income tax was first introduced rates were allowed as an expense against income tax.  Subsequently in 1978 they were allowed to be considered as an actual payment of income tax but it is proposed here that this resource tax will not even be allowed as an expense, let alone as a payment or an instalment of income tax.  Regardless of what level of taxation one might pay one will pay resource tax.  One could be in a situation where one would earn nothing at all in any given year and would still have to pay resource tax.  If the Minister is concerned with fair taxation then there should be a unified system of taxation and whatever resource tax is paid should be considered as part of that income tax code and the payment of such considered as preferably a payment of the tax or, failing that, an expense against income tax.  But to say that regardless of one's income tax position one pays resource tax clearly shows that the Minister is not concerned with equitable taxation; he is concerned not with treating farmers the same as everyone else but simply with extracting a certain amount of money from the agricultural community regardless of any consideration of equity or anything of that nature. That is completely wrong and belies all the oratory that the Minister and <Col N="97" /> members of his party put forward about wanting to see fairness and equality in taxation.  No other section of the community is subject to a resource tax and there is no other section of the community whose tax payments are not allowed against income tax.  In the case of rates for every other section of the community they are allowed as an expense against income tax but this resource tax will not be allowed as either an expense or a payment and is therefore cumulative and penal taxation of one section of the community only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is really tightening the screw.  It is extremely inequitable. Under the other codes of taxation, such as personal taxation, one is allowed expenses and this should be reckoned as one of them.  In relation to a limited company is the resource tax allowed as an expense prior to calculating profit or is that also excluded? If it is, it is an extremely serious matter.  But in relation to the ordinary farmer the Minister is being extremely unfair and extremely harsh in not allowing this against the payment of income tax or as an expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to whether or not this resource tax should be allowed as an expense, one should look at the rate at which the resource tax is being applied.  As I have indicated, we are not looking for a fixed predetermined yield from farmer taxation generally.  I have said that many times.  I have made an estimate in relation to it.  The fact is that the estimate is very considerably less than the figure of £100 million that was talked about last year.  It will be about £86 million included in which is a figure of £7 million for resource tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that as a contribution towards what was seen as being a reasonable amount of tax revenue from the farming community, this is only a contribution towards it to bring it up to a figure of about £86 million <i>in toto.</i>  It was important that one would have a reasonably precise base. There were two ways to go about this.  If one wanted to take the proposals made <Col N="98" /> by Deputies opposite, to yield a figure of £7 million one could have levied the resource tax at a higher rate and given credit on that basis and I was not prepared to do that.  An amount of £3.50 per acre is not a very high rate.  Most of the criticisms from the opposite benches are in relation to the principle and not the amount.  Increasing the amount and giving credit on that basis would not have been in ease of the people concerned and in many ways it would not have worked out as well as the existing proposal so that, one way or the other, if it were to be allowed as a deduction for the purposes of income or corporation tax the rate of resource tax would have to be increased to produce roughly an equivalent yield.  Particularly in view of the temporary nature of the tax, which I have dealt with already, it is desirable to keep it in as simple a form as possible. The yield is now about £7 million.  If that were to be allowed as a deduction in computing farming profits for the purposes of other taxes it would, in this year drop to £4,500,000, which would mean that the total expected revenue from farm taxation would be £83,500,000 instead of £86 million which would be almost £17 million less than what was talked about last year.</P>

      <P>I have acknowledged that at all stages and it is because of my recognition of that fact that I do not expect to get the same yield of revenue from farm income tax as was mentioned last year.  It is because of that recognition that, already, I have introduced the various concessions that Deputies opposite will be aware of in relation to stock relief for farm buildings, plant, machinery, development and so on.  That is the reality.  If one were to make further inroads into what I have already done then the balance I am trying to maintain between the various sections of the community and their contribution to tax would be, to say the least of it, put in jeopardy and we would get some of the reactions that we saw last year and <Col N="99" /> which, I am pleased to say, we are not getting this year.  On that basis the provisions of section 27 must stay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply reveals the inconsistency of his approach on this whole subject.  He made quite an amount of song and dance in the budget speech about not looking for a predetermined yield from taxation of farmers and yet his sole excuse in this case for not allowing resource tax against income tax is that it would not provide the predetermined yield of £7 million that he had decided upon.  So we see quite clearly that when it suits his book he does want a predetermined yield and when it suits his book he pretends that he does not.</P>
      <P>The Minister also says that he recognises the fall in farm incomes this year in his tax package.  Yet he is supporting a tax, namely the resource tax, which intrinsically pays no regard whatever to fluctuations in income.  It would be paid even if the people actually lost money.  Could there be any greater evidence of a Minister not having regard to fluctuations in farm income than his introducing a tax such as the resource tax which is based on the area of land alone and not on whether that land yields an income?  The Minister says that this tax is to be temporary.  He says it will be reviewed.  But there is nothing in the Bill which provides that it will be temporary.  The Bill is so framed that this tax can continue indefinitely.  There is no provision for a cut-off date for the application of this resource tax.  I would advise the farming community and their leaders to pay close attention, not to what the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance may say during a Dáil debate, but to what actually appears in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point earlier that a very heavy burden will be placed on farmers in October of this year by reason of their having to pay at that time their income tax, as well as the second moiety of the rates and, if their valuation <Col N="101" /> is greater than £70, their resource tax.  I estimate that they will be paying in one month 80 per cent of their total tax liability for the year.  These demands will have to be met at a time when farmers tend to have cash difficulties anyway because of their having to pay bills for such items as fertilisers, seeds and so on, which accumulated during the summer. This is also a time when farmers who do not have enough grass to keep their cattle for the winter have to sell their stocks. Because of the normal tendency towards excessive disposal of stock in October, I could visualise a situation in which, because of the bunching together of the three taxes in question and their falling due for payment at that time, there would be another collapse in cattle prices at the end of this year.  In these circumstances I would urge the Minister to postpone the date for liability for resource tax to 31 December, thereby relieving farmers to some extent by allowing them to pay their tax over a period rather than having to pay all the taxes together in October.  This would not involve any loss in revenue but it would alleviate considerably the liquidity problems of the farming community. One recognises that in business there are liquidity problems apart from overall long-term financial situations.  This applies also to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Bruton is aware that I have made an exception already in respect of farmers in so far as the date on which the selfemployed will be paying tax is concerned. Their liability for income tax falls due on 1 October as distinct from 1 September. This gives Deputy Bruton the opportunity of suggesting that two taxes become payable on the same day.  We could have eliminated that situation by moving the other tax forward by one month but we decided not to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that only half the income tax liability falls due at that stage.  Therefore, I do not follow Deputy Bruton's argument that there is an accumulation of taxes to be paid at the same time.  In addition, the Deputy must be aware that normally there is a period <Col N="102" /> of two months' grace before any interest becomes chargeable in respect of tax that has not been paid.</P>

      <P>That is not necessarily so.  It will be a matter for each individual to make provision for his own payments.  I might add here that so far as other sectors are concerned, there is no choice in respect of when or how tax is paid.  It is deducted at source.  As I have already made special provision in respect of farm income tax, I am simply lining up the same date here in regard to when resource tax is payable.  As I have indicated, the period of grace applies in any event.  On that basis I could not contemplate postponing the date further.  To do so would reduce further the actual yield in this year from farm contributions to income tax.</P>

      <P>I would just mention here that this is the section which provides that assessment in respect of resource tax will be made by the inspector of taxes or other authorised officers of the Revenue Commissioners and that the collection of the tax will be the responsibility of the collector general.  In practice what will happen is that the assessment to resource tax will be combined with the income tax assessment and those farmers who are liable for resource tax will, in general, receive one notice of assessment in respect of the two taxes and also one demand for payment. Therefore, though there will be <Col N="103" /> only one notice of assessment, the liability to income tax and the liability to resource tax will be shown separately on the assessment notice.  In terms of simplicity and of a reduction in documentation, both in respect of the administration and in respect of the farmers concerned, this is the most appropriate way of dealing with the matter.</P>

In the case of the resource tax, by contrast, which is a completely new, novel and unique tax in Europe, where people may well feel that there are grounds for appeal, to apply the same penal provisions in respect of interest on outstanding debts where appeals are pending as apply in income tax would be quite unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points to be made on that.  Firstly, it is entirely in line with the notional basis of assessment to which farmers have become accustomed.  Secondly in the notice of appeal they are entitled to state, as in any other area, the amount they think payable.  Obviously, the relief applies in the same way as it would in any other area.  Thirdly, if there was one area where there is not a great degree of complexity, although it is new, I would have thought it is this area.  The grounds on which one could or would appeal here would seem to suggest themselves as being either obviously meriting consideration or obviously not meriting consideration. It is quite precise.  The fact that it is new does not seem to suggest that people would be confused.  This is one area where, whatever else one's view might be, confusion will not be part of it.</P>

    <P>Section 31 applies, for the purpose of the resource tax, the provisions relating to the occupation of land which apply for the purposes of income tax.  The first amendment to the section is a drafting correction.  There are two amendments here of which one inserts a reference to Part I of the 1974 Act, being the part of the Act in which the relevant chapter appears.  The second amendment brings the provision into line with the new amended section 24, with which we have already dealt. As a result of the amendment of section 24, paragraph (i) of the proviso-there is no longer necessary.  The new paragraphs, paragraphs (i) and (ii), now <Col N="107" /> being inserted, avoid a double charge to resource tax which would otherwise occur.  Where a farmer with, say, land of £80 valuation rented that farm to another person who farmed it, the owner would, but for this amendment, be deemed to occupy the farm and would therefore be charged with resource tax as well as the person who actually occupied it.  The amendment corrects this position.  If the owner rents the farm at a commercial rent he will not be deemed to occupy it and will not therefore be charged resource tax in respect of it.  The number &ldquo;2&rdquo; in the proviso is being changed to &ldquo;(b)&rdquo; for the purposes of presentation.  This has been necessary because of the previous amendment.  Otherwise, the paragraph remains unaltered.  The purpose of this amendment, apart from the drafting is to ensure that there will not be a double charge of resource tax in respect of the same land.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that the effect of this resource tax will be the reverse of the Minister's alleged intention of taxing under-utilised resources.  A large farmer with a big, under-utilised farm, who decides to set it will be able to avoid resource tax completely.  I can foresee a lot of farmers who are making bad use of their land saying: &ldquo;I will get myself completely out of the resource tax net.  All I have to do is let the bulk of <Col N="109" /> my farm.  If I keep £69 valuation worth I can set the remainder and pay no resource tax.&rdquo; Yet the very people we are trying to encourage, the small farmers with a valuation of, say, £50, as is very common throughout the country, must take land on the 11 months' system if they are going to raise their farms to a standard at which they can provide enough grass for their cows or provide silage ground for the wintering of their stock.  These small farmers, who might own farms of perhaps only 30 acres, because they may take another 40 acres on the 11 months' system&mdash;land which they do not own and for which they are paying a high rent&mdash;will have to pay resource tax.  But the big farmer who owns the land, who may have been working it up to now, if he comes along and says: &ldquo;I do not want to pay this resource tax.  I will set my land&rdquo;, he can forget about it.  He pays no resource tax whereas the farmer who takes the land from him will have to pay resource tax. The Minister was saying earlier that he understood these farmers.  If he understands them all that well he should know that a lot of them are taking land on the 11 months' system because they have not got sufficient acreage.  As a result of this provision they will now have to pay resource tax as well as a rates increase and income tax because they are taking that little bit of extra land.  There will be a lot of farmers who will find that as a result of this amendment they will no longer be able to take land because they would be putting themselves into the resource tax net.

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have.  But, as happens on every occasion when one makes a concession, someone picks up the other end of it, as Deputy Bruton is now doing and tries to imply that one has not made a concession.  I do not know whether in those circumstances Deputy Bruton is suggesting that we should leave the charge on the owner.  If he is, perhaps he would say that, if that is what he is suggesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say this, for what it is worth.  Where there is a letting&mdash;and the test, as it is in terms of all farm income tax, being occupation as distinct from registered title&mdash;this is no different from anything else.  I am merely ensuring that it does not apply twice. That is all I am doing here.  Everything else is the same as it always was.  Indeed, the Deputy could have made the same case in respect of any other aspect of farm taxation.  If the Deputy is grieving for the man who rents the land I should say this to him.  If he rents enough of it to render himself liable to resource tax, I am sure he will take that into account in the amount he pays in rent.  As I have indicated already, the owner who is not occupying, and who therefore will be relieved of resource tax liability, will be liable to income tax on what he receives. It seems to me to be the fair and proper balance, while at the same time guaranteeing that there will not be a double liability in respect of the same land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision will have the effect of placing small farmers with valuations of £40 and less&mdash;farmers who have been taking land in order to make up for their small acreage&mdash;in a very difficult position if they are now going to be prevented from renting land <Col N="111" /> because, by doing so, they put themselves into the resource tax net.  The result of this provision will be that people whom the Minister never intended should pay resource tax will be forced into paying either resource tax or not having sufficient land to feed their stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take issue with that.  I am not so remote from the land&mdash;indeed perhaps I am closer to the small farmer than is the Deputy&mdash;as to imply that because a charge would arise in respect of someone who gets up to £70 or £80 valuation, that would discourage the man who has been taking a letting of up to 50 acres.  I know enough about what land rental costs on the 11 months' system to know that this would not be a major element.  Deputy Bruton, who by profession or otherwise may be more directly involved in farming than I, should be aware of that also.  There is no point in overstating the position.</P>
      <P>We are again getting hung up on grounds of principle.  Deputy Bruton has said that this will constitute a very heavy burden.  In many cases in relation to the actual letting value of the land, which is the real issue, the extra £3.50 per acre will not be a major burden having regard to the going rents per acre.  Deputy Bruton knows that better than I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Here it is a question of the last straw breaking the camel's back.  In the dairying area, where there is intensive activity in the case of, say, a farmer who uses his resources to the maximum but who will rent land from a neighbour or somebody not using that land thereby bringing himself into the resource tax net, would the Minister accept that he has one choice only because the profits from his dairying activities are so low? Inevitably the choice he will make is to get rid of his stock rather than involve himself in further taxation.  Is that not the obvious way out?  Is that not contrary to all the reports and indications today to the effect that increased production is so vital particularly to the dairying industry?  Furthermore, is it not <Col N="112" /> true that the State owes more to somebody who farms intensively and uses his land to the maximum rather than somebody who does nothing with his land but rents it to somebody to work it for him?  The Minister should bear that point in mind.  If such a farmer is placed in that position obviously he will get rid of some of his cattle.  It is true, as Deputy Bruton said, that where such people provide silage, where they graze followers for their dairy herd the choice now open to them, if they are coming into the resource tax net, will be to reduce their herd and thereby reduce production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What would be the relevant date of occupation for the purposes of assessment?  Would it be occupancy for the entire year or for part of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be in respect of the current year, but if the leasing period was for 11 months, the standard practice, it would be eleven-twelfths of the appropriate amount.  On that basis it would not bring such farmers to the point the Deputies have been saying&mdash;it would only be eleven-twelfths of the valuation for the purpose of the resource tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are obviously trying to imply that this will have a very serious effect on certain people, that it will penalise those who work land and will not penalise those who do not work it.  Our aim is to try to encourage people to work their land.  Small farmers on or below a £40 valuation would have to rent land of up to £30 valuation to bring them up to the threshold of £70.  At the £70 valuation he would be liable to £24.50 resource tax.  Therefore, unless a man was renting a considerable area of land he would not find himself the victim of the resource tax because of the land he would be renting.  If he is a good farmer this will not impose a burden on him or a penalty that would prevent him from doing this year what he did successfully in other years.  The net will not be suffocating, as Deputy Bruton alleged. Deputy Bruton would be able to give an <Col N="113" /> indication of rental values of land in County Meath and I do not accept that £3.50 per £1 valuation would stop a person.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 32, subsection (1) (d), line 1, to delete &ldquo;112&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;109&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In 1975 or 1976 the previous Government introduced a provision designed to increase the number of people employed in industry.  That provision allowed a reduced rate of corporation tax, reducing the rate from 55 per cent to 25 per cent with two conditions, one that there would be an increase of 2 per cent in the turnover of the company and two that there would be a 3 per cent increase in the number of people employed by that company.  That was recognised at the time as being a dramatic, imaginative and highly successful method of encouraging firms to take on extra workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been continued, except that the figure in regard to the turnover was deleted in 1978 at a time when employment was going up.  The base year taken is 1977, and 3 per cent has been added each year.  The proposal this year is to bring the figure up to 112 per cent, a further increase of 3 per cent.  I am proposing that the figure be 109 per cent.  I propose this amendment because of the frightening situation&mdash;I hesitate to use such a strong word&mdash;in the employment front.  Our suggestion is that the Minister leave a figure at 109 as it was in the 1979 Finance Act because of the threatened redundancies from closures and the forecasts in regard to the employment situation at the end of the year. This is a proposal to maintain our work <Col N="114" /> force at the expense of the Exchequer. This would be a welcome move as far as industrialists are concerned because it would give them the encouragement they are not getting at the moment to provide and to maintain employment.  The Minister will be doing a good day's work not only for the Government but for Irish industry if he accepts this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the purpose of the amendment.  As Deputy Barry has said, the whole purpose of the scheme to charge corporation tax at 25 per cent was to maintain employment and increase it at the rate of 3 per cent each year It was a temporary measure for three years only to provide an incentive to increase industrial employment. That still remains its purpose.  If we amended the provision as the Deputy suggests the cost would be £5 million and this could not be justified if the 3 per cent projected increase in employment was to be negatived.</P>
      <P>I suppose anything could be justified on some basis or another, but this provision is a concession in any event and Deputy Barry's purpose is to abolish one of the conditions of the concession in a year in which there are limitations on the scope of public expenditure, as I would expect Deputies opposite to be aware of. In maintaining the scheme as it is I am showing awareness of the significance of it.  If I were to adopt Deputy Barry's suggestion companies could increase their work force up to that level at this point of the year and they could qualify for relief for the entire year but could lay off 5 per cent of their work force in the latter half of the year.  I am sure that is not what Deputy Barry wants but that could be one of the consequences of his amendment.  For that and for other reasons I have already given, I regret I could not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that employment in manufacturing industries during 1980 has become very serious and that the high level of redundancies which has been referred to on a number of occasions by the <Col N="115" /> Minister for Labour is a cause of concern? Would he agree that whatever action is necessary to preserve even existing employment should be taken?  If we make it more difficult for industry to benefit from lower rates of tax, we will be doing something very negative.  In the present climate where a recent survey indicated that up to 90 per cent of the people involved in manufacturing industry are very pessimistic about their future, the Minister is on the wrong track by making this more difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputy Barry is attempting to do here, but it could have the opposite effect from what he has in mind.  Because there could be no other expectation but that one would continue what has been done in previous Finance Acts&mdash;a 3 per cent increase in employment&mdash;the consequences of adopting Deputy Barry's suggestion could be that people who have increased their work force in anticipation of a 3 per cent increase with a view to benefiting from this scheme, could start to lay off these people and still qualify because there was a 3 per cent increase in employment.  I know that is not what Deputy Barry wants but that is one of the main reasons I could not agree to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suffering from delusions if he thinks firms have the time or the inclination to play around as he is suggesting.  Manufacturing industry are too concerned about surviving to engage in this kind of game.  I am not suggesting that the section be deleted, merely that it be suspended for a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago we were debating a Bill to set up a fund of £20 million to provide resources partly from Government sources and partly from a further charge on the stamp on industry.  This was referred to in the national understanding. The Minister made the very strong point at that stage that because of the very serious situation, the maintenance of employment was as important as the creation of new jobs.  If that <Col N="116" /> principle applied in February or March, the same principle should apply under this legislation.  I believe the Minister will get a very positive response from industry if he accepts this amendment, not only because of the financial benefits to an industry&mdash;they will not accrue until the middle or the latter end of next year&mdash;but because many firms and the associations representing manufacturing firms feel there is no point in approaching the Government because the Government have closed their ears to their problems.  To most people, except the Minister for Finance, this seems to be a very simple problem for solution&mdash;the underwriting of the exchange risk for moneys borrowed abroad&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting this as an example of how industry feel about the Government.  Even where there appear to be small problems the Government have a very unbending and unflinching attitude and do not appear to be willing to meet them even half way.  If the Minister accepts this amendment and shows he is interested in at least maintaining employment, this would help to end the stand-off between industry and Government, which should not exist, and from it would flow further benefits for the Exchequer, Government, industry and employment generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that the maintenance of employment is very important.  In the context of discussions on the employment guarantee fund I indicated that the partners to the tripartite committee had agreed that the maintenance of employment&mdash;the maintenance of jobs that would have been lost&mdash;should qualify for support from the fund in the same way as the creation of extra jobs.  There is a range of avenues and agencies through which one operates and that is one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about a deliberate decision to give an incentive for increased <Col N="117" /> employment, which has been in legislation all along the line.  I am not suggesting that any industrialist would play tricks with the scheme.  He is more concerned with the profitability and viability of his company, but if he found he had already qualified for this special rate of tax&mdash;because of what he had done in anticipation of a continuing pattern of relief under this legislation&mdash;and then there were pressures, he could not be faulted if he let some people go.  That is not playing games.  That is something that might be considered as a real possibility.  That is an important fact.</P>
    <P>There are options open to companies whereby in lieu of the 112 per cent we mentioned&mdash;3 per cent each year since the beginning&mdash;they may qualify for relief for 1980 by reference to a 9 per cent increase since 1977, or a 6 per cent increase since 1978, or a 9 per cent increase <Col N="118" /> since 1979.  In view of these options it makes it more unacceptable that there should be no addition in respect of 1980 to the overall increase of 9 per cent.  This is the way this has always operated.  From one year to another there was an increase of 3 per cent&mdash;over four years 12 per cent, three years 9 per cent and two years 6 per cent.  Because of the purpose of this relief I could not agree to depart from it at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House.  This is a worthwhile amendment and I am very disappointed at the Minister's attitude to it.  The spirit of my amendment is that people would still qualify if they maintained employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to the new rate of corporation tax that will operate from 1981 to 2000.  On 20 December 1978 the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy announced that the scheme of export sales relief and Shannon relief would be replaced from 1981 by a new incentive scheme to apply to manufacturing industry generally.</P>
      <P>The new scheme will apply to income derived by companies on or after 1 January 1981 from the manufacture of goods in the State, including Shannon Airport, whether that income arises from domestic or export sales.  That is the first point of special significance.  Previously tax relief was in respect of export sales but this will now apply whether the income arises from domestic or export sales.  The scheme will terminate on 31 December 2000.  Therefore, it has the major advantage of being notified in advance to apply for a fixed and prolonged period.  Obviously it will be a major contributory factor to the development of employment programmes generally.</P>
      <P>As in the case of the export sales relief, the rendering of manufacturing services&mdash;that is, the subjecting of goods not owned by the person providing such services to a process of manufacture&mdash;will be within the scope of the new relief.  I should mention at this stage that sales into intervention will be excluded. We had this discussion on an earlier part of the Bill.  That is not to say that the meat industries will be excluded.  In fact, they will qualify as will any other industry for this new relief but if it subsequently emerges that a company sells to a sister company that in turn sells into intervention, it will have to be noted that the sale was into intervention in the first instance and thus the 10 per cent rate will not apply.  In a sense this is in substitution for export sales relief for which sales into intervention did not qualify.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the scheme that operated hitherto in respect of export sales relief was called into question by the Commission.  Because of the importance of having clear, longterm tax provisions for industry generally, the Government decided that this scheme, which will not discriminate between sales on the home market and export sales and will not run contrary to any provision of the EEC, was the appropriate approach to guarantee the attraction of industry and the development of existing industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companies carrying on trade in respect of which they are entitled at the end of 1980 to export sales relief or <Col N="121" /> Shannon relief will continue to be entitled to such relief on the basis of the existing statutory provisions.  If for one reason or another they decide to continue to operate under the provisions of the export sales relief scheme, under this Bill which introduces the new 10 per cent rate they will be entitled to continue to do so until 1990.  However, companies whose manufacturing income is eligible for export sales relief will have the right to opt irrevocably into the new scheme at any time from 1 January 1981.</P>
    <P>That is a very important option being left to companies who are now operating under the export sales relief scheme.  At any time they can opt for the new scheme but, of course, they must stay within it and the option may be exercised from 1 January 1981 until the end of their span of export sales relief.  If the period extends to 1990, at any time between the coming into operation of this measure and 1990 they are free to make their choice.  Any such company that does not exercise the option can claim new relief immediately on the expiry of its span of export sales relief.  In addition companies enjoying Shannon relief will be entitled to exercise a similar option. However, they are unlikely to avail of the new relief until Shannon relief is ended as it would involve changing a total exemption for a reduced charge of tax under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides for the grant of export sales relief in respect of trades which commenced after 31 December 1980 or trades already carried on at that date where exports of goods had not commenced and for the grant of Shannon relief in respect of trades commencing after that date where assurances to that effect have been given before 1981 by the IDA.  The Government are not only introducing a new scheme which will be an incentive towards the development of industry but they are introducing it in a manner which will ensure that the choice for the industries concerned is being left as open as possible up to the date of the expiry of the export sales tax at the end of 1990. <Col N="122" /> Not many Governments can give such a long-term commitment in legislation but this will extend up to the year 2000.  The security which this will give to would-be investors should make a major contribution to our employment programmes.</P>
    <P>The calculation of tax at the new rate is being interpreted in a most reasonable and liberal way.  It is proposed that the relief will amount to seven-ninths of the tax payable by a company on their income as calculated for corporation tax purposes from the sale of goods manufactured by them in the State.  This means that a company which would normally be liable to corporation tax in respect of such income at the 45 per cent rate will become liable at 10 per cent. The 45 per cent is the standard rate at the moment but the rate at which they will become liable now will be 10 per cent and the relief will be applied at seven-ninths of the tax which would otherwise be payable by a company on their income.  A small company is normally liable on their income at 35 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The seven-ninths is a relief on the 45 per cent which leaves a balance of 10 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  A small company normally liable on such income at 35 per cent would be liable at only about 7.8 per cent under the new proposals.  The application of this scheme could mean that some companies would be liable at less than 10 per cent.  The corporation tax to be relieved is computed on a similar basis to that at present provided for in the case of export sales relief, that is by reference to sales of goods manufactured in the State by the company.</P>

      <P>Section 36.  On the face of it the implementation of the scheme can seem complex so I will deal briefly with other aspects of the application <Col N="123" /> of the scheme.  A company's income which is chargeable at the proposed reduced rate less the relevant tax will form what is referred to in the Bill as a primary fund and distributions will be regarded for credit tax purposes as coming primarily out of that fund.  To the extent that the primary fund is insufficient to meet these distributions they will be regarded as coming out of other distributable income.  A distribution out of the primary fund will carry a tax credit of one-eighteenth and other distributions will carry the tax credit appropriate under existing law, that is normally three-sevenths of the distribution.  A tax credit of one-eighteenth represents 50 per cent of the corporation tax at the new 10 per cent rate on the profits out of which the distribution are made.  This is in line with the position in relation to the existing tax credit of three-sevenths which imputs to the shareholder about 52 per cent of the tax at the normal rate of 45 per cent on the relevant underlying profits.</P>
      <P>The primary fund will also contain distributions carrying the one-eighteenth tax credit which will be received by companies from companies which themselves benefited from the new reduced rates of tax.  A distribution which carries a tax credit of one-eighteenth and which does not fall to be treated as franked investment income will be liable to tax in the normal way.  Any increased liability thus falling on a shareholder would be capable of being offset by an enhanced distribution out of a tax saving accuring under the new scheme to the company making the distribution.  In cases where double taxation agreements do not make special provisions the credit which a non-resident shareholder would be entitled to set against his income tax liability in respect of a distribution out of relieved manufacturing profits will also be reduced.  Such liability rarely arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the extension of the new scheme to certain non-manufacturing activities under the export sales relief the definition of &ldquo;goods&rdquo; includes certain items not covered by the new scheme. Depending on the outcome of the discussions <Col N="124" /> with the EEC Commission it is proposed in next year's Finance Bill to extend the new relief to cover fish produced on a fish farm, cultivated mushrooms and the repair of ships.  That would extend it in line with the scope of the existing export sales relief.  It has not been possible to do this in this Finance Bill as the discussions with the Commission are still under way.  I am giving a clear notice of the Government's intention in this area.</P>
    <P>The publication of books and greeting cards not printed by their publisher and design and planning services rendered within the State in connection with certain engineering works executed abroad do not involve the production of goods or a process of manufacture, but the rendering of non-manufacturing services. The extension of the new relief to those services would give rise to demands which could not in logic be resisted for the bringing of all professional services within the ambit of the new relief.  If one were to do that it would give rise to difficulties with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>One point remains to be mentioned and that is the question of extending this new relief to non-manufacturing services at Shannon.  We will be continuing our discussions in this area with the EEC. Depending on the outcome of these discussions we propose to introduce provisions in next year's Finance Bill.  I have dealt with the purpose of it, the duration of it, the application of it, the option to avail of it and the security that will be provided in it.  I have also dealt with the extension of it to certain non-manufacturing activities.  It should be clear that the scheme being introduced by this section should be a major continuing boost to industrial development here.  On the face of it the operation of the scheme may appear to be complex but I am assured that it will not be.  It is only after detailed discussions with interested parties and detailed examination by the Revenue Commissioners that they have given effect to the Government's intention in the form in which it follows in this and subsequent sections.</P>

      <P>Deputy Leyden will have ample opportunity to find out that it is part of his job on this side of the House.  This legislation, inside a very complex and difficult Finance Bill is extremely important.  This was first announced by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in November 1978.  This is now June 1980.  Why this was not introduced as legislation before now I do not know.  It is very difficult and complex.  It should be a Bill taken, not in Committee here but in a Special Committee where it could be teased out line by line and where, as is customary in a Committee of that nature, the officers of the Department involved would have a chance of giving their contributions directly.  It would have been far more suitable than putting it in as a sub-paragraph in a Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say this as a criticism of the Minister, as it is a difficult Bill, but obviously he does not understand it. Neither do I.  The Minister is a layman in this matter and so am I.  In that regard I should like to pay tribute to Deputy McCreevy who because of his specialised knowledge in accountancy made a very valuable contribution to the VAT committee about two years ago.  He was the most informed and constructive <Col N="126" /> contributor to that debate.  The contributions of other accountants who are Members of the House, who have seen the operation of the Bill dealing with export tax relief, would have been important in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not adequate that we should be debating important legislation and have only three-quarters of an hour left to finish the entire Bill.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may rightly say that that is our own fault because we spoke too long on earlier sections and left ourselves inadequate time to discuss this.  There is some truth in that, but the other side is that the other sections of the Bill were important and needed teasing out.  This is my third time following a Finance Bill&mdash;I do not say putting one through&mdash;and the method of dealing with them is totally inadequate.  They need for more time than Members, with the exception of Deputy McCreevy and others who are accountants, can afford to give them.</P>
    <P>This is an ingenious way of substituting for what was the most valuable contribution to the establishment of industries since the last war, that is, export tax relief.  It more than anything else attracted job giving industries to the country and because it was so valuable the IDA or enticing body could use some leverage to get them to start up in different parts of the country.  There were a battery of grants but this was the bait by which we got the fish on the hook.  When industries came here they were &ldquo;enticed&rdquo; out of what might have been their first choice of location.  The export tax relief was the most important attraction we had in bringing foreign industry to Ireland over the last 20 years.  I am sure the Minister will note my restraint in not mentioning how it came to be on the Statute Books.  That has to go now because of EEC regulations.  It is being substituted for by the 10 per cent tax relief.  The Minister explained about it but not adequately and we will not have time to tease out adequately how it will operate.  It is on the basis of seven-ninth relief on the standard rate of corporation tax of 45 per cent.  The Minister told us it operates at the lower level of 35 per cent <Col N="127" /> for small companies and that the tax charge will be seven-eighteenths.  As regards people who can avail of the previous section of the Finance Bill where they are given the benefit, because they increased their employment by 3 per cent in a tax year, of a rate of tax at 25 per cent, will they be given relief also in that regard?  Their real tax charge would be about 6¾ per cent.</P>
    <P>In 1950 I did not think I would see the year 2000, but this is 1980 and I think I have a good chance of seeing it as it is not that far ahead.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a Government in the year 2000 increasing the standard rate of tax from 45 per cent to 63 per cent and increasing the tax relating to industries from 10 per cent to 18 per cent.  There should be some mechanism for preventing foreign interests feeling they had been had after coming here in the expectation of a 10 per cent rate and ending up with a 14 per cent rate.  It is possible that the extra 4 per cent would not be a deterrent to a company&mdash;I do not think that after ten years operation a company would pull out because of that amount&mdash;but it would damage our reputation abroad.  The external view of the country would be hampered.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism on Sunday last referred to that in the course of a radio broadcast.  That is something which is of concern to him as the person in charge of the IDA, but the language he used and the time he chose were wrong.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that we are in an open market and that there are many other countries offering very attractive packages to establish industries.  We must not give a lever to such countries or put them in a position of saying that the Irish Government said one thing and did another, or that the Irish Government are incapable of keeping their word.  We should not allow that situation to arise. My amendment, No. 37, covers categories mentioned by the Minister&mdash;fish farming, mushroom cultivating, ship repairing and books and printing cards not printed by publishers. <Col N="128" /> The Minister has told us that he will include three of those four categories by way of amendment in the 1981 Finance Bill.  He believes that the fourth, bookbinding, cannot be included at any stage. Presumably, the Minister can give an assurance to the House that the three categories he intends including in next year's Finance Bill will not cut across any EEC regulation or law?  If he can give that assurance I do not see why he cannot accept amendment No. 37 and have them included in this Bill.  There may be a special case in relation to books and printing cards not printed by publishers; but fish farming, mushroom cultivating and ship repairing have gone through very lean times because of the energy crisis and need every encouragement. We must ensure that there is not any danger to the employment they are providing.</P>
    <P>If while the Minister is still in office a further major change in direction as regards tax relief for manufacturing companies should occur he should bear in mind that it is not satisfactory from any point of view that it be given a limited debate.  Having announced these changes 18 months ago I cannot understand why they did not come before the House earlier to permit us a better opportunity to debate them.  The contributions to this change would be of benefit to industry in the future.  Those interested in the creation of jobs would be anxious to have a say in regard to this because all Members realise the value of export tax relief in the creation of jobs.  We all want to ensure that the 10 per cent corporation tax level is made as attractive as possible for our job creation programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this provision because it gives industry security from 1981 to the year 2000.  I should like to re-assure Deputy Barry that as it is our intention to remain in office for that period there is no danger of any revision or change of the provision. Such a guarantee could not be given if, by any misfortune, there was a change from a Fianna Fáil Government.  We will ensure that such a provision is continued <Col N="129" /> and that there will not be any variation. It will prove attractive because it will help manufacturers selling on the home market as well as those who are geared for export.  At present exports are tax free but home sales are taxed in the normal way.  It is good that the Minister has decided to continue with the total export relief until 1990.  I do not believe firms will object when they are getting such advance warning of the change.  They now have an opportunity to readjust and are aware of what the future has in store for them.  They can now gear themselves for the change in the years ahead.  Firms who opt for the 10 per cent tax rate from 1981 will know where they stand and can look forward to prosperity in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>At present there is a relief for those working in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East.  I understand that there is tax relief on some if not on all of the export of services whether they are architectural, engineering or others and I urge the Minister to continue to allow that relief.  I know of a firm in Roscommon engaged on contracts in the Middle East who are in a position to avail of such tax relief.</P>
      <P>In addition to this tax relief at present we also have the rates relief which is applicable and of which many people are not aware.  Individual county councils are always very willing and anxious to give this remission or allowance to manufacturing industry and this is also a great incentive.  As Deputy Barry has said, the actual total relief of income tax on exports for manufacturing companies based in Ireland is one of the greatest possible incentives to the creation of employment. I agree totally with Deputy Barry on that.  It has been a tremendous factor in attracting foreign industry which has allowed our people to have work in their own country.  This consistent continuation of the Fianna Fáil policy of job creation, the attraction of industry and the promotion of native industry is a very welcome provision in the 1980 Finance Bill and one I particularly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People should be aware of all the <Col N="130" /> positive provisions of this Finance Bill. The package contained in the Finance Bill is very welcome and every provision is of a positive nature.  As a result of the Government's work since January we have a Finance Bill which is geared to give incentives to industry and also incentives for the PAYE sector.  According to the Opposition, they appear to see nothing positive in the Bill and they are trying to negative many of its really good provisions.  I assure Deputy Barry that I hope he lives that long but I also hope he will be on the same side of the House as now for the next 20 years as Opposition spokesman on Finance.  That is where he will remain.  With this type of Bill and its provisions we shall stand over all our policies and be here until the year 2000 and possibly after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the time constraint I should like to welcome the introduction of 10 per cent in substitution, especially after 1990, for firms that have been and are on export sales relief benefit.  I wish to bring one aspect of the matter to the Minister's attention and that relates to sales intervention.  This is a rather important subject which affects perhaps one of our industries currently under tremendous pressure, the meat processing industry.  Under the provisions of section 34 (3) (a) sales to intervention are excluded.  That is very serious and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972 I was on a special committee dealing with a VAT Bill.  We discussed the question of eligibility of intervention to VAT at that stage.  The question of intervention relief has not been cleared up adequately.  I want the Minister to say if it is because of an EEC directive that sales to intervention agencies are not allowed the benefit of exports sales relief. Can he say that specifically?  I have <Col N="131" /> always got clouded replies containing &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;ands&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo;.  Nobody has said quite clearly and distinctly that sales to intervention are allowed export sales relief.</P>
    <P>In passing I must say that I am involved in the meat trade and to a certain extent I suppose I should in a vague way state that I would have a vested interest or potentially have a vested interest in this but nevertheless it is an area that I know is very important to the whole economy and that is why I am speaking on it.</P>
    <P>Another question now arises under the Bill in relation to the possibility of having sales to intervention benefit from the 10 per cent rate and be reckoned as sales of manufactured goods for the benefit of the company.  I am extremely disappointed that the Minister is not allowing the 10 per cent rate to apply to companies involved in the meat processing trade in respect of sales to intervention agencies.  Even if there had been a directive from EEC in relation to not allowing export sales relief in this case that goes by the board when there is a global rate of 10 per cent applicable to manufacturing production, production of manufactured goods.  Technically, therefore, it is possible to allow the 10 per cent rate to apply to goods sold through the intervention scheme.  That is something that should be seriously examined. I see no reason why that cannot be done even if it has not been possible to allow the export sales relief in respect of these goods.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to answer this specific point which has a great bearing on the hard-pressed meat industry. The Minister knows well that quite a number of meat processing firms of a very substantial nature are in a serious financial position.  This would be of help to them.  It would have been a help if they had been allowed export sales relief on intervention but now, to have them positively discriminated against as is the case under section 34 is deplorable.  I do not know where that advice has come from but, certainly, in <Col N="132" /> relation to the EEC directive if you are having a 10 per cent rate, that at least should be applicable to the sale of products into intervention.  I see no reason why that should not be done.</P>
    <P>There are a number of interpretations of what is allowed for as manufactured goods.  I am sorry that a greater attempt has not been made to define goods that have been manufactured.  I know that in fairness to the Revenue Commissioners, they have always been liberal in their intepretation of &ldquo;manufactured goods.&rdquo;  I hope that in relation to this Bill when enacted the liberal stance in regard to the definition of manufactured goods will continue and that no narrow interpretation will apply.</P>
    <P>The reason for the introduction of the 10 per cent rate is that we are finding it more difficult to attract industry here in an extremely competitive European economy.  After 1990, our export sales relief will go and we are now properly introducing this 10 per cent.  I should like to give the Government credit for it.  We are giving recognition to the fact that it takes a lot and costs a lot to ensure that foreign industry comes into this country. We are competing with Governments that are better off than we are and who are prepared to spend substantial sums of money to attract foreign industry. Would the Minister state what are the comparable rates of corporation profit tax applicable in the EEC member states?  That would be interesting information for this House.  I want to be sure that ours is the best and most attractive rate.</P>
    <P>If we are to have foreign industry here we must ensure that our case is pitched at the optimum point, and one of the weapons we have is corporation tax.  It is very important, as the House knows, that what is being done here is at the most competitive possible level which will attract foreign companies.  The British Government have been far more competitive in relation to their underdeveloped areas such as the north and north midlands, leaving aside Northern Ireland.  Their policies have been very active in attracting foreign industry.  Could a cost-benefit analysis and a cost-benefit <Col N="133" /> comparability study be undertaken by the IDA to ensure that the package the Government offers to foreign firms is the best <i>vis-à-vis</i> our EEC partners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I know the Minister would like to clarify a lot of points which have been made so I shall be very brief.  I welcome this section in the Bill because we all realise, as Deputy Barry has said, that our exports tax relief over the years has been one of the major factors in promoting industry and attracting investment. Many of the companies throughout the country which we see employing people would not be there except for the export tax relief which was given over the years.  Doubts existed as to whether it would be acceptable within the EEC context.  I am glad to see the matter has been clarified in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package which the Minister has brought in will be welcomed by everybody in industry and also by anyone who is interested in job creation. I am glad to see that the 10 per cent also applies to manufacturers on the home market.  I have always felt that the home market is as competitive as our export market.  There is a great influx of foreign goods in our supermarkets throughout the country.  I hope the reduction which companies are now getting will enable them to become competitive.  This reduction <Col N="134" /> in corporation tax should make it possible for them to have goods manufactured at more competitive prices.  Our manufacturers on the home market are facing considerable competition today.  We have only to look around at the various stores throughout the country and we can see that there are large stocks of foreign goods on sale.  I am very glad the Minister has extended this concession to the home market.</P>
    <P>We know that there is competition from other countries to attract foreign investment and we have seen projects going to other countries instead of here. The 10 per cent corporation tax must be one of the most attractive taxes in Europe.  I doubt if there is any rate throughout Europe as low as this.  I believe that foreign investors who are thinking of coming here will find this very attractive.  I would have preferred a flat rate of 10 per cent instead of the 7.78 per cent if it could be worked out. The flat rate would probably be more attractive to businessmen but this is how it is worked out.  The people who are already in business can opt for the export tax relief and I imagine a considerable number of them will.  If they extend considerably into the home market they will have to make a decision as to which will benefit them most.  I am sure if some firms feel that they can extend their outlets considerably into the home market they may move very quickly to the 10 per cent corporation tax which will be of greater benefit to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the manner in which you have allowed us in the time available to us to deal with matters which arose in relation to the whole chapter as distinct from this particular section.  It was the best approach to adopt in view of the time constraint and enabled us to deal with the many issues which have been touched on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to how this system compares with any other system applying elsewhere there is no system operating in Europe or anywhere else that compares with this incentive towards manufacturing industry.  It can also be said that the existing system, which will be replaced at <Col N="135" /> the end of 1990 by this system, is also the most generous on offer to industry in any one of the countries in the EEC or elsewhere.  There is nothing to compare with what is now being introduced.  It is a measure of the concern of everybody&mdash;I appreciate the views expressed by the Opposition particularly in this area&mdash;to promoting industrial activity but it is also a measure of the incentives by way of tax relief that have been given, are being given and will be given to manufacturing industry here.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes forgotten that the level of tax relief which applies here is far ahead of that available elsewhere.  While I know that there are difficulties for industry here, as there are elsewhere, one could be forgiven for noting that certain views seem to be on the basis of taking for granted all that is already on offer and asking for more in addition which would also cost a considerable amount of money from the revenue.  That is the first point I would like to make in relation to Deputy Collins's query and also Deputy Fitzpatrick who touched on it as well.  I appreciate the welcome they have expressed for this.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make arises particularly from what Deputy Fitzpatrick said is in relation to the competition we have on the home market.  It is vitally important that our people are aware of their obligation to give preference in their purchasing habits to native industry.  It was never more important than it is now.  I will be very irrelevant for a few moments but in relation to balance of payments it is quite important to consider where people spend their holidays as well at a time when we are facing balance of payments problems.  The two fall in together.  In this context obviously manufacturing industry on the home market is going to get a new boost here.  To the extent that it does get a boost, if there is one element that will now be boosted in a way that it was not under the existing scheme it is industry manufacturing for the home market and particularly, almost by definition, small industry which for one <Col N="136" /> reason or another will not be engaged in exporting to other markets.  Deputies will be aware that the development of the small industries activities of the IDA, particularly that being promoted by SFADCo on a pilot basis in the mid-western region, is crucial to our employment programme.  Obviously the small industries which are catering much more than the medium or bigger industries for the home market are going to get a major boost in this, and that is something that I am sure everybody here will welcome.  At a time when there are difficulties for industry generally we hope that the implementation and application of this will be a particular incentive to small industries catering for the home market and that&mdash;as we keep asking and preaching&mdash;the home consumers will become much more sensitive to their obligations than some of them hitherto have demonstrated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins raised another point which is important.  Again, I express my agreement with what he said when he talked about the definition of manufacturing industry, though he recognises that the general interpretation put on this by the Revenue Commissioners is liberal.  That has been my experience too. The Deputy says that if one were to define manufacturing industry, if you were to put a definition in this Bill of what manufacturing represents, the consequence of it inevitably would be that it would have to be, by reference even to the definition, more restrictive than the interpretation that has been put upon it generally in the liberal fashion that is there.  A definition in itself would tend to be, if only for the purposes of precision, more restrictive than the application&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But he can appreciate that when you have to pass this on to the parliamentary draftsman and say, even with the benefit of advice from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, my own Department and the Revenue Commissioners, &ldquo;Right, put that down in the Bill and tell us what you mean&rdquo;, you would find that what you would get would be very much more restrictive perhaps than the interpretation put on it by the Revenue Commissioners at this moment.

      <P>I assure the House through Deputy Barry, who asked a very pertinent question on this, that the clear intention is&mdash;and any Government would have the same intention and want it to be known as their intention&mdash;not just now but into the future for the duration of this to keep the rate at 10 per cent so that, for instance, if corporation tax went up to, as the Deputy asked, 50 per cent, then the reduction, which is seven-ninths, would be amended to whatever would be an appropriate fraction&mdash;four-fifths in those circumstances&mdash;to keep the effective rate at 10 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>You could amend the reduction to ensure that the effective consequence of it will be an effective rate of 10 per cent.  While on that, Deputy Barry asked about the 25 per cent rate that we touched on earlier.  As Deputy Barry knows, although perhaps he overlooked it when he asked the question, the 25 per cent rate he referred to will end this year.  We were discussing it on an earlier section.  It was a temporary arrangement which has been extended this year and is being ended this year. Therefore Deputy Barry's query in relation to how these revisions would apply to the 25 per cent rate will not arise.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but the Minister for Finance said exactly the same last year, that it was in for only one year and for the duration of the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The difference this year is that what I am doing is bridging the gap between the implementation of this new scheme, which will come in at the beginning of next year.  For that reason what the Minister for Finance said last year probably would have been well warranted and was the intention, but I am continuing it this year for one further year until the introduction of the new scheme.  I sympathise with Deputy Barry because I must acknowledge that his experience is mine too.  A Bill of this sort might be more appropriately dealt with in Committee, or at least this section of the Bill as he suggested, although that would apply to other sections as well.  We found from experience that the enthusiasm of Deputies for Special Committees, perhaps due to pressure of time, is not quite what it might be.  I have always appreciated what is done on Committee Stage in this House by Deputies, where the work they put in does not even get the publicity that it warrants, much less the problems they have in staying away from dealing with their constituents. However, it is understandable that Deputies do not show great enthusiasm for the detailed kind of work that a Committee examination of this element will involve.  At the same time we have given more notice here than on other occasions. We have given notice now of what is going to come into effect from the beginning of next year.  While we are still in this area, I remind Deputy Barry that it is for that reason almost unusually long prior notice.  I am not saying that it is not desirable to do that, but it is unusually long and had we introduced it earlier it would have been unprecedented by standards.  For instance, the 1977 manufacturing companies' scheme for the 25 per cent rate was brought in in the 1977 Finance Bill, so that by moving now in the Finance Bill to implement something that will take effect at the <Col N="139" /> beginning of next year we are not behind the pattern.</P>

      <P>One last point.  I tell Deputy Collins that it is not because of any EEC restriction that intervention is not being included.  I say that definitely and I have never hedged from this.  The main reason for excluding intervention sales from the new relief is the long term interest of Irish agriculture, which would not be served if the tax relief were to encourage sales of processed products such as beef, butter and milk powder into intervention.  This has been stated by Ministers for Agriculture.  The important thing from our point of view is to encourage the promotion of our own marketing of our agriculture as distinct from selling it into intervention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>In Ireland any question of land arouses some response even in a city man like myself. It has been a great cause of contention from the time of Parnell to Davitt to Lalor and right down to the present day.</P>
      <P>The Bill moved by Deputy Quinn on behalf of the Labour Party is a bit too simplistic to solve this problem.  I am thankful to him that we have been given an opportunity to discuss this matter.  If the solution were as simple as that portrayed by the proposer of the Bill, that would be very nice and we could find common ground on certain points.  If this Bill were adopted it would lead to complete chaos.  I am interested in building land, land on which to build more houses.  I will direct my remarks to that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the Bill is to deal with the high cost of building land, especially land for housing, and to make sure that increases in value as a result of investment in water and sewerage services, roads and other infrastructure will not accrue to landowners or property speculators.  Every member of my party subscribes to that doctrine.  Nobody <Col N="141" /> would oppose that as an objective.</P>
    <P>I should like to examine the Labour Party's proposal for achieving this objective as outlined in this Private Members' Bill.  The main proposal is to empower the elected members of local authorities to decide on the land which may be required for all housing, commercial, industrial and other development in a five year period, and to designate the land. The local authorities would then be obliged to acquire and finance the acquisition of all this land in a designated area, and pay for it at existing use value instead of market value.  I find it difficult to visualise the landowners in a designated area queuing up outside their local authority offices to hand over their holdings at existing use value.  It would be too much to expect that to happen.</P>
    <P>If this Bill were enacted there would be complete chaos in the building industry because nobody would surrender land voluntarily.  Therefore, it would have to be acquired compulsorily.  Any voluntary agreement to the acquisition of the land would disappear.  This would throw the housing programme into chaos.  City and county managers have acquired a certain expertise in these matters. Very often land owners recognise that they have a duty to perform and do not oppose the acquisition.  If the land had to be acquired compulsorily in every case, we would have queues of cases in the courts.  I am convinced nobody would let the land go easily.  While CPOs were being fought in the courts, the housing queue would get longer.  Far from achieving the aims which I am sure the Labour Party sincerely set out to achieve, the Bill would achieve the very opposite.  We would have chaos, whereas at the moment some kind of peace reigns.</P>
    <P>You cannot increase land.  The land is there.  If it is marshy land you can reclaim it.  If there are old buildings on it you can clear them away and build houses.  You can find extra money or extra enterprise, but you cannot find extra land.  Therefore, we have to be terribly careful how we enact laws to control land.  With our growing population, with the demand for housing getting bigger all <Col N="142" /> the time, we must ensure, by proper and wise government, that we can acquire the land needed.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a Deputy who represents a city area, I know how difficult this is.  It grieves me to see the price of a house built in the city.  The acquisition of the land may be a very large factor in the cost of that house.  We are building houses only half a mile from here, at City Quay, at quite a high cost.  First, you must acquire the land from owners of factories and warehouses, compensate them, and then clear the land and start building.  Despite the high cost, the Government have several schemes in the inner city.  I believe in developing the inner city.  I am realistic enough to know that this is not easily done.  The problem of acquiring land must be overcome by wise Government.</P>
    <P>I could not support the Labour Party's Bill.  Instead of helping, the Bill would only add to the housing queue. You would not get a fluid acquisition of agricultural land near any city or town. You would find it also impossible to build up a land bank which is so essential for the continuation of a housing programme.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill a local authority would have to acquire the land and then have to sell it back to the private sector.  Take the case of a farmer who owns land.  His son or daughter is getting married and wants to build a house.  Under the Bill they could not do that.  The local authority would acquire the land and then sell it back to the son or daughter to build a house.  It is a very clumsy way of getting rid of the housing problem.  That would happen if the Bill were enacted in its present form.</P>
    <P>In addition, restrictions are proposed enabling planning authorities to refuse planning permission for development of lands in the designated areas for no reason other than the fact that they are located in such areas and, having done this, to refuse to pay compensation for the reduction in value.  These proposals might indeed end speculation in land but unfortunately they would also put an end to the development of land in the <Col N="143" /> designated area by the private sector. The majority of houses built each year are built by the private sector and that should be encouraged.  It should not be left to the local authority to build all the houses needed because the local authority simply cannot do it.  The private sector has built thousands of houses throughout the country and will go on doing so.  We must help them.  I do not say we should help them at any price but we should help them to build houses that people can afford and not put further obstacles in their way which will increase the price of houses because of the delays which would ensue.  I do not suggest that our present laws are perfect and cannot be improved upon but I am convinced that this Bill would not improve the situation and therefore it would be a failure.</P>
    <P>The designated area referred to in this Bill is an area where lands would be used in a five-year period for all new development. In deciding on the boundary of the designated area the Bill proposes that regard be had to the developmental plan of the area.  Lands outside this designated area would presumably be sterilised for at least a five year period. The net result of all this is that building land in the designated areas would be tied up in compulsory acquisition proceedings and in the assessment of compensation, thus stifling new development in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that the aims of the Bill are sincere.  But sincerity in this is not enough.  It is no use telling a family waiting for a house that because of a flaw in a Bill enacted by sincere people they cannot have a house.  It would be a complete failure in regard to the speeding up of building on this land and, at any time, we need to speed up building.  I could never support this Bill because I believe it would slow down the housing drive.  I must say, in fairness to the Member who proposed this Bill, that I do not believe he intended this.  He is as anxious to speed up housing as the rest of us but he has gone the wrong way about it.  It would be better if he took the <Col N="144" /> Bill back and had a look at it and then put it forward again.</P>
    <P>I know there is a popular clamour to control the price of land, and it should be controlled.  It is immoral that people make huge profits from land because it has become a scarce commodity.  But wishful thinking does not control the price of land and we must have legislation which will enable the local authority and the private sector to build houses.  If a person can afford a house he will get it in the private sector but if he is among the lower paid workers he will look to the local authority for it.  His big need is a house and not the adjudication of how land should be acquired.  The young couple who put every penny they have into savings to buy the house which they want need to be helped.  The present legislation helps greatly.  Again, we would all like to see more generous legislation.  But we must be realistic.  We have to face the housing problem.  In my time in public life I have seen the frightful problem of housing in Dublin being brought down to manageable proportions. I am not being complacent when I say that.  I realise there are 5,000 or 6,000 people on the housing waiting list in this city alone and that because of obsolescence and other reasons we lose a certain number of houses each year.  But with building land being the key to the housing drive we must look at our laws to see how we can perfect them.  We have made tremendous progress in housing.  I heard the Minister say the other day that we would be building 25,000 houses this year.  People ask is this enough, but it is a good number.  We would like to see this increased but we must be realistic and wishful thinking will not build houses.</P>
    <P>This Bill would certainly mean the end of free enterprise.  I believe in free enterprise but it must be controlled for the common good.  We do not want to see people making huge profits from building at the expense of people who can ill afford the rent or the purchase price of a house.  At the same time over the years the private sector has contributed so much.  Many of the builders in the private sector are men who started <Col N="145" /> on their own.  All builders are not fat barons who make vast sums of money. We have hundreds of small firms who must be given some land to build on.  We must provide a pool of land so that the small builder can buy a site at a reasonable price to build houses so that they will be available to people who are on the waiting list of the local authority or who wish to buy privately from the builder.  We must provide land for the building co-operatives so that the members can build their own houses.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, we are back again to the acquisition of land.  This Bill will certainly not help here.  As I mentioned before, it would add greatly to the troubles of the local authority.  In this Bill, when the local authority are fortunate enough finally to obtain a piece of land in their designated area and dispose of the land to a private builder the builder's problems are not over.  He is now obliged, if he is not bankrupt at this stage, to develop the land on the local authority's terms and conditions and within specified time limits.  There is no incentive offered to private builders in this Bill.  The Bill assumes that the private building industry will agree fully with the proposed new arrangements. That is just not on.  I am sure the Labour Party are aware that the acquisition of land by local authorities at present is not always a simple and straight forward task.  If this Bill were to operate the local authority would be obliged not only to buy land for their own programme but also for the private housing sector.  This land would also have to be bought by compulsory purchase procedures and would stifle new development.  In addition local authorities would also be obliged to acquire and provide sites for industry and commercial development. The whole idea is unworkable.  Compulsory acquisition on such a massive scale in the suburbs of our towns and cities has the flavour of an alien tyranny about it.  Those who have served on local authorities will know that they have not got the staff or the machinery to go into such huge land deals.  It is not the duty of the local authority to go into the industrial field.  By all means let us plan <Col N="146" /> our suburbs properly so that we will have housing and industry to employ the people who live there.  This should all be done on properly planned lines.  It has been done in lots of places all over the country.  The local authority have a part to play in that development but they must not be seen to be a big brother organisation looking after every facet of the housing drive.</P>
    <P>We are not a big country but we must use all the resources we have in so far as our housing drive is concerned.  We must use the public sector&mdash;the town hall, the city hall and the staffs concerned&mdash;in ensuring that as many houses as possible are built each year, but let us not burden the public sector with a workload they are not geared to meeting.  Far from helping in the housing drive the Labour Party's proposal would cause chaos. Again, there would be the question of the financing of the kind of situation they propose, and we all know that money is always scarce so far as building is concerned. Since the foundation of the State successive Governments have tried very hard in the area of house building.  Any member of a local authority will be aware of the difficulty at times in regard to the housing drive but we have always managed by some means or other to maintain that drive.</P>
    <P>As a country we have one of the highest housing stocks proportionately in the world but that is not sufficient reason for anyone to be complacent about the situation.  We must realise that many people have to tolerate substandard housing conditions, people who are striving very hard to acquire proper housing for themselves and their families.  To this extent we welcome any proposal that would make their task easier; but, so far as the Bill before us is concerned, it falls short in many respects.  It appears to have been conceived hastily.  Consequently, the Labour Party might reconsider it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for the Environment moved an Estimate here recently for his Department he told us that £120 million would be necessary in order to acquire a land bank during a five-year <Col N="147" /> period.  The Minister said that as the land is disposed of to developers some of this money would be recovered but that it would be necessary for local authorities to continue to purchase land in order to maintain a land bank.  It is most essential that we have a land bank so that we shall not have a stop-go housing drive.  In this way, regardless of what other problems we may have to face, at least land for housing will be available.</P>
    <P>In a situation of an increasing population I do not expect that there can ever be an end to the housing shortage, but we can ensure that the problem is kept within minimum proportions.  I am sure that all sides here share the common aim of providing as many houses as possible and of raising the standard of houses, thereby providing a better standard of living for our people, both in urban and rural areas.  But it is in the cities that one finds the greatest level of poverty in terms of housing.</P>
    <P>Apart from the financial implications of the Bill has any consideration been given by the proposers to the staffing implications, to what would be the needs of local authorities in implementing such a proposal?  Even if we could afford the money that would be required to set up a new bureaucracy and even if the necessary qualified personnel could be found, there would be required also a new corps of officials who would become another layer in the planning control development machinery.  We often hear bureaucrats being lambasted, and while a certain amount of bureaucracy is necessary we should not impose restrictions in regard to the building drive simply for the sake of imposing restrictions.  We need a building drive that is flexible.  We need to be fair to everybody, including landowners.  We must ensure that our law afford them the same rights as those which apply to the rest of us.  But, having said that, I would not have any hesitation in proposing laws which would prohibit anybody from making a vast profit out of land merely because of a scarcity of land for building.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I welcome the opportunity given to us by the Labour Party by way of this Bill to debate this question of land for housing but I do not think that their proposal would help the housing drive in any way. I regard the Bill as a gesture towards something the Labour Party would like to see implemented, but perhaps the failure of the Bill is in their not really knowing what they want.  I agree with them regarding the control of land, but one must devise the machinery that would control land effectively and bring more land into use for the purpose of house building.  A build up of control at local authority level would not help in regard to housing output.  There is not any point in increasing bureaucracy unless one achieves greater effectiveness in what one is trying to do.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I must oppose the Bill.  However, there are some aspects of the Bill in relation to the control of land and to exorbitant profits that this party would subscribe to also.  However, apart from its faults, I still believe in the concept of free enterprise.  I trust that the Labour Party will withdraw the Bill and perhaps bring forward another piece of legislation on another occasion which would help in this whole area of housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Though this party have indicated their intention of abstaining in so far as this Bill is concerned, I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the issue in question.  The Bill is worthwhile to the extent that it has provided the forum for a debate here on this whole area of housing land.  For a number of years we have talked about the Kenny Report.  We have asked questions about the action to be taken on the findings of that report without receiving any real answers.  We now have an opportunity of talking about the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point to be made is that land must not be confiscated or nationalised, but on the other side of the coin there is the obnoxious situation of people becoming millionaires overnight because of their having land in a particular area. That is a situation that must not be tolerated.  It is one matter to talk about rights in respect of property, but we <Col N="149" /> must not overlook people's rights.  There is much emphasis in the Constitution in respect of property rights but very little emphasis about the right of people to a home, about the right to acquire a home at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>There is no question about it, land has become a high-price commodity. Builders have held big blocks of land and, as we have seen, rather than build on the land themselves, they parcel it out in small sites and sell it for vast profits. Is this what land is about?  Is this its purpose? Of course, it is not.  How can we control land for building?  How can we get around the problem without seeming to want to confiscate or nationalise?  We must be seen to be fair with people.  If they have land, they are entitled to a reasonable price for it, just as a person with a house is entitled to sell that house at a reasonable price.  That is the present open market situation.</P>
    <P>I fear what brings this type of Bill before the House and what concerns us all and that is the vast profit made on building land at the expense of the house purchaser.  I am a little disappointed that the Government side have not come up with any proposals.  I put down a question in the House a couple of weeks ago to the Minister of State responsible for this area.  Mind you, he has been conspicuous by his absence to date from this debate, though he said a couple of weeks ago that he had all sorts of plans, very involved, intricate, complicated and so forth.  I was hoping that this debate would bring forth from the Government side an initiative on the lines of a whole building land reform programme.  We have heard nothing of that, despite the fact that apparently a lot of work has been done.  It has been kept very quiet and secret to date, which leads me to believe that very little has, in fact, been done.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence in this debate other than that the situation is being examined, cross-checked and so on.  That is not satisfactory.  The Government had here an opportunity to expound some of their thoughts and views in relation to the whole area of building land; this they <Col N="150" /> have not done.  They have avoided the issue, which is disappointing.  The Government had an ideal opportunity to tell the Labour Party that their Bill was not suitable but that the Government were bringing in legislation along lines like these.  That that has not happened worries me.  I believe that nothing is happening and that the situation will drift on in future as it has drifted on for a fair few years to date.  It is a serious matter.  If we are to control and keep house prices down then we shall have to look into ways and means of tackling this problem.  Where we come across vast profits&mdash;and these are generally known&mdash;the whole capital gains tax area should be looked at with a view to taking the lion's share of exorbitant profits.  Alternatively, there should be a local authority land tax where local authorities can recoup money so that it can be put into the development of further land.  It is no use criticising the Bill as unworkable and as containing unacceptable issues.  That is not good enough.  People want to know what the Government are going to do, if they are going to do anything.  If they are not going to do anything, they should say straight out, that they they do not intend to take this issue seriously.</P>
    <P>I asked a supplementary question twice recently as to whether it was a constitutional problem and was told that it was not, but that it was a complex problem.  That is not an answer.  Some people think it is a constitutional problem.  If it is, let us say it is and let us look at the Constitution.  If a Constitution is to mean anything, it must safeguard the rights of people.</P>
    <P>The drawing of a line on the map and the zoning of development land from agricultural land overnight brings in an exorbitant price and a man can become a millionare overnight because of a line drawn on the map.  The Government have a duty to do something about this. People selling land are, of course, entitled to a reasonable profit.  They may want to buy land and set up a business elsewhere.  However, the lion's share of that profit should go back into further land acquisition by the local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> Another area which must be looked at is that of zoning.  Is zoning land a good idea?  Is it restrictive?  I believe it is restrictive and that we should look at that principle again to see if we cannot open up greater tracks of land for development.  The more land that is available for housing purposes, the more the price of the houses will be kept down.</P>
    <P>There is a local authority levy on land of £15,000 per acre.  That levy is long out of date.  It should be substantially increased. Local authorities should not be spending money on servicing land.  They should be able to recoup that money to ensure an ongoing process of developing large land banks.  The only way to have a serious land policy is by funding local authorities so that they can acquire vast tracts of land.  Whether they are acquired at the agricultural price obviously is a matter that would have to be examined. One must examine the particular instance, the business being operated by people at the time of purchase of that land and what would be its replacement cost by the same type of business.  One would have to have a broad approach to the subject.  But basically there would have to be tight control over land prices.</P>
    <P>I have made some suggestions, one being that there be larger tracts of land made available for housing development, which would tend to depress its price. Another is that the local authority be afforded greater scope in purchasing the land.  Possibly that is the way it should be done.  The Labour Party motion talks about designated areas in which local authorities would do this as part of a five year plan to be reviewed every other five years.  The idea is good but whether one could acquire it at an appropriate price is a moot point.  I believe people would have to negotiate the purchase price.</P>
    <P>I always favoured the local authority being empowered to purchase land.  I believe the local authority should be the sole owner of development land so that if people want to dispose of their land they do so to the local authority.  It is with that kind of development only that one can establish an overall plan, a plan for <Col N="152" /> the hinterland, for new towns, so there would not be the ribbon development that obtains when developers are able to purchase tracts of land thereby causing an upsurge of ribbon development which is often unsightly and undesirable.  I believe the local authorities should be empowered to purchase the land but the bone of contention is the determination of its price.  The local authority should be the owners of the land, selling then to various builders.  In that way they can then plan socially and otherwise.  One of the problems experienced when a site is sold at a very high price is that that area becomes an exclusive, elitist class area, people are saying: &ldquo;This is the place to live.&rdquo;  I do not accept that that is a good way in which to develop society.  The only way that practice can be discontinued is by the local authority having control over the lands, then selling to developers and, on the basis of that sale, the on-going purchase of other lands.  It may appear to be a rather simplistic method, but if we want to have control it is the only way such can be achieved; otherwise, chaos reigns.  There will be the problem every other five years of re-zoning, of astronomical land costs and, eventually, the unfortunate house purchaser footing the bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moore, said that such would slow up progress and could constitute an impediment to the development of housing.  That may well be, but the question of building land must be tackled sooner or later.  When any task such as this is taken on there is always a fear&mdash;the fear of change tends to stop people in their tracks.  But once something becomes an established practice apprehension is overcome.  I admit that in the initial stages there may be apprehension&mdash;I do not think there will be&mdash;but if that is a genuine fear of the Minister of State I believe it can be overcome reasonably easily.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared to tackle this in a realistic way.  I do not see any will on the part of the Government so to do.  I have heard nothing from the Government side.  Perhaps we will hear something from the Minister of State who is responsible for this area.  I hope <Col N="153" /> we will.  I look forward to what he has to say and hope it will give us some indication of Government thinking in this respect so that we may look forward with some degree of hope, because to date there has been no hope at all on this subject of building land.  There have been merely pious platitudes, with the Kenny Report being trotted out at regular intervals, taken out of cold storage, put back in again, the dust being blown off it from time to time.  We are told that something is happening but that it is complex and will take some time.  I reject this type of attitude.  It is time we were given some reasonable indication what line the Government are taking.  Let them introduce a Bill and if they are concerned about its constitutionality, then let it be tested by the courts in this respect.  But let us do something.  Let us not be making endless excuses.  It is time we were honest.  We know there are problems, that there are areas of agreement and others of disagreement.  But, broadly speaking, people want something done in this area because of the very high prices of building sites.</P>
    <P>I do not contend that the control of building land is a panacea for the problem of providing cheap houses; of course, it is not.  Building costs are rising astronomically and we are aware of this. But we must look at every aspect of house development and building to see where corners can be cut in order to make houses as attractive as possible from the buyers' point of view.</P>
    <P>Because of the astronomical cost of housing today, large numbers of people are going onto local authority housing lists.  Many of these people would themselves purchase their homes if it were not for the high deposits and interest rates, but particularly the high cost of sites. This situation could be changed completely if local authorities had greater control of the acquisition of land, if they were able to make available much more serviced building land.  This would serve to keep the price down to a reasonable level.  The main component in the present high price of sites is that building land in certain areas has become known as a <Col N="154" /> scarce commodity and part of the reason for this is the way in which we zone our areas, bringing in large numbers of people who want to live in those areas, and in such circumstances site prices escalate.</P>
    <P>One must ask whether this system is fair or just and whether we can stand over it.  The answer is that it is neither fair nor just.  This is not a free market situation because it opens up competition and land becomes scarce and very dear and normal free market forces do not obtain.  There is no doubt that there is unadulterated greed because people want to make large sums of money.  I am not fighting with such people, but Governments have a responsibility to control this type of thing so that certain individuals would not be allowed to have rights and deprive others of their rights. If people own land or other property they are entitled to a good profit but they are not entitled to soak the community en route to becoming a privileged class at the expense of people who badly need houses and who are trying to buy them.</P>
    <P>That is why it is so important for successive Governments here to exercise their authority to control building land prices.  People outside designated areas must pay high prices for land, but we cannot replace a bad system with another bad system.  Therefore we must devise a system that will ensure equity in regard to building land, a system without loopholes.  If I am in a zoning area and my colleague is in an non-zoning area, I am a wealthy man and though my colleague would not be a poor man he has not acquired the wealth I have. Where is the equity in such a situation?</P>
    <P>All this must be examined in accordance with the needs of the people, not on rights to property.  We have been talking about property rights in the past without taking any account of the needs of the people, and it is time for the Government to emerge with a policy on building land that will be fair, and seen to be fair, to everybody.  I do not want draconian legislation which would deprive people of their rights, but rights are not for the privileged alone.  If we are <Col N="155" /> to take seriously our job as legislators we must legislate to ensure that equity will prevail all around, that we will not take rights from people who possess them. We must try to meet everybody's point of view.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill was introduced because it has given us an opportunity to discuss a subject which has been dodged for many years and I hope that before the debate has been completed the Government will indicate the road they intend to take and when they will bring before the House the Bill on building land reforms long overdue, a Bill that would cut out property speculation, that would give greater power to local authorities to plan for the future development of our cities and towns.  The Government may be hedging on this because of their friends.  It is time they came out with the truth.  I will keep putting down questions on this matter because I am not satisfied that the problem is being taken seriously.  So far, the response of the Government to this Bill has been a disgrace.  They have not given any concrete proposals.  If they are not satisfied with the Bill let them come up with proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill can be looked at from many points of view, the political, the social and the practical, and it is difficult to know where to start.  I think that starting from the political point of view might be the most interesting and objective. This Bill is proposed by a member of the Labour Party.  It must be recognised that the Labour Party are on several prominent corporations and councils throughout the country and in a better position of extreme power to implement various provisions in regard to land usage than Fianna Fáil because of their position of inferiority on these councils.  It must be remembered that not so very long ago the same people were in a very strong position in relation to all sorts of land utilisation because for a number of years they formed the Government. A Labour member was Minister <Col N="156" /> for Local Government with power to do as he wished with this type of legislation.</P>
      <P>It is ironic, politically, to see that they waited until they were in Opposition before providing what they considered to be the panacea for all the ills they claim exist in land usage and land development. This lack of enthusiasm when they were in power is difficult to understand when they know, politically, it is a nonstarter and when their Coalition partners decided not to support this Bill.  It is incredible listening to some of the arguments put forward by Fine Gael, their ex-partners in Coalition, calling on a Fianna Fáil Government to do something while at the same time washing their hands of the Bill and saying they will not support it because it is not worthy of support.</P>
      <P>They had the opportunity to do something about this for four years and at present they have power in many local authorities which they are not using.  It must seem odd to spectators when a Bill of this type is being put forward by the Labour Party to alleviate the situation? Are they even concerned about alleviating the situation?  Is this Bill in essence, nothing more than a political shot across the bows in an effort to gain cheap publicity and cheap advantage over a problem for which this Bill does not find a solution?  Is this Bill nothing but the cheap political motivation of somebody who, perhaps for the best of motives, is looking for an easy way of advancing ideological ideas which can be implemented in other areas but are not? Instead they are discussed in this House where he knows they will not be treated seriously because they do not deserve it. On the political front, this creates utmost suspicion that somebody is putting forward an idea which is basically without support, which is unworthy of support, and is incapable of solving the so-called crisis in relation to prices of building land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous for the Labour Party to put this motion to the House knowing that for a number of years they had the chance to introduce such legislation but refused to so do, and knowing that on a <Col N="157" /> different level they have many opportunities to introduce measures but have not had the courage to do so.</P>
    <P>These are objective political observations which this House must look at.  The Labour Party, as usual, are building castles in the air, doing what is so easy on paper, in theory and while in Opposition, but when they were in Government they did not have the ability or the courage to even look at it.  On the other hand we have the peculiar and comical situation of their erstwhile partners in Coalition going against their socialist partners and refusing to support this Bill.  Objectively they are right not to support it but politically it looks very peculiar to hear Fine Gael members giving specious reasons why this Bill should be supported, yet saying they will not support it. Was there ever such a circus of practical politics in this House?  The lack of solutions to these problems is exposed in the arguments put forward by the Fine Gael and Labour Members.</P>
    <P>It is intriguing to see the enthusiasm expressed by people who are supposed to be socialists saying they can do this, that and the other by imposing controls, forgetting that a short time ago they could have introduced these measures but that they did not do so.  It is very easy to stand on the sidelines and advise a hurler or a footballer but the Labour Party are failing miserably in devising or making workable proposals.</P>
    <P>Some of the figures thrown out in wild hysteria are laughable.  It was ridiculous for the Leader of the Labour Party to say land can be bought for £4,000 an acre and by a stroke of a pen can be turned into £40,000 an acre.  It is wonderful to think about it but it does not happen.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil came into office they introduced the certificate of reasonable value.  This has controlled the price of building land to the extent that house values have been kept within reasonable value.  It has ensured that the majority of increases in expenditure on housing have gone into the areas of wages and proper development of house building.  This practical initiative has ensured that the price of building <Col N="158" /> land has remained very reasonable.  A builder when purchasing his raw materials knows his end product, a house, must give reasonable value for money.  We waited in vain for many years for such an initiative to come from Labour or Fine Gael but they had neither the wit nor ability to develop such a radical idea.</P>
    <P>A builder may be capable of spending £40,000 per acre and selling houses on that land for £8,000 each and this is what the man in the street wants to see. Under Fianna Fáil policies a relatively free market in land has resulted in very substantial building progress in relation to working class houses.  This is largely due to our recognition of the need of the working man to buy his own home at a reasonable price or his right to rent a house at a reasonable rent.  We have always encouraged people to own their own houses or to rent them at a price they can afford.</P>
    <P>This is in total contrast to the so-called solicitude of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, the Coalition which exists at some time and not at others. The policies which have evolved with Fianna Fáil have created a situation where the working man has been and is now able to buy his own house or to rent it at a very cheap price.  This has been the result of a caring administration committed to the belief that the person buying the product should be able to afford it, while the man working in the endustry gets a good wage and the entrepreneur has the freedom to make his own decision as to what price he pays for land.</P>
    <P>Some of the possibilities of this legislation are so mind-boggling as to be frightening.  For example, let us consider that a local authority could arbitrarily draw a line on a map and thus create a designated area.</P>

      <P>It is nice to have an answer to a hypothetical question.  If the proposer of this Bill were really sincere he would have the courage not to claim it as his Bill but immediately say that the Minister is the person who will have to implement it.  If, as he claims, he has the ability to frame a Bill in a workable way, then he should have stated what he wanted. The silliness of the unworkable ideas contained in this Bill is shown by the Deputy's remark that he will throw out the ideas and let someone else implement them.  Somebody else will have to pick up the ball and play it.</P>
      <P>It is very clever to pose questions from the Deputy's side of the House without giving the answers.  The Labour Party controlled several local authorities and were in Government for about four years and were not able to play the ball which they now propose should be played.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are concerned for the person who is buying a house and their track record in this respect is impeccable. We are a broadly based party and we recognise that some people can afford to pay £8,000 for a house while others can afford £20,000 or £40,000. To a large extent we have been successful in creating the situation where a person may begin by buying a house for £8,000 and eventually progress to a house worth very much more.  We do not say in a doctrinaire way that certain land must be used for a particular purpose. We realise that we are a diverse people with diverse interests, abilities and objectives. We have been very practical in giving our people the opportunity to become house owners and land owners. This is in total contrast to what is proposed in this empty Bill which can do nothing but stultify development and inhibit people in their desire to own their own homes.</P>

      <P>If this Bill can only engender a cheap personal attack, it merely shows its paucity of thought and its total lack of ability to do what it purports to do. The alternative to the Bill is a simple one: to acknowledge that there is a scarcity of building land and to instruct the authorities controlled by Labour and Fine Gael to allow anybody anywhere to pay for the servicing of land developed by the planning authorities.  They have not done that.  They have merely indulged in cheap jibes and have not provided any alternative.</P>
      <P>If people are to be provided with houses, land must be available but this is being hindered by a type of thinking that demands control over everything that happens.  The dearth of thinking on the part of Labour and Fine Gael has meant that houses are not being provided for those in need.  This Bill will do nothing to bring down the price of houses.  It is in total contrast to the system of the certificate of reasonable value introduced by this Govenment which controls building land.  This means that the first time buyer of a house knows that his property has been constructed to a good standard.  It is also the first time that consumer protection has been brought into the realm of house purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who throw out cheap jibes have not come up with one workable alternative.  During the period of office of the National Coalition every house in the Dublin County Council area was provided on land that was left as a legacy from previous Fianna Fáil administrations. During that period not one house was built on land provided by the <Col N="163" /> Government of the day.  When the Labour Party were in office with Fine Gael they did not bring forward a Bill like this because they knew it was incapable of implementation and it would not have a good effect on the people of Dublin city and county and of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The land bank policy of previous Fianna Fáil administrations did what this Bill hopes to do, namely, to enable local authorities to have substantial areas of land under their control so that local authority housing and, where necessary, private housing could proceed in an orderely manner.  The type of sterile thinking behind this Bill reduces the ability of local authorities to provide houses for those who need them.  If the normal process of acquiring land was widened in scope it would mean there would be no land available for local authority housing for generations to come.  If provisions in this Bill were adopted it would mean that land would not come into the possession of local authorities for a long time.  Thus, they would be hindered in their efforts to provide housing.</P>
    <P>This Bill was not given careful consideration. It will not achieve what it proposes to do.  It will not help anybody in the matter of housing.  As a political initiative it started in failure and it will be doomed to failure.  The idea of giving a local authority total control over zoning and over the provision of building land has not worked in other countries.  It was the subject of a short and unsuccessful experiment in England some years ago. There is no way it could work in this country.</P>

      <P>I am raising this matter on the Adjournment because I believe a genuine mistake has been made and I am asking the Minister of State at the Department of Education to correct the error.  I believe a mistake has been made because of an answer given in this House last Tuesday, 3 June, to a question I tabled some time ago.  I put down the question when I read in the national newspapers of the allocations that had been made by the Minister of State at the Department of Education to various centres for sport complexes.  I was dismayed to find that Dungarvan was not among the centres listed.  Over the past three years I have raised this matter in the House at Question Time and on each occasion I was told that no funds were available for such a sports complex in Dungarvan.  Last Tuesday I asked the Minister for Education if he would make a grant available for the proposed sports complex at Dungarvan, County Waterford, to which Deputy Tunney replied:</P>
      <P>The only application received in my Department for assistance towards the provision of a sports complex in Dungarvan was dated 14 April 1980 and it related to a project for the use of the employees of a particular firm, their families and near relatives. It was not received in time for consideration in connection with the projects being selected for assistance.  It would not have qualified for such assistance because of the limitations on its usage.</P>

    <P>I appreciate that such a complex would not be accepted if it were merely for one firm and their families but the original application for a grant was made in March 1972.  At that time Waterford County Council, Dungarvan Urban District Council and the County Waterford Vocational Education Committee got together to set up a sub-committee with members drawn from each of those bodies so as to develop a multi-purpose <Col N="165" /> sports complex in Dungarvan.  It was proposed to locate this complex at Ringnasilogue on property owned by Dungarvan Urban District Council.  In March 1973 the Department of Education in their official letter No. F 35/7/6 authorised and conveyed sanction to the County Waterford Vocational Education Committee to commission a professional feasibility report on the provision of a recreational and physical education centre for West Waterford to be based in Dungarvan.  In September 1973 the survey was prepared by Messrs.  O'Sullivan and Partners, architects, Tralee, County Kerry, who were architects to the Tralee multi-purpose sports complex.  When completed this survey was presented to the Vocational Education Committee.  In July 1974 officials of the Department of Education met the CEO of the Waterford VEC and informed him that it would be necessary to obtain a contribution of 30 per cent from the post-primary schools in the town in connection with the development of the sports complex. The post-primary schools in the town have either just completed major developments or are carrying out major developments at present and these major developments were being mooted at that time.  Saint Augustine's College is newly built and has extensive recreational facilities.  The other schools involved are the Christian Brother schools, the Presentation Convent schools and the Mercy Convent schools all of which are building on large extensions and are not in a position to contribute the 30 per cent required.</P>
    <P>In August 1974 a letter from the Department of Education authorised the VEC to retain Messrs.  O'Sullivan and Partners to make a line drawing of the proposed multi-purpose sports hall in conjunction with the overall plans which had been presented.  That plan has been prepared but since then the sub-committee and the CEO of the VEC have heard nothing on the project.  That might be because the schools could not, because of their other commitments, come up with the contribution requested. However, if the Department showed a <Col N="166" /> willingness to give a major grant such as has been given to other centres, the necessary local contribution would have been forthcoming.  The major firms in the town and surrounding areas are willing to make major contributions.  As well as that the trade union movements and the trade union council have given such a sports complex their full backing and are prepared to engage the support of their members.  Will the Minister of State seriously reconsider the question of a grant for such a sports complex in Dungarvan?</P>
    <P>The nearest sports complex recently grant-aided is in Ballybeg in Waterford city which is 30 miles from Dungarvan and 50 or 60 miles from areas which Dungarvan would cater for.  County Waterford is geographically structured so that Waterford city is at the apex of an isosceles triangle.  I am sure the Minister can imagine how far removed from Waterford are the portions of the county at the base of that triangle and how they could not benefit from a sports complex based in the city.  Dungarvan is somewhat west of centre in the county and is an ideal location for such a complex. If any money is available it should be directed towards this project.</P>
    <P>I understand that the tripartite committee which was set up last year as part of the national understanding allocated £8 million to the Minister's Department primarily for projects such as this and for youth employment schemes and that £5 million of that £8 million have now been allocated for sports complexes which vary in size.  Some of them would cost in the region of £200,000, some will cost £100,000 and some will cost less than that.  I understand that 60 locations throughout the country are earmarked for these moneys.  What is causing annoyance in County Waterford is the fact that some of those projects were only presented to the Minister as late as last year.  With all the planning and work that has gone into this complex, starting as long ago as eight years, it is understandable that people are quite upset about this.  This centre would cater for some 30,000 people.  That is a sizeable <Col N="167" /> number of people and they are certainly in need of a major recreational centre. There has been a vast increase in employment in that area particularly in Dungarvan in the past ten years due to the advent of Waterford Glass, which is a major factory employing 500 young people.  A number of smaller industries were set up and some others are planned in the immediate future.  The growth in population has been quite considerable.  I am sorry to say that the growth in recreational facilities has been virtually nil and voluntary effort has endeavoured, through local youth clubs, to fill the void.  They cannot succeed because the type of money they get is only peanuts when considered with what is needed.</P>
    <P>There is clear indication that there is need for such a centre.  I am asking, in as nice a way as possible, that Dungarvan be given first priority if any of the the £5 million which has been allocated is not spent.  As usual with such major schemes where there are so many projects outlined some will fall by the wayside due to lack of local commitment or lack of local funds.  We would be only too glad to avail of any such money, preferably in the £200,000 category.  The project planned and presented by the architects would require in excess of that sum.  The statutory bodies, voluntary bodies and local industry in the town can be depended on to meet the proportion of local contribution which is demanded by the Department.</P>
    <P>Dungarvan Urban Council allocated a site for the proposed sports complex. That site is still there.  It was earmarked for a sports complex and has never been used for anything else nor will it be.  The ground work has been done and I should like the Minister to reciprocate by providing the grant in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the words of Deputy Deasy in respect of the &ldquo;nice way&rdquo; in which he presented his case, one is prevented from digging too deeply into the background of sport <Col N="168" /> and physical recreational requirements in this country.  One is not given an opportunity of referring with relish to the situation that obtained regarding the provision of sporting and recreational facilities during the bleak years of 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976 leading to a situation where in 1977 when I inherited the title of Minister for Sport I inherited that which is best described by people in Mayo and other areas as the double negative.  I was presented with a situation where in my Department in respect of financial provision for these urgent needs there was nothing for nobody.  The double negative describes more aptly than that which might be more correct grammatically the true position; no staff, no money, no sports council, nothing.  That is as far as I intend going back.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the background to get Deputy Deasy to accept that in respect of the alleged application there was no error in the Department because since my arrival in the Department, bearing in mind changes which have occurred, there was established a special youth and sport section dealing exclusively with non-formal educational requirements. The Deputy knows that in respect of primary, secondary and third level education there are the traditional sections which deal with that.  My assigned duties and responsibilities refer to the non-formal educational requirements and we have been dealing with those although keeping in contact of a kind with the other sections of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy knows that our area is a specific one.  We were given the responsibility this year of administering the new scheme arising from funds which became available to us from the tripartite fund, topped up by the Government, and we worked exclusively on information, intimations and applications which were in the youth and sport section.  We had, and this is a worthwhile reflection on the growth that has occurred, a sufficiency of that type of live application which enabled us to pursue the matter as requested by the Taoiseach, following his announcement about the availability of <Col N="169" /> this money, so that in a short period of some weeks we were able to present to him and to the tripartite committee&mdash;I should like to thank them and express my appreciation and indebtedness to them for accepting the need that exists and will continue to exist for the provision of these facilities&mdash;an acceptable plan.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Deasy refers to the dormant or neglected application or proposal which lay in some pigeonhole in some section of the Department of Education because, as he admits, the requirement of the day in respect of the 30 per cent contribution had not been satisfied, he is not accepting the nature of the fund from which we operated in the allocation of moneys for these recreational facilities.  As a Deputy representing that constituency it is understandable that he is disappointed that Dungarvan did not figure in those allocations but I expect that he shares with me the joy that part of his consitiuency did figure.  That area having been satisfied there is a greater likelihood that Dungarvan, and other parts of his constituency, will have the facilities which, as I stated earlier, are as urgent as any other educational facilities in that constituency, or in any other.  As I stated we inherited a rather sick state in the Department.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that the application was not live in the area of youth and sport in my Department.  The application to which we referred when replying to the parliamentary question was late and so narrow in its provision as to have it excluded from consideration under this fund.  I should like to express my appreciation and thanks to the trade union movement and the employers who belatedly, as belatedly, perhaps, as some of the politicians, have accepted the need and the urgency that exists in respect of providing for our people, young and not so young, facilities for the employment of their spare time in a gainful and healthy fashion.</P>

      <P>Latest available figures show that the number registered as unemployed at Thurles exchange has decreased by over 300 since April 1977.  In addition manufacturing employment in the town has increased by over 250 since January 1977.</P>
      <P>In its Industrial Plan 1978&mdash;1982, the Industrial Development Authority have set a target to create 500 new manufacturing jobs for the Thurles and Templemore town grouping.  The Authority are confident that it will achieve this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> I am informed by the IDA that despite the fact that industrialists have been brought to Thurles on 11 separate occasions since the beginning of this year, a suitable project for the town has not so far emerged.  The Authority are fully alive to the industrial development needs of the town and are actively promoting its 18,750 sq. ft. advance factory and the recently acquired 76 acre site in the town.</P>
    <P>As part of its role for the intensive development of small indigenous industry in the mid west, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited have undertaken an intensive drive in the Thurles area to promote native small industry by encouraging local enterpreneurs. To this end, the company have purchased a 2.4 acre site on which two 2,500 sq. ft. factories have been constructed. One of these factories is already occupied and the other has been allocated for a potential project.  In addition, a temporary demountable building on the Thurles industrial estate has been allocated to another potential project.</P>

      <P>The situation regarding High Court family law cases is not as represented in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The High Court has one courtroom allocated to it in Ormond House where family law matters are dealt with on a regular basis.  The particular judge dealing with family law matters changes <Col N="57" /> from term to term.  The nature of family law litigation involves in some cases renewed applications to court because of changing circumstances, and in some such cases it is desirable that the parties go back to the judge who has already dealt with the case.  If it happens that he is not the judge currently sitting in Ormond House he will take the application in some courtroom in the Four Courts building, but on such occasions only the persons directly concerned are allowed to be present.</P>
    <P>Occasionally it may happen that the family law list in Ormond House becomes overloaded with urgent cases one of which may be taken by a judge who happens to be available in the Four Courts.  Again, any such case will be held <i>in camera.</i></P>

      <P>The main reason for the delay in dealing with the case was shortage of valuer staff and pressure of statutory rating work in the Valuation Office.

      <P>In my reply to the Deputy's question of 27 May about progeny testing and performance recording of certain breeds of sheep, I indicated that these schemes formed part of my Department's sheep breeding improvement programme.  The expenditure of £16,000 mentioned in the reply related to these schemes only and covered the years 1977, 1978 and 1979. The total gross expenditure on all the Department's sheep breeding improvement measures during that period was £193,000.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 10 September 1977 and was paid at the rate appropriate to a married man from 13 September 1977 to 11 December 1978.  In connection with this claim he stated that his date of birth was 27 April 1914. When payment of benefit ceased he claimed old age contributory pension on 16 January 1979.  At this stage it came to light that his correct date of birth was 27 April 1908.  It also transpired that he had been living apart from his wife for a number of years.  He therefore received payment of unemployment benefit including an increase for his wife amounting to £2179.55 to which he was not entitled.</P>
      <P>On receipt of his claim for old age contributory pension in January 1979 it was decided to treat it as having been made on 10 September 1977 the date of his claim to unemployment benefit and to allow it from 10 June 1977 at the rate appropriate to a man without a dependant. Due to the onset of the postal dispute, it was not possible to have payment of old age contributory pension made to him until 3 August 1979.  The total amount of pension due to him from 10 June 1977 to 3 August 1979 was £1766.70, resulting in a net overpayment of £412.85.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances there are no arrears of old age pension due to him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 14 August 1979 but was not entitled to payment as the 1978 insurance card, on which his entitlement to benefit depended, had not been received in my Department.  The contributions due by his employer in <Col N="67" /> respect of him for the years 1976 and 1977 were also outstanding.</P>
      <P>Following investigation by the local officer of my Department the outstanding contributions for the years 1976 to 1978 were collected on 19 May 1980.  These contributions had the effect of entitling him to benefit, and payment of disability benefit for the period from 17 August 1979 (fourth day of incapacity) to 16 May 1980 was made to him on 26 May 1980.  Two further payments of benefit after that date were issued on 29 May and 6 June 1980 on receipt of continuing medical evidence of incapacity.</P>

      <P>Medical evidence of incapacity has been received from the person concerned in respect of the period from 17 March 1980 to 26 May 1980.  He was not entitled to payment at the outset of his claim as the 1978 insurance card, on which his entitlement to benefit depended, had not been received in my Department.  Following inquiries regarding the outstanding card it was established that he had sufficient paid contributions in that year to qualify him for benefit.  Payment of disability benefit from 20 March 1980, fourth day of incapacity, to 26 May 1980, date of latest certificate received, has now been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no record of the receipt of medical certificates from the claimant for the period from 4 February to 17 March 1980.
