      <P>When I moved the adjournment last Thursday evening I had been trying to give an objective assessment of the budget.  I had been critical where I thought constructive criticism was needed and I had given credit where credit was due.  One thing that I said on Thursday is very relevant, that is, that unfortunately budgets are not looked at objectively.  Judgment of them depends on which side of the House one is.  That was patent yesterday on the Social Welfare Bill but not with all Deputies. Some Deputies on the far side of the House gave credit for the huge increases given in social welfare but others saw nothing at all good in the budget.  This is the type of thing which the ordinary people do not think much of.  The budget gave huge increases in social welfare and I give credit to the Deputies on the other side who acknowledged that.  Yesterday I was astonished to hear the Leader of the Labour Party say that he could see nothing at all in the Social Welfare Bill. With the unprecedented increases in <Col N="1837" /> social welfare which we have been given I could not understand that.</P>
      <P>I have objections to that Bill.  I did not hear any mention yesterday of the question of increases of income and the old age pension.  A person with an income of £6 in 1979 should not be debarred from getting the full pension, but that has been the law and neither the Coalition nor the present Government have changed that.  I have appealed to have it changed.  I also made an appeal on the Social Welfare Bill regarding the prescribed relative's allowance.  At present it is given when a relative is bedridden or an invalid, and I appeal that that allowance be given across the board to enable people to keep their relatives at home where they want to die.</P>
      <P>Regarding social welfare I want to contradict a statement which has been bandied around County Galway in connection with small farmers.  Prominent members of the Opposition are going around the country saying that in this budget small farmers have to go on a factual income and if they object they will be made to do so.  Nothing is further from the truth.  The Minister for Social Welfare said yesterday that the rate of unemployment and assistance paid to smallholders who opt for the notional system of assessment will be maintained at their 1979 level.  The Minister for Social Welfare said yesterday also when he introduced Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill:</P>
      <P>In the case of smallholders in certain disadvantaged areas, means for unemployment assistance purposes may be assessed notionally by reference to land valuation, where the valuation is £20 or less.  In these cases, special rates of unemployment assistance are payable.  This is a concession having regard both to the present levels of farm incomes and the means test for unemployment assistance generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if you are on the notional system you do not get an increase but it is optional for farmers who think that the <Col N="1838" /> notional system is hard on them to apply to go on the factual income basis.  Those who go on to that will get the increase but as far as I know out of thousands and thousands of small farmers only about 3,000 or 4,000 in the west of Ireland who have very low valuations will remain on the notional system.  I emphasise that.  I do not want certain prominent Senators going around telling the small farmers of County Galway and the west of Ireland that the small farmer social welfare is finished and that they must go on the factual income.  This has been pasted across the papers in the west.  Both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare mentioned it in their speeches and, unless I misinterpreted them, these statements are untrue.  Deputy Bruton mentioned that there should be an increase in this but did not say what has been said in the west and what has been bandied about in all the newspapers: that people would have to go on factual income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was terrible to take up the local paper last week and see the headlines.  The front pages of the <i>Connaught Tribune</i> reported a prominent Senator in the west as saying that all small farmers would be now forced on to factual income.  The headlines said that farmers' dole was being phased out.  The factual income system does not suit a number of small farmers with under £40 valuations who may have a few sidelines. Deputy Bruton has a point in that their social welfare just might be increased. But I want the facts and they are that there is no question of small farmers being <Col N="1839" /> forced to go on factual income.  That Senator must have been sadly misinformed and his statement was untrue.  I make factual statements and I would like to hear the same from the other side.  In fairness, Deputy Bruton made no untrue statement, but I would ask him to ask his party in the west to work on facts in relation to the question of small farmers social welfare.</P>
      <P>All this so-called worry about the small farmer just annoys me.  I remember a time when I could not go to a meeting without people saying that we had the country ruined with the dole. Now these people are crying crocodile tears for the small farmers.  We were the first to introduce the small farmer social welfare and at the time we were accused of vote catching.  This system was continued by the Coalition Government, but it was Fianna Fáil who introduced it and Fianna Fáil have no notion of doing away with this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that it would be more realistic to increase the multiplier.  If the multiplier is increased certain people in receipt of social welfare will be brought out of the net, or else they can be put on factual income.  The farmers at present on the notional system know quite well what factual income means; it means that the inspector will inspect their incomes as he does for old age pensioners.  If farmers with large families think that they will do better on the factual income system I would warn them not to be too quick to change because they might find themselves worse off than not having an increase in the notional system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a lot of talk about this being an executive budget.  We know it is an executive budget.  Every increase given over the last six years was given to executives and nobody from the trade union movement objected to percentage increases only myself in the Dáil.  I heard nobody except Deputy Dr. O'Connell and Deputy Bermingham objecting.  Of course when increases and allowances are given on a percentage basis, executives will get the most.  The people speaking for the workers are executives <Col N="1840" /> themselves and that is why they do not object to it.  It is the system that is wrong.  It is annoying to hear people say that it is an executive budget.  Who wants to change it?  What socialist will stand up and say that he wants to change it?  I want to change it and have been lobbying for change over the last 12 years.  I always maintained that increases should be given on a headage rate across the board because the cost of living does not go up any higher for the man earning £20,000 per annum than for the man earning about £4,000.  My criticism of the budget is that it is inclined to give too much to the higher income group but this is being given according to a system.</P>
    <P>There are two types of PAYE workers and they should be classified separately. There is the ordinary PAYE worker who gets paid on a Saturday night and then there are company directors and ourselves. We all pay as we earn.  It is not fair to say that the PAYE sector, meaning the ordinary workers, are paying the most taxation.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday I referred to the whole question of farmer taxation and to farming in general.  I am not keen on resource tax or on the 2 per cent levy.  I am not keen on any tax that is not an income tax.  The Taoiseach said that the resource tax was a temporary measure, but until taxation is evened out and people know who will be taxed all the taxation due will not come from farmers.  I agree with taxation on accounts.  A lot of people are talking about a new system of taxation.  I would really like to know of a taxation system that is fairer than taxation on income. A purchase tax will hit the really poor.  If a person is making an income he ought to pay tax on it.  Therefore, I am all for tax on accounts where if one has a profit one pays tax and if not one does not pay.</P>
    <P>One of the nice things in the budget is that people with valuations of from £40 to £49 will have a simple form of tax form to fill in.  I cannot understand why a simple form cannot be used by everybody.  A small farmer with six children with a valuation of, say, £40.10 is not in a position to pay a couple of <Col N="1841" /> hundred pounds to an accountant to prove that he is not taxable.  That is why the present accounts system is objectionable to the small farmer.  A simplified accounts system for farmers with valuations between £40 and £49 is something that should be looked into.  If we accept a simplified form of accounts it will be in our interests because the large farmer or businessman can pay an accountant who would be able to fix things so as to get a lot more relief than an ordinary simple man could get using a simple form of accounts. Such a farmer would seek the assistance of an accountant because it would pay him to do so but I am concerned about the farmers with small holdings.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the decision to assess on valuation because valuations vary greatly throughout the country.  For instance, in one county land may be valued as low as half a crown per acre while elsewhere in that county it may be £1.50 per statute acre.  In my view all tax and reliefs should be based on the adjusted acre.  How does one arrive at the number of adjusted acres?  Farmers who apply for a grant must specify on the application form the number of adjusted acres.  It is the job of instructors to ascertain the number of adjusted acres. A farmer may have 100 acres of poor land but the number of adjusted acres on that holding may only amount to 30. The number of adjusted acres is usually less than the total acreage of a farm.  I know people who live along the banks of the Shannon between Ballinasloe and Shannon Airport whose land is flooded for almost six months of the year.  That land carries a valuation of £1.50 per statute acre which means that those farmers may now be brought into the tax net and are likely to lose their agricultural grant.  I know farmers in my county whose land carries a valuation of half a crown per acre but have up to 100 friesian cows and, as a result of the low valuation, are not in the tax bracket. That is an indication of how unreal this system is.  That is one constructive criticism I must make about the budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1842" /> The Government have done a reasonably good job in distributing the proceeds of the national cake.  Those who look for everything from the Exchequer feel that the Government should act as a fairy godmother and that the national cake falls from the sky.  The adjustment in the capital acquisitions tax was not considered enough and, with the reduction in the price of land, it might have been higher but it is an improvement. I agree that Fianna Fáil lost an election in 1973 mainly because the National Coalition promised to remove death duties.  However, death duties were replaced by the National Coalition with three new taxes.  It was pointed out to me eight months ago that the previous Government in introducing capital acquisitions tax imposed a worse duty.  I am aware that farming organisations are not satisfied with the budget adjustment in relation to capital acquisitions tax but the movement upwards is an indication of the Government's concern.  The Government do not want to cripple any person who inherits land.  When we were considering the Bill under which capital acquisitions tax was introduced I pointed out that small farmers in the west of Ireland would suffer.  I pointed out that because of the low yield from such holdings most of the farmers in the west did not marry and left their land to nephews and nieces.  Unless the nephew or niece lived on or worked the farm for at least five years prior to inheriting it they had to sell the land because the tax was so high.  Such people should be catered for under that code.  A lot of farmers forget that that tax system was introduced by the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the decision to reduce the allowance on machinery to 30 per cent per year but there was little talk about the fact that income splitting will alter the tax band for many farmers.  Farmers who were in the 35p in the £ tax band may now avail of the income splitting system with the result that they will be in the 25p in the £ band.  People should be made aware of that.  We have all been made aware of the disadvantages of the budget but the advantages have not been highlighted.  It <Col N="1843" /> cannot be said now that our farmers are getting away with murder.  The budget has been slightly hard on them.  There are other reasons for the decision to reduce the allowance on machinery.  In my view we are over-mechanised.  Many farmers change their tractors too often simply because they can put the purchase of a new one against their income tax.  We must also consider that a lot of those tractors must be imported and that affects our balance of payments. Another important factor is that farmers, in order to purchase tractors, must borrow money.  That is being done at a time when capital is badly needed for other matters.  It must be borne in mind that other projects such as land project work and the erection of buildings is excluded and farmers can claim the same allowance for such work as before.  I have sympathy for small farmers who were unable to do any development work on their holdings in recent years.  Such farmers have only been in a position in the last three years to make progress and could not purchase machinery until last year. Those farmers will be sore about the decision in the budget but it is not as bad as it appears.</P>
    <P>A farmer with a valuation of £40.10, a wife and six children who was not in the tax bracket up to now will lose his agricultural grant.  His rates will double.  That farmer has a grievance because he cannot put that against income tax which he does not pay.  Some years ago I was accused of throwing water on what was described as a good directive from the EEC, Directive 159.  When that directive was introduced I stressed that it was weighted heavily against small farmers but now a lot of large farmers who did not do too badly up to now are crying out against it.  I congratulate Deputy Bruton for raising this matter recently.  Those in the development farmer category and who brought up their stock levels are getting nice cheques now in the form of 1978 guidance payments. The small farmer has never been able to avail of these payments.  In his case, after <Col N="1844" /> he had been classified by an inspector from the Department, his entitlement would be 30 per cent grant and in some cases, because the estimate was not updated sufficiently to allow for inflation, grants of only 25 per cent were paid. There was no plan so far as the small farmer was concerned whereas if he were in the development category he would receive guidance payments and help to buy machinery.</P>
    <P>I recall hearing Professor Sheehy say on a radio programme that it was regrettable that 80 per cent of farmers were excluded from the development category during the three good years preceding 1979.  I regarded Directive 159 which was biased against the small farmer as an intermediate scheme.  The farmers' organisations referred to it as a predevelopment scheme.  It was immaterial to me what it was called.  My concern was that there be some national scheme on the lines of the old small farmer incentive scheme under which a farmer, if he failed to improve his situation from year to year, did not get the grants.  That scheme was discontinued on the bringing in of Directive 159.  It was a very good scheme and was brought in by Fianna Fáil.  However, it was most regrettable that in the three good years to which I have referred those small farmers who made efforts to develop qualified only for a miserable 30 per cent or less in some cases in respect of the cost of buildings.  It appears as if the powers that be in the EEC have no intention of changing Directive 159. Despite this situation something should be done to help the small farmer.  Many of these people with holdings of 35 or 40 acres and who have gone into milk production during the past three years are experiencing great difficulty in regard to the provision of the necessary accommodation for their cows.  If the cows are not taken off the land during winter because of lack of the necessary buildings in which to accommodate them, it is not possible to make two cuts of silage but the minimum cost of a building for the accommodation of, say, 20 cows is between £10,000 and £11,000.  Great credit is due to the small <Col N="1845" /> farmers for the good work they have done despite their receiving only very poor assistance from the EEC.</P>
    <P>I could continue to speak on farming matters during the few minutes remaining to me but there are a few other matters to which I should like to refer.  We do not hear so much now about unemployment. This Government are determined to create as much employment as possible and in that respect they have been very successful during the past two-and-a-half years.  It is not as difficult to find work now as was the case then. What concerns a young person now on taking up employment is not his gross earnings but the actual amount he will take home with the result that, perhaps, the Government are not given their due credit for having created the job in the first place.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Taoiseach say that there would be set up machinery aimed at stopping the rot in regard to trade disputes.  Strikes are very costly to an economy.  The Post Office strike was very serious from the point of view of our economy.  In order to avoid such disputes there should be machinery whereby a decision in respect of a claim from workers for an increase in pay should be given within two months of the claim being made.  This would have the effect of stopping the rot from setting in in an industry.  In my town of Ballinasloe, of which I am very proud, there are three factories but there has never been a strike at any of those industries. I attribute this happy situation to the good industrial relations that exist between management and staff.  If we consider some of the industries in which there have been a series of strikes we find that very often not all the fault was on the part of the workers.  Just as a politician who fails to keep in touch with the grassroots is not likely to remain long in politics, management who are above the heads of the workers and who fail to consult with their workers, usually find themselves in difficulty in regard to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>We are all somewhat disappointed that the housing reconstruction grants <Col N="1846" /> are being discontinued but we must realise that the loans have been increased substantially.  The question of the income limit and the improvement in that regard has been dealt with already.</P>
    <P>As I said during my opening remarks, energy is the most important matter facing us.  The Minister for Energy has a mammoth task ahead.  There are a few points to which I should like him to give consideration.  I refer to small areas of bogland which would not be of any use so far as development by Bord na Móna is concerned but which could be used by local people if the necessary drainage were carried out and if access to them by road were made possible.  There is in existence the local improvements scheme but because there are so many small roads leading into farms and which are badly in need of improvement, the moneys available from this scheme are diverted almost totally to this work leaving very little for the development of bog roads.  While there should be as much development as possible by Bord na Móna, attention should be paid also to the small bogs so that many of the people now buying turf produced by the board would be in a position to provide themselves with fuel.  In this way a substantial proportion of the demand on Bord na Móna would be eliminated and their products made available for more important purposes.  But people will not be encouraged to cut turf if the bogs concerned are inaccessible or badly in need of drainage work.</P>
    <P>The budget is very good in the circumstances. Indeed, it was not expected to be nearly as good as it is.  I assume that the next speaker will be Deputy Bruton.  I have listened to Deputy Bruton here from time to time and he has been consistent always in his criticism.  I have not known him to be over-critical except, perhaps, when he is expressing his personal views.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if a Deputy is sincere in his criticism the public, realising that, will give him credit for it, but they are fed up with this type of politician. When two opposing politicians appear on television before they say a word everybody knows they will disagree.  The <Col N="1847" /> neutral observer will turn off his set or switch to another channel.  If the politicians gave credit where it was due and then made constructive criticisms the public would listen to them.</P>
    <P>I could talk on this budget for two hours, particularly on farming because I know a little about it.  I hope I have been constructive.  This is a good budget.  We gain over the Opposition because we are involved at grass roots level.  If our ship goes off course the grass roots will tell us to get the ship back on the straight and narrow.  Fianna Fáil are doing that.  Of course we all know the oil crisis occurred when the Opposition were in power but they did nothing about it.  We are doing something about it.  This budget will be hard enough but it is in the interests of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Callanan for his kind remarks which I can reciprocate on the double so far as his objectivity is concerned.  I want to criticise this budget as being damaging to our economy on four major grounds. First, it will immediately aggravate the credit squeeze for productive industry and agriculture because the extra Government debt needed to finance the budget will squeeze out private borrowers from the money market and force the Central Bank into setting much severer credit restrictions for this year than either the 18 per cent which obtained last year or what they would have done if the budget had not been as much a deficit budget as it is.</P>
      <P>Secondly, by increasing the taxes on consumer goods this budget will push up the consumer price index by an amount which is certainly open to dispute, but by a substantial amount.  In that way, it will precipitate another inflationary wage round in the latter part of the year.  It is worth mentioning that the present national understanding will run out at the end of August.  This wage push generated by the Government will worsen our competitiveness abroad, which is already seriously undermined as evidenced in a very bad balance of payments situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> Thirdly, the Government, by failing to rein in Government credit and spending, will worsen an already very bad external reserve situation and our balance of payments situation, which is also already very bad.  I intend to give figures to illustrate the extreme seriousness of our external reserves and balance of payments situations.  This worsening of the situation by the deliberate policy decision of the Government in this budget will seriously increase the risk that either or both of the following things will happen: there will be an enforced devaluation of our punt within the European Monetary System and/or the take-over of the running of our economy by what one might describe as the international receiver.  We are all familiar with the responsibilities of a receiver, but the international receiver is the International Monetary Fund.  The result of the profligate financial policies of this Government over the last three years may be that the international receiver, the IMF, will move into our Department of Finance, as they did in Britain, Denmark and Italy at various times in the recent past.  The cuts that will have to be made then in Government spending will be far more drastic and indiscriminate than they would have been if we had taken the action ourselves in time and on a gradual basis.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, because the actual budget introduced in February is so different from the belt-tightening which was predicted by the Taoiseach in his January address to the nation on television when he told us we were living beyond our means and because the budget is so different in its content and in the amount of borrowing that it implied from what he said was necessary scarcely a month previously, it will cause a serious fall in something which is already very scarce, namely, public faith in the words politicians utter as being the truth. In his January address the Taoiseach cried wolf and in the budget he tried to pretend there was no wolf at the door. By doing that he will have less credibility the next time he goes on television to tell us a serious situation exists.  The people will not believe him because they will say <Col N="1849" /> he went on television in January saying serious belt-tightening was necessary but he did not do it in February.  They will not believe he will do it next time and all he says will be considered as mere words.</P>
    <P>This devaluation of public confidence in politicians' words is something that will affect not only this Taoiseach but the Taoiseach of any party because the public tend to see politicians as a collective group.  If one politician is seen not to be sincere and not to act in accordance with his convictions, people will tend to believe other politicians are the same.  If Deputy Garret FitzGerald finds himself in a year's time as Taoiseach and having to go on television to tell the people something along the lines the present Taoiseach told them in January but because those January predictions were not matched in the February budget it will be all the more difficult for Deputy FitzGerald to convince the people.  All politicians will find that their words are no longer trusted.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to agriculture.  I propose to demonstrate that in general, as a result of this budget, farmers of all sizes who are in the tax net&mdash;over £40 valuation&mdash;will this year be paying more than their fair share of tax.  In other words, they will be paying more tax on a given income than a PAYE worker with the same income, and that is not fair.  Secondly, I will demonstrate that smaller farmers, those between £40 and £60 valuation, will this year face a far bigger increase in their tax load, notwithstanding the resource tax, than will larger farmers.  Thirdly, I will demonstrate that the small intensive farmer&mdash;a 50-acre farmer with a valuation of £40 producing about 50 per cent above the average level of intensity of production&mdash;will be especially hard hit. In 1980 his taxation will be increased six times over the amount of taxation he would have paid in 1979.</P>

      <Col N="1850" /> Given that farmers who are in the tax net are paying much more than their fair share of taxation, I will demonstrate that there is no justification whatever for the introduction of a resource tax in the interests of equity, which had already been achieved and over-achieved without such a tax.  To introduce a resource tax was to pile injustice on top of injustice.</P>
    <P>I wish to illustrate a point about my first allegation regarding the national debt.  In 1977 the national debt represented 79 per cent of our gross national product; in 1979 it jumped to 88 per cent and at that rate our national debt within a year or two will be equal to our gross national product.  The Government owe about £6,500 million, or more than £2,000 for every man, woman and child in the country and an increasing share of that money is owed abroad.  Regarding public borrowing by the Government financed externally, in 1977 37 per cent was borrowed abroad while in 1979 that figure had increased to 51 per cent.  In other words, more than half of every £ borrowed by the Government is borrowed abroad.  This year the Government must pay £150 million in interest payments alone on money borrowed abroad and this amount is equivalent to 5p in the £ on the basic rate of income tax.  If that money did not have to be paid abroad we could reduce income tax by 5p in the £.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government and the Central Bank imposed an 18 per cent limit on private sector borrowing.  They said to businessmen, farmers and people directly involved in productive activity generating wealth and jobs that they would not be allowed to increase their borrowing by more than 18 per cent. What happened to Government borrowing? It increased by 24 per cent and Government activity is not nearly as productive by any measure as private sector activity, yet the Government insist that the private sector should be limited to 18 per cent while they themselves will not submit to any such limits.</P>
    <P>External reserves have fallen drastically, that is, the money which must be used to pay for imports in <Col N="1851" /> foreign currency.  At the beginning of 1979 our external reserves were enough to cover the value of 3¾ months imports. By the end of 1979 and at the beginning of 1980 this had fallen to 2½ months cover.  External reserves at the beginning of 1979 were £12,000 million and they are now down to around £9,000 million. There has been a drastic fall of almost one-quarter in one year.  Everybody on the money markets of the world is aware of this and is watching.  If this trend continues we simply will not be able to pay for imports to this country.  The balance of payments deficit, that is the amount we are paying out of this country for imports as against the amount we are getting in for exports, has worsened and that is one of the main reasons for the fall in our external reserves.  The balance of payments deficit in 1979 was £800 million as against £165 million in 1978. In other words, the balance of payments deficit has increased by about five or six times in one year.</P>
    <P>According to the Central Bank Report it seems unlikely that this deficit will be significantly reduced, if at all, this year unless corrective measures are taken. The Government document on the economic background to the budget is in marked contrast to the actual budget and suggests that the advice which the Minister for Finance was getting from his officials was very different from the contents of the Budget.  This document stated that on certain reasonable assumptions about the behaviour of savings and stock building the balance of payments deficit should be higher in 1980 than in 1979.  We already have a situation where external reserves have fallen dramatically and the balance of payments deficit is several times larger than last year.  The Department of Finance say that the situation will be even worse in 1980, yet no corrective action was taken by the Government to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The position of our currency has not improved during the past year.  Since March 1979 the trend line for the IR£ within the EMS has been consistently downwards.  This is inevitable in a country <Col N="1852" /> with a massive balance of payments deficit, falling external reserves and a rate of inflation which is in some cases three times as high as that of other countries with which our currency is supposed to be linked.  It is impossible for our currency to maintain its value indefinitely within the EMS.  What is the likely consequence of this sort of development?</P>
    <P>The Government claim in the budget to have reduced the borrowing requirement. I believe this is basically a fraudulent claim for five basic reasons. First, this year's revenue is artificially boosted by £100 million which is brought forward as a result of the postal strike of last year, money properly attributable to 1979 which will be collected in 1980.  The effect of this money on the revenue side is, artificially, to make things look better.  Secondly, £33 million is being brought in this year by making the self-employed pay earlier but in a full year, in 1981, that money will not be an addition to the overall revenue situation. Thirdly, the money in taxation on spirits has been brought forward and that adds a further £9 million in artificial revenue.  It is not long-run revenue. Fourthly, the Government have reduced their own contribution to the capital budget but maintained the level of the capital budget by telling public bodies, semi-State bodies and local authorities that they will not borrow for them.  The Government can apparently reduce the amount of their borrowing but the overall amount will remain the same because semi-State bodies who are guaranteed by the State will be borrowing to make up the difference.</P>
    <P>All this means that the reduction in Government borrowing is unreal because it does not include local authorities and semi-State companies. Another point is that the full cost of social welfare improvements will not be borne this year whereas a large proportion of the revenue from increased contributions will be received.  Therefore the situation this year is only artificially better than it is in reality.  An example is the children's allowances.  The increases will <Col N="1853" /> not be given until July but the reduction in the tax allowance will occur in April, making the financial situation in this respect better from the revenue point of view.</P>
    <P>I have said that the credit squeeze will be worsened.  That will be so for two reasons.  The first is that the Central Bank will realise that if they are to protect the value of the punt they will have to restrict the money flow to the private sector.  I have explained that the Government borrowing picture is not real.  In fact the Government are increasing their spending and if the overall level of spending is to be reduced in order to keep imports down and regularise the balance of payments situation, the Central Bank must ensure that spending in the private sector will be cut.  Therefore, there must be a serious credit squeeze.</P>
    <P>The second way in which the credit situation will be worsened in regard to private business and agriculture is that when the Central Bank are setting credit guidelines for private borrowing, local authorities and semi-State bodies will be included in the 15 per cent limit. Therefore, if the Government tell those bodies to increase their borrowing, those bodies will be squeezing out people in the private sector because they will be borrowing out of the restricted credit available for private sector borrowing.</P>
    <P>Another matter that will affect our financial situation is that the Government are not spending productively.  For the first time in many years half of every £1 spent out of the current budget will be spent on paying salaries, not on productive investment to assist agriculture and industry, or on the purchase of land to enlarge smallholdings, but to maintain staff levels in the public service.  The Government are giving a very bad example by increasing their manpower by five extra Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>What are the likely results of all this? At present the Government seem to be able to borrow abroad with relative ease. But even one international banker could begin to analyse the picture underlying our situation and if the Government apply <Col N="1854" /> for a loan next year that one banker could scratch his head and say he wants a study done of the Irish ecenomy, of the balance of payments situation, our external reserves, our comparative rate of inflation, just to make sure we would be able to repay the money.  The bank would send out its man to do the job and if he goes back with the information that our balance of payments is appreciably worse than in countries competing with us on the international money market the bank will say that because of the danger of not getting its money back it would have to increase its rate of interest to compensate for the risk.  However, that is the least ominous possibility.</P>
    <P>A worse possibility is that the bank might start to circulate information to the effect that it does not think Ireland would be able to pay back the money at all under our present system and the bank might report us to the IMF who would then say, &ldquo;They should not be given any money at all&rdquo;.  Or the IMF might say, &ldquo;We will give you the money but in return we will send a man into your Department of Finance and he will operate as Minister for Finance to see that you will run the country exactly as we tell you.  If we say that you must cut down in the public service you will have to do it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is something we thought could not happen in holy Ireland.  But it has happened elsewhere&mdash;in Britain, in Denmark and in Italy.  If our external reserves are run down from 3¾ months cover to 2½ months cover in a single year and if our balance of payments deficit is quintupling in one year we cannot avoid a situation which would force the IMF to send a receiver to the Department of Finance to tell the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, what he must do, and no amount of sweet talk will dissuade the international receiver from doing his job.</P>
    <P>Another possibility, which none wishes to contemplate, is that if our external reserves continue to be run down at the present rate we will not be able to maintain the value of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other EMS currencies.  If our reserves <Col N="1855" /> able to maintain the value of the punt within the EMS, whether we like it or not.  We must remember that no longer are we linked with sterling, no longer will we be able to hide behind the British £. Our creditors will be ruthless and there will have to be a devaluation of our punt. That would have many serious effects. First of all, it would cause immense hardship to businesses and to the Government trying to borrow abroad.</P>
    <P>In a situation in which the Government are increasing their level of borrowing abroad from 37 per cent of their total borrowing in 1977 to 51 per cent this year and at the same time running spendthrift economic policies which are undermining the value of the punt, they are cutting their throats.  If our punt is devalued we will have to repay the debts we borrowed abroad on the double because our punt will no longer be worth as much in repayment of those debts as it was prior to devaluation taking place.</P>
    <P>The same will obtain for private industry. Our banks and private industry at the moment, in order to evade the credit squeeze, are being encouraged to borrow abroad.  If the punt is devalued they also will suffer those massive exchange risks.  The primary objective of the Government's economic policy at the moment should be to maintain the value of our punt because the consequences of not doing so will be very grave indeed for our economy.  As well as the immediate effects I have illustrated on Government finances and on private business finances, it will start us on the slippery slope.  We will slide slowly down into relative poverty in Europe.  We will be seen internationally as the poor man of Europe, as a country in which is not worth investing.  They will likely be able to say, &ldquo;You cannot be sure they will even be able to maintain the value of their own currency&rdquo;.  If we once devalue within the EMS we will no longer have the same creditworthiness as we have had in the past.  I believe that the devaluation of our punt is something we must avoid at all costs.</P>
    <P>I find it amazing that the Government, particularly after the Taoiseach's address <Col N="1856" /> to the nation in January, came in with a budget which relied so much on borrowing.  I predict that the amount the Government will borrow this year will be even larger than the amount they borrowed last year.  In 1979 the Government had all the good intentions about their budget as they had this year.  In 1979 the then Minister for Finance said he would reduce borrowing requirements and that the current budget deficit would be kept at £288 million.  What happened? At the end of 1979 the current budget was not £288 million but £520 million.  This year the Minister for Finance tells us that the current budget deficit will be £355 million, a lot more than the £288 million which his predecessor predicted in 1979.  It is likely that the actual deficit will be just as much in excess of the £335 million set this year as the £520 million, which actually occurred last year, was in excess of the £288 million which was predicted by the former Minister for Finance. There is no reason to believe that the situation will be any better.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that for salary increases in the public service the provision is nearly £100 million to cover special increases which may occur&mdash;we all know there are a lot of them in the pipeline&mdash;and the cost in 1980 of a new national understanding, which is to cover four months of the year.  One-third of the year is to be covered by a new national understanding.  If that is all to come out of £100 million it will have to be a very restricted national understanding that will be negotiated to start in September of this year.  The Government by increasing the cost of living so dramatically in the budget and increasing indirect taxes are almost ensuring that the national understanding which will be negotiated this year will be an inflationary one, will be far larger than it would otherwise have been if we had not this budget.  The situation in which only £100 million is provided to cover special increases in the public service and the new national understanding will simply not be maintained.  The situation in 1980 will be the same as it was in 1979 when the Government predicted a <Col N="1857" /> deficit of £288 million and ended up with a deficit of almost twice that amount.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the position of agriculture in our economy.  It seems very unusual that the Government chose 1980 as the year in which they would dramatically increase the tax load of the farming community, particularly that of smaller farmers.  This year the farmers face a very difficult situation.  Their incomes have fallen.  The Minister for Agriculture estimated that the income increases would fall by about 3 per cent. The situation is far worse than the Minister's figure disclosed because his figures do not take account of the interest cost being borne by farmers.  It is estimated that 20 per cent of a farmer's income at the moment is actually absorbed in the repayment of debts which he has incurred.  We can subtract 20 per cent of any figure for income which is given.  The Minister's figures took no account of the fact that farmers have interest payments to meet, which are exceptionally large this year because of the high interest payments.</P>
    <P>I believe the reduction in farmers' incomes in actual cash terms in 1979 was as much as 20 per cent.  Farmers this year are caught in the price net of the EEC.  They are getting price increases set in Brussels based on the German rate of inflation which is about 5 or 6 per cent. They are getting the same increases as the German farmers but the Irish farmers have to pay increases in costs of 16 per cent, 17 per cent and 20 per cent.  We are losing out because our rate of inflation is far higher than the rate of inflation on the Continent of Europe.  We are getting far less from any price increases granted in Brussels, which are set on an overall European basis, than are the people in the economies of Europe.</P>
    <P>This is also the year in which the super levy was proposed and this is the year the Government chose to introduce this dramatic increase in the taxation of the farming community.  What are the reasons for this?  Our only source of information in relation to this is what the <Col N="1858" /> Minister for Finance said in the budget. He said that taxpayers generally have felt that the amount of tax paid by farmers was less than was justified by reference to farm incomes.  The Minister did not say whether he believed that farmers were not paying their fair share of tax.  He did not say that, because he could be contradicted.  He had to rely on the &ldquo;gut&rdquo; feeling of the man in the street, which the Minister accepted, whether it was right or wrong.  The people in the street felt that the farmers were not paying enough and that the Minister would get it from them.  The Minister decided he would get the money from farmers not because they were not paying their fair share but because people felt they were not paying their fair share.  He went on later to say that it is in the interest of the farming community that farmers pay and be seen to pay their fair share of tax from the incomes which they have.</P>
    <P>In that budget he proceeded to introduce a tax which bears no relation whatever to the incomes of farmers, namely a resource tax and an increase in rates for smaller farmers.  If a farmer is losing money he will still pay the resource tax.  If a farmer with between £40 and £60 valuation is losing money he will still pay the doubling of his rates brought about by the budget.</P>
    <P>If a farmer with a valuation of between £40 and £50 is losing money he will still pay the doubling of his rates brought about by this budget.  Yet the Minister justified this introduction of taxes, which bears no relation to income, by saying that it was in the interests of the farmers that they be seen to be paying their fair share of taxes on the income they have.  The Minister at no stage told us that he thought they were not paying their fair share because he had not the courage to do it and he is not a man noted for his courage.</P>
    <P>I would like to illustrate the points I have made about why the farmer is paying far more than his fair share of tax. First I will take the example of a farmer with a valuation of £40.  Such a farmer, taking farm income statistics, would have an average income of £4,000.  Out <Col N="1859" /> of that £4,000 that farmer, who is married with two children, would pay the following taxes in 1980: £484 in rates and about £10 in incomes tax.  His total tax load will be £494.  That will be an increase of 149 per cent on what he paid last year; last year he would only have paid a total of £198 in rates.  How does the PAYE person with £4,000 compare? The farmer with £4,000 will be paying £494 mostly in rates; the PAYE person with a similar income will be paying £245.  In other words the farmer will be paying more than twice as much as the PAYE person with the same income and that is a farmer who is paying hardly any income tax and no resource tax. On rates alone he is paying more than twice as much as the equivalent PAYE person.  I intend to give these statistics to the Minister at the end of the debate if he wants them to use in discussions with his colleagues, because evidently he did not have them up to now.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of a farmer with a valuation of £50.  He would be earning on average £5,000 a year, taking income statistics.  He will pay £605 in rates and £271 in income tax, bringing him to a total tax load of £876, which will be an increase of £555 or 73 per cent on what he paid last year.  How does the PAYE person compare?  The PAYE person with an income of £5,000 will pay £495 as against £876 for the farmer.  The farmer will pay 77 per cent more than the equivalent PAYE person.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of a larger farmer with a valuation of £100 who would be earning about £10,000 a year. He will pay £1,210 in rates, £350 in resource tax and £1,108 in income tax, giving him a total tax load of £2,668. The PAYE person with the same income of £10,000 will pay £2,243.  In other words, the farmer will be paying £425 more or 19 per cent more.</P>
    <P>The surprising thing to emerge from these statistics&mdash;and the PAYE person at all levels of income is paying less&mdash;is that the gap between what the smaller farmer pays on his small income and what the PAYE person pays on his small income is far greater than that between <Col N="1860" /> the larger farmer and an equivalent PAYE person.  So, relatively speaking, the small farmer is losing far more than the large farmer <i>vis-à-vis</i> the PAYE sector. But all farmers, including larger farmers, will pay more tax this year as a result of this budget than equivalent PAYE people in a year in which farm incomes have fallen, in a year in which one of the major reasons for the balance of payments crisis we face here, and which has dire consequences for us, is the fall in agricultural production.  If agricultural exports had been up to the 1978 level in 1979 we would not have half the problems we had this year.  In a year when a fall off in agricultural production and exports has contributed to a very serious economic situation here the Government come along and increase the taxation on agriculture.  Could any economic policy be more haywire than that?  At a time when lack of agricultural production is causing problems for our economy the Government load on more tax on the agricultural sector.  I really think that the Minister for Agriculture did not make the best of the arguments he must have had with his colleagues over this budget because if he had and if he had sought these figures, which could easily have been obtained, he would have done a lot better in the Cabinet discussions about taxation.</P>

      <P>I would further point out that this year, in which the taxation load on the farming community has been increased to a level where they are now paying more than equivalent PAYE people, is the third successive year in which Government spending has also been reduced as far as agriculture is concerned. In 1979 the amount available to the Department of Agriculture was cut by £7 million in cash terms, which in real terms, given the rate of inflation, was a cut of about £40 million.  In 1980 another cut of £7 million is administered. Indeed, the Department of Agriculture last year&mdash;and I think again this year&mdash;was the only Government Department whose available money was cut in cash terms.</P>
      <P>In the three successive years in which money for the Department of Agriculture has been cut there was an 80 per cent increase in the amount of money available to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  A Government that can cut agricultural spending and increase industrial spending by 80 per cent is a Government clearly demonstrating where their economic priorities lie.  This Government's economic priorities certainly do not lie in agriculture if they can cut agricultural spending to that extent while increasing industrial spending by 80 per cent over three years.  This year the cut is worst of all because it comes in a year when farmers have done very badly.  There might have been some justification last year for restricting Government spending on the grounds that farmers' incomes in 1978 had been relatively good, but in 1979 farmers incomes plunged and to come along at the end of 1979 and administer further cuts is very unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where have the cuts taken place? There is a cut of £2 million in the <Col N="1862" /> amount available for arterial drainage. Notwithstanding the fact that the Government committed themselves in an agreement with the EEC to increase the amount of arterial drainage taking place under an accelerated programme in the west, they come along this year and cut the amount of money they are spending on this scheme.  That is a breach of faith with the EEC and with the farmers in the west.  In addition, the first thing that needs to be done with newly drained land is to fertilise it.  Much of the land in the west which is in need of draining has a very high level of acidity so lime must be put on it.  The Government cut out the lime subsidy in the west.  If ever there was a false economy it was to cut out the lime subsidy in a year in which we are trying to encourage drainage.</P>
    <P>The Government cut the amount of money available for the disadvantaged areas scheme by £1.5 million and they cut the amount of money available to the farm modernisation scheme to £3 million below what would be needed to maintain last year's level of activity taking account of the rate of inflation.  Obviously the Government hope there will be fewer cattle on the land to draw headage payments under the scheme and they expect fewer farmers to invest in buildings and in the other items that would require grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  Why else did they cut the amount available under both of the schemes if they did not expect and hope that farmers would claim less?  The Government are budgeting on a downturn in agricultural activity as evidenced in the reduced provisions under the schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government have made a cutback in the retirement scheme for farmers. The amount they made available suggests they will not maintain pensions under that scheme in line with other pension increases granted in the budget. How much did the Land Commission receive to buy land?  They got £10&mdash;ten measly notes to buy land in 1980&mdash;yet an extra £1 million was voted by the Government for additional salary costs in the Land Commission.  What are all <Col N="1863" /> the civil servants going to do if they cannot buy land?  They are given £10 to buy land and an extra £1 million to pay themselves, to sit twiddling their thumbs doing nothing.  Could anything be more ridiculous?</P>
    <P>The Government have cut the amount of money available to the CBF&mdash;the beef promotion agency.  They did this at a time when it is clearly recognised that we must sell our beef more aggressively if we are to make the necessary improvements.  There was a clear understanding among farmers that a levy was being imposed on beef sold at marts and factories in order that extra money could be made available to the CBF on the understanding that the Government would maintain the value of their contribution, but at the first opportunity the Government cut in half the amount of money they are making available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was.  Many people have been led to believe that married couples are doing well in the budget.  I should like to give an illustration to show that the opposite is the case.  Let us take the case of a married couple where the husband is on PAYE and the wife is not working.  They have two children and must pay £1,500 in mortgage repayments. Assuming that incomes rise this year by about 20 per cent&mdash;a reasonable assumption&mdash;the deduction from that couple who have an income of £7,000 per year will be £1,473 as against £1,063 in 1977&mdash;an increase of more than £400 in tax.  The proportion of their income taken in tax will increase from 15.2 per cent in 1979 to 17.5 per cent in 1980. The fact that married couples will pay more tax this year has been demonstrated fully in an article by Paul Tansey in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  In cases of families with an income of £5,000 or £10,000 per year where both spouses are working, a higher proportion of their income will be taken in tax and social insurance <Col N="1864" /> contributions than was the case last year.  According to the analysis carried out by Paul Tansey, the only case where a married couple will be better off is where their joint income is £20,000.  Where a man is earning £12,000 and his wife £8,000 they will have their tax reduced but households with an income of £5,000, £7,000 or £10,000 will pay increased taxation. This will be done to ensure that less tax is demanded from a couple with a joint income of £20,000.  My heart really bleeds for the people about whom the Government are concerned.  If people have an income of £20,000 a year, I do not think they need a tax cut and certainly not at the expense of people on incomes of £5,000, £7,000 or £10,000.</P>
      <P>Where else have this Government of energy conservation raised revenue?  If we do not want people to use cars, the obvious thing to do is to encourage them to use bicycles.  Yet in the budget one of the luxuries on which VAT was increased was in respect of bicycles.  This was done by a Government who tell people to leave their cars at home and use a bicycle.  They also increased tax on furniture and furnishings.  Anyone with a house must furnish it&mdash;he or she will need a chair, a table, a bed, an armchair. These items are not luxuries.  However, the Government have increased the rate of VAT on beds and on other items of furniture.  That is no way to raise revenue.  This increase will have a particularly bad effect in my constituency because it relies heavily on the furniture and furnishing industry.  People involved in the business are losing out on the home market because of the way VAT operates.  People who import furniture do not have to pay VAT immediately but the person selling furniture in a factory must pay the tax immediately.  The furniture and carpet industries in Navan will suffer an additional competitive disadvantage because of the increase in VAT.  The possibility of selling Irish-made furniture will be worsened as a result of the budget.</P>

    <P>I should like to give the House some more information about the many items on which VAT will be increased.  They <Col N="1865" /> include bathroom fittings, bicycles, blankets, building materials, carpets, clocks, floor coverings, educational supplies to schools.  An additional rate of tax will be imposed on detergents&mdash;something that even the poorest housewife must use every week.  Yet, it is regarded as a luxury by the Government and carries increased tax.</P>
    <P>The resource tax on farmers is particularly unjust because there is no guarantee that the rate of payment or the coverage of the tax will not be increased at any time in the future.  I did not believe the Taoiseach when he said this was a temporary measure.  That statement by him was a piece of window dressing to get him through the year and perhaps it was done for electoral purposes.  I have indicated already that farmers are paying more than their share.  If the tax is really a temporary measure, the Government should withdraw it once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Faced with the current difficult economic climate and the need to put the State's finances on a sounder footing the Government's approach to this year's Budget was on the twin bases of equity and growth inducement.  This approach involved a number of aims&mdash;to spread the burden of taxation more fairly, to improve the social services and welfare benefits and to preserve and improve the conditions for the expansion of production and for increased employment.  In view of the importance of external trading to Ireland, the economic situation in the outside world has a major impact on activity here.  There is a continuing recession in the industrialised and developed world and we as a trading nation cannot hope to insulate ourselves entirely against the consequences.  The effects of the energy price increases over the past year will, undoubtedly, influence conditions here during 1980.  But we should not adopt a pessimistic attitude and fail to do what we ourselves can and should do to exploit the opportunities open to us to continue the growth in prosperity which was so striking during the seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> The budget is part of the Government's strategy aimed at providing the conditions for the growth and expansion of the economy.  In the case of agriculture, it is aimed at ensuring the continued well-being and development of the industry.  In view of the key role which agriculture plays in our economy the Government were at pains to ensure that farming would be encouraged to develop and expand.  Of course, the Government could have taken the easy way out.  We could have avoided the less pleasant aspects of the budget and have borrowed more.  But this would have solved nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, in the longer term, it would have led to higher inflation, with rapid erosion of the value of the pay packet.  It would have led to higher interest rates, making things more difficult for those wishing to invest and expand, and perhaps forcing to the wall persons and enterprises who have already borrowed heavily.  Such a course would really have benefited no one.  The Government decided to face up to their responsibilities, to put State financing on a sounder basis, but in doing this to ensure that the productive sectors would continue to have the opportunity and the incentive to grow.</P>
      <P>The proof of this lies in the fact that, in spite of the general economic and financial difficulties which we face, the Government have provided extra money for agriculture this year.  The combined Estimates for agriculture and lands for 1980 amount to over £205 million as compared with about £197 million in 1979.  This is in addition to the very large sums which we get from the EEC under the common agricultural policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, we got well over £400 million from FEOGA, the Community's agricultural fund.  I am sometimes surprised that the huge extent of these receipts is not fully appreciated by many people.  Some Opposition speakers seem to think that the only assistance that agriculture gets is the amount provided by the Exchequer.  In fact, last year agriculture got from FEOGA roughly twice what it got from the Exchequer.  And, of course, these sums do not take account of the EEC advantages in the form of higher market prices and assured market outlets.  These benefits were among the main reasons for joining the EEC in the first instance.</P>
      <P>So far as the EEC is concerned, there are a number of proposals under discussion in Brussels at present which will provide us with additional aid in the future.  In particular I might mention the revision of the structural directives, which, of course, deal particularly with the Farm Modernisation and disadvantaged Areas Schemes, and the new Western Development Package which contains detailed measures to develop the western counties with substantial aid from Europe.  And also, of course, there are the farm price negotiations.  While it is not possible to predict how the various negotiations will eventually turn out, we can say with confidence that they will definitely result in more EEC funds for our farming industry.  The price proposals that are before the Council of Ministers are roughly on the lines of 2 per cent to 3 per cent increases.  Naturally we would like to see greater increases but I think in the circumstances existing in Europe at present, it is unlikely that the 7.9 per cent requested by COPA will be conceded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say at this stage that I am heartened by the recent discussions in the Council of Ministers relating to what is commonly known as the super levy on milk.  Deputies will be aware of my strong opposition to this proposal by the Commission.  At last week's meeting of <Col N="1870" /> the Council of Ministers I was glad to find that a number of other States are equally opposed to this super levy.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that when the negotiations on the price and anti-surplus proposals are complete we will not be afflicted by this super levy.  In the meantime I will maintain my opposition to it. At present we face some formidable problems in the EEC, particularly in regard to milk, sugar and beef.  I am sure the House is aware of the proposals to suspend intervention for four-and-a-half months, which would have very damaging effects on our cattle and beef trade.  I am sure Deputies are aware also of the proposals to reduce the sugar quotas. These are problems about which we are very much concerned.  I can assure the House that we are tackling them resolutely and have made clear our opposition and determination to resist any measures that may fundamentally damage the development of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>In recent times the common agricultural policy has been subjected to ever-increasing pressures and criticisms by people who, unfortunately, have not the interests of agriculture at heart. These criticisms are often motivated by other reasons.  I should like to assure our farmers that the Government are determined to resist these pressures and fight for the maintenance and preservation of the principles and mechanisms of the common agricultural policy.  Therefore, I would urge our farmers to have confidence in themselves and in the future of their industry.</P>
    <P>Between the Government's financial provisions and the FEOGA transfers our agriculture has had, and will continue to have, a massive injection of resources for further development and expansion.  This year extra money is being provided by the Exchequer for animal disease eradication.  We have doubled the money for brucellosis to £15 million as compared with approximately £7 million spent in 1979.  An extra £1.4 million has been allocated for bovine tuberculosis eradication.  These allocations can leave no doubt about the extent <Col N="1871" /> of this Government's commitment to disease eradication.  We recognise fully that this is work demanding top priority.  The amount being provided for the hardship fund this year will leave more available in the fund than we spent last year or the year before.  As regards general disease control we had extra expenditure in 1979 on payments to farmers arising from the discovery of leukosis in a small number of herds.  Happily the disease has now been contained and, if the recent pattern of clear tests is maintained, it should be possible to lift restrictions on a number of herds by the end of the year. Therefore, compensation payments to herdowners are expected to be substantially lower this year.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to appeal to all involved, farmers, their organisations and the veterinary profession, to treat this disease problem with the same priority as do the Government.  We are living on borrowed time.  We must make massive progress in regard to this very serious problem in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In order that the new organisation for agricultural training and advisory services, AnCOT, can become fully effective as soon as possible, extra funds are being provided in this year's budget.  I am sure that the board of AnCOT, which represents farmers and rural organisations, will be making a major impact on farm development in the coming year.  Additional funds are also being provided for the further development of agricultural research.</P>
    <P>On the capital investment side&mdash; which embraces the farm modernisation scheme and the western drainage scheme&mdash; we are providing £36,500,000 as compared with just over £34 million last year.  This means more money for farmers to improve and develop their holdings.  Contrary to what Deputy Bruton said&mdash;that there was a drop in actual funds being provided for these services&mdash;it can be seen from those figures and those published in the Book of Estimates that there has been an increase. I would urge farmers to take full advantage of these schemes.  They are <Col N="1872" /> there to help the farming community improve their incomes through increased production and efficiency.</P>
    <P>Of course agriculture, like other sectors, has had to make its contribution to the overall Government effort to control State spending and get our national finances in order.  However, in this exercise, we were most careful to ensure that the basic interests and future development of agriculture would not be impaired. Some of the savings made have been criticised but these criticisms arise from misunderstandings in a number of cases.  For example, less money is provided for the agriculture and veterinary faculties at the universities this year simply because extensive new building programmes which have been going on there are now virtually complete. In the case of CBF we introduced last year a statutory contribution for that body.  As a result CBF will in fact have considerably more funds this year to carry out their expanded functions.  They will have an estimated £1.2 million of a budget compared with £642,000 last year.  It is unjustifiable for anybody to get up here and say&mdash;as did Deputy Bruton today&mdash;that the allocation to CBF was cut when in effect, with the Excheque contribution and the statutory contribution provided last year, the money for expenditure in 1980 is doubled.  Whatever way one wishes to look at it this is a very substantial increase for CBF.</P>
    <P>In other areas we took steps to deploy the limited funds available to the best advantage. Thus, while we have terminated the lime transport subsidy for the western region, we reintroduced the mountain lamb extension scheme which is, of course, of special importance to hill sheep farmers in our disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>As regards the disadvantaged area scheme, some Opposition Deputies have tried to convey the impression that the relatively small change in the amount provided this year means a reduction in the level of headage payments.  This is simply not true; no reduction is envisaged in the level of these payments. <Col N="1873" /> The reduction in the total sum provided is due to the fact that in 1978 and 1979 extra money was spent by my Department in speeding up payments to farmers. Happily these arrears have now been largely cleared and so a smaller amount is needed this year to meet the commitments.</P>
    <P>On the Land Commission side another false notion is being propagated by the Opposition.  It has been alleged that a token sum only has been allocated for land purchase this year.  This shows a lamentable lack of knowledge about the operations of the Land Commission. When I heard Deputy Bruton talk here and from what I read of what he had to say in other places, that the Land Commission had £10 with which to carry out their activities for 1980 it became obvious to me that he did not really know how the Land Commission or the land bond proposals operate.  Of course, land acquired by the Land Commission is normally paid for in land bonds.  In fact I shall shortly be introducing legislation in this House to increase the amount of bonds which may be issued by £25 million, a long way from the £10 bandied about by Deputy Bruton in this House and elsewhere.  So much for his criticism.</P>
    <P>Also on the agricultural side we provide for subsidies on milk and dairy produce.  Despite the reduced total there is no change in the rate of subsidy as compared with 1979.  The extra amount spent last year was largely to cover the carryover commitments from 1978 and so we can manage this year on less.  As far as the consumer is concerned every pint of milk carries a subsidy of 1½p and every pound of butter carries a subsidy of almost 27p.  Even with the contribution from FEOGA towards the butter subsidy these are a heavy burden on the Exchequer.  The Government recognise that they are important especially to the lower income groups and larger families. Despite great pressure on financial resources this year the subsidies have been maintained unchanged.</P>
    <P>As regards farmer taxation, provisions announced in the budget have two basic <Col N="1874" /> aims.  The first is to move towards the position where the farming sector pays its fair share of the overall tax burden, a position which farmers and their representatives have declared themselves willing to accept.  The second aim is to encourage the future growth and development of agriculture.  This is done by maintaining the more important investment allowances for land improvement and farm buildings and by the universal application of the accounts system.  This will ensure that each farmer in the taxation net will only pay the tax appropriate to his actual taxable income earned.  Any farmer whose income net of appropriate allowances and deductions does not reach the taxable bracket will not pay any income tax.  This will mean that many farmers who have to fill up tax returns will not have to pay anything at the end of the day.  Provision is also made whereby any farmer entering the tax net for the first time this year can have the option of presenting the current year's accounts rather than the normal previous year's accounts if this is to his advantage.  Taxable farmers will have all the advantages of the PAYE sector, such as income splitting, widening of the bands and so on contrary to the distorted picture put forward by Deputy Bruton this morning.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate and encourage family farm transfers the Government have decided to increase the upper limit of the special agricultural relief under the capital acquisitions tax system from £100,000 to £150,000 thereby directly relieving transfer problems caused by the rise in land prices.  This now means that farms that are being transferred from father to son must be worth more than £300,000 before they are liable for tax. The recent decline in land prices will increase the value of this concession.  The transfer of family farms from one generation to the next is a sensitive issue, and indeed is a very personal matter. The Government are fully aware of the sensitivity, and we in turn have responded by according this concession of a substantial increase in the special agricultural relief on inheritance tax.  I am sure it is a concession that will be <Col N="1875" /> widely appreciated throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Many of the criticisms of the effects of the inheritance tax on the development of farming have been totally misleading. Since the capital acquisitions tax was introduced in its present form almost five years ago, there have been only three cases of children of farmers who have paid this tax.  I do not see how anyone can claim that three cases in five years represents a threat to the future of the family farm, or that the problem is one of increasing magnitude, as it was represented to me by various deputations a couple of weeks ago.</P>
    <P>As regards the resource tax Deputies will now be familiar with the announcement by the Taoiseach last Wednesday that this tax on larger and better off farmers was a short-term feature of the tax system.  However, it is a necessary feature in the interim period until the accounts system achieves its objective of ensuring that farmers contribute a fair and equitable share of taxation on their profits.</P>
    <P>In looking at this budget farmers and their leaders have perhaps taken a onesided, negative and selfish viewpoint of it.  Nobody likes to have to pay tax and so everyone criticises those aspects of a budget which penalise himself or herself. We hear far less about the budget changes which confer benefits or advantages. The farmers' representatives do not appear to see the good points in this budget.  At any rate they do not highlight them.  I have already mentioned the liberal concession on inheritance tax. We should not forget that the 2 per cent levy has gone.  Those farmers already on accounts and those entering for the first time are going to benefit from the very generous income tax concessions. Without doubt this will reduce the income tax of farmers already within the tax net assuming they maintain the same level of income.  The Taoiseach has made clear the Government's position on the resource tax.  Taken together these arrangements add up to a very reasonable package.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> It is interesting to note that while there are approximately 150,000 farmers in the country as a whole, only 36,000 of these are now within the income tax net.  Furthermore, only those farmers in that 36,000 who make a profit over and above the various allowances will be paying any income tax.  It must be emphasised particularly to farmers coming within the income tax net for the first time that unless their profits are high enough they have nothing to worry about from the tax man.  This is the situation that applies to taxpayers generally throughout the country, and it is one that will now apply to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I wish to repudiate the false notion that taxation of farmers will inhibit greater investment and increased production.  I am sure the opponents of agriculture would like to see it that way. This is not the case with any other sector subject to tax nor is it the case with farming. As I already emphasised, farmers within the tax net will only pay tax if they make a taxable profit.  The generous capital allowances will encourage increased investment of a genuine nature in land development and farm buildings as this will reduce the incidence of tax, and on this basis will encourage greater genuine investment on the farm, leading to greater production which will benefit the farmer, the economy and our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Experience over recent years has shown that a certain number of farmers have been using the system of capital allowances to avoid tax.  They have purchased expensive machinery in excess of their real needs.  Such purchases had the added disadvantage of contributing to our balance of payments problems as almost all of the machinery was imported.  It is not in the interests of the nation that the Government should tolerate tax avoidance along these lines which also had a detrimental effect on our balance of payments.  It was, therefore, necessary to restrict this form of capital allowance.  However, the machinery purchases will still qualify for full tax relief but over a longer period. This will allow farmers to invest in <Col N="1877" /> machinery in a genuine way to meet all of their requirements.</P>
    <P>If assessed unemotionally this budget must be regarded as a very reasonable package for the farming community.  It provides a clear basis on which to plan for increased production and profits over the coming years and I, as Minister for Agriculture, will be ensuring that the necessary conditions for this will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Government have demonstrated their confidence by the increased financial resources being provided for agricultural progress and development. We went to great pains, not just to avoid impairment of aid, but rather to improve the essential elements of Government assistance for the expansion of Irish agriculture.  We have done this in the interests not only of the farming sector but of the nation as a whole, because if agriculture is not progressing the whole process of national economic advance would be seriously hampered.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, given normal weather conditions, we shall see a significant upturn in net agricultural output this year.  There should be a return to more normal usage of farm inputs, particularly feeding stuffs, as compared with the high usage which we had in 1979 because of the unfavourable weather conditions.  The result should be a sharp recovery in net farm output.  With an expected higher level of cattle disposals in 1980, agricultural exports should resume their upward trend.  The overall effect should be a significant increase in farm incomes; in this regard the Economic and Social Research Institute has recently forecast an income increase of 13 per cent.  We cannot expect more than modest price increases from Brussels, and this means that productive efficiency will be the key to future farming profitability and expansion.  I am confident that our farmers, working in partnership with the Government, will rise to the challenge ahead and will make the eighties a decade of further progress for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The foundations for this progress in agriculture, and in the economy as a whole, have been laid in the recent <Col N="1878" /> budget.  It has provided the kind of economic environment in which there is an incentive for the agricultural community to expand and develop their enterprises. This is in the interests of farmers themselves and, at the same time, to the benefit of the wider national community in general, which depends so greatly on the prosperity of the agricultural sector.</P>

      <P>I do not intend any discourtesy to the Minister for Finance when I say that I propose entirely to ignore his own budget speech and to concentrate instead on the speech made in the present budget debate by his party leader who, of course, as is well known, speaks through Deputy O'Kennedy.  It must be said in Deputy O'Kennedy's favour that he never pretended to any financial or economic expertise in the days before he was promoted into that job.  He must be regarded consequently as the merest mouthpiece.  During an earlier stage of the complex budget debates I used a simile drawn from the bible which offended the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am not going to harp on it again, but the old trick of Jacob in trying to impose on his father by wearing a rough skin and hoping that the old blind man would mistake him for Esau is not entirely out of place when we see that what is being spoken here through the mouth of Deputy O'Kennedy is in fact the plan&mdash;if it can be called a plan&mdash;of his leader.</P>

    <P>In the speech made here by his leader on 5 March, just a week ago, the budget was described as having been produced in a combination of factors which amounted to being &ldquo;the most difficult that any Minister has had to face in this country in modern times&rdquo;.  I shall accept that statement; I believe it is true.  The budget was produced in the most difficult combination of circumstances that certainly a Government has faced for some years, but that is produced and offered to this House as being, in some way a mitigating factor or an excuse, a background against which a lenient judgment must be invited of the disagreeable and unacceptable parts of the <Col N="1879" /> budget.  It is not that at all.  In my view the combination of factors which are the most difficult for many years are very largely the product of the prodigality and recklessness of the Government itself.  It does not lie in the mouth of any Member on the far side, from the Head of the Government down, to plead difficult factors in respect of this budget when those factors are the product of their own poor governmental performance.</P>
    <P>That performance rests on foundations which were laid before the General Election of 1977, when promises were made in regard to remission of various forms of taxation which ensured that any Government, no matter what Government, left in the situation of implementing those promises would be in difficulties.  Revenue was recklessly thrown away merely to buy votes.  Motor taxation, which was not a source of grievance to anybody, because it had never crossed anybody's mind to demand its abolition, was flung away as a sop to the motorist, particularly the younger motorist, who saw himself in that way as having £50 or £60 extra in his hand and could be induced, because perhaps he was not old enough to have formed any strong political convictions, to vote for Fianna Fáil for that reason. The rates were thrown away at one fell swoop, not in three handfuls as the National Coalition Government had proposed&mdash;although I am not entirely convinced that we were right in that proposal of getting rid of them at all; we did propose to do it, but not in one fell swoop; some responsibility, some sense of proportion remained with that Government&mdash;Fianna Fáil did it in one fell swoop, and they abolished wealth tax at one fell swoop, and went on then to deprive themselves of 80 per cent of capital gains tax.  It was absolutely certain that fiscal measures of that type were of an inexcusable, unforgivable dimension and were bound to cause fiscal difficulties in the following years.</P>
    <P>In order to make up the slack in the State's finances which the abandonment of those sources of revenue caused, the <Col N="1880" /> Government were obliged to resort to extremely heavy borrowing.  It is true, and must be said in favour of Deputy O'Donoghue, that he did not conceal that from the electorate beforehand, although the electorate do not mind too much about the politics of borrowing; they are not concerned too much when the borrowing is merely to relieve the grievances which they themselves are experiencing. It is true that Deputy O'Donoghue did anticipate borrowing 13 per cent of GNP in the first full year of the Government in which he hoped to be.  That was more or less the figure which the State did then borrow. However, the figure which he gave for 1979 was exceeded the following year by more than 3 per cent or 4 per cent and the figure which he gave for 1980 is also going to be heavily exceeded this year, notwithstanding that Deputy O'Donoghue himself said that those figures which he outlined for 1980 and 1981 represented unsustainable levels of borrowing, a level of borrowing which in the long term would be unsustainable and which could not be exceeded.</P>
    <P>I have computed the degree to which the failure of the Government to keep to their own self-imposed borrowing limits has added to the national debt.  In 1979 the extent of borrowing requirement instead of being 10½ per cent, which was originally projected, was 13.7 per cent, while in 1980, instead of being the 8 per cent as originally projected, it is now going to be&mdash;and we shall be lucky if it does not go further during the year&mdash;almost 10½ per cent, 10.4 per cent.  The difference in 1979 in pound notes was £236 million.  That is not a total borrowing, that is the difference between the level of borrowing which the Government originally planned and the level of borrowing, to which, in the end, they have had to resort.  If you inflate that by 15 per cent so as to bring it up into terms of the 1980 pound note, the figure is £271 million.  The 1980 figure is £207 million of an excess over and above what was originally projected. That is an excess borrowing, even over the high levels which were projected by Deputy O'Donoghue in 1977 of £478 <Col N="1881" /> million or&mdash;I shall not be accused of going too far when I say this&mdash;within spitting distance of about £.5 billion&mdash;and that is not just for borrowing. It is £.5 billion of borrowing over and above the borrowing which the Government were committed to by their 1977 election promise.</P>
    <P>Naturally, a Government who do that cannot but be in difficulties.  Naturally, a Government who do that cannot but find themselves in a combination of factors which the leader has described as the most difficult that any Government have had to face for many years.  It is perfectly obvious that that is how they are going to end up.  In the speech to which I have just referred we were told that the cost of servicing the public debt at the point which it has reached now is, in a full year, £666 million.  These figures become astronomical and one cannot grasp or digest them, but, in plain terms for the ordinary citizen, that means that for every man, woman and child in this country £200 a year is being paid out in interest on the public debt.  The State is engaged in paying £200 for every man, woman and child in the country, not to repay the capital, not to invest in further development but merely to keep down the payments due on the public debt.</P>
    <P>That is a fantastic situation and naturally, unavoidably and necessarily a Government who lead themselves into that situation are going to be in difficulties. Far from pleading those difficulties in extenuation of unpopular measures in their budget, they should be apologising for having created these difficulties in the first place and apologising doubly for having done so in order merely to win votes.</P>
    <P>That expansion of the public debt of course has had to continue this year in order to pay for some of the budget concessions but these are not the only things it has to pay for.  It is also paying for a reckless expansion in the public service. Last week in the debate on the Ministers and Secretaries Bill I gave figures which I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me to repeat in a different setting. <Col N="1882" /> In regard to the expansion of the public service since the National Coalition left office&mdash;the National Coalition became unpopular for a variety of reasons and one of the reasons we made few friends was that we imposed an embargo on recruitment into the public service&mdash;the Minister for Labour and the Public Service said that that embargo had been responsible for several jobs being left undone; but that embargo meant that when we left office the civil service contained 48,600 people and no more.  It now contains 53,800, that is 5,200 more.  If you compute what it must cost to pay these civil servants, to house them, to heat them, to pay their travel expenses, you come out with a figure well in excess of £50 million.  It could not be less than that.  That is reckless public spending.  It is a reckless investment, not in anything of a capital nature or anything wealth-producing but in jobs for jobs' sake. Deputy Haughey told us the other day that he does not believe in reckless expansion of public employment like that, he does not believe in simply adding persons to the public payroll.  He said, and I quote from the Official Report of 5 March 1980, column 1311, Volume 318:</P>
    <P>There is no real advantage in simply adding persons on to the public payroll, particularly if the expenditure has to be financed by borrowing.</P>
    <P>This is the latest in the long series of examples of Deputy Haughey pretending a wisdom which his record disentitles him to claim.  One week before the dissolution of the 20th Dáil, on 17 May 1977 he said in the Debate on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill that he agreed entirely with a report which had come recently from the ESRI in which the creation of jobs merely to put people into employment was advocated.  He said, and I quote from the Official Report, column 921, Volume 299:</P>
    <P>Geary and Dempsey go on to suggest that the problem of unemployment should be tackled by a special works programme whose main objective would not be economic but to put people to work,.....  This is exactly <Col N="1883" /> in line with what we have been proposing.  I personally suggested well over a year ago that £100 million should be diverted from the public capital programme into a jobs for jobs' sake programme.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Haughey on 17 May 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said many times before that there is the equivalent of three Army divisions in the civil service with lines of communication troops, support troops, entertainers, cooks and every possible ancillary organisation. That is far too big for a country like this. We have an Army corps of civil servants. There are too many of them and instead of recruiting more the Government should be interested in getting value out of those they have.  Of course that is not popular.  It means supervision, watching what is going on, making sure that people are there turning in a full week's work for which they are being paid. It means doing things which are unpopular and which will even cost votes. Naturally, Fianna Fáil will run a mile from anything like that.  It is far easier simply to recruit people recklessly by the <Col N="1884" /> thousand.  Since we left office 5,200 jobs have been created in the civil service alone, and 8,000 new jobs under the health boards.</P>

      <P>There are more people in the employment of the health boards today than there were in the entire civil service in 1955 or 1960.  That cannot be justified.  That is a luxury which this State cannot afford.  I agree with the speech made here this day last week in which it is stated that we cannot simply add people to the public payroll.  Every one of these has to be carried on the backs of four or five or six wealth-producing citizens in some other occupation, because it is from the revenue which they provide that those salaries and overheads come.  If Deputy Tunney thinks he is going to walk me into a corner by pressuring me into saying that the civil service should not be expanded.  I say that it should not be expanded.  It is too big already and he can post me up all over the country as saying that and a lot of citizens will agree with me.</P>

      <P>In the middle of March, when it should be falling, unemployment is getting near the 100,000 barrier again. When did unemployment last jump in the way that it did last week, at this time of the year before?  This is the time of the year in which the peak should have been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Tunney <Col N="1885" /> mentioned this because the case which was being made then in large print during the election was that those numbers did not state the true dimensions of unemployment and that the true dimensions were 150,000.  That is the number who were unemployed in our time. Now a different suggestion is being made, most recently by Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, that the registered figures overstate unemployment.  I have no animosity against Deputy O'Malley, and much less now than I had once.  I consider him a reasonably straightforward blunt person and certainly a man with a manner which does not easily make friends.  Deputy O'Malley seriously suggested that perhaps those registered figures overstated the problem and that there were parts of the country in which there was nearly full employment, where employers could not get people to work.  It is a curious thing that when we are in the figures are not large enough to reflect the real problem, but when Fianna Fáil are in the figures overstate the problem. Even Deputy Tunney, with his verbal skill, will see that there is an inescapable dilemma there.</P>
      <P>The Leader of Deputy Tunney's Government believes in jobs for jobs' sake and said so in 1977.  Either himself or one of his colleagues said that even if they were paying men to dig holes and fill them up again it would be better than having them unemployed.  Naturally, no private employer would pay a man to do that and therefore the State must.  I will not take that from that man or any of his Government, all of whom if they serve under him have flawed pedigrees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend it that way and I never understood anybody to intend it that way.  I regard the Head of the Government as being unsuited to his post and the same doubt falls on anybody who accepts office from him.  If I change my mind about the Taoiseach I will be open minded enough to admit it here, if I am still here.  I will not take from the Taoiseach or his Government the suggestion, against the background of that speech in May 1977, that the public service has been in some way allowed to grow too big, that they are not responsible and that other are somehow responsible.  I cannot see any expansion of functions or services to account for the huge growth.  Some Departments will not answer the phones, some had a fairly easy six months last year because of the postal strike, and the telephone service is worse than ever. What are all these extra people doing? This comes from a Government which was led until last December by a man whose acceptance speech in July 1977 put reform of the public service in the forefront of his objectives.  The then Taoiseach said it needed political will; he did not have much political will and his successor clearly has not much political will.  Far from the public being sure that they are getting value for money, far from productivity being visibly improved, we are just getting more jobs which the public have to carry on their backs.  In my other job I suppose I could be said to be a beneficiary of that expansion. In a sense somebody with an academic post like mine could be said to be a luxury which others have to carry. I acknowledge that and admit that anyone <Col N="1887" /> working in a position such as mine is in a position of great privilege; but still the State is carrying burdens which are beyond its strength in regard to public employment.</P>
      <P>Speakers from the other side said that we were being ungenerous in failing to acknowledge the social welfare and other improvements.  I acknowledge that there are improvements, although in the depths of the recession, in the greatest possible economic and fiscal constriction, we always made it a clear priority that, year after year, social welfare benefits, long term and short term, would at least keep pace with inflation.  The short term benefits have been increased by 20 per cent, which will not keep pace with inflation.  The inflation rate will not go up to 25 per cent, although I am sure it will reach 20 per cent, so the long term 25 per cent increase is a handsome increase. However, it will barely keep pace with inflation and leave the recipients a shade better off.  If they are a shade better off I will not be so begrudging as to deny it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been accused of not acknowledging these things and trying to look to the potential effect of the budget on the future.  That is the whole point of a budget debate.  The budget is to set the course of the economy for the next year. What has happened in order to pay for these improvements on the social welfare and PAYE scene&mdash;even though, as the leader of my party said, the improvements under PAYE have been far too heavily tilted in favour of the people who need it less, and inflation this year will run away with virtually all of that&mdash;is that borrowing has got to a huge level and there are cuts of every possible kind&mdash;for example, in the grants to local authorities.  All one has to do in regard to seeing the situation in local authorities is to look at the roads.  I have lived here all my life with the exception of a few years here and there and I have never seen the roads in such bad condition.  They are in a condition that one would have expected to see in the Balkans before the First World War.  The former Deputy Paddy Burke made a bit of a joke of it in this <Col N="1888" /> House when he said that when the Coalition Government left office there was not enough money in the public Exchequer to pay for a bag of cement.  This Government do not even have enough money to fill in a pothole.  I drove to the airport twice in the past week, and by the time I got there on each occasion I was nearly car sick from the sensation of driving over the roads, which are in an incredible condition. Deputy Haughey calmly told us last week that the severe winter of 1978-79 and all the rain we had afterwards were to blame.  We had a hard winter in 1978-79 but we had a harder winter in 1962-63 and the roads were not nearly as bad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated at the outset that I would not <Col N="1889" /> mention Deputy O'Kennedy but I find I am obliged to do so now.  The Minister for Finance when Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs took a lot of trouble with his contributions and I listened to him with a good deal of respect and interest. I felt his contributions were good and for the most part I agreed with him except when he got on to the subject of the fishery limits in which he displayed the same dishonesty as the rest of his party, willing to lay down their lives for the 50-mile limit as long as it embarrassed the Coalition but flinging it away cynically as soon as they got into power.  They sabotaged it when they assumed office.  With the exception of his performance on fisheries I had a lot of time for Deputy O'Kennedy's contributions. One theme he hammered more than enough was that, no matter what came or went, or what budget constraints operated on a Government or the difficulties they might find themselves in, one thing which was not negotiable in his eyes was the bilateral overseas development aid programme. He felt that, no matter what came or went, we had a duty to the black men, the yellow men and their children, starving, suffering and emaciated without any prospect of jobs or a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>I supported every word Deputy O'Kennedy said on those occasions, and I believe he meant what he said, but he is such a small boy in the Government that he was not able to stick up for the ODA programme.  The Government have left themselves with so little room to manoeuvre that the black and yellow babies went out the window.  The real contribution by us in bilateral aid this year will actually be down for the first time ever.  There was never a bilateral aid programme until one was introduced by the National Coalition.  If Deputy FitzGerald, the leader of my Party, left politics tomorrow, his most shining contribution to this country's public life would, in my eyes, be the initiation of the bilateral aid programme for people in underdeveloped countries.  There was never such a thing here until he started it and, <Col N="1890" /> fair play to Fianna Fáil, they did not block it or criticise it.  In fact, they supported it once it had started.  What happened when they took office?  It got the usual increase in 1978-79, but this year it did not.  It must be remembered that this year the budget was presented by a Member who when in Opposition felt this was the one thing which should be non-negotiable, was sacrosanct and should not be touched.  He always believed the programme should not be touched and that there should be a steady progression of increase in it until it reached what is regarded as an internationally acceptable level in terms of percentage of GNP.</P>
    <P>That is only a selection of the things we have had to endure.  We have had cut-backs in services, benefits and subsidies in order to pay for the reliefs the budget contains.  All those represent difficulties which the ordinary people will feel.  They are also part of the complex of unprecedented difficulties referred to last week.</P>
    <P>Another thing which happened in order to pay for the reliefs which the budget contains is the range of increases in indirect taxation.  While others may complain about increases in taxation on tobacco and drink I will not do so, because it is true that in terms of the number of minutes or hours one has to work to buy a bottle of whiskey drink is probably cheaper now in those terms than it was 20 years ago.  It can stand an increase in taxation and had we been in office I would have been in favour of putting up the price of cigarettes and drink.  I believe many of my party would have been in favour of that also. However, the increase in the price of petrol is fantastic.  It makes me feel that there is no hand at the rudder of the Government, that there is no real stability or unified will or interest in the Government in seeing how the country is progressing.  That increase will work its way through every item on which the CPI is compiled.</P>
    <P>I am not a professional economist or in the business of forecasting whether it <Col N="1891" /> will mean a 4 or 6 per cent increase by mid-May, a matter which is an issue between the leader of my party and the leader of Deputy Tunney's party, but the increases will not be seen by that time. Further increases will be working through the economy in consequence of that rise for the rest of the year.  It will have a ripple effect.  When the stone is dropped in, the biggest and most powerful ripples are the ones nearest the point of entry; but the ripples keep going for a considerable time and, eventually, though they are diminishing in effect, reach the edge of the pond.  That will be the effect of an increase in a commodity which is an element in every item of goods and services.  Oil is needed for transportation and manufacturing, notably in the manufacture of electricity, and as an item in the bill of CIE.  We will have a bigger number of applications dropping on the desk of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in consequence of that rise, which undoubtedly will seriously aggravate inflation.  That also is a consequence of what I was complaining about earlier with regard to throwing away sources of revenue and excessive borrowing.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil are still in Government this time next year&mdash;God forbid&mdash;the Finance Minister will be bleating about the extra percentage points as being something beyond his control&mdash;but they can be seen now to be within his control. That fiscal measure which will net so many millions of pounds has been made necessary because the cupboard is bare. It is a fiscal measure which we can now predict&mdash;even the leader of Deputy Tunney's party admits this&mdash;will add visible percentage points to the inflation rate. An industrial worker living in Deputy's O'Toole's constituency&mdash;that area comes to mind because the Deputy is sitting beside me&mdash;who works at the Asahi plant and lives in Belmullet, or 30 miles in the opposite direction, will have to add an extra £3 or £4 per week to his petrol bill.  Does anybody think a worker could absorb that and offer it up?  He will not.  That £3 or £4 will be fed into the notional floor from which his wage <Col N="1892" /> demand this year will be launched.  In other words, there is a viable percentage element in whatever national wage agreement is reached which is attributable to the oil price increase and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Great play was made of the fact that in 1974 when the oil crisis first broke Deputy Richie Ryan put 15p on to the price of a gallon of petrol.  The increase in the budget is only one of a range of increase and it should not be forgotten that 20p is something about the same order as the 1974 increase.  This year it is one of a number of increases which will all prove to be inflationary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a greater percentage increase in 1974.  The Deputy was about to say that but he withdrew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think so; it was of the same order but at least it was by itself.  The increase in this budget is only part of a general package of additions which collectively will be extremely inflationary. The promised increases, the dimensions of which were not announced in the budget, in regard to social welfare contributions and postal and telephone charges, to be effective from 1 May, are not in that calculation.  What effect will they have on inflation?  It should be remembered that those things are not being forced on us by outside conditions; the Government have brought them on us because they left themselves short of revenue.  They have borrowed beyond the point which was wise.  They borrowed beyond the point at which a Danish Finance Minister last year resigned in despair when he found his Government were over-extending themselves.  The consequences of their doing that are that they have been forced into these measures which are clearly inflationary and which are sure to increase wage demands beyond the stage of tolerability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when a Minister for Finance was able beforehand to put forward a figure in respect of a wage demand that could be accepted as reasonable.  In the small print of the Fianna Fáil Manifesto there was a reference to an assumption of a wage increase <Col N="1893" /> of 5 per cent in the following wage round.  One never hears nowadays of a 5 per cent wage increase: 50 per cent would be more likely to be the figure.  The progression more often than not is as follows: 5 per cent becomes suddenly &ldquo;of the order of 5 per cent&rdquo;. The &ldquo;order of 5 per cent&rdquo; then becomes a single figure increase and that, in turn, becomes something below what the journalists refer to as a &ldquo;psychological 10 per cent barrier&rdquo;.  This brings us into approximate double figures, but these are the progressions by which the lines are shortened.</P>
    <P>Like any Government, we had to take some unpopular steps while we were in office.  In 1976 and 1977 we succeeded in securing reasonable wage settlements, settlements which subsequently were acknowledged as being reasonable and which were praised by Professor O'Donoghue as being responsible for the very healthy growth in industrial output and in the general recovery from the recession of those two years.  Professor O'Donoghue had the honesty to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  We do not need to accumulate all those titles.  Deputy O'Donoghue had the honesty to say, as reported in print in a Foreign Affairs Bulletin, that the recovery, which was underway and which in fact had progressed far by then, and that the improvement in industrial output and export earnings were due to those reasonable wage settlements.  However, there was a price to be paid for those reasonable settlements and we paid that price by taking steps that were unpopular, but this Government do not like the idea of being unpopular.  They have not succeeded in achieving reasonable settlements or in holding the parties to those settlements even to the terms to which they agreed.  With that lamentable background they produce a package of measures of which the budget is only the <Col N="1894" /> pinnacle because before the budget there were some measures introduced that were essentially budgetary and we are to have more to follow in terms of increases in postal charges, of social welfare contributions and so on.  What is produced is a package of measures going back to about the end of last year and which will have the effect of driving up wage demands with the consequent effects on employment, on export competiveness and so on.

      <P>It was said and believed generally in the Government party that Deputy Colley had been rather wet and wobbling in regard to farmer taxation last year, that he had enraged everybody by promising to impose a levy on farmers. When the farming voice came through loud and strong the then Minister for Finance retreated and this brought the PAYE people out on the streets in jigging time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man whose speech I have been quoting was foremost, according to reports, in referring to Deputy Colley as being wet for that performance.  There was an announcement during the budget speech by the Minister for Finance about a resource tax.  But there was not a word then that this resource tax would be a temporary measure, that it was to be only a transient feature of the fiscal landscape but we heard last week from <Col N="1896" /> the person I am quoting and this morning from the Minister for Agriculture that the resource tax is not to be a permanent feature of our taxation structure. Is that not a climb down as contemptible as anything done by Deputy Colley?  Is it not doing a Colley on this occasion? Those Deputies up there are sitting on some of the fattest farms in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies Lalor and Fitzsimons got the message from the farmers about the resource tax.  Now we hear that this is not to be a permanent tax.  Indeed, if we are lucky it need not be even a temporary tax.  Is this not doing the Colley act?  Let us not have any pretensions as to the strong arm and the clear clean profile of pragmatic government from a man who within three months of assuming office has done something that is as bad as anything ever done by Deputy Colley and which naturally has switched off not only the farmers but the other sectors also. However, the Minister will learn the hard way.  He will learn that that is not the way to conciliate people.  It reminds us of the fable of the old man and his ass, the man who could not please anyone.</P>
      <P>I would find it difficult to advise this Government financially or economically but if we were to find ourselves in government tomorrow we would have to pick up the pieces and decide what could be done about a public debt which is monstrous compared with anything we left behind.  We would have to decide what should be done about the servicing of that debt which is taking up a share of the public revenue that is staggering by comparison with what the situation was when we left office.  We would have to decide what should be done regarding the trade deficit which has broken one psychological barrier after another.</P>

      <P>Assuming that the position in other counties is the same as it is in County Meath, for which I got a reply the week before last, will the Minister explain why the Land Commission persist in holding on to farms they acquired many years ago?

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the position has changed radically in the past year.  Last October the Government issued instructions to Land Commission inspectors to draw up resale schemes for the land they had in stock. Last year they submitted schemes amounting to 30,000 acres, which was the highest ever.  We hope to continue that trend during the next few years until we have allocated the land in stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that despite orders issued the Land Commission have land in their possession from as far back as 1962?

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>No such instructions were given.  I accept that in the past land has been held for considerable periods of time.  In many cases the reason was that the land Commission hoped to be in a position to acquire further land in the area and thus to draw up better schemes.</P>

In 1979 a total of £9.6 million in bonds was issued by the commission for this purpose.  In addition, a sum of £2,050,000 was available for the purchase of lands for cash made up of £800,000 voted in 1979 for this purpose, plus £1,250,000 already in the relevant grant-in-aid funds.</P>

      <P>When the Greyhound Act was introduced in 1958 Bord na gCon had no subsidiary companies.  Surely a Deputy is entitled to get information on how these companies are running individually and compare losses or profits and expenses with different companies?

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the payment of the second phase of the national understanding of 1 March 1980, and the 16 per cent rise in the cost of living envisaged during 1980, he will revise the income guidelines used in determining eligibility for medical cards before June 1980 and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The income guidelines for the purposes of eligibility for medical cards are normally reviewed on an annual basis by the chief executive officers of the health boards.  The guidelines at present in use came into effect on 1 January 1980 and, in determining them, full account was taken of changes in the cost of living during the previous 12 months as measured by the consumer price index at mid-November 1979.  The increase in incomes under the second phase of the national understanding also took account of the increases in the consumer price index to mid-November 1979.</P>
      <P>Medical card guidelines are an aid to health boards in ensuring that the statutory provisions in determining who has full eligibility for health services are complied with.  The method of reviewing the guidelines, which has been in operation for some years, has proved to be effective in keeping them up-to-date.</P>
      <P>It would be impractical to revise the guidelines at more frequent intervals to coincide with every change in cost of living or in wages or to anticipate possible future changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the guidelines are now irrelevant? He apparently is not aware that at one stage during the term of the Coalition Government the guidelines were reviewed on a six monthly basis.  Is he aware that people who would have qualified up to November for medical cards will not now qualify even though they are in a worse financial state owing to the huge increases in the price of food and other commodities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines have been revised as recently as January.  Developments which take place during the year will be kept under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines were taken in November.  Is the Minister aware that there have been huge increases in the price of food and people on the borderline are in a worse position now than they were in November?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The two questions are separate.  As regards the cost of living for social welfare recipients, benefits have been increased in the budget independently to cope with and cater for increases in the cost of living.  As far as the guidelines are concerned, they are separate and independent and relate to wage and salary increases.  They have been recently revised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the guidelines are based on an estimate made in mid-November, the price of milk, butter, bread, gas, petrol have gone up and there have been increases in CIE and ESB charges.  These could not possibly have been taken into consideration by the health boards when they were reviewing the guidelines which came into effect in January.  In those circumstances would the Minister not agree that considerable hardship is caused, due to the direct action of the Government in sanctioning such price increases plus the increases that took place subsequent to the budget?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy realises that it is related to income levels. It is on the basis of income level that one qualifies or does not qualify.  In fact, one's income will have changed in relation either to the social welfare benefits received, on the one hand, or the changes under the national understanding&mdash;changes in one's level of wages, salary or income.  These have been taken into consideration in the preparation of the new guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will appreciate that the only relevance income has is in what it will buy.  I have listed a number of items which have been increased since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is missing the point.  There is no direct relationship between the guidelines for the medical card which are related to one's income and the cost of commodities. Whether one does or does not get a medical card depends on the level of one's income and not on the cost of other items.  To account for the increases in wages which have been awarded during the year, the guidelines have been increased to allow for that.  In effect, this will bring into the medical card group people who might have fallen out of it towards the end of the year and this is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister one question in two sections?  Is the Minister aware that there is a glaring anomaly in his area of responsibility, both in the social welfare and in the health fields in that, on the one hand, the Minister's Department for Social Welfare will declare eligible a person for unemployment assistance and because of that declaration of eligibility he will not qualify for a medical card.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for health (i) the number of patients on the orthodontic waiting list in the Western Health Board on 31 December 1979, (ii) the number of such patients referred for treatment during 1979, and (iii) the number of such patients it is expected will be called for treatment in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Western Health Board had 1,999 <Col N="1931" /> patients on its orthodontic waiting list on 31 December 1979.  285 patients were referred for treatment during 1979.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements it could be expected that approximately 320 patients would be called for treatment in 1980.  However, it is intended to appoint a whole-time orthodontist for this area during the year, with adequate clinical support staff.  This should result in a significant increase in the number of cases commencing treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that this is a scandalous situation and even at the present rate, some of these patients will have to wait up to ten years before they are treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the fact that there has been a vastly increasing demand for the services of these specialist orthodontists.  In view of that, in relation to the area to which the question applies, I have said that it is intended, during this year, to appoint a full-time orthodontist.  I cannot, at this point, do any more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that that is not even sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that everyone would like to see many more specialists of all kinds, but this is only one health board area and there is a similar demand all over the country in all health board areas.  In this event, the addition of a further orthodontist to this particular area will greatly ease the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that considering that there are approximately 2,000 patients on the list, the waiting period for people on the list now for this type of treatment will be at least seven years.  Surely that is totally unreasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall just stick to what I have said, that, in effect, we are appointing an additional specialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is most reasonable of the Minister in the year that is in it, at this point in time, to respond to this question by saying that he will appoint one additional orthodontist to the area in which the Deputy is involved as well as Deputy Molloy, who put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy put the question.  This certainly is distinct progress in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the said board, could I ask the Minister if he is aware that that particular kind of orthodontist treatment becomes very urgent because unless it is given or applied before the child reaches the age of 13 or 14 at the latest, it is useless.  That is what I am told at least.  Because of that, there is no way in which that kind of facility will clear that backlog and those children will be over the maximum age at which the treatment can be effective to them.  We are talking about a specific area where the urgency is greater than in other medical or dental areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is an area of considerable urgency.  In fact, I have considerable personal experience in the area.  I know and appreciate the importance of the work done there and know that it has been growing very rapidly in recent years.  This is one of the reasons why I was particularly interested in seeing that something would be done even in the current circumstances.  I am making arrangements not only for that area but also for other areas.  The profession will accept that this will represent a major step ahead throughout the country generally and that a part of that improvement will take place in the area in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister when the orthodontist is to take up duty in the Western Health Board area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that question.  It was not the question in the first instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister is appointing one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment is approved, so it is a question of finding suitable people who are prepared to take the job.  The first point arising following the budget is the question of approval and, as far as I am concerned, that is the point with which I can deal.  It is a question of routine procedure and people being interested in taking up the post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper article (detailed supplied) attributing a statement to the Director of the Medico-Social Research Board that cannabis appeared to do little harm and was not as dangerous as cigarettes and the action it is proposed to take in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article referred to.  It reflected a personal view.  I am aware that this view is not accepted by all experts in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cannabis and the controls which should be exercised in relation to it were discussed in considerable detail when the Misuse of Drugs Bill was being considered in 1977.  It was then decided, on the evidence available to the House, that its sale or distribution should not be legalised.  I have no reason to think that <Col N="1934" /> any change in that decision should now be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that the taking of soft drugs very often leads to the taking of hard drugs?  Is the Minister further aware that, even if it is a personal opinion, a statement like this can do untoid harm to youths who are often mislead by foolish statements made by woolly-thinking individuals who should know better?  Does the Minister intend to take any action in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my position very clear by stating in the House that I have no reason to think any change in the decision made by the House previously should now be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked concerned people making such statements. Surely the Minister knows that making a statement like this is encouraging people to break the law of the land and that indeed, the drug squad have a hard enough time at present trying to deal with the increased number of individuals in Ireland who unfortunately are taking both soft and hard drugs.  Can the Minister take no action against those people, who may call themselves progressive members of society but who are woolly-headed individuals, to make them cease making such statements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must bear in mind that he is referring to a newspaper report of a letter and if he reads the original letter he will find that it is not quite as the reporter put it.  It made quite clear that: &ldquo;Nevertheless, I do not know that we should go so far as to legalise yet another drug&rdquo;.  That aspect was made quite clear in the letter.  It was something that was taken out of context subsequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Perhaps, Sir, you could assist me in the following matter.  I tabled two questions to the Taoiseach both of which were ruled out of order.  One of them possibly could have been ruled out of order on the basis that it was a repeat. The other one, asking the Taoiseach how many times he had given permission for the British Army or Northern Ireland security forces to cross the Border, was not a repeat.  I have here the Official Report, unrevised, to which you referred me in your letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is well aware that he may not raise this matter in this fashion now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: If a question to the Taoiseach on Border security and British forces operating within our jurisdiction is ruled out of order on a false premise, surely I am entitled to raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have your letter here. Your due consideration is based on the fact that it is a repeat question and you listed a series of questions.  I have here the Official Report, unrevised.  Nowhere in this is that question asked, so on what basis am I ruled out of order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: What has been conveyed to me was not factual and that is why I am raising it now.  If the Taoiseach for political reasons refuses to answer such a question, that is a political decision for which he must take the consequences, but that is not the function of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy <Col N="1936" /> must know well that this is an old device of trying to raise a matter that was ruled out of order.  The Taoiseach is not the person who rules it out; it is the Ceann Comhairle who is responsible for it being ruled out.  The reasons are conveyed to the Deputy.  The Deputy may discuss them outside the House with the Ceann Comhairle if he wishes, but not in the House.</P>

I wanted to say a great deal more about how the conditions to which the budget is a response and which the Leader of the Government described as uniquely difficult conditions are almost uniquely a product of the Government's predictable mishandling of the situation since 1977.  I wanted also to say some more about how the measures in this budget do not go nearly far enough to right the matter.  So far as the budget contains things which are popular, it is only putting off the evil day of reckoning when far more severe measures in regard to taxation and public expenditure will be necessary.</P>

    <P>I have three or four financial suggestions in regard to trying to bring a solution and all-Ireland harmony nearer.  We should spend money on publicising in the North, our point of view in regard to the North.  I do not mean the Fianna Fáil Party's point of view but the national consensus in regard to the North.  There is nothing to stop us from paying for and taking whole pages of the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> and the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, which are the organs of majority opinion there, <Col N="1961" /> and using our best skills to demonstrate the falsity of some of the myths with which they live.  In defence of Deputy Lynch and the late Deputy Seán Lemass, all Governments here, whatever postures they struck or whatever motions they went through to pretend otherwise, have done their best within the possibilities which a very volatile public opinion here offers to maintain law and order here and have not permitted the country to be used as a base for murder and savagery in the North. Perhaps one Government overreacted and one was slack but by and large all Governments here had their hearts in the right place in this regard.  We should spend money in trying to get that point across to the unionist majority who do not believe it and who are in the grip of a myth that this House consists of 148 fellow travellers with murder.  I am speaking for the Fine Gael Party and for the Labour Party.  No party has had a more honourable record in that regard than the Labour Party since they were founded.  About four-fifths, perhaps nine-tenths and possibly more of the Fianna Fail Party are of the same view.</P>

I would not be ashamed to do that.  The fact that the English, the French and the Belgians do not do it does not matter as they have not got the same problems.  That is a straightforward way of doing it.  We should be far more active in searching for ways of trying to get some kind of friendly reaction.

      <P>: The State has now become involved in very welcome expense in regard to the recovery, rescue and preservation of some extremely remarkable medieval Irish jewellery in relation to the finds made some weeks ago in County Tipperary.  Those articles should be sent to Belfast, not on permanent loan, at some reasonable opportunity and the people there should be given the opportunity to see them.  They should be sent there as a gesture of friendship in the way that the Killymoon Gold Hoard was 12 years ago.  That created a terrific impression before the violence started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not done anything like enough in the way of spending money to attract people from the North to get to know us, with our warts and all, but at least to satisfy themselves that we are not devils incarnate.  We should consider doing what other countries do for tourist promoting purposes.  We should give tourists from the North of Ireland on the production of a bone fide hotel receipt, <Col N="1963" /> refunds of VAT on their petrol consumption and on their hotel bills.  That would not break us.  I am surely in order in making that suggestion in relation to a budget which continues taxation in both those respects.  Naturally, since we are the fearful, timid, mouse-like people that we are, we are afraid to take a step in case it would take us out of line with the British.  We tend to look over our shoulder to see what the British are doing. I do not give a damn whether they do it or not, as they do not have the problem of a supposed national objective over which not one of their leaders ever lost an hour's sleep but to which they are supposed to commit and re-commit themselves at their annual conferences. They do not have the problem of trying to conciliate people who on their own republic orthodoxy are their own blood brothers but to whom they have given the back of their hand ever since they could walk as a state.  They do not have that problem and the fact that they do not do these things does not exempt us from the duty of considering whether they would bring Irish harmony any closer.</P>
    <P>Out of regard for the Chair I will not battle with him in regard to his ruling although I believe it is wrong.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>: When presenting his budget to the House on 27 February the Minister for Finance spoke of the obligation of Government to have as a priority the prudent management of the public finances and the improvement of the climate for economic development.  As he so rightly pointed out, this obligation <Col N="1964" /> becomes ever more burdensome in the present climate.  Fulfilment of this obligation requires a firm Government policy under which all sections of the community are, and can be seen to be, shouldering the extra burdens equally.  In the General Election of 1977 when Fianna Fáil came back to power we entered into commitments to the electorate. Those commitments were detailed in our election manifesto.  They were based on the same principle that each section of the community should share an equal burden in the achievement of a healthy social and economic order.</P>
      <P>In relation to prices we made detailed commitments.  In the past two years, in the face of unprecedented external economic pressures, we have fulfilled them.  The principal target of the manifesto in relation to prices was to reduce the rate of inflation by, <i>inter alia</i>, effective price control.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism had this as one of his major concerns on taking up office.  In the manifesto we promised a review of the operation of the National Prices Commission, a body which was established by Fianna Fáil in 1971 to monitor price movements.  The National Prices Commission undertake a substantial volume of work.  We looked at its structure and effectiveness and as a result of the review a number of major changes were made in the criteria for reviewing price applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a more rigorous examination of price proposals than before and the changes introduced here have had the effect of increasing the Minister's control and influence in the prices area. The Minister extended the period of notification of proposed price increases from two months to three months in the case of major firms to enable price proposals from these firms to be examined in greater detail and depth.  He also requires such firms to report each year on efficiency and productivity improvements. He raised the requirement for export exemption from price control from 25 per cent to 35 per cent of total volume so as to encourage firms to make a greater effort to increase their exports. <Col N="1965" /> He directed the National Prices Commission to pay particular attention to the import costs of Irish subsidiaries of multi-national companies.  He thought this extremely important to prevent the parent companies of such companies charging excessive prices for supplies in order to benefit the holding company abroad and in this way evade price control regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister also asked the commission to intensify their examination of the effect of currency fluctuations on companies' imported raw material costs and to keep under continuous review world market prices for raw materials and commodities.  In the pre-election manifesto Fianna Fáil promised to investigate middlemen's margins in areas where there was an inordinate difference in the price obtained by the producer for certain products and the price paid by the housewife for the same product.  The National Prices Commission carried out these investigations at the direction of the Minister and identified the areas where there were reasons for disparity. In one case the commission discovered what they regarded to be an unjustifiably large increase in gross margins and as a result the Minister immediately made a maximum prices order for controlling the retail price.  Formal control of some products, particularly in the fruit and vegetable area, by maximum prices order would create serious administrative difficulties.  It would be virtually impossible to relate a controlled price to a clearly defined quality of produce and this would render an order ineffective.  The best way to reduce margins is through improved efficiency and increased competition.  To this end the Government committed themselves to ensure that the consumer is provided with as much information as possible about prices in the form of radio programmes, a television programme and a flood of information to the national and provincial newspapers on a daily and weekly basis.  The manifesto also included a commitment to abolish the seven day rule arising out of the UK outer zone in respect of fuel price increases. <Col N="1966" /> We abolished that rule and now all applications for price increases in fuel are examined closely on their merit taking account of crude oil price increases. Another commitment related to Northern Ireland prices and ESB accounting procedures and those commitments have also been fully met.</P>
    <P>With regard to prices, the manifesto states that Fianna Fáil would regard price control as an important matter and, therefore, revert to the position where a member of the Government would be responsible for it and for dealing with the underlying causes of inflation. Minister O'Malley took on that responsibility and has exercised it over the last two and a half years.  In that time the Minister has refused or cut back recommendations for price increases from the National Prices Commission on 34 occasions.  The Minister was confident in all these cases that the firms concerned were capable of bearing some or all of the increased costs involved without any damage to their viability. The results of these actions by the Government mean that we have now in operation here one of the strictest forms of price control in the European Community and one of the most difficult to comply with.  The House will be aware that the British Government, for example abolished price control altogether and the result has been a major rise in their inflation rate which is now substantially above our own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have a rigorous and careful scrutiny of price applications and allied to it we have expanded the operations of the prices inspectorate to crack down on all forms of overcharging. In 1977, the year the Government assumed office, there were 45 inspectors in the Department engaged in the enforcement of price control legislation and the investigation of complaints.  In February 1980 the number of inspectors in the Department involved in prices investigation had risen from 45 to 83.  During 1979 the inspectorate investigated <Col N="1967" /> 6,342 complaints received at the Priceline centres and found that 3,798, or 60 per cent, of those complaints were well-founded. Evidence of the contravention of price control orders for legal proceedings was obtained in 4,509 instances. All this strengthening of the procedures under our prices control legislation has taken place against a background of adverse external economic pressure outside the control of the Government.</P>
      <P>Political upheavals in various parts of the world in recent times have had a telling effect on the price of the essential commodities which we import.  This is true not only in relation to oil prices but also in relation to a whole host of basic commodities which we need to keep our existing industries operating and to support our drive for continued industrialisation. Developing producer countries are nowadays not willing to part with their indigenous resources at bargain prices and they are striving, justifiably, to ensure that their production of basic raw materials assists their own economic development and will help towards providing their own peoples with a reasonable standard of living.</P>
      <P>The movements in crude oil prices in the last two years have been staggering to say the least.  In January 1978 the price of a barrel of Saudi-Arabian light crude was 12.95 US dollars.  By January 1979 the price had increased to $13.34.  In July 1979 the price was $18 per barrel while in December of that year it had increased to $24 and the present price is $26.  Therefore, there has been an increase between January 1979 and now from $13 to $26 per barrel, and light Arabian crude was the cheapest oil available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the severe nature of the political happenings in Iran the price of Iranian oil has increased a lot more steeply.  For example, the market price for Iranian crude in January 1978 was $13.6 but this has increased to the present price of almost $33 per barrel. These are crippling increases and they have had a serious effect on our <Col N="1968" /> economy and on our balance of payments. Increases in the price of fuel oil have a spillover on to the prices of numerous other commodities.  For example, naphtha, the raw material used for town gas production, is an oil product and its price has increased in line with crude oil prices.  Unfortunately, as a result town gas consumers, particularly in Dublin and Cork, have been faced with continuing rising prices.  The annual fuel cost of the ESB for 1980-81 has been estimated by the board to be £211 million but their total actual revenue for 1978-79 was only £223 million.  In those circumstances and with the ESB dependent so much on oil, is it any wonder that they must increase their prices by substantial amounts?  The plain fact is that we must reduce our dependence on imported fuel.  The way in which we use oil is more appropriate to an era in which the financial consequences were of little concern.</P>
    <P>The Government's actions both in terms of the budget and in terms of our efforts generally to promote energy conservation and to develop our own fuel resources are designed primarily to reduce this dependence.  A government's price control policies must be geared to fit the existing economic circumstances. The way in which we have exercised price control during the past two years has been particularly successful in this regard.  It is interesting to consider the movement in the inflation rate in recent years and to use this movement as a gauge to measure the success or failure of the Government's policies.</P>
    <P>In the three years 1974, 1975 and 1976, prior to the Government assuming office, we experienced annual inflation rates of 17 per cent, 20.9 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.  The movement in oil prices during the corresponding period was from 10.55 US dollars for a barrel of light Arabian crude in 1974 to $12.95 in 1976, an increase during the period of $2.4.  The annual inflation rates for 1977, 1978 and 1979, the first three years of office of this Government, were 13.3 per cent, 7.6 per cent and 13.2 per cent respectively.  When one compares <Col N="1969" /> these inflation rates with the increases in oil prices during the same period, one finds that the inflation rates were, to say the least, impressive.  They compared favourably with the rates achieved by our trading partners in other European countries who also have been subject to the rising oil prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>: Increases in the price of imported raw materials are not the only input increases which our manufacturing industry have had to bear in recent years.  Many of them are of our own making.  Wages and salaries in particular have shown a considerable increase in recent years.  During the past two years alone wage increases <Col N="1970" /> awarded under the terms of the relevant national wage agreements have added more than 30 per cent to wage bills.  This was a large increase but the figure does not tell the full story.  The latest figures available show that in the period from June 1976 to March 1979, while the wage increases provided for under the national wage agreements totalled 28.1 per cent, the increase in actual earnings recorded by the Central Statistics Office was 49.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is clear that with cost increases of this magnitude price control must be operated in such a way as to allow firms to remain viable and competitive.  We cannot get way from the economic facts. If we need oil to fuel the economy we must pay the higher prices being charged for it.  If we continue to pay ourselves higher wages and salaries we must pay the resultant higher prices for our goods and services.</P>
      <P>The consequences would be predictable if all applications for price increases were to be rejected out of hand while cost increases continued to occur. Company bankruptcies and redundancies would follow within a short period. In many cases supplies of goods to the Irish market would cease altogether. Given the increased costs of imported materials and the size of increases in money incomes which have occurred in recent years, increased costs can nowadays only very rarely be met from profits or fully offset by improvements in productivity and efficiency.  If price control were to be applied in this way it would soon become irrelevant.  No products would be available at the controlled prices and the social costs inflicted on the community would soon become intolerable.</P>
      <P>It is necessary in the operation of an effective price control system to hold a balance between the competing needs and demands and pressures of the consumer and those of the industrialist who is trying to produce goods at a reasonable price, trying to keep his workers in employment and in many cases trying to expand employment at times of considerable economic difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> As I have said, it appears that our price control system, as it has been strengthened in recent years, is the most stringent and most difficult to comply with, of all the price control systems operated in the EEC.  This is a source of continuing concern to some extent from the industrial point of view because of the pressures which are put on firms here more than in other countries.  This pressure is evidenced by the number of complaints the Department receive from industrialists.  A number of complaints about prices being too high or price control not being operated strictly enough are received.  The complaints we get in that regard are, however, a mere fraction of the complaints from industrialists subject to price control.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and myself continually meet deputations from the business community who come to talk to us about the difficulties which they experience in complying with our stringent price control procedure about how unfair they think it is and how strenuously it has been applied over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The task of balancing the interests of the consumer with those of the industrialists and his employees is a delicate one which requires the constant attention of the Government.  Unlike the previous administration where the Minister displayed not the slightest interest in prices, this Government have a Cabinet Minister who has the active responsibility for price control, and this means that the competing needs of the various sections of the community are given the fullest possible recognition.</P>
    <P>The budget, which we are at present debating, was framed in such a way as to ensure that the impact on the necessities of life is minimised.  The way in which indirect taxes have been levied is such as to concentrate them in so far as is possible on discretionary expenditure. The spreading of the income tax burden in response to the justifiable demands of the PAYE sector of the community, the significant improvements in social welfare allowances, will serve to increase the purchasing power of the <Col N="1972" /> various sectors of the community.  These improvements and increases have to be financed by way of taxation, and the method of the Minister for Finance in obtaining the largest proportion possible by way of taxation on discretionary items helps to ensure that the most bearable impact falls on households and individuals whose means and commitments are such as to allow of only limited discretionary expenditure.</P>
    <P>The price increases announced by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism as a consequence of the budget, and other cost increases, attracted a good deal of attention in the media.  We were treated to the usual banner headlines predicting doomsday just around the corner.  Indeed while I am on the subject I would like to refer again to the continuous flow of consumer information on price matters which my Department provide to the newspapers for publication.  It is not always published. The practice of some newspapers in simply predicting huge price increases is irresponsible and can be extremely harmful, particularly at times when wage negotiations are at the formative stage.</P>
    <P>The price increase of 77p per standard cylinder on bottled gas attracted a good deal of media attention.  This price increase provided for an increase of 22p per standard cylinder, and pro-rata for other size cylinders, to take account of the 5p per gallon imposed on butane and propane in the budget; an increase of 50p per standard cylinder, and pro-rata for other size cylinders, to take account of a recommendation of the National Prices Commission for compensation for Calor Gas (Ireland) Ltd. and Ergas Ltd. for the higher cost of purchases of butane and propane on the world spot market.</P>
    <P>The companies involved here had applied to the National Prices Commission for permission to increase their prices by amounts sufficient to cover the increased cost of purchasing their raw material&mdash;in one case, this amounted to over £4½ million.  The increase looked for was 63p per standard cylinder.  The National Prices Commission undertook <Col N="1973" /> a detailed examination of the proposal and recommended to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism that the companies be allowed to increase their prices by 59p per standard cylinder. Following his own examination of the proposal, the Minister decided that the price increase should be 50p per standard cylinder.  The original application was therefore cut back by 13p or more than 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The price increase of 77p also included an increase of 5p per standard cylinder, and pro-rata for other size cylinders, in retailers' cash margins which had been recommended by the National Prices Commission to compensate these traders for cost increases.  The retailers involved had applied for increases of 12p and 25½p.  Following detailed examination the price increase approved was 5p per standard cylinder. It is interesting to note, therefore, that an increase which could have amounted to 110.5p was cut back to 77p.</P>
    <P>My Department were criticised to a considerable degree following the budget in regard to the price increases on petroleum products.  In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced an increase in the price of all grades of motor spirits and of auto-diesel of 20p per gallon, VAT inclusive, at wholesale level, effective from 28 February 1980.</P>
    <P>On 28 February the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism made an order, the Maximum Prices (Petroleum Products) (No. 2) Order, 1980, providing, <i>inter alia</i>, for an increase of 22p per gallon, VAT inclusive on the retail price of petrol and auto-diesel, with effect from 3 March 1980. The purpose of the time-lag between the increase at wholesale level and at retail level was to allow for the disposal of petrol stocks bought at the old price.  I am sure that every fair-minded person will agree that an occasion such as the budget should not be used by holders of large stocks of petrol to make an unjust profit at the expense of the motorist.</P>
    <P>In this context, I would refer to occasions in recent years when the Minister <Col N="1974" /> found it necessary to reduce the maximum retail price of petrol.  On those occasions it was very evident that some petrol retailers were less than prompt in reducing their prices.  Were it not for the action of the prices inspectorate of my Department on those occasions, many motorists would have been unfairly penalised.</P>
    <P>The same situation could have arisen in relation to the latest increase had not the order made provision for the clearing of old stock.  Between Thursday, 28 February, and the following Monday, 140 complaints were received from around the country about petrol retailers increasing prices before the permitted date.  All of the complaints were investigated and most of the retailers involved agreed to make refunds to the complainants.  However, in cases where petrol retailers refused to refund overcharges and where evidence of overcharging was available to the Department, legal proceedings were instituated immediately.  There were, of course, those retailers who because of the rush on petrol after the Minister's announcement had to purchase new stocks at the new wholesale price.  These retailers had to close until they were legally entitled to pass on the increase.</P>
    <P>The budget also provided for increases in the tax on beers and spirits. As Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, I am particularly concerned at the level of prices being charged for alcoholic drink in bars and lounges throughout the country.  I am concerned both because of the effect on the consumer and because of the effect of alcoholic drink prices on the consumer price index.  The price of alcoholic drink has a very high weighting in the consumer price index.  Drink prices are controlled by maximum prices order.  While the constitutionality of this order is currently the subject of a Supreme Court action by the publicans, my Department's inspectors continue to enforce its provisions as rigidly as possible. Evidence has been obtained of widespread overcharging by publicans throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> At the present time there are in the pipeline more than 4,500 prosecutions of publicans for overcharging; evidence of overcharging by publicans gathered by the inspectors are coming into the Department at the rate of about 300 to 350 per week and the prices inspectors will continue to investigate drink prices throughout the country to ensure that no publican is allowed to overcharge with impunity.</P>
    <P>Government action in areas such as price control can provide only part of the response needed to problems such as these.  Success or failure in dealing with these problems depends upon many factors, not least the level of wage increases. In the present economic climate wage increases not matched by real improvements in productivity and efficiency spell problems for maintaining a reasonable level of prices.  This is true not only in relation to the price of goods on the home market but also to the prices of our export products.  An exporting country such as ours, where two out of every three jobs depend on exports, with a large deficit in the balance of payments, cannot afford, as the Minister for Finance pointed out in his budget speech, to lose competitiveness internationally through such increased costs. The price control system which we operate allows companies to be compensated only for unavoidable cost increases which they have incurred.</P>
    <P>In relation to wage costs, this means wage increases awarded under national wage agreements or awarded in accordance with the terms of such agreements. Increased wages and salaries not matched by real increased productivity simply have the effect of pushing up the prices of those commodities which we buy and therefore, in the final analysis, are of no real benefit to the people who obtain them.  The inflation rate is simply driven up further and a greater burden is placed on the more deprived members of the community.  It is estimated that payments due under the second phase of the current national understanding will come to about 10 per cent of average industrial earnings.  This, coupled with the <Col N="1976" /> 9 per cent under the first phase, leaves us with a very high rate of increase by international standards and the effect is seen on price levels.  As the Minister for Finance has pointed out, there would not appear from a strictly economic viewpoint to be scope for any further pay increases this year.  While the increases in oil prices which I referred to earlier have had a considerable effect and have accelerated the rise in price levels, we must face the economic fact that it would be foolhardy to compensate ourselves for this extra burden by simply awarding ourselves increases in income.</P>
    <P>It cannot be stressed too often that price increases are the symptoms of inflation and not its causes.  I have tried to emphasise this point by the remarks I have made in relation to oil price increases and wage cost increases.  The external causes of inflation&mdash;increases in import and export prices&mdash;lie beyond the control of the Government.  It is only possible to take action to limit their effects on Irish price levels.  The actions which the Government have taken in relation to the procedures under which the National Prices Commission operate have been designed to meet this end.  The job of the commission is to consider each application and recommend what price increase is justified within the commission's terms of reference, by the cost increases that the applicant has incurred, taking all relevant circumstances into account.</P>
    <P>When considering price increase proposals, the commission usually allow incurred increases in raw material costs where these are verified by documentary evidence.  In the case of labour costs, the commission must have regard to specific Government guidelines and, generally speaking, only increases in line with the national wage agreements are allowed. In regard to overhead costs, firms are expected to document increases claimed where possible, and where this is not possible the commission have regard to their own available data or to indices published by the Central Statistics Office. The commission are not obliged to recommend full compensation for increased costs and often less than full <Col N="1977" /> compensation for increased costs and often less than full compensation is recommended to encourage productivity and efficiency.</P>
    <P>Since applications referred to the National Prices Commission are applications for price increases, the commission tend to be identified only with price increases.  Attention is invariably focused on the price increases which are recommended because they are regarded as newsworthy and not on that part of the price increase sought that was prevented from occurring.  It is interesting to look at the number of price increase applications processed by the commission and the way in which they have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>In 1978, the National Prices Commission dealt with 350 price applications. The commission recommended in eight of these cases that no price increase be granted at all.  In 162 of the applications, the commission cut back the price increases applied for significantly and recommended that only part of the increase sought should be allowed.  Of the total of 350 applications for price increases, only 163 were recommended for approval in full.  The remaining 17 cases were price reductions recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>In 1979, the commission dealt with 507 applications for price increases.  Of these, they recommended that in four cases no price increase at all be granted.  Applications recommended for approval in part only amounted to 298.  Of the total of 507 applications, only 205 were recommended for approval in full.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, in that period also the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism refused or cut back commission recommendations in a further 34 cases.  The Minister's responsibility for and interest in price matters has served to help and support the commission in their arduous task&mdash;unlike his predecessor who did not bestir himself on one single occasion to question or comment on any recommendation of the National Prices Commission during his term of office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> Since the commission were established by Fianna Fáil in October 1971 until the end of January 1980, they have dealt with 4,765 applications for price increases. Of these, 104 applications&mdash;or 2.2 per cent&mdash;were recommended for refusal.  There were two main reasons for those refusals: the cost increases that were claimed were not adequately supported by documentary evidence or were insignificant when compared to the applicant's total costs or current profits.</P>
    <P>Of the 4,765 applications considered, 2,298&mdash;or 48.2 per cent&mdash;were recommended for approval in part only.  The main reasons why these firms were not granted the full increases sought were: the increases sought in materials and other costs were not fully supported by satisfactory documentary evidence; the firms involved sought price increases to cover increases in pay costs over and above the Government guidelines; the applicants could reasonably be expected to offset a part of the costs increases by improvements in efficiency.</P>
    <P>There were three main reasons why 2,339 applications&mdash;or 49.1 per cent of the total&mdash;were recommended for approval in full.  First, the applicants were&mdash;and had been&mdash;making losses or very moderate profits and any attempt to restrict the increases sought could have endangered employment and the applicant company's existence.  Secondly, the price increases sought were based solely on increases in the cost of materials.  In the short run, the scope for economising on the use of materials or switching over to alternative and cheaper materials is limited.  Thirdly, the applicant company proposed to absorb a significant part of the increases incurred in costs and consequently the increase allowed in full did not recover all their cost increases.</P>
    <P>In 24 cases, since their establishment the commission have recommended reductions in selling prices following examination of applicants' cost and price structures, on the grounds that the selling price levels then existing were overcompensating the firms concerned, due mainly to favourable changes in their costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> The Commission are consistently guided by the need to maintain efficiency in the production of goods and services. The Government's view is that the consumer should not have to pay for inefficiency in industry and consequently, the commission continue to take account of the scope for productivity and efficiency improvements in the various firms and industry sectors who apply for price increases.</P>
    <P>The Commission are also aware of the implications of proposed price increases for employment and employment generation.  There is a need for companies to generate profits for investment and, accordingly, price increase proposals based on investment plans are examined on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the commission.  Price increases to improve profitability for investment are limited to companies whose prices are competitive, who have proved themselves by their record of investment in the past and who have viable investment plans for the future.  It is particularly important that such investments will generate new jobs or at least maintain existing jobs which would clearly otherwise be lost, and it is desirable, also, that the capital invested be spent in this country, as far as possible.</P>
    <P>In the twelve-month period, from February 1979 to January 1980, the commission considered price increase proposals from 541 applicants, totalling £441.9 million on an annualised basis. Of this total, £360.5 million was actually allowed.  This means that as a result of the proper operation of price control procedures, the prices of the products and services covered by these 541 applications rose by about 22 per cent less than they would have risen if the applicants had not been subject to detailed price control and the consumers had to pay nearly £80 million less than they would otherwise have had to pay.</P>
    <P>This figure under-estimates the saving to consumers.  Nearly all the commission's recommendations relate to ex-factory prices and retail prices are generally fixed by adding a percentage margin to the prices at which the <Col N="1980" /> retailers buy.  If the average retail margin on cost were, say, 25 per cent, then the savings to consumers would reach almost £100 million.  That is, in the period February 1979 January 1980, the operation by Fianna Fáil of the National Prices Commission set up by Fianna Fáil and the strict control and monitoring of their recommendations and the strict decisions taken by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism saved Irish consumers nearly £100 million.</P>
    <P>Under Government guidelines, the National Prices Commission cannot allow price increases to compensate for wage and salary increases in excess of limits laid down.  If rigorous price control had not existed, increases in pay costs above the limits would in many cases have been recouped from higher prices.</P>
    <P>The £360.5 million actually allowed as increased costs for the purposes of price increases in 1979-80, when broken down into its constitutional parts, reveals some interesting facts.  Of the total figure, £232.37 million was in respect of raw material costs, £72.1 million in respect of pay costs and £56.06 million in respect of overhead costs.</P>
    <P>One thing is abundantly clear from these figures and that is that increases in material costs were of paramount importance as causes of price increases.  Over 64 per cent of the total costs allowed was in respect of raw material cost increases. As I have said already, the vast majority of raw material inputs have to be purchased on world markets, the prices of which are influenced by external factors totally outside the control of the Government.  For example, in the case of primary energy goods in particular, it has been a case of paying the going prices on world markets to ensure continuity of supply to this country, thus maintaining the provision of essential goods and services.  The consequences of not allowing price compensation in such circumstances would be declining production levels, reduced employment and the substitution of home-manufactured goods by imported products, in many cases not subject to price control, accompanied by a worsening of our balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> I have tried in my remarks to the House today to inform Deputies, and the public at large, of the operation of our price control system and the problems which it encounters.  These problems will continue to arise but this Administration have the will, energy and expertise to overcome them as they arise.  The sound principles on which this budget is based, and on which our price control policies have been based over the last two-and-a-half years, will ensure that our efforts will continue to be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Many adjectives and superlatives have been used to describe this budget but I think there is only one very short word of three letters that can describe it and that is &ldquo;bad&rdquo;.  It is bad for many reasons.  I have wondered to what extent the PAYE reliefs in the budget would have been given were it not, first, for the protests and, secondly, for the High Court case, because Government speakers have referred to the so-called PAYE concessions as being in line with the Government's programme, as what they always intended to do.  In fact, it was the very tax policy of the Government that brought the people in hundreds of thousands on to the streets. Never before did we witness such massive support for a cause as was seen in the past 12 months particularly in the two major protests made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following last year's budget it became evident to PAYE workers that they were not going to get justice, that equality or fair play would not be introduced into the tax system.  There was also plenty of evidence before that, if one needed it. Speakers on the Fianna Fáil benches talk about successive Governments being responsible for the tax system.  Who are successive Governments?  One would get the impression that every second Government meant a change of Government. If we go back over the last 25 years, all the Governments have been Fianna Fáil except one.  So, responsibility for a tax mess rests fairly and squarely on Fianna Fáil.  While they are quick to claim credit where possible, <Col N="1982" /> when it comes to any criticism they are equally quick to say that is due to &ldquo;successive Governments&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil do not ever appear to have been a &ldquo;successive Government&rdquo; in that sense.</P>
    <P>My point is that the tax concessions in the budget are being forced on the Government, concessions they never intended to give.  These concessions, as they were given, have not reduced the inequality in the tax structure; they have given relief at certain levels of income and they have certainly done what a tax system should not do, made the rich richer and the poor poorer.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers also mentioned that people are living beyond their means.  That may be true in some cases but the thousands of wage and salary earners who depend on pay day to meet their bills are not living beyond their means.  It is true to say that, prior to the change of Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, in their manifesto and everything connected with it, did give the clear promise that people would have more money in their pockets, a better standard of living and, generally speaking, would be more or less in a Utopian situation, if only there was a change of Government. The expectations held out at that time have not been fulfilled.  Once the flood gates of expectations are opened it is very difficult to close them.  The Government themselves would be the first to admit that, having regard to the problems over the past year or two, problems which arose, to a great extent, from these unfulfilled expectations.  There are not many people, if any, that could be regarded as living beyond their means.  I am sure that the Minister himself meets quite a number of his constituents and I doubt if he could identify any of them justifiably and correctly as living beyond their means.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments should be a major part of any budget but, unfortunately, their review is confined to an annual event, with a few exceptions in recent years.  An annual review of social welfare payments is no longer acceptable. It is no longer the right thing to do, for the very reasons stated by the <Col N="1983" /> Minister in his remarks about unpredictable and unexpected price increases, and the external factors he mentioned. For those very reasons, the levels set for social welfare payments should be reviewed on an on-going basis, should be adjusted during the year and, certainly, more frequently than once a year.  The adjustments made and provided for in this budget will hardly compensate for the increases in the cost of living over the past 12 months, not to mention the increases arising out of the budget provisions.</P>
    <P>When some factors in this budget percolate right through the economy, they will result in further increases over the coming months, increases which, at this stage cannot accurately be gauged.  For example, most experts and commentators expect our inflation rate to be around 20 per cent for the coming few months.  Social welfare recipients who have to buy at dearest prices&mdash;and I say that very deliberately&mdash;will be at a great disadvantage.  The way various commodities are made up now, if one is able to buy in bulk, to buy the large so-called economy size, it is much cheaper.  On the other hand, pensioners and other social welfare recipients cannot afford to buy large amounts of anything but must buy in small quantities which, of course, is the most expensive way of buying.  They pay a little bit more all the time for their basic requirements.</P>
    <P>In connection with social welfare generally, there is a falling down. Whether it is due to staff shortage or other reasons I do not know, but in relation to the payment of some benefits, people experience severe hardship by not receiving these payments in time.  The level of benefits certainly is not generous but at least if they get them on a regular basis&mdash;I am talking in particular about sickness benefit&mdash;they might be just about able to manage.  Getting them on a very irregular basis makes life so much more difficult.</P>
    <P>Some press commentators have referred to the fact that the Labour benches here are often very bare.  I do not want to make excuses about this, but <Col N="1984" /> one of the major genuine excuses is that we in the Labour Party&mdash;myself in particular&mdash;all today have been detained on the phone talking to the Department of Social Welfare trying to get people what they are entitled to.  Particularly over the last six or eight months most of my time as a Deputy in this House has been occupied with that exercise of trying to get people what they are entitled to.  It is outrageous that I can quote many cases where people entitled to benefits would never have got them but for the intervention of myself or other TDs.  This is scandalous. We live in a country where we like to tell people that if they are entitled to it they will get it, whereas that is no longer true.  I say that very deliberately. People now require a TD or Senator to delve into the matter to get them what they are justly entitled to.  People would have lost hundreds of pounds of benefit and I hope that this will be rectified not alone in the levels of benefit but in the way the system is managed and looked at.</P>
    <P>I have had nothing but the utmost courtesy and co-operation from any officials I have contacted regarding cases, but whether there is a political will there to put the thing right is doubtful.  I will not go so far as to suggest that there is some deliberate political attempt to create this kind of situation but it does exist and I am sure that other Members of this House are aware of it.  That is why I make the plea for social welfare recipients.  The level of benefit, even with the 20 per cent and 25 per cent increase in the long-term rates is far from adequate, having regard to all the circumstances. The system of payments and of ensuring that people get what they are entitled to when they are entitled to it will have to be tackled very urgently by the Government.</P>
    <P>Down the line at local authority or health board level where the supplementary allowances have to be managed a lot of administrative problems arise because in the final analysis the health boards have to come to the assistance of those people who are left high and dry by the Department of Social Welfare.  I <Col N="1985" /> do not agree with the percentage increases in social welfare benefits.  Percentage increases are misleading.  The 20 or 25 per cent increases on an average income is an advantage but a similar increase on a social welfare payment is a different thing altogether.  There is an attempt to mislead by quoting percentage increases.  Much more is required than, say, an increase of £4 or £5 on these rates when regard is had to all the other increases that have been implemented in the past 12 months and will be implemented over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The tax campaign had two aspects to it, one of which has been lost sight of and that is that people were looking for equality in tax which they have not got, but they want that without any cuts in services, particularly essential services. There are severe cuts in essential services. One has only to read the reports from all the local authorities throughout the country to learn that they have passed resolutions asking the Minister to reconsider the allocation, to receive deputations and so on.  Local authorities have been given a guideline of a 10 per cent increase and have been told also that the buoyancy of their revenue will provide perhaps another 2, 3, or 4 per cent.  Here again the Government in doing that are asking the local authorities to use the revenue coming in to them from new rated premises for the maintenance of existing services.  In other words, all the new premises in respect of which rates will be paid will find that the services cannot be expanded to cater for them.  The direction to that effect going out from the Department of the Environment was a very wrong direction. Because some factories and business premises require services they will not be too pleased when they realise that the rates they will pay this year will not be used to provide services but will be used merely to maintain existing services. Already some local authorities have problems in maintaining employment.</P>
    <P>Health boards have serious problems and I was amazed at the Minister for <Col N="1986" /> Health the other night exhorting hospital authorities to try to cut down on hospital admissions. In my health board area there is a very diligent and conscientious system for hospital admissions and only people who require hospital treatment are admitted.  I do not know how anyone can cut down on these admissions.  This serves to demonstrate the inequality of the budget. The people who cannot afford to pay for hospital treatment will be affected by any cut back and people in a position to pay will pay for private hospital treatment. Every day of the week parents with children who are ill are told on going to the local health board that they must wait three, four or six months before the child will be admitted to hospital.  These parents dig into their savings and have the child admitted as a private patient.  Unfortunately, many parents are not able to do that and their children suffer.</P>
    <P>This budget diminished the services available to the less well-off in relation to health and education.  In relation to health, more and more hospital beds are required for an increased population. Therefore, the health services must expand and develop.  Here we have a situation where the Minister for Health is asking health boards to ensure that hospital admissions are reduced.  Instead money should be made available for the expansion of hospitals.  Recently a parliamentary question was asked in the Dáil about the county hospital in Kilkenny where there is serious overcrowding and a serious staff shortage and the Minister was not able to offer any solution, primarily because of the provisions of this budget which is supposed to be so great.  It is a sad state of affairs that as a direct consequence of the provisions in the budget the less well-off sections will suffer more.  In hard times these are the people who are always squeezed out. The cut-back in local authority services affects the poorer sections most because local authorities exist primarily to provide services for those who cannot afford to pay for them.  The people I refer to will not benefit from the PAYE concessions <Col N="1987" /> either.  At other levels of income it may be argued that there is a <i>quid pro quo</i>, one is given something and something is taken back.  However, the poorer sections get nothing although they must pay the increases in indirect taxation and they must suffer the severe restriction of services.</P>
    <P>This budget makes no provision for the increased population.  It was only during the past year that proof became available that the population had increased. The only measure taken by the Government to provide for the increased population was a few extra seats in the House.  This demonstrates the extent of vision of the Government.  The extra seats could have waited for some time. There are far more urgent things to be attended to in relation to the increased population.  We cannot provide for an increase in population within the terms of a budget that imposes severe cut-backs. We should provide more houses, more schools, hospitals and other infrastructure to cope with the increase in population, and of course more jobs.</P>
    <P>It is alarming to note that unemployment is on the increase, but it is not surprising because this was inevitable arising from the policies pursued by this Government.  The Government in trying to justify heavy borrowing tell us that it will increase employment but they must remember that when borrowing is reduced employment figures will also fall.  In trying to justify the heavy borrowing that took place in the last two years Ministers have told us that it would be only a temporary measure after which the momentum would be established and the economy would float at that higher level of activity.  They told us that borrowing could then be stopped without any adverse effect on employment or any other economic activity.  We would have liked that to be true but, unfortunately, everything points in the opposite direction.  The momentum which was supposed to be created by the brinkmanship in borrowing has not occured and we are worse off than we were before.</P>
    <P>There have been several cut-backs in <Col N="1988" /> the field of education and again the less well-off sections of the community will suffer.  With the increase in our population more schools are required and a big number of schools are overdue for replacement.  I hope we have learned a lesson from the past and do not try to solve this problem by providing pre-fab classrooms.  There will be a big increase in the number of young people looking for school accommodation at all levels but, in particular, at primary school level.  At present children are being accommodated in classrooms that are overcrowded and that situation will not ease particularly in view of the fact that the other related problem, that of pupil-teacher ratio, is still with us.</P>
    <P>As there is a debate in progress in Private Member's Business on housing grants I will not dwell for any length of time on this subject.  However, it is important to point out that the weaker sections of the community will suffer as a result of the proposals in the budget in relation to those grants.  Those with small houses or rural cottages who are anxious to install a water supply or sewerage facilities are being denied State assistance towards the cost of that work. The Government should bear in mind that there are many in rural Ireland who do not have such basic necessities as a water supply and proper sewerage facilities.  If such a drastic measure was considered necessary it could have been done on a selective basis, as was adopted by Deputy Tully when Minister for Local Government in 1976.  I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, who pointed out that the grants were being used in some cases to provide luxury accommodation, but Fianna Fáil must accept the blame for that because they decided to pay the grant without an inspection to see if the house was in need of an extension or additional facilities.  I am concerned about the householders who cannot carry out this work without State assistance, the poorer sections of the community who must live in overcrowded accommodation.</P>
    <P>People have become punch-drunk by a succession of price increases.  I can <Col N="1989" /> recall a Ministerial statement to the effect that wage earners should not seek compensation in respect of price rises as a result of increased energy costs, but it must be remembered that practically every commodity is increased in price when the cost of energy rises.  People must be compensated.  It has become fashionable among some economists to state that workers should not seek compensation for increases in prices or a rise in inflation on the basis that such increases only add fuel to the fire.  I doubt if all economists would agree but it is a nice line for some of them to try to get away with.  If that line was followed prices would really go mad.  One of the controlling factors in relation to prices is the fact that wage earners must be compensated for price increases regardless of where these increases emanate from.  The worker has only his or her labour to sell and in return for that commodity a wage or salary is paid.  It is important that the price of that commodity increases in line with price increases generally, because in order to be able to sell his labour the worker must have the necessities of life.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in condemning the budget for the reasons I have outlined. It is a budget which will have the result of making the poor poorer and of withdrawing from them many essential services.  Certainly it will reduce their opportunity of benefiting from these services thereby widening the gap between the rich and the poor.  In addition, much of the progress that has been made down through the years in relation to cherishing all the children of the nation equally will be undone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this budget which is perhaps the most fair and most caring budget that I have witnessed during my time in this House. Also, it is the most clever budget of recent years.  Despite the intense financial problems with which the Government must contend, they have succeeded in bringing some degree of equality into the income tax area.  Undoubtedly the PAYE people have been unfairly burdened up to now.  Many of them had lost <Col N="1990" /> the incentive to work and an increasing number had resorted to tax evasion as a result of the heavy demands made on them by the Revenue Commissioners. The importance of giving our workers a proper incentive to work hard and conscientiously cannot be over-stressed but the harsh PAYE system and the failure on the part of successive Governments to revise that system on a regular basis sowed the seeds for the major protests that have been witnessed in our cities and towns by these people.  However, the budget has gone a long way to right these wrongs and I am glad to note that the major concessions as outlined in the budget have been welcomed by the PAYE lobby and by the ICTU.  Unfortunately, though, someone must pick up the bill and in this case the farming community are being asked to make a more equitable contribution to the State's finances.  Despite the fact that the agricultural industry are experiencing some problems at the moment I do not think the taxation measures announced in the budget in respect of farmers will impose an unfair burden.  There is not any question of farmers being singled out for harsh treatment.  As the Taoiseach said recently, the £40 valuation provision will remain as it is for at least three years.  In addition there will be generous allowances in respect of capital expenditure on farm development.  The resource tax of £3.50 per £1 of rateable valuation will apply for only a short term, until the commission on taxation have devised an acceptable alternative taxation system.</P>
      <P>Little attention has been paid to a major concession that has been granted to the farming community in this budget.  I refer to the change whereby from now on the upper limit for capital acquisition tax in respect of farms will be £300,000 or 50 per cent more than was the case in the past.  This means that a wife and son who inherit a farm worth, say, £600,000 or less, because of the provision for an exemption of £300,000 each, will not have to pay any tax on the farm.  This change was elaborated on today by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note also that income <Col N="1991" /> splitting will apply to the farming community just as it will apply to urban workers.  This gives to the farmer's wife, in effect, her just right to a weekly wage.</P>
    <P>I trust that the budgetary proposals will help to curb the polarisation that has developed between urban and rural communities, a situation which has arisen largely because of the inequitable taxation system.  Unfortunately, though, the situation was often exacerbated by irresponsible speeches from people on both sides of the fence.  If we allow serious divisions to develop between urban and rural communities the country will suffer at a time when we need to create jobs for our young people and to provide a decent standard of living for all our people.</P>
    <P>One of the most important features of the budget is the 25 per cent increase in social welfare benefits.  We must look after the weaker sections of the community. Any Government with a social conscience must ensure that there is a decent standard of living for the sick, the unemployed, the old age pensioner and so on.  In a situation in which increasing numbers of married women are going out to work&mdash;and no one should deny them the right to do that&mdash;the Government's decision to allow income splitting for the first time will result in a considerable tax saving for couples.  It will mean that all married couples, whether they have one income or two incomes, will have the benefit of double the personal allowance for a single person.</P>
    <P>Workers have welcomed the Minister's decision to introduce a special allowance of £400 for each employee, including pensioners, taxed under the PAYE system.  The decision to change the rate bands means also that the great majority of the middle-income group will not have to pay tax in future at the higher rates.  The overall effect is that most taxpayers will pay at a lower rate and that those in the lower income group will be exempt altogether.  For example, a single person with an income of less than £1,700 a year and a married couple with less than £3,400 a year will not have to pay tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1992" /> Although this budget is a landmark as far as income taxation is concerned, the Commission on Taxation will have an important job to do and all sections of the community will await anxiously their findings.  We all hope they can produce a fair solution to our taxation problems.</P>
    <P>Talking about taxation and equity, I should like to draw attention to the banking sector.  There is good reason to believe that if the commercial banks had managed their affairs properly we would not now have such a short supply of money.  Indeed I would go further and accuse the banks of a certain amount of mismanagement.  In February 1979 the Central Bank told the commercial banks that they could increase the amount of credit for the public by 18 per cent. Rather than distribute this money in a proper orderly fashion, the commercial banks lashed out half of the year's allocation in three months, and not to anybody's surprise the Central Bank had to intervene to bring some sanity to the market.  The overall effect of the banks' splurge has been that bridging loans and money for farming have been difficult to get.  Perhaps it is hardly fair to blame the banks entirely because high prices for land already obtained, but there have been some instances of banks granting loans to adjoining farmers to compete against each other for land.  This clearly forced land prices to an uneconomical level, and with interest rates so high many farmers found it impossible to improve their holdings.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for Finance say that the Commission on Taxation will be looking not only at PAYE but at other taxation issues.  I strongly urge them to look closely at the dramatic decline in taxation paid by the two big banking groups who managed to reduce their current tax liabilities because of loopholes in section 84 of the Corporation Tax Act and also because of the concession allowed to them to lease plant and machinery to customers instead of making loans available to them to buy their own plant and machinery.  The two big banking groups in recent years have gone into purchasing <Col N="1993" /> plant themselves, picking up Government grants of up to 60 per cent and leasing the plant to customers.  In this way they have managed to evade tax substantially and consequently to increase the taxation burden on PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister for Finance has called a halt to increasing demands on workers and has granted them substantial concessions.  At this point I think it would be appropriate for me to put on record precisely the taxation the two big banking groups paid in the year ending March 1979.  The Bank of Ireland paid £3.3 million in current tax on a pre-tax profit of almost £47 million.  The Allied Irish group managed to cut their tax liability to the ridiculously low figure of £600,000 on a pre-tax profit of £41 million.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that some people have been calling for nationalisation of banking?  I do not happen to believe that nationalisation is the answer, but I say that the banks should be obliged to pay a more equitable level of tax.  Going on last year's figures, the Bank of Ireland group paid an effective current tax of 7 per cent.  The Allied Irish group paid only 1½ per cent.  To demonstrate just how well the banks have reduced their tax-levels because of this loophole in the law, I would point out that the Bank of Ireland's current tax rate dropped from 38.7 per cent of pre-tax profits in 1975 to a mere 7 per cent in 1979.  The same applies to Allied Irish whose tax rate fell from 31.3 per cent in 1975 to a mere 1½ per cent in 1979.</P>
    <P>The only thing that can be said about the banks' leasing service is that it is particularly advantageous to exporting companies.  However, they cannot claim the full capital facility against tax.  I sincerely hope that the Commission on Taxation will ensure that this loophole will be closed and that the banks will be made to live up to their responsibility to pay their due share of tax.</P>
    <P>With banking so important to our national economy I should like to hear more debates here on the way banking is <Col N="1994" /> being operated.  It is too vital a service to be ignored.  I believe that we should be encouraging more competition between our banks.  At present the banking cartel ensures that the same lending and interest rates are charged by all the banks. I do not see any good reason why the banks should not be subject to the Restrictive Practices Commission.  Competition between the leading banks would inevitably lead to lower interest rates for customers and borrowers and lower charges for general banking services.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see that the OECD have proposed that Governments should re-examine the banks' position of exemption from competition law.  I think it is only fair that the banks should pay interest on customers' current accounts.  It is wrong that the banks should have use of this money free of charge.  They should pay interest to the customer.  For that reason I was happy to note that one of the British banks is now proposing to break ranks and to pay interest on current accounts.  I hope it will do so. The banks here should take note of this move and revise their rules on current accounts before they are compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>The three functions of government are: first, the efficient use of the resources of the country; secondly, an equitable distribution of wealth and income and, thirdly, to maintain economic activity and generate employment.  These are the essential functions of any government in a modern democracy.  The budget refers in particular to the second function&mdash;the equitable distribution of wealth and income and applies very much in relation to banks.</P>
    <P>Now that the immediate problem of the PAYE sector has been resolved, we must hope that the Government will get the full support of all in the promotion of better industrial relations.  The long and bitter industrial disputes, particularly in the public services, which we experienced last year did untold harm.  They undermined confidence and they slowed down the growth of industry and tourism apart from creating great personal problems.  Disputes of this magnitude <Col N="1995" /> must not be allowed to happen again.  I believe that the Taoiseach and his Ministers have much goodwill going for them and I am glad to note they are determined to improve the Government's image as an employer.  I am glad to say that in my home town, Navan, the long-established furniture industry has not had a strike for almost 30 years, and Navan Carpets have never had an official strike.  This is a credit to the employers and the workers and it could be copied by other towns.</P>
    <P>The budget was good but as a backbencher I must find some flaw in it. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to the major problems facing the carpet industry.  In recent months there has been large-scale dumping of British and American carpets on the Irish market and because of this Youghal Carpets have had to put their workers on a three-day week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am drawing attention to this matter is that the tax on carpets was increased from 20 to 25 per cent.  I am about to appeal to the Minister to consider making the carpet and furniture industries an area of their own because of the present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <P>Youghal Carpets have had to put their workers on a three-day week but fortunately Navan Carpets, who are part of the Youghal Group, have not been affected yet.  In view of the problems facing the carpet <Col N="1996" /> industry I ask the Minister to consider retaining the 20 per cent VAT that exists on home-produced carpets.  Irish carpets must be given every help to compete with imported carpets.  British carpets are subject to only 15 per cent VAT and if we do not give immediate help to our carpet industry they will find themselves in a non-competitive position.  Last Sunday I watched a television programme on BBC2 that dealt with the British carpet industry.  Although they pay only 15 per cent VAT they depicted the death of that industry because of American imports. If that is the situation in Britain, heaven help our carpet industry which has to pay 25 per cent VAT.  I hope the Minister will have a compassionate look at the situation.</P>
      <P>Much the same applies to the furniture industry which has been badly hit by imports. I should like to tell the House, and I shall be informing the Minister for Finance also, that imports of furniture have increased considerably in recent years.  In 1975 furniture imports were a mere £6.4 million but in 1979 that figure had escalated to the alarming figure of £25 million.  In respect of exports the following was the situation: £3.9 million in 1975 and the figure had increased in 1979 to only £8 million.  The gap between imports and exports of £17 million causes me some concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our manufacturers of carpets and furniture are at a disadvantage when compared with their British counterparts in that they have to pay VAT in two months' time from the date of invoice while the British manufacturers do not have to pay until the point of sale.  This gives our competitors a considerable advantage. This is important to me and to other furniture manufacturers in areas such as Monaghan, Dublin and Cork.  In County Meath some 1,800 people are employed in the furniture manufacturing industry.  It is unwise to ask them to compete unfairly against furniture subject to a lower VAT rating.  Nobody can properly describe furniture as a luxury. It is a necessity.  Everybody needs a bed to lie on, a chair to sit on and a table to eat from.  These are not luxury goods <Col N="1997" /> and should not be subject to the 5 per cent increase from 20 per cent to 25 per cent VAT.  I shall appeal to the Minister personally to reconsider that extra 5 per cent on carpets and furniture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke this morning about the state of the roads.  Our roads are not in as good a condition as we would like.  There are many complaints about them but it is fair to say that following the severe winter of 1978-79 and even the considerable rain we had earlier this year, there has been an exceptional deterioration in road surfaces.  The Minister for the Environment is arranging to have greater emphasis on essential repair work by carrying forward vigorously the programme of development for national roads.  The capital allocation for road construction and improvement works has been increased by over 45 per cent in two years.  Deputy Kelly this morning was comparing our roads after a hard winter in 1962 with our roads this year after our last hard winter.  I pointed out to him that our roads in 1962 were not carrying the traffic they are carrying today.  Our roads were not built for the type of traffic now using them, particularly since we joined the EEC.  It is hoped that the Government plan for the next decade by which it is intended to spend £1,000 million on the whole road system will bring them up to international standards.  Meantime, I realise that our people, our car owners are going through a difficult period because of this road deterioration.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that if the tax had not been taken off cars the roads would not be in their present state.  That is not true because if we still had the car tax in 1979 it would have brought in about £30 million.  If one considers that it takes about £40,000 to tarmacadam one mile of road one can see how far the £30 million would go in improving our road structure.</P>
    <P>There was also comment about the increase in population and the suggestion that we are not able to cope with the present population trend.  Everybody knows that if the 1976 census had not been <Col N="1998" /> postponed both local authorities and the national Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that and I know it is recognised by the Opposition that it was a mistake and all Governments make mistakes, but Deputy Pattison mentioned it in his speech.  It was a mistake that we are living with now. Hopefully, when we get all the results of the present census both local authorities and the national Government will be able to aim at the proper targets and get a proper assessment of the needs of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The three functions of modern democracy are to secure efficient use of our resources, equitable distribution of wealth and income and the maintenance of economic activity to generate employment. I believe that that is what this budget is all about.  It was said to me the other day by a man who has been paying taxes for 25 years that this is the best budget, the fairest and the most caring budget of his life.  It is a budget of which the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government can be justly proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Having sat here listening for a number of hours today and, indeed, having read in the past couple of weeks what has been said about the budget, one is at a loss to know where to start.  Having listened to Deputy Burke, Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, and to Deputy Fitzsimons, who has just spoken, in the case of the former, the Minister came in with a great script that he could have used at any consumer association meeting in the country.  He gave us reams and reams of figures concerning investigations done by the National Prices Commission and Priceline offices around the country and ended up by saying that Fianna Fáil saved the country £80 million odd in the past 12 months due to vigilance in the case of price increase demands.  That is a very naive and innocent expression for a <Col N="1999" /> man who knows well what the facts really are.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzsimons gave us a lecture on the evils of our banking system and, indeed, with some of what he said I fully concur.  About 18 months ago, when we were discussing the Consumer Information Bill, I spent about three-and-a-half hours one morning on this side of the House asking the Deputy's Minister to introduce some control over those same banks.  The Deputy's Minister however categorically refused to include the banks.  In fact, in case there would be any mistake or any misinterpretation of the particular section, he introduced a section in the Bill specifically excluding the banks from the provisions of that Bill, which is now the Consumer Information Act.  I suggest to the Deputy that he talk to his own people here on the front bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was asking for the nationalisation of banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Deputy who mentioned nationalisation.  I am telling the Deputy what his own Minister feels ought to be done and I suggest, through the Chair, that he talk to him.  I must compliment him on pointing out the less palatable aspects of the budget. Naturally, he was doing his own thing for Navan, which he is entitled to do, regarding the carpet and furniture industry. I fully agree with him that the increase from 20 per cent to 25 per cent in the VAT rating of what ought to be regarded as essential items is wrong and should not be allowed to happen.  The Deputy was very honest in standing up in the House and saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been treated to a run-down on the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the way in which all its promises have been implemented&mdash;in many instances with tongue in cheek.  The fact is that this budget does little to implement any outstanding promises made in that manifesto.  I shall deal with those as I come to them.  The verdicts on the budget are very mixed.  They range from a very guarded welcome in some cases <Col N="2000" /> to outright dissatisfaction in others.  The tax concessions referred to so eloquently by Fianna Fáil speaker after Fianna Fáil speaker under closer scrutiny do not turn out to be what people think they are.  One of the features of this budget, which we also found last year with the 1979 Budget, was that it took about six to nine months to find out what was in the damn thing and by Christmas 1979 the bulk of our people discovered that the 1979 Budget was something totally different from what it was supposed to be when announced in February.</P>
    <P>We now, this year, have a budget a month later than the ordinary budget time of recent years.  On budget evening there were thousands of people really convinced that they had after all shown that they had a bit of muscle when they marched in the street.  The PAYE sector were convinced that they had got something for their trouble.  On closer scrutiny, however, I find&mdash;and anybody who will sit down with pen and paper and calculate exactly what the real position is will find&mdash;that the so-called concessions are illusory.  Indeed, we should be grateful to the media who in many cases have gone to the trouble of telling us what the position is in the case of certain categories.  If one has an income over £15,000, £16,000, £20,000 a year one is quite happy, for two reasons to which I will refer later.  If one is in the lower income group it will be found that what one thinks one has got one has not got.  <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday, March 10, put it &ldquo;Sleight of hand magic in budget sums&rdquo;.  The particular gentleman who wrote that had no axe to grind with any party.  He was just giving factual information, in so far as the person earning £5,000 was concerned, under the old system and under the new.  It transpired that that person will be worse off in 1980 than he was in 1979.  If you are in the upper income executive bracket you are being looked after.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzsimons mentioned that the person earning £1,700 need pay no tax at all and that a married couple earning twice that amount will be shown to have no taxable income.  That is a true statement. <Col N="2001" /> Let me say that those people are caught by indirect taxation.  It has now been shown that, contrary to public accepted opinion in this matter, indirect taxation is not as equitable or as fair as it is said to have been.  It has been shown only in the last fortnight, on the day prior to Budget Day, 26 February, that indirect taxation applied across the board would cause much more hardship to the lower paid worker than to his higher paid counterpart simply because the lower paid person must spend a much higher proportion of his or her income on non-discretionary goods.</P>
    <P>This word &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; has taken on a new significance and has become very popular in the last few weeks.  In talking about non-discretionary and discretionary, these to me mean that the poor man must pay more for the essentials of life in the case of indirect taxation, whereas his counterpart in the higher income tax bracket can only eat one lunch anyway and sit on one chair at a time and will not spend the same proportion of his income through indirect taxation for the necessities of life. The application of indirect taxation can be shown to be detrimental to the social needs of a community in that it hits hardest at those who can bear the burden least of all&mdash;the unemployed and the lower paid worker.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of taxation of which much has been talked, and indeed, from which the Government have tried to reap any possible benefit for their own purposes, is this area of income splitting. The factual position is that, but for a case being taken to court and a judgment being made in a certain way against the Government of the day, this would never have been heard of.  The Minister is trying to make a virtue out of a necessity by pointing out the great fellow he is in introducing this, when in fact there was no option.  Even on that particular issue there are certain aspects of income splitting which are not too clear at the moment.  May I say this and hope that at some stage before this debate is over I shall get a reply to my query?  Heretofore a married couple who <Col N="2002" /> were working had the option of presenting their tax claims aggregated or as two individuals.  The normal procedure was in that case that at the end of the tax year the Revenue Commissioners adjusted the tax liability to ensure that both spouses got a fair deal.</P>
    <P>In other words, whether one presented one's tax assessment or one's allowances aggregated or as separate individuals one was told that it did not make one iota of difference overall and one paid no more and no less no matter which of the two systems one opted for.  At the end of the year if the wife did not use up all her allowances this was transferred to the husband's liability and he got the benefit of it to ensure that there was absolute equality.  If a couple now opt for income splitting and if at the end of the tax year one spouse finds that he or she has not availed of all the allowances due or if the other spouse is using an excessive amount of his or her taxable income or paying tax at a higher rate on an excessive amount, at the end of the year can the unclaimed benefits or allowances be transferred from one spouse to the other?  If that is not so, once you opt for income splitting you stand or fall separately on that issue.  Therefore, that is a very relevant point which ought to be answered before this debate is over.</P>
    <P>In this budget there is no content which I can find that would give any degree of importance to the idea of increasing our employment.  Since the new Taoiseach took over a few months back we have had a television appearance, an Ard Fheis speech, a budget and a contribution on the budget from the Taoiseach himself.  All in all it would seem that the job creation programme mentioned in the Fianna Fáil manifesto which was pursued persistently and consistently by his predecessor with a great degree of success has been abandoned since the new Taoiseach took over.  Only yesterday did he tell us, after having a meeting with the ICTU, that it was still the No. 1 priority in his Cabinet and within 24 hours he had told us that the problem in the North of this country was No. 1 priority.  You cannot have two No. <Col N="2003" /> 1 priorities.  The idea of cutting down our unemployment figures would seem to have been abandoned.  The youth employment scheme has been cut back drastically.  The work experience programme, again aimed at youth, has been cut back drastically.  We have the termination of the employment maintenance scheme.  All these are signs of not too great an interest in the problem of unemployment with all its attendant social evils.  The Taoiseach has stated that our young and growing population is a challenge, not a problem as other people would look upon the presence of young people in this country.  I put it to him that it is both a problem and a challenge and his budget does nothing to confront that problem or challenge.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat what has been said concerning education.  We have a cut-back in education.  Our school-building programmes have been cut back thereby causing a lesser effort in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Our school transport system must be cut back because there is no provision for extra money despite an inflation rate which will be in the neighbourhood of 20 per cent by the end of this year.  All this leads me to believe that we are not facing up to the challenge presented to us by the presence of such large numbers of young people in this country, despite what the Taoiseach has said.  On that we have had statements made about what we might and should be doing to meet the demand for employment in the future.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald, there is a shortage of specialist personnel in the field of technology.  We never had an industrial revolution here and possibly that is one of the reasons why our educational system has been oriented towards the academic rather than a technological side, but surely it is time to change that. We have a duty to start.  The only problem I see is that unless we put money now into this area we will be facing a new technological age&mdash;indeed we are facing it&mdash;without any degree of preparation whatever in the microprocessing <Col N="2004" /> area which is now upon us and which in itself will cause problems in certain areas of employment and also unemployment or layoffs at least.  One wonders if we can solve the problem at all at this stage.  What galls me more than anything is to sit or stand here and listen to people from the far side of the House telling us that we must prepare for this and do something about that. When that comes from members of a party who were in government in this country for 38 years of the last 60, it does not make sense.</P>

      <P>The appearance of the manifesto at a Fianna Fáil cumann meeting is the last thing Fianna Fáil want at this stage.  In that manifesto promises are made, some of which were fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980 we in the local authorities are facing a crucial stage in our development and this budget and the capital programme published prior to the budget do nothing to help us out of the dilemma in which we find outselves.  There is a cutback in the development of roads, a cutback in water and sewerage and so on.  The next speaker from that side will say that we have had an increase of x per cent but the fact is that the increase will not cover the inflationary spiral.  We have a problem that developed last year because of last year's budget which abolished the facilities for the recoupment of VAT by local authorities on materials purchased.  This was a grave imposition on all local authorities and this year we have repeated the dose.  This in effect means that local authorities have not the money they need to carry <Col N="2005" /> out the work which it is their function to carry out.  In the past couple of months the house improvement grant was withdrawn and page 27 of the manifesto, paragraph No. 6, says that:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will introduce a new scheme for house improvement grants.</P>
    <P>I am a politician and I am all for getting votes at election time, but there is a stage beyond which one does not go to purchase votes.  If one makes a promise to get votes it is not realistic to expect people to accept any argument for the abolition of that facility two years later. Paragraph 11 of the manifesto, under the heading &ldquo;Local Government&rdquo; says that:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will reorganise Local Authority structures so that everyone can better participate in decisions affecting their own community and play their part in the development of local initiatives.</P>
    <P>For me to play my part as a member of the local authority in the development of the local authority all I am looking for is money, and that I am not getting.  To jog the memory of some people who might be prepared to disagree with me, in 1976 the total allocation to local authorities showed an increase of 22 per cent on the previous year and in 1977 it showed an increase of 38 per cent on the previous year.  But in 1978, after the first Fianna Fáil budget, that 38 per cent increase was reduced to a 14 per cent increase and in 1979 that further fell to a 10 per cent increase, while in 1980 we have levelled off and are now in full flight with a 10 per cent increase when on the admission of the Taoiseach last week we are probably talking about a 20 per cent inflation rate this year.  The Taoiseach took Deputy Dr. FitzGerald to task for even mentioning that it might be 22 per cent.  There is not much difference between 22 per cent and 20 per cent when we are talking about a 10 per cent increase. Unfortunately, the likelihood is that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is right. Deputy Dr. FitzGerald was taken to task in 1979 for saying what he said <Col N="2006" /> about the figures produced in the budget. He was publicly castigated and told that he was not acting in the best interests of the country in the presence of our international colleagues in the EEC.  But he was right and the Minister of the day got it wrong.  For that reason I tend to lean towards the figure mentioned by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald in his assessment of the inflationary content inherent in the budget.</P>
    <P>We were told at a local authority meeting recently that we had received our allocation for roads this year and it transpired to be a 5 per cent increase on last year.  That is from a party who produced a document last year entitled &ldquo;A Road Development Plan for the Eighties.&rdquo;  There is no money to implement that plan.  Local authorities will not be in a position to carry out their functions. I am not proud of the fact that my local authority this year, calculating on the basis of the allocation, will be unable to meet their statutory demands from other authorities like the Office of Public Works and the health boards.  That is not due to mismanagement of funds but due to a shortage of funds.  They cannot meet their own statutory requirements and that money will be deducted from next year's allocation before they get it, so it will have a cumulative effect and we will be worse off next year.</P>
    <P>On budget night some commentator in the excited atmosphere of a television studio described the budget as an energy conscious budget.  I found that totally absent in the budget.  It may have other characteristics, one could describe it with certain adjectives, but certainly it cannot be described as an energy conscious budget.  We are all at a loss to know what may be said this year about energy conservation.  One Minister withdrew a grant that was available for conversion to a system of solid fuel heating while a colleague of his on the same day was talking about the importance of conserving energy.  This energy conscious budget increased the VAT rating on insulation from 20 to 25 per cent.  In other words, an item such as a cylinder jacket would cost more because <Col N="2007" /> of the increase in the VAT rate.  It should be remembered that there are in the region of 800,000 houses here and that one-third of them are said to be properly insulated.  In that event more than half of our modern houses need an improved form of insulation, but an energy conscious Government in their energy conscious budget increased the VAT rating on an item that would help to conserve some energy and cut down our imported fuel bill.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us that the budget represented a new approach and that a new start was being made.  Deputy Fitzsimons described the budget as a caring one and told us that it bore the stamp of social justice.  Such clichés sound fine but they do not mean anything when one looks at the subject matter to which they refer.  The Taoiseach told us that budget represented a new beginning but I have yet to find any substantial philosophical change in approach.  There is a gesture here and there, a reaction to pressures which came during 1979 and an increase in the allowance to PAYE taxpayers of £400 above and beyond those given to other taxpayers.  However any benefit accruing from that will soon disappear and the PAYE sector will be back for more.</P>
    <P>The most amusing aspect in relation to the debate was the performance of Deputy O'Donoghue last week.  I found it amusing but not for the reasons one might think.  The Taoiseach and his Government have tried to put as much of the light of day between themselves and the manifesto and the subsequent implementation of it, in so far as it has been implemented.  But Deputy O'Donoghue stated categorically last week that the budget represented a continuation of what he was suggesting last year and the year before.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, in Cork last week-end pointed out the same thing. Surely those people know what they are talking about.  They have not seen any great change, any new approach, any substantial deviation from the well-worn path of Fianna Fáil Government after <Col N="2008" /> Fianna Fáil Government in their approach to budgetary matters.</P>
    <P>It is well known that that was the last thing the Taoiseach and his Government wanted to hear.  It would have suited them better had they been able to convince our people that the budget represented a new approach, that much philosophical head-scratching went into its preparation.  But the truth is that nothing has changed.  We have the same approach as before, the same stumbling from crisis to crisis, the same reaction to the same predictable action.  The overriding factor in all of this&mdash;this is the serious aspect of the budget&mdash;is that as time goes on and as this approach is adopted year after year the gap between the haves and the have-nots will continue to widen.  That is the most serious result of what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that inflation and indirect taxation combined adversely affect the poorer man more than the rich person.  Therefore, the gap will continue to widen.  Some Government will have to tackle this problem.  Despite their assertion that they are doing new things, that they are a caring Government with a social conscience, the Government are not capable of tackling that problem.</P>
    <P>Following the weekend sessions at Barrettstown Castle, the series of pre-budget discussions with different groups and the inviting of submissions, I expected the Minister to introduce something fresh and new in the budget.  I expected him to break new ground in our economic and fiscal policies, but nothing has changed.  The comments on the budget of independent agencies throw some light on what it means to them and to our people.  I respect the views of those people who have long experience in the field of finance.  Some of them are well-known stockbrokers in this city. They have cast some doubt on the veracity of figures given in the budget and have come up with some rather stunning calculations.  The prediction that 1981 will probably be a tighter year financially than 1980 is agreed on by all those people who have commented on <Col N="2009" /> the budget.  In this regard I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> if March, 1980:</P>
    <P>Goodbody and Wilkinson, stockbrokers, estimated that the final total could drift up to £950 million&mdash;not as bad an upwards drift as the £230 million seen in 1979&mdash;but an upwards adjustment nevertheless.</P>
    <P>They are talking about the borrowing requirements. The comment by J. &amp; E. Davy, stockbrokers, as reported in the same newspaper is even more to the point.  They estimated that:</P>
    <P>... when account is taken of the £100 million in lost tax revenue in 1979 (to be retrieved this year) the real 1979 borrowing requirement was 12.3% of GNP, rather than the 13.7% actual figure quoted by Mr. O'Kennedy.  As a consequence the 1980 EBR would really fall to only 11.6% rather than the 10.4% actual level talked about in the budget.  So the real year to year deflationary cut was more like 0.4 percentage points of GNP rather than the 3.3 points suggested by the nominal figures.</P>
    <P>These are comments from people who have no axe to grind and who are merely bringing their expertise to bear on figures they find before them.  What they have to say makes very stunning reading.</P>
    <P>One might ask at this stage what impact, either for good or for evil, the budget will have on the economy.  Industrialists have reacted in a mixed way to the provisions of the budget.  They point out that the action taken to reverse our borrowing trends may not be sufficient to have the desired effect.  One fact that most people might find stunning is that, despite the so-called cut-backs in capital expenditure, Government spending has increased compared with last year.  In 1979 there was spent by the Government 53.6 per cent of GNP.  That included salaries and so on and was broken down between current and capital expenditure as follows: 39.5 per cent current expenditure and 14.1 per cent capital expenditure.  In the current <Col N="2010" /> year there is an increase on the 1979 figure from 53.6 to 54.6 per cent of which 41 per cent is current expenditure and 13.6 per cent is capital expenditure. We all know that last year the problems arose on the current expenditure side, that it was on that side that the massive miscalculation of £213 million took place.  But it would seem that there has not been any effort made to cut back on the percentage of GNP spent by way of current expenditure while, as has been said already from these benches, an increase in capital expenditure where it would have some beneficial effect in the form of job creation, for instance, might be excused.  One must question the mix which this budget throws up in relation to advantages in terms of job creation and in terms of capital input into the country.</P>
    <P>On industry in general, the reactions to the increases in oil prices were predictable but the position is that these increases will cost industry in the region of an extra £46 million.  It is estimated that the petrol price increases will cost £20 million while heating oil will cost an extra £16 million and that the other oils used will cost about an extra £10 million. Therefore, we are talking about a bill for industry of the order of £46 million and this must be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, saw fit to give us a long dissertation on what a barrel of Arabian light oil cost in 1973 and what it costs today.  Of course, one would expect massive increases in that time.  I had that information at my disposal but when I asked the Minister to tell me what impact the increases had on our inflation figure, he ignored my question. However, I am asking again for this information in the hope of being given an answer.  What impact have fuel price increases had in 1979 on the 16 per cent inflation rate experienced by the end of the year?  If we had this figure we would know the degree to which there was inflation over which we had control. We are being told constantly by the Government that we cannot control inflation because of our necessity to import all our energy needs, that either we <Col N="2011" /> pay the increased prices or we do without the fuel.  That is a misleading and naive assertion.  A statement in the manifesto asserts that the then Government were responsible for at least 80 per cent of the inflation which took place in 1979.  The statement at page 10 of the manifesto is:</P>
    <P>Government policy must be directed towards discouraging increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control or influence.  This policy has been absent in the last four years.</P>
    <P>No doubt that was a reference to the 1973-1977 period.  It is conspicuous by its absence at the moment and has been since 1977.</P>
    <P>In regard to industry's reaction to the budget, the result of a survey was published in last week's <i>Business and Finance</i> and in turn it was publicised in the daily newspapers.  It stated, in the headline, that 75 per cent of businessmen were happy with the budget provisions. It transpired that Irish Market Surveys had done a survey among 92 chief executives, and the survey gave their reaction. I assume they were PAYE people like ourselves in the House, but to get an accurate picture of actual reactions to the budget one would have to know how many of the 92 were factory owners, self-employed people, as against chief executives. If that had been done I am sure the 75 per cent would have been reduced drastically.  Two of the reasons given by the people interviewed who were gratified were that the tax bands were favourable and that the indirect nature of the increased taxation also was to their benefit&mdash;two things which are anathema to the lower paid workers who either cannot avail of or are the victims of these provisions.</P>
    <P>The budget has not tried to break new ground.  There is no underlying philosophy in it which is in any way new. It certainly does not contain the stamp of social justice which it is supposed to have according to the Taoiseach.  I will give an example of what I would regard as social justice.  In 1977 the age for qualification for the old age pension was <Col N="2012" /> 66 years.  At that time there was a means test which ignored the first £6 of income. That is still £6 and the qualifying age is still 66 years.  Not by one day or one penny has it been changed.  If we are to judge the budget by its stamp of social justice it fails.  It will be seen to be a budget for the rich man and if he is to be a given increased income somebody else must lose.  The only category I know who will lose are the poor.  Through this budget they are the people who will once again subsidise the rich.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that never before had a budget been so well predicted as this.  I believe that is so because of the open nature of the Government and because of the figures released before the budget on the housekeeping of the Government in 1979, a most difficult year for the economy.  Because of the pre-budget estimates made available by the Department of Finance, because Fianna Fáil laid their cards on the table, every thinking person was aware of the nation's financial state and its needs.  Consequently, most individuals were able to foresee what must be done to continue the progress begun by Fianna Fáil in 1977. On 27 February the newspapers were able to forecast fairly accurately that there would be cuts in the amount of tax payable by the PAYE workers, that there would be increases in social welfare benefits and that as a result there would be increases in indirect taxation.</P>
      <P>However, the predictions of most people outside the House, and of the Opposition within, were far from fully accurate.  The fact that the Minister cut PAYE by a much greater margin than Fine Gael or Labour expected or ever dreamed of doing themselves took their breath away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the words of the Taoiseach this budget is a landmark on the road to achieving equity in taxation.  When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition in 1976 the need to cut income tax, with particular reference to married couples, was outlined in Fianna Fáil's economic document of that year.  This was further <Col N="2013" /> highlighted in the 1977 manifesto.  In 1978 the Government committed themselves to income splitting and in this budget they take another step to affirm Fianna Fáil's commitment on income tax.  Therefore, the budget proves that we mean business in that respect.  The manifesto promises are being delivered irrespective of what the Opposition say, and they are being delivered on time.  As a result of this fair budget and its concessions in regard to income tax, many families are considerably better off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i>: In the time alloted to me I should like to deal with the Minister's amendment.  It was amusing to hear the Minister of State talking about the country living beyond its means, about housing <Col N="2014" /> grants being given without regard to the means of the beneficiaries and about such grants being spent on sun parlours, playrooms and the conversion of garages. It was amusing to hear what he said having regard to the history of Fianna Fáil in relation to these grants.</P>
      <P>Under the National Coalition Government of which I was a member reconstruction and new house grants were available subject to a means test which could be revised at any time according as the country could afford it. The record shows that in 1977 some 12,209 house improvement grants and 12,561 water and sewerage grants were paid to applicants who really needed assistance.  The general election came and, in order to curry favour with the electorate, Fianna Fáil opened the floodgates and abolished the means test. They said grants would be available for new houses, for reconstruction and for water and sewerage services without regard to the means of the applicant. This was in line with their decision to derate without regard to the means of the rated occupiers and with their decision to remove car tax without regard to the means of the beneficiaries.  As a result, in 1979 some 30,298 house improvement grants were paid at a higher rate regardless of the means of the applicants. The grants were paid to all and sundry, including the highest income groups in the country.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State has put on record, the grants were given in order to provide in many cases sun parlours and playrooms.  They were given to provide for the conversion of garages and for the addition of other luxuries to houses already adequate for those living in them.  It is interesting to note that between 1977 and 1979 there was no significant increase in the number of water and sewerage grants paid because the people who rushed in to swell the house improvement grant applications from 11,000 to 30,000 already had bathroom and toilet facilities in their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now two-and-a-half years after this <Col N="2015" /> Santa-like bonanza of grants for all, house improvement grants and grants in respect of water and sewerage facilities have been withdrawn completely.  Now the most humble citizen will not get even £1 to help towards the cost of reconstruction, modernisation or the addition of bathroom and toilet facilities. However, grants for new houses continue to be paid to people with incomes of £15,000, £20,000 or £30,000.  That is what the Minister of State calls redeployment of public funds.  That is what he asks this House to welcome and approve.</P>
    <P>It was disgraceful to withdraw grants when the number of local authority houses has dropped and when the average cost of providing a new house has risen from £12,234 to £24,065.  It was a disgrace to withdraw grants that enabled the life of modest houses to be prolonged or to be converted to more comfortable dwellings.  The price of a new house has put it beyond the reach of the average person.  The stage has been reached when very many partially built houses can be seen throughout the country because the people cannot get the money to finance them.  This is not a redeployment of finances.  It is withdrawing grants that were available for many years to pay for money borrowed by this Government to implement the extravagant promises that got them into power.</P>
    <P>The amendment put down by the Government, which I invite the House to reject, is in line with the budget that has shifted the burden of taxation from the better off to the less well off.  That is exactly what has been done with regard to house improvement grants.  These grants were available under the National Coalition Government on a regulated basis so that those in need of them would get them.  In 1977 Fianna Fáil had to do something dramatic to get back into office and it was easy to offer grants to all and sundry.  It was easy of offer to remove car tax and to derate houses irrespective of the income of the people concerned.  Now we hear the Minister <Col N="2016" /> talk about the country living beyond its means, about giving benefits to people regardless of a means test.</P>
    <P>The memory of this Government is very short.  It was interesting to hear Deputy O'Donoghue saying here the other day that there is no change in policy, that it is the same policy that was introduced in 1977 and was being implemented all along.  We have the Taoiseach trying to pretend that there was a change of policy.  In order to demonstrate that, he abolishes Deputy O'Donoghue's Department and throws him out along with it.  Then you have Deputy O'Donoghue coming in here and giving the Taoiseach what I think is a kiss of death by saying: &ldquo;It is the same old party, the same old Government and the same old policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whether new or old, this is a retrograde step.  It attacks the less well off.  It attacks small farmers who are not entitled to the benefit of the local authorities' housing lists, who cannot provide new houses for themselves, but who want to add water and sewerage facilities or additional bedrooms to make their homes more comfortable.  They are not to get a penny.  The grants that were enjoyed for several years are being withdrawn.  This is a tax on people who buy their houses from the local authorities and in that way save local authorities the cost of repairs.  If they then want to add some comfort to the houses they have got they will not get one penny.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us he has increased the loans.  He has, but if people want to avail of a small loan to do these repairs it will cost them at least £10 a week over 30 years and that would only cover modest repairs.  The Minister expects to be clapped on the back for that just as he expects to be complimented for his £12,000 loan which will cost £35 a week, which may surprise Deputy Flynn.</P>
    <P>I condemn the withdrawal of these grants as a retrograde step when new houses are beyond the reach of citizens and at a time when the Government should be encouraging people to improve existing houses and prolong the life of them.  This is not a deployment of <Col N="2017" /> resources but a withdrawal of resources from the needy and a continuation of the policy of providing resources and grants to people in the upper income group who could do without them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of dealing with the motion in the name of Deputy Quinn and supported by his Fine Gael partners.  There is no need to go further than what the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, said last evening; but, in the interests of accuracy and to refute some of the misleading statements made by the Opposition on that occasion, I am tempted to speak.  We certainly have the prophets of doom and gloom about since the budget. What I have heard in favour of this motion can be loosely termed a load of political slapstick designed to lead astray even the most innocent.  I can only refer to it as a hodge-podge of pious hopes on the part of the Opposition parties who are trading on fear that they would like to engender in the minds of all and sundry, trading on ambiguity, half truths. misrepresentation, misquotation and mental reservations&mdash;the whole ambit of mental figure juggling in the hope that they would mislead innocent people. People are not as gullible as Opposition spokesmen seem to think.  That is why I am trying to put the record straight on some of the misleading statements made last evening on behalf of the joint Opposition parties.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat taken aback by Deputy Quinn.  From him I expected a more effective and properly researched contribution on the motion.  I was surprised because he has considerable talent and has displayed it on many motions which I have had the privilege of hearing debated.  In this case, no.  For some mysterious reason he dealt in wild statements, sweeping generalities, and that is why it is necessary that somebody should refute such statements in case the general public might be misled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to a point studiously ignored by both Deputy Quinn and Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The decision to dismantle the house improvement <Col N="2018" /> grants scheme was not taken as a panic measure by the Government and it was not dictated by the Minister for Finance. It was a comprehensive policy statement on behalf of the Government deploying available finances in this year for the benefit of people most in need.  The resources are being made available to the deserving sector.  Only for that reason has this change taken place.  This was explained clearly and concisely by the new Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly.  I take the opportunity to congratulate him on his elevation to that office.  Since coming to it he has shown that he has the talent and capacity to deal effectively with all matters relating to housing.  The Minister gave the explanations, but in case anybody should be misled by the Opposition it is only right that some matters should be repeated for the enlightenment and information of the public generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn and Deputy Fitzpatrick and their colleagues since I have been in this House have been crying out for an increase in the money available for local authority housing. They have also been seeking an increase in the eligibility limit for housing loans&mdash;increases on all sides.  What did we get in the last few months from Fianna Fáil and particularly in the immediate past?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A new Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We got all those increases, and I am glad that Deputy Quinn reminds that we also have a new Taoiseach.  These improvements have all been granted in the recent past and I would have thought that Deputy Quinn would have the courtesy to admit that the increases and improvements he and his friends were demanding for the past year or 18 months had been forthcoming and say that at least that much had been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically £8 million extra is being made available this year for local authority housing and some £12 million <Col N="2019" /> extra to fund increased loans for the purpose of repair loans advanced by local authorities.  Income elegibility has been increased enormously.  A few short years ago it was not quite like that.  Since we came back to office in 1977 we have raised the loan limit from £4,500 to £12,000.  I did not hear anybody say that was enormous, but I will state it on behalf of the people who have to look for loans for the provision of houses.  The income limit has risen from £2,000 to £5,500 in a few short years.</P>
    <P>Was that the way it was before that? Not on your life.  We had a situation where the Coalition Government brought in an income limit of £1,950, a means test to deprive people of the opportunity of getting money to build their own houses.  That is surely a fine socialistic idea.  Pseudo-socialists, I would call the whole lot of them.  They are better fitted for bars in the Royal Yachting Clubs than for sitting on socialist benches as far as I am concerned, but be that as it may.  It might well be worth mentioning that when the Coalition Government were in power and had these limits in force, there was many a poor devil down the country who could not get this loan despite the fact that he was the holder of a medical card.  His income was too high for him to qualify for these fine loans and grants made available by the Coalition Government during their term of office.</P>
    <P>The Government feel that these measures are necessary at this time to bring some balance into the situation of people providing their own homes.  The Deputies opposite will give the impression that house improvement grants were being abondoned completely.  That is the impression that they would like to go abroad, that somehow, in one fell swoop Fianna Fáil have disregarded all applications for housing grants and withdrawn all improvement grants.  The Minister of State last night pointed out quite clearly that that is not so.  An important section of the grant will encourage the provision of group water and sewerage schemes, the carrying out of essential housing repairs for elderly <Col N="2020" /> people, people in rural cottages, people suffering from certain mental and physical handicaps.  All those people are being accommodated at this time, which shows that what Deputy Quinn had to say in his opening remarks is totally untrue. He suggested that it was the first time in Irish politics that grants had been withdrawn completely from the Irish scene.  He talked about tradition.  He had better pay attention to the tradition of his party&mdash;of which he was not, I agree, a front bench member&mdash;which overnight withdrew the facility for people making applications for grants during their term of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn is a very effective speaker who would have brought tears even to my eyes when he started talking last evening about bad and overcrowded conditions that the people would have to suffer because of the termination of this home improvement grant.  He said that we will end up in a situation where there will be no housing stock suitable for living in at all because of this move by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I really believe that he was not sincere when he suggested that.  The fact of the matter is that the maximum improvement grant available up to last February was £600.  I ask Deputy Quinn how far that £600 would go in dealing with a total estimate for restoring a house.  Would it restore a house completely, put on a few new rooms, a bathroom and all the other connections needed to bring this housing stock up to what he would like?  Does he realise that the average estimated cost of doing these improvement jobs is between £1,500 and £2,000?  Is he suggesting that £600 would go a long way, or is he saying that the poor people he was crying about last night would have the rest of the money over and above the £600 to make up the balance, on average, of £1,400?  I say no.</P>
    <P>We went a great deal further in that regard than the £200 unsecured loan which applied when Deputy Tully was Minister in the Department of the Environment, but that is water under the bridge now.  We, instead, have brought about a situation where individuals can <Col N="2021" /> have a £4,000 loan to do a decent job, if such is required, and that they would pay for it with their own savings and with the help of this SDA loan.  If they so choose, they can have an unsecured loan of £1,000.  Is not this a much better way of doing business?  Surely grants are only provided in situations where people have no other funds available to them?</P>
    <P>Take some of the figures, as far as that is concerned&mdash;and I am going to do that, because Deputy Fitzpatrick last night had a book in his hand of which I took due note and went and made one available to myself.  It is a most interesting document, and the Deputy should not have brought it into the House because if anything is going to put a nail in the coffin of the Opposition's motion this evening, it is this particular document.  The reference is the quarterly bulletin of the housing statistics, for the quarter 31 December. In this, it gives a total breakdown of all applications through the Department over the years.  It is interesting to note that the total improvement grants approved and paid for since 1972 worked out at 225,666 grants.  There were water and sewerage grants in the sum of £180,559 and new houses in that period were 249,142&mdash;most of them because of good Fianna Fáil housing policy&mdash;leaving a grand total of 655,367.  I should like Deputy Quinn to remember that figure, which is going to be very relevant to something I have to say later on.</P>
    <P>Last night, Deputies Quinn and Fitzpatrick, in unison, implied that there was a serious lack of sanitary facilities in this country.  I was disappointed to hear those two people speaking in that way on that particular subject.  They would like to lead people astray.  Are they aware of the position at all?  Deputy Fitzpatrick was talking with his tongue in his cheek when he mentioned hundreds&mdash;and I quote&mdash;hundreds of local authority houses, in towns, which lack water and sewerage facilities.  That may apply in County Cavan, and maybe the local authority houses up there do not have these facilities.  I can assure the House that, to my certain knowledge, it <Col N="2022" /> does not apply in the county which I represent.  Perhaps it is poor representation by the Cavan Deputy which has brought this about&mdash;I do not know.</P>
    <P>The total national housing stock could be summed up at around 880,000 units of houses.  It is estimated that about 90 per cent of all those units of housing have piped water supply and that about 86 per cent have flush toilet facilities. That is a far cry from what Deputy Fitzpatrick was trying to lead us astray with last night.  I bring this to the attention of the House, because the other figure I have mentioned is 655,367 new houses, reconstructed houses, since 1977.  There is a sharp difference between those two figures.  When you add on all the applications in Minister Connolly's office for improvement grants this year and all the group water schemes applied for and approved by Minister Connolly, and add them on to that figure of 655,367, you are not too far short of the 880,000 houses in the country's total.  If we were to take some of the mansions that would not be included in that at all and some of the castles in the sky that Deputy Quinn and his friends are living in, all their lives, virtually the whole housing stock has been looked after by improvement grants, housing loans and other loans made available by the Fianna Fáil Government over the years.  Bear that in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 10,944 was an all-time record.  When Deputy Fitzpatrick is talking about putting flush toilets and water into houses he might bear in mind that the record of Fianna Fáil is the one to be envied in that regard.  The only reason the figure has been reached is because of the policy of providing those facilities to people.  That goes back to a Fianna Fáil Government in 1959.  That is why that has come about in the intervening years.  The people are grateful to Fianna Fáil for that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> During the past 20 years 327,733 new houses were built representing 37 per cent of the total housing stock at present. During that period, 414,209 houses were grant approved so far as improvement grant were concerned.  There are a further 75,000 improvement grant applications for new houses on hand.  In other words, 817,000 houses or 93 per cent of the total housing stock is modern, is being or will be improved. That is some record, and it is fair to say that it is time to call it a day as far as giving improvement grants is concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a remark made by Deputy Quinn, and I hope he will understand that there is nothing personal in what I have to say.  I do not like referring in these terms to him or to any contribution he makes, but I will have to be excused on this occasion.  He made the prediction that small builders would be bankrupt by the score by the removal of these improvement grants.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Deputy Quinn knows full well that when the Coalition were in power public capital expenditure affecting the building industry dropped by 5 per cent in 1973 and 1974, a further 8 per cent in 1975 and a further 6.5 per cent in 1976.  Very interesting.  As a result of that the building industry was in a shambles until such time as we came back to power.  It has only since recovered the ground lost in those years.  Output dropped by 1 per cent in 1974 and 7 per cent in 1975 and that resulted in nearly 12,000 good union cardholders losing their jobs while the Coalition were in power.</P>
    <P>Since we resumed office in 1977 one of our primary concerns was to put the building industry back on an even keel. Output in the industry increased by about 28 per cent and direct and indirect employment increased by almost 13,000 persons in those two years.  People in the building industry and their associates have always felt the only way they could be sure of a job was to make sure Fianna Fáil were in power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned the fact that <Col N="2024" /> about 80 per cent of builders are small builders.  It was the only vital statistic of his whole performance that was accurate. I congratulate him on it.  He pulled that figure out of the bag and got it right.  I agree that about 80 per cent of them are small builders.  He might have gone a little further if he was being genuinely fair in pulling out the figure by saying that while 80 per cent of the builders registered with AnCO employ up to ten people the employment given by them accounts for only 22 per cent of the workforce.  I am sure the Deputy is only too well aware that most of the jobs done to qualify for the house improvement grants, because of those figures, can only have been done as nixers. Would I be right?  If most of those improvement jobs were carried out by that kind of individual I find it hard to see how the Deputy could be supporting that kind of action seeing that it would be against the best wishes and rules of the unions involved, against the best wishes of employers, employees and taxpayers. It was just another figure dropped nicely which could be misinterpreted and lead astray even the most elite, and that is why it must be repudiated.</P>
    <P>The Government have on more than one occasion displayed their concern for the welfare of people employed in the building industry.  Despite the present economic difficulties&mdash;there is no denying they are there&mdash;the public investment in building has been increased substantially. The public capital programme estimated at present at £1,154 million was a 15 per cent increase on the 1979 figure.  The capital which goes directly or indirectly into the building industry was not just increased by 15 per cent, it was increased by 18 per cent, and that figure is not out of a hat.  It represents £722 million under the capital programme that will benefit the building industry.</P>

      <P>Somebody asked how things would be affected in County Mayo.  In 1973 in County Mayo 446 houses were completed, and that in a county that had a housing crisis until it was relieved by Fianna Fáil.  Last year we had the fine figure of 1,093.  In 1975 the number of local authority dwellings completed was 124.  I do not have to say who was in power at that time.  Last year it was 310.  I have given a figure for disabled persons' grants which has been supported by a caring Fianna Fáil Government over the years.  In 1973 and 1974 as far as the whole country was concerned the value of them was £64,059.  What was it last year?  Three-quarters of a million pounds, and Mayo benefited to the extent of £100,000 from those as far as that was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made last evening&mdash;to which I took great exception&mdash;about the question of exclusion of the public from O'Connell Bridge House.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was criticising the temporary closure of the building as far as telephones and everything else were concerned. From the viewpoint of selfish political capital-making, no doubt he would welcome the chaos and delays, the continuing public frustration and intolerable pressures on the staff.  Of course that is what he would like; I know that.  He would like those intolerable pressures because I suppose there would be something political to be made of it. He would like pressures on the staff; he would like frustration on the staff; he would like them all to have nervous breakdowns, I take it, in O'Connell <Col N="2026" /> Bridge House.  But I regard what Minister Connolly did as good administrative procedure in the circumstances in which he found himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that that is inaccurate also and did not happen. In fairness to the Minister that should go on the public record.  The consequence of the closure is simply that no grant applicant is being in any way victimised. Letters of inquiry will be dealt with.  The staff will concentrate on having them replied to in the shortest possible time.  How could they attempt to do so if there was continuous interference by telephones and by every type of individual caller at present?  As far as that situation was concerned no alternative solution was put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  That is typical of the Opposition. They can go around Minister-bashing, Government-bashing, Department-bashing, but not a single alternative emanated from Deputy Fitzpatrick in regard to the situation in which Minister Connolly found himself a couple of weeks ago in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record also that the staff in O'Connell Bridge House did long continuous periods of overtime, some of it not paid for, for which they got no credit except being bashed about because people could not have their telephone calls answered.  I want to go on record, on behalf of Minister Connolly <Col N="2027" /> and myself, that those people should be congratulated.  They deserve great credit.  They also deserve being afforded that little amount of time in which to cope with the enormous problem that descended on them a few weeks ago.</P>

      <P>Nobody in Dáil éireann is likely to demand higher taxation or increased Government borrowing simply to restore the house improvement grant. Given the real limitations on public funds for housing this year would the Deputies who have subscribed their great names to this motion genuinely press for the diversion of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money from those people who have the initiative and who are prepared to add their own hard-earned savings to SDA loans in order to house themselves?  Is that what they are suggesting at present?  Would those same Deputies honestly prefer to see the money going on free grants to persons already housed without regard to their economic circumstances?</P>

Would they like a reversion to the means test?  Would they like a reversion to the cutback overnight?  I suggest they would not.</P>

    <P>I am putting on record that what was done was in the best interests of the common good at this time.  Minister Connolly is to be congratulated on the efficient way in which he dealt with this <Col N="2028" /> matter last evening and I ask the House to throw out this motion.</P>

      <P>I was interested to hear a Mayo man making the comments he made here this evening.  There was a survey carried out in this country by a Fianna Fáil Government approximately ten years ago in order to ascertain the number of really bad houses there were and the number needing repair.  There were found to be more houses in County Mayo in very bad state of repair, many unhabitable, and this after approximately 15 or 16 years of continuous Fianna Fáil rule. Fianna Fáil did nothing about it.  The Deputy referred to the number of houses built in 1973.  I should point out that until there was a change of Government houses were not built in the west.  If the Deputy cares to look up the records he will see that the first large number of houses built all over the west commenced in 1974, because it was the 1973 budget introduced by Fianna Fáil that governed the number of houses built in 1973.  I would not expect the Deputy to know that; he has not been long enough here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in regard to housebuilding was that when we took over in 1973 we were confronted by one very serious problem.  That serious <Col N="2030" /> problem was that the Fianna Fáil Government in office beforehand&mdash;in addition to the houses erected many years before which had fallen into disrepair&mdash;had decided on a type of local authority house which had got into such disrepair that we had to spend millions on top of millions all over the country in order to render them habitable.  Indeed, thousands of them had not even the basic necessity of a fireplace.  But, of course, they were only for workers; they would be occupied by working class people so the attitude was: what did it matter?  Fianna Fáil were not interested then and are not interested now in that type of housing.  Therefore we had to spend a lot of money which could have been spent on other things, endeavouring to render those houses habitable.  Unfortunately we did not succeed with all of them.  I notice Fianna Fáil Deputies from the west now have questions down to the new Minister&mdash;some of them who were in office a few months ago but who having gone out of office have become very interested in knowing if it is proposed to make grants available for certain repairs to some of those houses that have not been finished.  It is very interesting, and illustrates the change that can take place in a movement from one side of the House to the other.</P>
      <P>Continuous reference has been made here to the time when a means test was applied to reconstruction and repair grants.  I was responsible for the implementation of that means test because I felt then, and still feel, that people who are sufficiently wealthy should undertake their own house repairs, and that there should be as much money as possible made available to those who have not the necessary money.  I make no apology to anybody for doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What have we now?  We have Fianna Fáil in their election manifesto saying they were going to introduce a new scheme.  As late as January of this year there were suggestions of some type of new housing <Col N="2031" /> regulations being brought in with regard to repairing houses.  Next we have the Minister for the Environment going down to Clare, his own constituency, saying a few words, handling in a brief, telling them to read it and to watch the nine o'clock news and getting out of it as fast as he could because he knew, as we know, that thousands of people are living in bad houses and will never be able to repair them if they have to depend on their own resources.  It is all right for people with their pockets full of money to talk about being able to do repairs yourself. It is a grand thing to be able to hold up your head and say &ldquo;My house has to be repaired and I am going to do it myself and I do not want State funds&rdquo;. The people who have not got the money necessary to do that must turn to the State.  The last Deputy to speak was sneering at the idea of people feeling that £600 was of some use to them.  I assumed from the way he was talking that he never felt that £600 was a lot of money, but to a man with a wife and four or five kiddies living in the country on £50 or £60 per week who, because his house is not big enough, wants to add on a little bit of additional accommodation, £500 or £600 is a lot of money to get from the State.  Fianna Fáil in their usual way have decided that that is not to be done.  Those people do not count, therefore they do not get the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn apparently succeeded in getting a lot of statistics.  Statistics can be thrown around the place and you can make them work in any way you like&mdash;lies, damn lies and statistics.  The trouble is that for the ordinary person most people do not know what is meant by them.  Most people do not get the document from which Deputy Flynn was quoting, and if they had it they would not understand it except with the aid of somebody like himself who is paid by the State.  It is the job of people like him and me to see that they understand what is in such documents and, therefore, we would know, but the ordinary person does not.  What ordinary people do know is that they are going to have a job done which will cost a certain <Col N="2032" /> amount of money.  They can borrow a certain amount which they know they will be able to afford to pay, and where in the world will they get the difference? Until recently the difference was being made available by the State.  When we were in office £400 was not too bad at all compared with £600 now.  People who got that £400 were glad to get it and to know that that amount of assistance could be given to them.  Housing costs have increased to such an enormous extent that when the figure went up to £600 while it was still very useful, it did not represent the same proportion of the cost of a job being done.  This is where Fianna Fáil fell flat on their face.</P>
    <P>Then they introduced a scheme which suggested that the people who wanted to heat their houses otherwise than by oil or gas should put in a type of heater for which they could get a grant of up to £600.  Having introduced that scheme, the Minister, again down in Clare, announced it in such a way that it was quite obvious that he did not know what it was about.  He came back and made a statement to the press which contradicted what he had said in Clare, and then he came into this House and contradicted again the two previous statements he had made.</P>

      <P>Ask the Deputy to sit back and take some of what he was handing out.  When the Minister did that the result was that we had a scheme which was supposed to save on oil.  It did save on oil, there is no doubt about it.  A lot of people in this country now do not use oil, but the extraordinary thing was that if a person was living in a council house or a house with a back boiler which provided him with hot water he could not get a grant under this scheme, but people who had an oil-fired system could.  There was woolly thinking there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worked with the officials of the Department of Local Government, as it was then, for over four years.  They are the finest civil servants we have ever had, and nobody on our side in this House has cast any slur on them.  As long as I <Col N="2033" /> am in the party I will not allow any of my colleagues to cast a slur on them even if they wanted to, but they do not. These civil servants know their job and they do it and they will give the finest advice. There does not seem to have been much political motivation in the Custom House until recently.  Somebody would not take that advice, and the result was that we had what we in the country long ago used to call stirabout.  It was a mixture of something which was sticky and you could not be very sure of what exactly was in it.  This is what this grant scheme produced.  An awful lot of people became involved in this.  People having started it, people having got half way through and some people having finished it, it was decided suddenly to cancel the scheme and it was cancelled.  While this scheme was in operation we had the houses built by Fianna Fáil Government for local authority tenants which still have not got a fireplace.  What kind of thinking is that?  What kind of people do Fianna Fáil think they are dealing with?</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of talk here tonight and last night about the system of rehousing people.  The Minister present referred to the fact that the money saved was to be made available for other useful things, and Deputy Flynn wanted to know where that money would come from.  I suggest that the £2.5 million spent on the executive jet could be added on for house repairs.  This throwing away of money for grandeur to show how great we are should be stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He is well able to take himself and in this House also he is well able to look after himself, like the rest of us. In this regard the money which is being saved is supposed to be spent on new <Col N="2034" /> houses.  God knows, it could be, because a lot of people have told me that they thought they would get into the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i> if they got the £1,000 they were waiting so long for it.  There is no doubt at all that if we do not conserve our existing housing stocks we will find ourselves in a position where we will require a lot more houses.  You cannot get away from that.  The former Taoiseach said that when we were in office we were building too many local authority houses.  That he and his Government meant that was proved by the fact that when they got into office the number of local authority houses started to take a nose-dive.  At the time this was happening people were being told that it would be all right now, they could borrow £12,000 to build a house.</P>
      <P>Let me make two points about this. What kind of a house will you build now for £12,000?  You could build a good house a few years ago for £9,000 or £10,000 but you will not build a house for £12,000 or anything like it now. Even if you could, what is the repayment on a £12,000 local authority loan?  You do not have to go very far to make out that it will cost over £30 a week for 30 years repayments, and that is for a person with an income of £60 or £70 a week.  Again I am very interested in Deputy Flynn who talked about the person with a medical card who he felt would be able to get this type of loan.  I do not know what way he thinks the local authorities here administer their affairs. No local authority will be allowed to lend money to a person who is not in a position to pay it back.  They must be at the very limit of the £5,500 before they are allowed to borrow anything like £12,000 and with that amount of money they cannot get a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody is terribly confused.  That sort of thing gives the impression that anybody can walk into a local authority, borrow £12,000 and get a contractor to build a house.  That is not the way it happens.  Deputy Connolly will soon know about it.  We have the extraordinary situation where local authority <Col N="2035" /> houses bought by tenants, some of which were built over 50 years ago, have been used to house people.  Because of the system which Fianna Fáil reintroduced, in this city alone hundreds and maybe thousands of houses are housing two and three families each.  When in office we insisted that there would be enough money made available to Dublin Corporation so that they could at least make some progress on the housing list.  That appears to have been completely overlooked, and we now have two or three families living in a house without a hope of being rehoused by the local authority.  These people cannot even build on to their houses now because of the abolition of the house improvement grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn referred to the amount of the loans available from local authorities.  It varies within different local authority areas.  I was a member of the Meath County Council, and if somebody in Meath wished to repair a house he could get 95 per cent of the cost of the job between the local authority and Departmental grant to carry out repairs.  Other local authorities have different ways of dealing with these things, but if there was not somebody on a local authority who was interested in ensuring that a poor person was looked after, that would be the end of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn referred to the grant for the disabled person, but let us be clear that this grant is not administered by the Department of the Environment but is administered at local authority level.  If they could have done away with that it would have been done away with as well. Group water and sewerage scheme grants remain, and they are very necessary.  I would advise Deputy Flynn to put down a few parliamentary questions to the relevant Minister to find out how many houses still require water and sewerage facilities, and particularly how many houses in his constituency have not got water and sewerage facilities. The Deputy might be surprised, but perhaps not, as maybe what he was saying tonight was said tongue in cheek.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn complimented Deputy <Col N="2036" /> Connolly, the new Minister of State, on his promotion and on the number of schemes which were carried out as a result of his sanction.  Moses is not in it with him.  If he was able to have schemes sanctioned and carried out since he was promoted a few weeks ago, Moses was wasting his time.  The situation is that it takes a considerable amount of time to implement schemes.  With the assistance of extra officials in the Department, I succeeded in shortening the time considerably, but I could not claim to have schemes sanctioned and carried out within three, four of five weeks.  We can judge the rest of the Deputy's speech by that.</P>

      <P>I do not object to the fact that O'Connell Bridge House was closed down, but there should have been some other way.  The Minister should have come in here and admitted that he had done a damn stupid thing, that he had succeeded in having thousands of additional applications dumped on top of them, in a few weeks, and that because of that they were swamped with work that they would be unable to deal with and that something would have to be done.  It should have been possible to have at least one line open so that people who were in a bad way about their grants would be able to make an enquiry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn said that the people carrying out house improvement repairs and so on were doing nixers, and I did not like that comment.  I know of decent one man, two man and three man jobs employed in repairing houses down through the years, and those people when working are always in need of money.  Sometimes people can pay them in advance, but more often than not they have to wait until they get some money from the Department.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to come in here under the protection of the House and say that these people are doing nixers, that in other words they are dishonest.  They are not dishonest, they are doing an honest day's work, and quite a number of them are anxious to know what will happen and if they will get paid for the work they did.  I can look at the closing of the office in O'Connell Bridge House in one way but the man waiting for his money may look at it in a different way, especially if the job was finished and he expected payment within a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another worrying thing is the position in relation to people who did the jobs <Col N="2038" /> and who are waiting payment or are involved with the 47,000 or 48,000 applicants whose applications are bogging down the Department.  When will these people get paid?  I do not blame the officials, I blame the Minister who made the mistake.  The Minister who made the statement made the mistake.</P>

I am sure Members like Deputy Flynn, who usually have a lot of money in their pockets, do not know what happens to the person who does not have any money.</P>

      <P>I did not say it was not hard earned, but, obviously, the Deputy cannot see far enough down to be aware of the person who when doing a job such as this must count every penny.  It has taken some of those people up to ten years to do the work.  They must do a little now and again, when they have a few extra shillings.  Much as they are anxious to finish the work they must leave it from time to time because they do not have the money.  Now, as those people have almost completed their work, they have been told by local authorities that because of a circular issued by the Department of the Environment they are not in a position to pay the grant.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in what was paid out because over the years considerable amounts were paid out at various times but I am concerned about the people who feel they will not be paid a grant.  My concern is for those who have been notified by local authorities that because the work was not finished&mdash;worse still, because the job although finished had not been inspected&mdash;they will not receive the grant.  One person told me yesterday that he had notified the local authority that the work had been completed but that the local authority did not receive the letter.  His father, who originally applied for the grant, died three years ago and the son, who continued to do the work for his mother, had been told he will not get the grant.  I blame the Minister for that situation.</P>

      <P>I did not bring the scheme to an end; I did not wipe it out or say that such people would not be paid after a certain date.  The Minister for the Environment issued that instruction and hundreds of people like the person I have referred to will not be paid a grant.  As I explained earlier those people are the poorest of the poor who had to carry out the repair work periodically when the money was available.  We are all aware of those people.  It is not the way we would carry out repair work but we are not in the same position.  I am sure such people would approach Fianna Fáil members quicker than they would approach members of the Opposition but nothing can be done for them.  I suggest that the Minister should have another look at the decision and attempt to straighten out the position so as to alleviate the hardship he has caused to certain people.  I am sure he will get the best possible advice from the Department officials and I ask him to accept it because it will be correct.</P>

The Minister is being selective in an effort to direct the funds available to other new developments such as new housing and the improvement of infrastructure rather than duplicating some of the systems already available such as the alternative heating and energy scheme.  With regard to the dismal picture painted by Deputy Quinn last night I should like to state that I have not come across that in my constituency.

      <P>At the outset I should like to strike from the record a reference to a story which is not accurate in relation to an incident in O'Connell Bridge House concerning the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly.  Obviously, I accept his word in relation to that.  I was given to understand that the story was correct but I withdraw it unreservedly.  The motion before the House deplores the Government's decision to abolish the grants and the prolonged delay in the processing of current grant applications.  The Minister of State moved an amendment to that welcoming the steps taken by the Government in redeploying the public funds available for housing in the current year to ensure that priority is given to the most deserving categories of housing needs.  That is nice but there was no mention of it in the manifesto.  Fianna Fáil were not so concerned about redeploying funds to meet deserving housing needs when they were throwing money around like confetti.  Of course, they were not building houses in those days, they were trying to buy votes.  It is to the shame and to the sorrow of this country that they were successful because the money they spent and threw away did exactly as they said it would, it built the sun parlours that Deputy Connolly <Col N="2041" /> referred to.  They converted the garages also at a time when people were still without water and the kind of basic facilities they need in this city, whatever about County Mayo.  That is what the economics of the manifesto did.  It is what the chaos of that manifesto did and it was not because Fianna Fáil were concerned about the housing stock but because they were concerned explicitly and exclusively with getting back into power.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I stated that under the political management of the Minister for the Environment the Custom House, as we know it, had been relegated to the fourth division and that an official in the Department of Finance was calling the shots in relation to Government policy. To prove that I should like to refer to what the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, said yesterday.  He said that in order to put our country on a sound economic footing it was necessary that the community should stop living beyond their means and, especially, that the extent of taxation and public borrowing should be rigidly controlled.  He said that in this context every aspect of public expenditure has had to be critically examined and some services, however desirable from a public point of view, suspended or curtailed.  Against that background, he said, it was inevitable that the nature and scope of the Government's investment in housing would have to be included in that review.  That was Department of Finance English if anybody has an ear to listen to it.</P>

      <P>I accept that apology, through the Chair.  That recognition of the relegation of the Department of the Environment is implicit in the paragraph I referred to, irrespective of who phrased the words.  I also recognise that the Taoiseach, having won the glittering prize, can now turn around and tear up the manifesto that put him into that position. That is what we are witnessing now.  In June 1977 there was no concern about deserving cases or any suggestion that those who could afford to build on a sun parlour would pay for it out of their on pockets.  Instead, they were to get a grant of £600, plus the instant abolition of rates.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have always maintained that a capitalist system is fundamentally irrational and that when it starts to get into a recession it lashes out at everybody.  The most vulnerable and the weakest are those who are hit first. Every day I have been in this House Fianna Fáil have given evidence and proof to that fundamental truth as I know it.  In this instance, having abolished rates on mansions as well as council houses, having given grants for the erection of sun parlours&mdash;to use the Minister's words&mdash;as well as for the provision of toilets, Fianna Fáil have run into an economic squall caused on part by international contradictions in relation to the price of energy but caused equally as much by the mismanagement of the economy.  At that stage in the crisis the Government do a turn about and, with the irrationality of capitalism, hit at everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> The people who are hit most by such a response are, as Deputy Tully said, those trying to build on an extra bedroom, to bring in a water supply or to extend the life of their houses.  That is the lesson of this entire episode.  There is an element of farce in it but there is also in it a real dimension of tragedy.  I do not know what is Deputy Flynn's knowledge of the building industry but I assure him that those workers who have union cards as well as those who do not have them and also the small building contractors who for many years have been providing an essential service are being squeezed by the same forces of constriction in relation to the supply of materials.  Credit for them has been virtually eliminated.  They are being squeezed by the banks which Fianna Fáil have refused to take into public control and they are now being squeezed by O'Connell Bridge House which is closed for business until 14 April.</P>

      <P>No doubt, in regard to the Estimate for the Department of the Environment the Minister will be as short with his time as he was in Clarecastle when he made this announcement.  I <Col N="2044" /> have made the economic case in relation to the mismanagement of funds by Fianna Fáil.  There would be some degree of justice in this if the money belonged to Fianna Fáil, but the tragedy is that what is involved is taxpayers' money.  I regret that, due to the pressure of time and to the way in which we structure debates here, Deputy Blaney, as a former Minister for Local Government with a record that many people would be proud to have, has not been able to come in on this debate.</P>
      <P>A cardinal point of housing policy and one that was emphasised in both of the White Papers published in the sixties is the need to conserve the housing stock.  With the 75 per cent home ownership of which we boast so much we must have a corresponding system of aid and support to ensure that the housing stock is maintained and improved. Perhaps I should be talking to the relevant official in the Department of Finance, but suffice it to say that the Minister has thrown out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point we made reference to in our motion but to which the Minister did not refer in his amendment was that we deplore the prolonged delay in the processing of current grant applications. Every Deputy and Senator knows that for no personal reason of the Minister in question these grants have got to the stage of total chaos.  In two weeks the Minister has succeeded in provoking 44,000 grant applications whereas during the past year there was an average of 1,000 per week.  There is not any administrative system capable of responding reasonably or properly or such a situation.  We here are in a position to make telephone calls or to table answers for written replies about the situation, but what about the hundreds of people who are entitled to these grants and who should not have to approach a local representative in relation to them? Because of the political mismanagement that has been perpetrated on the Department of the Environment serious damage has been caused to our democratic society.  Many people know now that <Col N="2045" /> unless one goes through the channel of approaching either a Deputy or a councillor in order to have representations made to the Minister of State who, incidentally, always replies courteously, they will not get the kind of response they want.  The old myth that has beggared this country for so many years will be reinforced, that is, that you will only get something done if you know a Deputy or somebody in the Government. The whole horse trading, favouritism and parliamentary paternalism from which this country has suffered for so long will be reinforced by what is being done.  That was an intrinsic part of our resolution and one to which Deputy Flynn did not find time to address himself.  We are arguing that in addition to the financial mismanagement on the part of the Government combined with the mismanagement of the economy generally in the past two years, substantial psychological damage has been done to the process of liberation that should take place in a country with our kind of education levels.  Instead, we have reintroduced a sense of dependence, a sense of needing to know someone in the Dáil in order to get a grant to which there is entitlement in the first place.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the other two parties feel about that, but we are opposed strongly to it.  I regret that one of the side effects of this sorry spectacle will be the reality that no matter what the Minister decides to do regarding the 44,000 applications now on his desk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>O'Connell Bridge House has been closed for business as a result of the chaos caused by the decision made by the Minister for the Environment. No matter how hard the officials in the Custom House work that process of reducing the credibility of the Custom House and of the civil service generally will be maintained.  Every Deputy must deplore that situation.</P>
      <P>It is easy to table a motion deploring mistakes that have been made, but it is the task of the Opposition to oppose anything they consider to be contrary to the interests of the country.  I should hope that we have been as constructive as possible.  I have quoted from Fianna Fáil policy, from the four White Papers in which there was reference to the necessity to maintain and improve the housing stock.  Did the people on the other side believe that when they used taxpayers' money to have it printed or were they merely using words to cover up something else that was going on on the Government side?  But how can we regard them as being serious in the light of the action taken on 21 January?  I suggest strongly that the resolution on my name and in the names of the other Labour Deputies has been well argued and has not been countered by the amendment moved by the Minister of State.  Consequently, I call on the House to support our motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I gave notice today of my <Col N="2049" /> intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 12 on today's Order Paper.  My question was as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture the reasons for the dramatic fall in the number of notices served under section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, as amended by the Land Act, 1965, from 118 for the period May-October 1977 and 197 for the period May-October 1978 to 22 for the period May-October, 1979; if this represents a change in Land Commission policy and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Constitution lays down the guidelines that it shall be one of our social policies to maintain as many people as possible in economic comfort on the land of Ireland.  That has been done during the years through the agency of the Land Commission, which operated in a number of ways.  They acquired land that came on the market for sale or they acquired land which was not being worked or used as it should have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years past the Land Commission acquired about 30,000 or 35,000 acres of land per year but since the change of Government the whole policy has been changed.  I noticed this very dramatic change in the past two or three years.  For example, as I pointed out in my question, the number of section 40 notices dropped from 118 in the period May-October 1977 and 197 in the period May-October 1978 to a mere 22 in 1979.  That means that no steps have been taken to acquire any land in the period May-October 1979, because these section 40 notices initiate acquisition proceedings.  From my experience in my constituency I know that land that comes on the market and which should be acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion and for the enlargement of farms that could be made viable is being bought by large farmers who have enough land and by speculators who wish to invest their money in land.  The latter are not farmers <Col N="2050" /> but they are buying land as an investment. The result is that farmers with 30 acres or 35 acres of land who want more land have no way of getting it.  The Minister of State is aware of this.  He knows the position in County Galway. So long as the Land Commission stands idly by and does not prevent the purchase of land by these cheque book farmers at prices the small farmer cannot afford the situation will remain critical.  What is happening is not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>About two years ago the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, told this House that he was introducing a new Bill that would replace the present land policy and would ensure&mdash;I think he said by taxation or by some other method&mdash;that land would not pass into the wrong hands.  He said the small farmer would not be outbid. Today we heard from the Minister that the matter is still only under consideration, and he could not give us an idea when the Bill would be introduced.  I do not know what will be in the Bill, but it seems to me that it could be two or three years before it is put on the Statute Book.  In the meantime land is passing out of the hands of the small farmers who need it badly.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the position has been aggravated because there has been a kind of snap and grab raid.  These people who want to acquire land as an investment or to acquire more land than they need see that now is the opportune time.  They have heard about this Bill coming into operation in the future. They want to be sure of getting their hands on land that comes on the market before the Bill comes into effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister conceded in the House today, and it has been conceded elsewhere, that the Land Commission is now concentrating on dividing land on hands and, in effect, not acquiring any land.  The Minister could not pretend otherwise because any Deputy with experience of land acquisition knows that the first step in acquisition is the serving of a section 40 notice.  The records of the House show, out of the mouth of the <Col N="2051" /> Minister that these notices are not being served.  I think it was Deputy Gilhawley who got a letter from the Minister's Department to the effect that the Land Commission was virtually closed down as regards acquisition.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to leave the present machinery working and to operate it until such time as he replaced it with effective machinery to protect the small farmer, until he replaces it with legislation and enactments that will as effectively protect the small farmer as the present Land Commission has been doing.  People may say the Land Commission operates slowly and that they do not like the land bonds with which it pays but they cannot say that it has not been effective in protecting the land for the purpose of increasing the acreage of small farmers and making their holdings viable.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for a Minister to say that he is thinking about introducing a Bill, that it is a very complex matter and requires much consideration.  That is what we were told by the predecessor of the present senior Minister shortly after the last election, but we now know that nothing has been done, that it is still being considered.  I want to put on record that for all practical purposes the Land Commission has gone out of business and is slowly winding down. The Minister says he is disposing of land on hand and not acquiring any.  That is the same as a closing down sale, just like a man who intends going out of business, who sells off the stock on hands and does not buy in any more.  That is what the Land Commission is doing.</P>
    <P>I am really concerned for farmers who come to me and ask if we can get the Land Commission to acquire a particular farm going on the market.  I say that I am sorry that I cannot, that I do not believe the Land Commission will acquire it.  I advise them to buy the land themselves.  They say they cannot, that it will go for more than they can afford and will be bought by people from the town, in some cases bought by people across the Border or bought by large farmers <Col N="2052" /> nearby.  The Minister knows what I am talking about.  It is not as if he were a Minister who did not understand.  I appeal to him to use his influence with the Government to get this business stopped, to get the Land Commission going again until it is replaced by better or at least equally good machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major criticisms of the Land Commission in recent years has been that acquired lands were being kept on hands for too long a period, the net result being that a vast area was effectively unavailable for planned agricultural development.  By the end of 1977 this area had reached a total of some 74,000 acres of lettable land and there was a further sizeable area in the acquisition machine.</P>
      <P>When this Government took office it decided that, in the interests of the agricultural economy, it was imperative that these lands on hands should be released for effective agricultural production as quickly as possible.  To that end the emphasis was placed on the allotment of land rather than the initiation of new proceedings which would only add to the problem.  The result has been that the area of lands on hands has been reduced from 74,000 acres at the end of 1977 to 63,000 acres at the end of 1979, this despite the fact that in the same period a further 45,000 acres were acquired.  Deputy Fitzpatrick will, I am sure, agree that the acquisition of land is not an end in itself but only a transition stage in the transfer of land to smallholders.  I want to make it perfectly clear, however, that the change of emphasis to which I have referred did not mean the end of acquisition.  As I told the House earlier, the Land Commission last year acquired some 23,500 acres and there are a further 40,000 acres in the acquisition machine.</P>

      <P>These figures hardly suggest that the Land Commission is being run down.

This, I suggest to the Deputy, is so obviously the correct approach that it should not need defending and it surprises me that Deputies opposite should be trying to make a political issue out of a matter that is of such importance to the needy <Col N="2054" /> small farmers of the country.  May I also say that the £25 million which I told the House today would be provided this year for the purchase of land is the largest allocation of money ever provided for that purpose by any Government?</P>

      <P>As regards the question of a minimum income for old persons living in institutions, this is primarily a matter for each health board, who usually allow old persons in institutions to retain a sufficient amount from their Social Welfare allowances or pensions to meet their personal needs.

      <P>My predecessor explained in his reply to the Deputy's question on 3 April 1979, (Official Report, Volume 313, columns 896 and 897) that the question of establishing a charter of rights for hospital patients is a complex issue and requires very detailed consideration; and that the Council of Europe had not completed their consideration of the matter.  I understand that this is still the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor also referred in that reply to a group which he had established to consider the more limited question of patients being better informed regarding arrangements in hospitals.  This group submitted its report some time ago and arising out of its recommendations two booklets have <Col N="1941" /> been prepared by my Department and copies have been issued to health boards and other hospital authorities.</P>
    <P>One booklet is intended as a model for use by hospital authorities in preparing a guide to help hospital patients and visitors and provide useful information regarding the services and facilities available in the hospital.  The second booklet is a guide for hospital managements and suggests ways in which procedures and services within hospitals may be improved so far as the patients are concerned.</P>

      <P>The estimated capital indebtedness of local authorities at 31 December 1979 was about £1,120 million.  At this stage information on the indebtedness of individual local authorities at that date is not available.  Particulars of the indebtedness of individual local authorities are included in the Annual Returns of Local Taxation published by my Department. The returns in respect of 1976 were presented to both Houses on 20 April 1979.  I hope to have the returns for 1977 published in the near future.</P>
      <P>Interest paid by a local authority on capital borrowings extends over the full term of the various loans now comprising the indebtedness of the authority.  Information is not available in my Department on the amounts of interest so paid by individual local authorities or by all local authorities combined.  It is, however, estimated that the total amount paid by local authorities in 1979 in interest on their capital borrowings was about £94 million.  A breakdown of this amount on an individual local authority basis is not available.</P>

      <P>: The allocations of capital funds to housing authorities, with the exceptions of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, for their local authority housing construction programmes have in recent years been made in three phases: (1) Initial allocations to meet existing commitments on hands at the beginning of the year; (2) Allocations to finance new work started in the first part of the year; (3) Further allocations at varying times throughout the year following detailed reviews of expenditure.</P>
      <P>In 1977, 1978 and 1979 commitments allocations were notified to housing authorities on 22, 16, and 14 February in each year respectively.  I expect to notify authorities of their 1980 commitments allocations shortly.</P>
      <P>The initial allocations for new works in each of the years 1977, 1978 and 1979 were made in 22 March, 30 March and 10 April respectively.  Capital allocations were made to Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council at the start of each year which included provision for both existing commitments and new work for the full year.</P>
      <P>The full amounts of the public capital programme provision for local authority housing were allocated to housing authorities in 1977, 1978 and 1979 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1977&mdash;£74.1 million; 1978&mdash;£80.77 million; 1979&mdash;£87.5 million. <Col N="1948" /> Authorities were authorised each year to incur additional expenditure by way of working overdraft to an aggregate amount of approximately 10 per cent of the public capital programme provisions.</P>
    <P>With regard to house purchase and improvement loans and supplementary grants, an initial allocation is normally made to each local authority in the beginning of the year in respect of the six month period ending on 30 June.  A further allocation is made in July in each year.  In 1977, 1978 and 1979 initial allocations were notified to authorities on 22 February, 7 February and 14 February respectively.  An initial allocation for 1980 was notified to authorities on 11 March.</P>
    <P>The amounts allocated to local authorities in 1977, 1978 and 1979 for the payment of houses purchase and improvement loans and supplementary grants were as follows: 1977&mdash;£19.7 million; 1978&mdash;£37 million and 1979&mdash;£46.0 million.</P>

      <P>An application for a revised certificate in respect of sites nos. 3 and 5 at a proposed price of £19,150 was received on 20 February 1980.  To enable the application to be determined the applicant was requested on 5 March 1980 to forward additional information which is still awaited.  If, after full examination of all relevant aspects of the application, the proposed price appears to represent reasonable value a revised certificate will be issued.</P>

      <P>: Legislation to provide for installation of tachographs in Irish transport vehicles was enacted in 1979. The matter is dealt with in the European Communities (Road Transport) (Recording Equipment) Regulations, 1979 (S.I. No. 214 of 1979) which came into effect on 25 June 1979.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide for a phasing-in arrangement for installation of tachographs in the period up to the end of 1980 in all vehicles which come within the scope of the relevant EEC Regulations and for the operation of tachographs on such vehicles as from 1 January 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission of the European Communities have recently accepted an arrangement under which tachographs are to be installed in transport vehicles in the United Kingdom in the period up to the end of 1981 and for the operation of tachographs on such vehicles as from 31 December 1981.  Furthermore, certain factors have delayed the programme for installation of tachographs in Irish vehicles. I have been in touch with the Commission about a possible revision of the programme for installation of tachographs in Irish vehicles.  I propose to make an announcement in the matter <Col N="1951" /> when my consultations with the Commission are completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Unemployment benefit has not been paid to the person concerned because certain inquiries, which were somewhat protracted, had to be pursued as to whether the person complied with <Col N="1955" /> the conditions for entitlement.  These inquiries have now been completed and a deciding officer has disallowed the claim on the grounds that the claimant is not unemployed within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>If the person referred to wishes to appeal against the disallowance, a form for this purpose will be given to him at his local office.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned claimed a widow's contributory pension from my Department.  As the statutory contribution conditions for the award of pension were not satisfied her claim was rejected.</P>
      <P>Following investigation of her means, which consisted of a farm of 36 acres, claimant was awarded a noncontributory pension at a reduced rate with effect from 29 September 1978 (day following her late husband's death).</P>
      <P>It subsequently came to light that claimant's late husband had been employed for periods for which no contributions had been paid.  As a result she was awarded a contributory widow's pension at a higher rate (based on an average of 26 contributions) with effect from 29 September 1978.</P>
      <P>A pension order book has been issued to the designated post office for collection by her.  A payable order for arrears due has been issued direct to her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The person concerned claimed a contributory widow's pension but is not qualified on her late husband's Irish insurance record or her own for a contributory pension.  Inquiries are proceeding in regard to any British insurance which might be of assistance.  In the meantime, following investigation of her means, she has been awarded a noncontributory widow's pension at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>Arrears of pension were withheld pending inquiries to the Southern Health Board as to the amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid to claimant. Payment of the balance of the arrears, after deduction of the amount of the allowance paid by the community welfare officer, has now been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The provision of service for applicants in Brooklawn is dependent on an underground cabling scheme which it had been planned to have carried out about now.  Because of the volume of urgent repair work on damaged and faulty cables requiring attention, however, it will not, regrettably, be possible to have the cabling scheme attended to until later this year.  The telephones will be installed for the waiting applicants as soon as the cabling scheme is completed.</P>
