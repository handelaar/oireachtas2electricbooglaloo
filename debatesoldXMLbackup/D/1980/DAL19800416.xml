      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be beneficial at this stage to do as the Deputy suggests.  He will appreciate that conversations and discussions of this sort can often be more valuable if they are of a confidential nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the phraseology being used is a departure from that which has been used in the past and that there is ambiguity as to what precisely this phraseology means?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Might the matter raised by the Leader of the Labour Party be dealt with in the context of a debate on Northern Ireland?  There has been some discussion about a debate of that kind.  I am not happy with the idea that the matter should be taken by way of a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There are many precedents for debates in the House on Northern Ireland and there are many other issues relative to the Department of Foreign Affairs which would appropriately be debated separately.  Consequently, I am asking the Taoiseach to make arrangements at an early date for a debate on Northern Ireland during which we could raise these issues of the <Col N="1245" /> doubts and ambiguities which arise in people's minds.  I urge the Taoiseach to agree to a separate debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of force in that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the Taoiseach will make time available in the immediate future for such a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make time available for a discussion on Northern Ireland but I think the timing of any such debate is important.  If certain meetings which are projected come to fruition it might be as well to have the debate afterwards when it might be more useful, more informative and more constructive. However, that is a matter that I am prepared to discuss with the Leaders of both Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an alternative view, but since the Taoiseach says he is prepared to discuss the matter I shall not pursue that point here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I put down a Private Notice question to the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking the guidance of the Chair.  A young woman lost her life at the weekend while crossing the Border between Counties Tyrone and Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy submitted a Private Notice question in that regard but it was rejected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so and my request to raise the matter on the Adjournment was rejected also.  In these circumstances I should like the Chair to enlighten me as to how I might raise matters of this kind, matters which affect his constituents as well as mine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent the people of Donegal who use the Border checkpoint in question.  I use it myself about ten times each week and the same applies to my family, so that it might have been one of us who was killed.  There is no reason for my having to remain silent when people who use that checkpoint are in danger of being shot.  That is why I am protesting in the strongest terms possible about your ruling, a ruling which suggests that you are protecting this thin veneer of a Fianna Fáil Party led by Deputy Charles Haughey, a man who day dreams about Irish unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a wrong accusation to make against the Chair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apology for this accusation.  The reason I have given would seem to me to be the only one for you refusing to allow me raise the matter in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it though I believe it to be true.  A young woman's life was lost as a result of the wrong judgment of senior officers in the British Army in having young boys of 19 in charge of guns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason for my accepting your judgment.  The House is being reduced to a sham by reason of public representatives being denied the right to express their views on the shooting to death of an innocent Irish person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it right that a boy of 19 should be in charge of a lethal weapon?  I was denied the opportunity of raising yesterday the matter of the death of an innocent woman or of asking the Taoiseach to raise the matter at the meeting with the Secretary of State.  Why was the matter not raised at that meeting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <P>I think it would be appropriate to refer to the unfortunate incident which necessitated a vote, a Member's <Col N="1253" /> suspension and the suspension of the sitting, and to make the comment that this has come about because of the extremely restrictive interpretation of the legitimacy of questions tabled in the House.  This has become particularly obvious during the last few months.  There is another development which has led to further difficulty in the House: legitimate questions tabled for answer by the Taoiseach are being placed by him with other Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but he knows that these are matters that we cannot go into here.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges might have a look at these matters.  Indeed the Chair would like if they did.  The Chair is merely interpreting Standing Orders as interpreted by all my predecessors.  The grave disorder which unfortunately upset the House today was the result of a question being rejected on the same grounds as those on which many questions have been rejected before now.  Whenever a question is rejected, my office is open for Deputies to come in and ask why.  I frequently oblige them by telling them why.  There is always a definite reason for it and the Chair is not protecting anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments were intended to try to prevent a recurrence of what happened here this morning.  I wish to assure the Chair that I and my party feel very strongly about the highly restrictive nature of interpretation of legitimate questions tabled by Deputies of my party.  This is a development that has taken place only in recent months. The practice of the Taoiseach in regard to questions tabled about statements made by the Taoiseach personally&mdash;I tabled such questions in recent days on his statements to the Ard-Fheis&mdash;has been to hive such questions off on other Ministers because the Taoiseach wants to evade having to elaborate and clarify or to deal with supplementaries.  That will lead to open conflict in the House, which should be avoided.</P>

      <P>I wish to rebut the accusation against me.  It is just part of a continual process of personal attacks which have been made on me here in the past few months.  I want to assure the House that in so far as any questions are addressed to me I take very little initiative in having them transferred.  Normal procedure in this matter is adhered to and it is no wish of mine to transfer any questions for purposes of evading the answers.  There is a fairly well established procedure through which ministerial responsibility is practised. Following that procedure, questions are dealt with more or less as a matter of routine by my office.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to assure the House that I do not take any positive measures to transfer questions, nor has the practice in this regard been altered one iota since I assumed office.</P>

I wish to assure the Taoiseach on this matter and ask him to point out any remark or statement I have made that could be interpreted as anything but political.  I will continue to attack the Taoiseach politically when I think it appropriate to do so.  It is part of my responsibilities as an elected representative in this House. However, I repeat that there has been a radical departure in regard to dealing with questions addressed to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>On the point made by the Taoiseach, I cannot see, when a question is put down about a statement made by the Taoiseach, how it could be appropriate for any civil servant, behind his back and without consulting him, to transfer that question elsewhere.  If that is the true interpretation of the Taoiseach's suggestion, then what is happening in his office is wrong.  The transfer of questions addressed to the Taoiseach must be done with his authority, and although questions may <Col N="1255" /> be misdirected to the Taoiseach or can be directed to him in relation to departmental matters when it would be appropriate to have them transferred, when they relate to statements made by the Taoiseach he must be answerable for his own statements.

      <P>I should like the House to accept that I was not saying that civil servants were transferring questions behind my back or without my knowledge.  It is a well recognised function of the Taoiseach's Office when questions come in, to deal with them in the normal way.  I understand it to be a well established practice that questions are dealt with by the Taoiseach's private office in this way and transferred to appropriate Ministers and not necessarily brought to the attention of the Taoiseach.</P>

I have submitted at least three questions in the last few days to the Taoiseach in relation to statements made by him at the Ard-Fheis. The Taoiseach has refused to answer them and they have been transferred to other Ministers.  Can I assume now that when we submit questions to the Taoiseach they will be answered by him?</P>

      <P>I wish to make a final point of order.  Deputy Harte's behaviour this morning was regarded by the House as disorderly and a vote was taken with that effect.  I think the House will appreciate the genuine emotion that led him to behave in a manner which according to the rules of the House was disorderly.  That should be accepted by everybody.  I would therefore ask you, Sir, to withdraw the two statements you made, that he was getting mileage out of it and that he was seeking deliberately to be put out of the House.  I think those statements were unfair to the Deputy who was labouring under deep emotion on the matter.  I suggest that you would be generous and withdraw the two statements made in the heat of the moment&mdash;I can understand that your feelings were exacerbated by what was happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the series of events over a week ago which led to a number of clashes involving troops serving with the United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon, and increased tension in the Southern Lebanon generally, the Government have been following developments closely.  The Government have been seriously concerned by recent developments and have taken a number of steps in this connection.  Before I comment further on the situation I should perhaps recall a number of points relating to the Force which are already known to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago the Government decided, at the request of the Secretary <Col N="1260" /> General of the United Nations, to send a contingent of the Defence Forces to serve with UNIFIL which had been established by decision of the Security Council.  This decision was approved by the Dáil.  Replacement contingents have since been dispatched at six-monthly intervals.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL was established with the aim of ensuring Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon and restoring the authority of the Lebanese Government in the area.  In accordance with the terms of reference approved by the Security Council, the Force was, among other things, to use its best efforts to prevent the recurrence of fighting and to ensure that its area of operation is not utilised for hostile activity of any kind.  The Force was not to use force except in self-defence, the latter including resistance to attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate.</P>
    <P>The Israelis, when they completed their withdrawal, handed over a strip of territory North of the border to forces led by Major Haddad and UNIFIL has not been able to exercise effective authority in this area.  These so-called <i>de facto</i> forces have been supported militarily and financially by Israel.</P>
    <P>The Irish battalion is located in the south-east of the area under UNIFIL control and is bordered to the south and east by territory controlled by the <i>de facto</i> forces.  These forces have been attempting to extend their area of control by harrassing the local population and the UN Force and by endeavouring to establish positions in the area under UNIFIL control.</P>
    <P>The events since 6 April have been the subject of two special reports to the Security Council, copies of which I am arranging to have placed in the Dáil Library.  I do not intend, therefore, to outline them in detail but rather to mention the salient points in so far as the Irish contingent were concerned.  On 6 April last the &ldquo;<i>de facto</i>&rdquo; forces endeavoured to set up a position at At Tiri in the Irish battalion area and were resisted by Irish UN forces.  The UN <Col N="1261" /> brought in reinforcements from other units.  Despite the fact that negotiations under way were due to be resumed on the morning of 7 April the &ldquo;<i>de facto</i>&rdquo; forces opened fire.  Private Griffin was seriously injured.  Nine Irish soldiers were taken prisoner by the &ldquo;<i>de facto</i>&rdquo; forces.  The &ldquo;<i>de facto</i>&rdquo; forces in At Tiri remained surrounded by UN Forces. Subsequently on 8 April the Irish soldiers were released.</P>
    <P>In the following days Israeli forces established themselves in the surrounding area but withdrew from the Irish area by 12 April.</P>
    <P>The situation in At Tiri remained tense during these days.  On 12 April the &ldquo;<i>de facto</i>&rdquo; forces compelled women and children to harass the UN forces and a confrontation developed.  A firefight between &ldquo;<i>de facto</i>&rdquo; and UN forces developed in the course of which a Fijian UN soldier received fatal injuries and one member of the &ldquo;<i>de facto</i>&rdquo; forces was killed.  UN fire was not directed at civilians.  Subsequently  &ldquo;<i>de facto</i>&rdquo; personnel detained by the UN were exchanged for four Irish soldiers who had been taken from an observation post as hostages.  UN headquarters at Naquora, in which some Irish personnel are stationed, was subjected to heavy shelling but there were no serious injuries.</P>
    <P>The situation in the area is now quiet but tense, and UNIFIL Command has taken certain precautionary measures in the light of threats that have been made.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL is, of course, under UN Command and operates under the mandate laid down by the Security Council and in accordance with the terms of reference proposed by the Secretary General which were approved by the Security Council.  Within these guidelines operational questions are matters for the Force Command under the overall direction of the Secretary-General.  The Government have endeavoured to assist the Secretary-General in any way possible with efforts which he has been making to bring about an improvement in the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> On the instructions of the Government, our Acting Permanent Representative in New York made known our great concern about developments to the Secretary-General and has been discussing with the Secretary-General whether any improvements are possible in the existing arrangements for the Force.  He has also maintained contact with other troop contributors.</P>
    <P>At the diplomatic level, the Government's efforts were in the first instance directed towards securing the release of the nine soldiers detained.  Subsequently they have been directed towards seeking an improvement in the situation generally.  As Deputies may be aware the Security Council is currently discussing the question and, on my instructions, the Acting Permanent Representative yesterday addressed the Security Council and conveyed the great concern of the Government at recent developments.  I am arranging to have a copy of his statement placed in the Dáil Library also.</P>
    <P>The Government also instructed the Irish Ambassador to Israel, who is resident in Athens, to travel to Israel where he has had discussions with the Israeli Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Defence and at the Foreign Ministry. The assistance of other concerned countries has also been sought.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that UNIFIL have in the past two years worked both for the benefit of the people in their area and have been most useful in promoting the overall objective of the maintenance of peace in the Middle East generally.  It has been the view of the Secretary-General and of disinterested observers that, although the Force could not in the circumstances be completely successful in carrying out their mandate, the situation would have been very much worse without them.  It was with this in mind that the Government recently agreed to despatch a further replacement contingent to the Force.</P>
    <P>When the Government originally agreed to the request of the Secretary General they knew that the task of the force would be a difficult one and that <Col N="1263" /> the mandate would be difficult to carry out.  We felt it to be our duty, however, to respond to the request and to maintain the proud Irish record of involvement in UN peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>Irish participation in UNIFIL was based on the clear understanding that the governments concerned accepted the establishment of the force and would give them the necessary co-operation in carrying out their difficult mandate.  Unfortunately we have increasing reason to question whether this most basic condition is being met.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General has consistently sought to obtain the full co-operation of Israel in enabling the force to carry out their duties.  He has, however, had to report that this has not always been given to a sufficient degree.  The Government have regularly over the past two years in contacts with Israel also pressed strongly for its assistance in enabling the Force to function effectively and without interference.</P>
    <P>The Israeli Government, while admitting that they have influence over Major Haddad, have denied that they have control over his actions.  They have made it clear that they opposed firing at and shelling of units of UNIFIL and have indicated that they would use their influence over the <i>de facto</i> forces to endeavour to prevent this.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Government will continue to keep developments under close review.  If the full co-operation of all parties is not forthcoming to enable the force to carry out its mandate effectively and without interference then the most serious question as to its effectiveness and value must inevitably arise.  The Government will continue actively, through diplomatic channels, to assist the Secretary-General in seeking such improvements as are possible.  I would appeal to all Governments which have an interest in the preservation of peace in Southern Lebanon and believe that the force should be maintained to use their influence in any quarter which may be necessary to this end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> I wish to place on record&mdash;and I am sure the House will join with me in this&mdash;our admiration for the way in which the officers and men of the Defence Forces have carried out their duties with UNIFIL and our confidence that they will continue to do so in the impartial and dedicated manner for which they have rightly won praise in many quarters.</P>
    <P>I regret to inform the House that I have just learned that Private Griffin died last night.  I know that the House will want to join with me in conveying our sympathy and condolences to his family and in paying tribute to his contribution to the UN Force in the preservation of peace.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in sending my Party's condolences to the family and relatives of the late Private Griffin.  It was known in the past few days that he was gravely ill and that he had taken a turn for the worst.  I am very sorry to hear that it has come to the worst.  I sincerely hope that the sympathy of this House will be of some consolation to his family and relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to apologise for the absence of Deputy O'Keeffe who is unavoidably absent.  I am deputising for him at last minute notice.  It is a pity that somebody like him is not here because he has had experience of being on the ground in the Lebanon and is more conversant with the situation there than am I.  Be that as it may I shall be brief.  I welcome the opportunity afforded this House by the Taoiseach to clarify at least in part what is regarded here as a very confused situation.  My only criticism of the Minister's speech is that it has not clarified the situation sufficiently, and has not indicated what action it is proposed to take in relation to the continuing conflict or harassment of UNIFIL Forces and particularly the Irish troops.  Like the Minister I want to pay a tribute from this side of the House&mdash;something I did some time ago&mdash;to our forces, to our Army, who have contributed not alone in the Lebanon under most difficult circumstances <Col N="1265" /> but in other areas throughout this troubled world, who have played a vital role in the preservation of peace and are renowned and known by people the world over for their efficiency, dedication and professional approach to the job assigned to them. From what I can ascertain I believe that their role there is difficult because of a number of factors&mdash;their terms of reference, their mandate, the terrain, the strategic position in that terrain the Irish troops have occupied, to a certain extent restricted by their mandate, the harassment caused by opposing factions and the fact that some UNIFIL forces, and particularly the Irish contingent are, so to speak, caught in the middle.</P>
    <P>I can recall the contributions made when this motion was debated in this House in May 1978.  They were few.  I think a number of Members of this House did not understand the problems that would arise.  I would draw the attention of the House to the debate on that occasion, on 9 May 1978, reported in the Official Report of that date at columns 600 and 601 where the Leader of this Party, Deputy FitzGerald, drew the attention of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs to the uncertainty and obscure mandate under which the Irish troops were working in the Lebanon. Deputy FitzGerald questioned that mandate.</P>
    <P>He said he was not satisfied&mdash;as can be confirmed from a reading of the debate to which I have referred&mdash;and pointed out that the peacekeeping authority would be undermined and could be discredited because of the confusion in carrying out that mandate.  To some extent I am afraid that the fears expressed then have been justified.  Some parties in the Lebanon have refused to accept the United Nations authority, in which the Israelis, through militia forces, or the <i>de facto</i> forces, as the Minister said, through Major Haddad, conduct a campaign with impunity throughout the area to such an extent that the Irish troops have been forced, in the last few days&mdash;and I thought the Minister would <Col N="1266" /> have referred to this&mdash;to pull back from their operational area.  It gave the impression of being a kind of retreat.  This is a serious matter&mdash;where there are forces of that sort acting illegally, within that area, where they can commandeer lorries and jeeps belonging to the UNIFIL Forces there.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Lebanese Government and the PLO agreed to accept the mandate of UNIFIL on that occasion, how is it that a force of somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 christian militia men were left well placed to harass UN troops, and could promote a re-occupation of the disputed territories by Israelis?  That is an area which must be clarified.  Major Haddad moved tanks into a post overlooking the Irish camp, a very strategic area.</P>
    <P>The Minister should now have the mandate clarified, a request made initially by this Parliament.  If possible he should have clarified the Israeli-Haddad alliance and also some element of public opinion here which it must be said also has gathered momentum in recent days&mdash;that we should withdraw our troops because of harassment there, because the contribution they are making, under difficult circumstances, is not appreciated by the people, a situation in which they are prepared to risk their lives, as has been illustrated by the death of Private Griffin.  It should be clearly stated by this House, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;that is why I put a question to the Taoiseach along with Deputy Barry and Deputy FitzGerald, which was transferred to the Minister; I am not quibbling about that&mdash;that we have an international role to play in the preservation of peace in this world, that we have done it with distinction and honour; that our Army have carried out the duties assigned to them without fear or favour; that we are not in the Lebanon in conquest or taking part with any one of the divisive groups there but that we are there with the sole objective of preserving peace.</P>
    <P>What is disturbing also is the campaign of false propaganda being carried <Col N="1267" /> out by the Israeli press, by the Israelis, in relation to the operations of UNIFIL, with particular reference to the Irish contingent there, scandalous propaganda. The Minister should ensure that that is at least counteracted and does not continue, because that sort of thing will undermine the whole purpose of the Defence Forces there, and of UNIFIL, in the difficult, if not impossible, task assigned to them.  Quite recently the Leader of this Party was on an American tour&mdash;when he met many people influential politically and otherwise and a source very sympathetic and influential to the Israeli cause made it perfectly clear publicly, in his presence, that the contribution made by the Irish contingent in the Lebanon and throughout other troubled areas, was professional and was regarded by everybody concerned as being top-class.  Still this campaign of propaganda has been waged against them, with particular reference to the Irish contingent.</P>
    <P>There is a question of clarifying that mandate.  There is a question of the troops being in a position where they know exactly what they are doing.  Are we equipped to meet and combat people like the Haddad troops who are highly trained and efficient and have all facilities available to them?  Are our troops fully equipped?  Can we meet this sort of confrontation?  Have we brought pressure to bear, through the channels open to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government, on the Israelis to lay off and accept the role which our troops and the UNIFIL troops are there to carry out?  Have we contacted the Governments of the Nine, the Committee on Political Co-operation within the Nine which should be used?  Have we contacted the Governments which have contributed to UNIFIL and are supplying troops to make sure that pressure is brought to bear before the situation becomes worse?</P>
    <P>I should like to thank and pay tribute to the departmental staff at Headquarters who are free to give information on the position.  To anybody who contacted them they gave the up-to-date situation. <Col N="1268" /> However, that situation is still tense, and it requires that red tape of any sort should not inhibit the Minister or the Government in trying to have the position clarified before it deteriorates further.</P>
    <P>I am only deputising for our spokesman on Foreign Affairs and I wish to be brief, but I should say that statements made outside the House nationally or internationally in regard to the situation in the Lebanon should be well informed.  Very often, inadvertently or otherwise, statements are made that could make that delicate situation even more delicate.  It is a matter about which people should not speak glibly.  The troops there have a difficult role to play. They are doing it well and any contribution made or taking of sides or statements that are not well informed could do untold damage.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to associate myself with the remarks of the Minister on the death of Private Griffin.  This was a very tragic situation where a man in his very early twenties lost his life in what I would regard as the noblest cause one could serve, the cause of world peace. On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to express very sincere sympathy to the family of Private Griffin and our deep appreciation of his sacrifice.  I hope they will find some consolation in the fact that it was in such a noble cause he died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main concern of all Members of the House is the safety of Irish troops serving with UNIFIL in the Lebanon. The present situation there is causing grave concern to us, but it must be said that it is not a situation that developed overnight.  It has been developing for a considerable time.  Last July, after visiting the Irish troops serving with UNIFIL in the Lebanon and having observed and heard from the Irish troops serving there what was taking place, I came back and in an endeavour not to cause unnecessary anxiety or concern to families of troops serving in the Lebanon I sought a private meeting with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy <Col N="1269" /> O'Kennedy, and the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Molloy.  At that meeting I tried to convey to them the serious concern felt by our troops and senior Army officers and the officers of other nationalities serving there that, while the <i>de facto</i> forces under Major Haddad had up to then been shelling by way of harassment both the local population and UNIFIL forces including the Irish troops, the situation had begun to change and they were now in fact shelling for effect.  I offered the Ministers a very substantial list of shells or other types of explosives, thousands of rounds of ammunition used against Irish positions and troops, but there was a refusal to accept the fact that Major Haddad's forces had changed their tactics and were firing for effect.</P>
    <P>I visited one Irish company in which a young officer serving with it is a son of a Member of this House and I found that a shell had landed on the roof of the building they occupied.  Even that did not seem to convey what was clearly the frame of mind and opinion of Irish military personnel serving there: that there had been this very serious change. Very reluctantly, as a result of not being able to convey this opinion at a private meeting, I raised the matter publicly in this House.  What I said then is on record.  It is somewhat regrettable that a more stern position was not adopted with the Israeli Government in particular.</P>
    <P>Because of the mandate it is important to look at one or two factors which our troops serving in the Lebanon have to cope with on the ground.  First, I quote the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations when he was renewing the mandate that would operate from 13 January to 8 June 1979.  Speaking about the renewal of the mandate he said:</P>
    <P>... I have no alternative but to make this recommendation.  I must also express my view that UNIFIL cannot continue to function without certain essential conditions being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> He describes those conditions:</P>
    <P>1.  An adequate security zone around the UNIFIL headquarters in Naquora is perhaps the most immediate of those.</P>
    <P>He was speaking in January 1979.  What is the position around UNIFIL headquarters in Naquora at present?  He was talking about a safety zone around the headquarters of the UN forces in which there are Irish personnel.  Almost immediately outside the main gate of the headquarters the <i>de facto</i> forces, as they are described, have a road block.  One can sit in the officers' mess or dining room and hear heavy military vehicles, tanks or troop carriers or whatever else&mdash;I am not very familiar with military terms&mdash;rolling past.  One drives in a UN vehicle accompanied by Irish Army personnel and one passes by jeeps in which the same <i>de facto</i> forces are sitting armed to the teeth almost immediately outside the main gate of the UNIFIL headquarters in the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>The Irish troops are serving in the hills some distance from headquarters.  If an Irish Army officer wants to go from headquarters to the troops on the front line he has to do the following.  He must drive in a convoy because when an officer went in a single car it was hijacked by the <i>de facto</i> forces, although the car was occupied and driven by Irish troops. I made a journey from headquarters to the front line and passed through six checkpoints.  Three checkpoints were manned by UN forces, one by the PLO and the other two were manned by the <i>de facto</i> forces.  Irish and other UN troops travelling in convoys in UN vehicles are subjected to harassment and search by these <i>de facto</i> forces.  That is very difficult for trained military personnel legitiately engaged in UNIFIL operations to tolerate.  But these people have put up with this impossible situation with great restraint.</P>
    <P>When we got to the operational area there were a number of strategically placed observation posts manned by four or five Irish Army personnel.  To relieve these personnel or to supply them <Col N="1271" /> with food, equipment or other requirements, it was necessary for the Irish personnel serving with the UN to get permission from Major Haddad and his <i>de facto</i> forces.  They had to tell the <i>de facto</i> forces in advance the time, the vehicles to be used, what they were carrying, and the number of personnel who would be travelling.  Not infrequently the <i>de facto</i> forces decide at the last minute that they are not prepared to allow the Irish troops to pass their checkpoints to relieve the soldiers manning the observation posts. They are turned back and are told to reapply for permission to travel to the front line.  Our troops are left in those isolated posts, cut off except for the use of a field telephone or something of that nature.</P>
    <P>Those are the circumstances in which our troops and other national contingents serving with UNIFIL in the Lebanon are trying to fulfil this mandate. Let there be no mistake about this&mdash;I note there is some ambiguity in the Minister's statement about it&mdash;the <i>de facto</i> forces under Major Haddad are directly employed and responsible to the Israeli Government.  There is no doubt about that and there should be no ambiguity in the Minister's statement about it either.  If I remember correctly, the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Molloy, when visiting the Middle East area had a discussion with General Wiseman, Israeli Minister for Defence. He acknowledged publicly that the <i>de facto</i> forces under Major Haddad were subject to and operating under the direction of the Israeli Parliament.  Do not let there be any ambiguity about that, particularly in the circumstances in which our troops are serving at the moment. Do not let a Government Minister gloss over that very unpleasant but very vital fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed referred to a propaganda campaign.  I never had contact with armies nor had any desire to join an army and I know very little about military operations, but I want to tell the House without any reservations of the very good and impressive relationship the Irish troops serving in the Lebanon <Col N="1272" /> have with the local population.  If a Member is visiting another country it is always possible to lay on a good show but there is no way anybody could stage the very obvious trust, confidence and friendship that existed between our troops on the ground and the local population, particularly the younger people and children, in the Lebanon.  As Deputy Creed said, a scandalous propaganda campaign against our troops has been carried out very effectively by the Israelis and that campaign has not been effectively counteracted by us.</P>
    <P>Last July it was customary for our troops to go into Israel on weekend leave.  At that time there was a growing reluctance among our troops to go into Israel because of the feeling that had been generated in Israel against the UN forces operating in the Lebanon, and in particular against the Irish troops.  I am not taking from the excellent medical attention which the Israelis gave to our people who were injured.  I have no doubt that Private Griffin got the best medical attention.</P>
    <P>Do not let any Member have any doubts where the direct responsibility lies for the operations of Major Haddad and his <i>de facto</i> forces.  It lies directly with a country with which we have formal diplomatic relations.  What have we done about this?  I raised this matter last July and pressed for certain measures to be taken.  I identified the role Major Haddad is playing there and to whom he is responsible.  We protested but how effective have our protests been?  How seriously were they taken?  In diplomatic circles there must be some point at which a government can indicate their serious displeasure at the activities of another government with which they have diplomatic relations.  Was the Israeli ambassador ever summoned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and a formal protest made?  There is no indication in anything I heard or read that such a step was taken.  Surely the safety of our troops and the possibility of being able to fulfil the mandate contributing to world peace is serious enough to justify the highest possible diplomatic protest <Col N="1273" /> being made publicly?  Why was it not made?  Our troops and the public are entitled to ask that question.  Even at this late stage will the Minister for Foreign Affairs do it?  He should not have any doubt about Israel's role in the present situation.  It is only natural that our main concern should be for the safety and welfare of Irish troops.</P>
    <P>As well as that we have a wider responsibility.  We have a responsibility to the UNIFIL forces serving in the Lebanon irrespective of what nationality they may be because they are serving the same cause.  There are forces operating in the Lebanon other than the <i>de facto</i> forces.  A look at the map of the UNIFIL operation to see where the different contingents are placed will show that our people have this difficulty with Major Haddad because they are placed up against where he is.  Another national contingent are placed up against the PLO who also hold and control territory within the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>We have heard this morning that we have lost one of our troops.  One of our young men has died in the service of this cause.  The Fijian forces&mdash;who, I noticed when I was there, had an excellent relationship with the Irish forces serving in the same organisation&mdash;have lost no less than seven of their soldiers who were killed by the PLO.  It is reasonable to pose the question: is it appropriate that in those circumstances, where we have our own troops serving side by side with troops from another country in the one organisation in the one noble cause, while the Fijians have had seven of their soldiers killed by the PLO, our Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement some time ago encouraging, to say the least, the activities of the PLO?  I do not want to overstate it, but this did not contribute to the welfare and safety of our own troops serving in that area.</P>
    <P>A number of things should be done. First of all, the Israeli ambassador accredited to this country should be summoned to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and made aware of not only the Government's concern but the concern <Col N="1274" /> of this House and that we will hold them&mdash;as we should and are entitled to do&mdash;directly responsible for any death or injury of our troops serving with UNIFIL if that death or injury is inflicted by Major Haddad's <i>de facto</i> forces.  They pay them, they arm them, they control them and there is no doubt about that. Also, as Irish troops are so often called upon to give their service in this way I suggest, although this was ignored last July, that if an all-party delegation from this House were to be sent, as other European countries send all-party delegtions, to UN sessions we could be directly involved and know what kind of tensions and difficulties are likely to face our troops being called upon in some other part of the world.  It is most urgent now that an all-party delegation from this House would be sent out to visit the troops serving in the Lebanon.  There are two reasons for this.  First of all, it would give an all-party delegation an opportunity of seeing just what our troops have to contend with and under what difficulties they are trying to fulfil their mandate in the Lebanon.  It would be very much appreciated and would be a very considerable boost to the morale of the Irish troops who are serving not only this country but also the cause of world peace so well.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is known widely that the Israeli army and the Israeli economy are dependent very much on support from the USA.  I ask the Minister to tell the House if any direct representation has been made to the US Government with regard to what use the weapons which they are supplying to the State of Israel are being put?  Surely they would have a responsibility for the activities of Major Haddad if those activities are facilitated by the supply of arms originating in the US being filtered to him by the Israeli Government.  It would be premature at this stage to say that we should not continue with our operation and commitment to the UN and UNIFIL, but unless there is very considerable change in the attitude of the Israeli Government particularly, it is something that this House will have to keep under very close review indeed.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section 31 is to ensure that all practical steps are taken to prevent persons falling into the fixed vessels referred to in this section.  The Deputy's amendment is not material to the purpose of this section. The point he is raising seems to be the sort of thing which the EEC are proposing to cover in the constructural provisions of a framework and individual directives on vessels of various kinds. When these relevant directives have been adopted, they will be translated into domestic law here, probably by regulations made under the European Communities Act of 1972.  It would be much more desirable that we should wait for the relevant directives to which I have referred.  These directives and what they entail will be pretty complicated but will have the object of harmonising European standards.  Of course, all our vessels should be properly constructed but, for the purposes of this Bill, the section as it reads meets the requirement.</P>

      <P>These two amendments seek to provide for emergency conditions.  The relevant paragraph in section 33 proposed by the Minister says that a report shall be made within 28 days of the completion of the examination.  We seek to add:</P>

      <P>I can envisage a situation where something is dangerous and 28 days could leave time for many more accidents to take place.  This may not be the best way to deal with the matter and perhaps there are better ways.

      <P>As I said to Deputies on the earlier stages of this Bill, it is my intention while Minister, particularly in legislation of this nature, to give every consideration to any amendment submitted, to see its merit or otherwise.  In the case of this amendment by Deputy Mitchell, subsection (13) of section 40 of the Factories Act lays down the requirement of 28 days in connection with steam boilers.  The purpose of subsection (7) (c) of this section is to make similar provision for the sake of consistency, but this time in respect of steam receivers.  There is nowhere near the same possibility, as I know the <Col N="1280" /> Deputy is aware, of danger with steam receivers as there is with steam boilers. The 28 days' interval in the case of steam boilers has proved adequate where steam boilers are concerned.  It must be remembered that the examination may show that the steam receiver cannot continue to be used with safety unless certain repairs are carried out.  Even if it took the Minister 28 days to be informed of the fact it would be a foolhardy occupier who would permit a steam receiver to be used in its unrepaired state during that period, if for no other reason than that he would if insured risk his insurance cover being withdrawn or his premium being raised considerably if the insurance company inspector became aware of what was going on.  In not accepting the Deputy's amendment, I am satisfied that 28 days is a reasonable period to give the person who has examined the steam receiver to write up his examination and send a copy of the report, where required, to the Minister.</P>

That is also, of course, the case with regard to the table which sets out section 74 (1) of the Factories Act, 1955 as amended by paragraph (a) of section 35 in the Bill. Paragraph (b) of the proposed revised version of section 35 represents an addition to the text of section 35 of the Bill as drafted at present.  The purpose of the addition is to insert two further subsections, (5) and (6), in section 74 of the 1955 Act.  By virtue of subsection (5) no person&mdash;this is extremely important&mdash;will be permitted to disturb the place where a fatal accident occured or to tamper with anything there until the place has either been visited and inspected by an inspector or three clear days have expired since the fatal accident was duly notified.  This prohibition does not apply to the doing of anything by an inspector or the doing of anything by a person with the consent of an inspector. Provision is also made to make it a defence in any proceedings taken in respect of a contravention to prove that the doing of any act was necessary for securing the safety of any person.  Subsection (6) makes the usual provision for an offence and the relative monetary penalty.  Deputies can accept that this is a strengthening of the purpose of the Bill.</P>

    <P>This is purely a drafting amendment for the information of Deputies.  It will be noted that the subsection provides for a <Col N="1283" /> three-year-term of office for the safety representative.  The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear beyond doubt that the persons employed in the premises concerned may select and appoint a safety representative from amongst their number not only on the first occasion but also every successive third year thereafter should they so wish.

      <P>These amendments arise out of discussions with interested bodies.  As I said already in the House, these discussions took place between completion of Second Stage and the initiation of Committee Stage.  It was put forward both by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Employers Confederation that a requirement for safety representatives and safety delegates to have, if possible, two years experience of the work in question could have beneficial effects as regards the positive contribution to be made by these people in the discharge of their duties.

      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a)  The Minister may by regulations assign to safety representatives (in addition to those assigned by this Act) such functions, relating to the safety and health of the persons employed, as may be specified in the regulations.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give effect to a proposal which was agreed jointly by the two bodies I referred to earlier.  The purpose is to empower the Minister to add, by regulations, to the functions already assigned to safety representatives in the Bill as regards the safety and health of persons employed. Before making any such regulations the Minister is required to consult the representative bodies of the employers and the trade unions or analogous bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. It is a long time since the Second Stage of this Bill was taken but the House may recall that when we spoke on that Stage we were able to establish that the Minister, in framing and bringing this Bill before us, did not consult with such bodies as the faculty of occupational medicine in University College Dublin or the Association of Industrial Medical Officers.  That is why there are so many amendments to the Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is granting himself and his successors power to add to the responsibility of safety representatives in the area of safety and health.  I welcome also the fact that before he does so he will consult with the bodies concerned, including the trade unions and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> While we are dealing with the subject of bodies concerned with safety obviously one such body are the trade unions, as the subsection states.  One of the failures of the Bill is that it does not deal a lot more with the responsibility of trade unions and individuals in the matter of safety.  The temptation is there not to observe restrictions necessary for safety.  Trade unions could be encouraged to observe regulations and introduce into their procedures a system where every collective agreement is vetted for its implications for safety and health.  Very often a clash of interest arises between earnings and productivity on the one hand and safety and health on the other.  Too often earnings and productivity win.  That is because workers are interested in the few bob.  To balance that there might have been included in the Bill some incentive to the unions to appoint safety officers of their own or some provision to encourage more active participation by trade unions in the area of safety and health.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 23, to delete &ldquo;a tenement&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that, during the Committee Stage debate on the Bill, the Minister for Justice gave notice of his intention to move on Report Stage, if warranted, a further amendment concerning section 5 of the Bill.  The Minister was at that time examining a question that had been raised concerning the effect of the provisions of section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister explained to the House on Committee Stage, that question concerned the effect of the words &ldquo;the person making the letting&rdquo; and &ldquo;the person taking it&rdquo;.  The corresponding expressions in the 1931 Act provision, in section 2 (d) of the 1931 Act, are &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo;.  Since &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; are in effect defined, both in the 1931 Act and in the Bill, as including successors in title, the argument was put forward that the change could prevent an assignee of the original lessor or lessee from taking over and relying upon the original temporary convenience. That is, the argument runs, a temporary convenience letting is, initially at least, outside the scope of the legislation if it comes within the provisions of section 5 (1) (a) (iv), since that subsection excludes such lettings from the definition of a &ldquo;tenement&rdquo;.  However, it is argued, since an assignee of, say, the person making the letting is not himself that person, the application of section 5 (1) (a) (iv) may cease with the assignment, and with it <Col N="1287" /> the exclusion from the scope of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The change in the wording of section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill was, in fact, made so as to ensure that oral lettings for temporary convenience would come within the ambit of the provision&mdash;and hence would have the benefit of the exclusion from the definition of &ldquo;tenement&rdquo;&mdash;as well as lettings of that kind made in writing, to which alone the expression &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; refer.  The view was not taken that section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill would cease to apply by reason of an assignment of the letting.</P>
    <P>This matter is of particular importance in regard to the question of renewal rights for tenants who take lettings for temporary convenience in premises that are awaiting redevelopment. The Minister has had the matter examined by the Landlord and Tenant Commission and the commission have recommended that section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill be amended to make it clear that no change is being proposed in the law as it stands, in section 2 (d) of the 1931 Act, regarding the assignment of lettings for temporary convenience unless a change is intended.  No change is indeed intended in this regard and the Minister accepts the view of the commission that the provision should be made quite clear.  Amendment No. 34 proposes to do this by inserting in section 5 (1) (a) (iv) the words &ldquo;lessor or lessee&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;person making the letting or of the person taking it&rdquo;.  Section 5 (1) (a) (iv) will then represent the re-enactment of section 2 (d) of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, with the change that oral lettings for temporary convenience, as well as lettings for temporary convenience made in writing, will come within the scope of the provision, and will now do so in a way that is free from the ambiguity, or lack of clarity, that may be regarded as attaching to section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>To appreciate how this is brought about it is necessary to consider the effect of the changes that are proposed by amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  The effect of <Col N="1288" /> those changes is that the expressions &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; and &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; may now apply, in this Bill, to premises that do not comprise a &ldquo;tenement&rdquo;.  In section 3 (1) of the Bill the expressions &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; are defined as respectively including &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; and &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A temporary convenience letting to which section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill applies is, by definition, not a tenement. However, if amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are accepted the expressions &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; and &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; can be used in relation to such lettings.  Hence the reinstatement in section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill of the substance of the wording of section 2 (d) of the 1931 Act&mdash;including the references to &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo;&mdash;means that, in consequence of the altered definitions of &ldquo;lessor&rdquo;, &ldquo;lessee&rdquo;, &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; and &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in section 3 (1) of the Bill, as against the corresponding definitions in the 1931 Act, &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; in section 5 (1) (a) (iv) may relate to oral lettings for temporary convenience as well as to temporary convenience lettings that are made in writing.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> These are drafting amendments in order to clarify the position regarding the letting of temporary convenience. The Minister's statement has explained the position fairly well.  I should like to avail of this opportunity of welcoming the Minister of State on his first Bill in the House and to wish him well.</P>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that the effect of the amendment would be to put it beyond doubt that the expression &ldquo;temporary convenience&rdquo; is not confined to the original landlord or tenant but once it is a letting for temporary convenience it runs with the land and will remain a letting for temporary convenience in the hands of an assignee of the lessee interest or the lessor interest? I would like the Minister to clarify that for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>At rather greater length, the explanation of amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 and what they are designed to <Col N="1289" /> achieve is&mdash;(1) They ensure that the exclusion from a &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; of the kind of temporary convenience letting to which section 5 (1) (a) (iv) refers extends to an oral letting for temporary convenience of that kind as well as to a letting of that kind that is made in writing.  (2) They also ensure that the benefit of that exclusion extends to an assignee of the person, whether the person making the letting or the person taking it, for whose temporary convenience the letting is made.</P>
      <P>This is because, as a result of these three amendments&mdash;(a) section 5 (1) (a) (iv) now refers to &ldquo;lessor or lessee&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;person making the letting or of the person taking it&rdquo;; (b) &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; is defined&mdash;section 3 (1) of the Bill&mdash;as including the personal representatives and successors in title of a lessor and hence includes an assignee; (c) &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; is similarly defined, also in section 3 (1) of the Bill, and hence similarly includes an assignee; (d) &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; is also defined as including &ldquo;landlord&rdquo;; (e) &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; is also defined as including &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;; (f) where &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; can include &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; and where &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; can include &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; those expressions may relate to oral tenancies, as well as to tenancies that are in writing.  Apart from those inclusions &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; could relate only to tenancies in writing since &ldquo;lease&rdquo; is so defined, in section 3 (1) of the Bill, whereas &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; and &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; are expressions that may refer to oral tenancies as well as to leases; (g) the changes proposed by amendments Nos. 1 and 2 in the definitions of &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; and &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; enable those expressions to relate to tenancies that may <i>not</i> comprise a tenement, such as the kind of tenancy that is covered by section 5 (1) (a) (iv) of the Bill.  Hence &ldquo;lessor or lessee&rdquo; in section 5 (1) (a) (iv) now include &ldquo;landlord or tenant&rdquo; and hence may refer either to oral lettings for temporary convenience or to lettings of that kind that are in writing.</P>

      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i>, moved an amendment that was identical with this amendment that is now being moved.  Subsequently he withdrew that amendment on foot of an undertaking given by the Minister for Justice to re-examine the matter so as to see whether he could meet the Deputy on the point.</P>
      <P>The matter has been given careful consideration and the amendments now before the House are the result.  The effect of these three amendments will be that a tenant's right to serve a valid notice claiming a new tenancy will be preserved for a period of up to three months after service by the landlord of notice of the termination of the tenancy instead of a period of only one month as proposed in the Bill as it stands&mdash;apart from tenancies coming under sections 14 and 15 of the Bill, where a period of six months is provided.  The amendments imply acceptance of the argument put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick that narrow time-limits in section 20, could, in practice, delay rather than expedite proceedings in relation to a claim for a new tenancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may recall that, in opposing Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister for Justice pointed out that the Landlord and Tenant Commission were concerned in a number of recommendations made by them in their First Report, to shorten <Col N="1292" /> the time-limits provided in the 1931 Act so as to speed up the various procedures under the legislation.  On foot of this undertaking to Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Minister has had these various time-limits re-examined but he has concluded that&mdash;save for those time-limits that are the subject of the amendments&mdash;no valid ground exists for the extension of any of the other time-limits provided in the Bill. This is apart from a change in the time-limit provided by section 56 of the Bill which in its terms is linked with the section 20 time-limits and where a change is involved consequential on the changes in section 20.</P>
    <P>The time-limits in section 20 relate to the most important right of all under the Bill&mdash;the right of an occupational tenant to obtain the grant of a new tenancy.  A tenant who far any reason failed to act within those time-limits would normally be committed to seek an extension of time under section 82 of the Bill, whatever the expense for him that that might involve.  Accordingly, it is accepted that a too-narrow time-limit in section 20 could in practice give rise to additional delay, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has argued, rather than to a more expeditious procedure, and could perhaps also give rise to hardship.  Moreover, there is a case to be made for having the time-limits in section 20 the same as the corresponding time-limit in section 31 of the Bill where the grant of a reversionary lease is in question, and that also is achieved by these amendments.  They further simplify the Bill, and it will be useful for practitioners to know that a single time-limit applies to applications whether for the grant of a new tenancy or for the grant of a reversionary lease.</P>
    <P>However, no such case exists for extending other time-limits provided elsewhere in the Bill, and where those other time-limits are concerned the general view that was taken by the Landlord and Tenant Commission is valid, that is, that the procedures under the legislation should, where feasible, be speeded up.  This is particularly the case in regard to the procedures relating to compensation for improvements under Part IV of the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am obliged to the Minister for introducing these amendments which arise from an argument put forward by me on Committee Stage where I argued that a period of one month was too short and would in many cases lead to the notices not being served in time with a consequent application to the court under a subsequent section of the Bill for an extension of the time.  The net result of the whole operation would be as I have said to prolong and delay the implementation of the tenant's rights rather than hurry it up.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 15, after &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and assuming demand for such tenements in the area is normal&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 seeks to add to section 23 (5) &ldquo;and assuming demand for such tenements in the area is normal&rdquo;. In order to explain the position I will have to go back to the Bill as introduced. Section 23 of the Bill as introduced contains the machinery for fixing the rent of a new tenancy to which a <Col N="1294" /> tenant is entitled under the Bill.  Section 23 (5) reads:</P>
    <P>(5)  The gross rent shall be the rent which in the opinion of the Court a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the tenement, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and in such circumstances that the supply of similar tenements is sufficient to meet the demand and the competition therefor is normal and having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and to the letting values of tenements of a similar character to the tenement and situate in a comparable area but without regard to any goodwill which may exist in respect of the tenement.</P>
    <P>That subsection contains the formula for fixing the gross rent of the premises under the new lease.  It follows a similar subsection in the 1931 Act.  On Committee Stage the Minister introduced an amendment which excluded from subsection (5) the words &ldquo;and in such circumstances that the supply of similar tenements is sufficient to meet the demand and the competition therefor is normal&rdquo;.  Those words were in the 1931 Act also but as a result of some remarks made by Mr. Justice Kenny in the Supreme Court, the Minister reconsidered the Bill as introduced and decided to exclude from subsection (5) the words to which I have referred.  On Committee Stage I argued to the best of my ability that the effect of those words in the 1931 Act was to ensure that in fixing a rent of a new tenancy the court was precluded from having regard to a situation in which there was a scarcity of houses, that a court would be precluded from fixing the rent of a premises on what I referred to as a scarce commodity basis.  That provision was desirable and absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the learned Mr. Justice Kenny said he did not know what the words meant.  Whatever they meant, they were a direction to the court that in fixing a rent of a new lease the court should proceed on the basis that there was reasonable demand for a house of a <Col N="1295" /> similar nature to the one in question and that there was a reasonable supply of those houses to meet demand.  Without those words the court may fix a rent on the basis that there is a scarcity of the type of house in question, that, indeed, there is only one such premises available and, that therefore, the letting value of the house is exceptionally high.  In other words, the court is invited to fix the rent of the house on what I referred to, for want of a better phrase, as a black market basis.  We all know that during the last war commodities were sold on the black market when they were in short supply and that such commodities realised prices that were far greater than their normal or reasonable value.  The words which the Minister excluded from this section on Committee Stage take away a protection which existed in favour of the tenant and which prevented a tenant being exploited in the fixing of a new rent on the basis that there was an acute shortage of premises of the type in question and in respect of which a renewed tenancy was being sought. While arguing this point on Committee Stage I got the impression that the Minister considered me to have a point and that he intended to have another look at the situation.  I am confident that this reconsideration has taken place and I should be very interested in hearing what the Minister for State has to say about the amendment.</P>
    <P>Until such time as I may hear a solid argument to the contrary, I am convinced that the effect of the amendment of the law by way of this Bill will be such as to direct the court to have regard to the letting value of a premises in the area concerned.  The subsection reads now:</P>
    <P>The gross rent shall be the rent which in the opinion of the Court a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the tenement, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and to the letting values of tenements of a similar character to the tenement and situate in a comparable area but without <Col N="1296" /> regard to any goodwill which may exist in respect of the tenement.</P>
    <P>The real consideration is the letting value of the tenement situate in a comparable area and a comparable area will be an area in which there is only one or perhaps two such tenements and where there is a big population to be served. What could be in question for example, could be a licensed premises.  There might be only one licensed premises in an area and that situation would inflate immediately and enormously the letting value of that premises.  But let us say that what is involved is a private house and that for some reason there has been considerable development in the area without the number of private houses being built keeping pace with the demands of the people working in the area.  In such circumstances there would be an inflated-value situation with an artificial value being put on the premises and the tenant being exploited accordingly. Alternatively the premises concerned might be a small shop and there could be a Navan-type situation in which there would be many people working in the town concerned with the result that the value of the premises would be inflated enormously.</P>
    <P>What I am aiming to do is to save the tenant from such a situation.  Perhaps if I had tabled an amendment framed exactly in the terms of the section as it appeared originally it would have been ruled out of order as something which had been decided on Committee but in order to find a platform for my argument I have sought to amend the new subsection (5), which reads:</P>
    <P>The gross rent shall be the rent which in the opinion of the Court a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the tenement, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and to the letting values of tenements of a similar character to the tenement and situate in a comparable area but without regard to any goodwill which may exist in respect of the tenement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> I want to add to that: &ldquo;and assuming demand for such tenements in the area is normal.&rdquo;  That would take away the blackmail element or the scarcity element to which otherwise this subsection is wide open.  The basis of this landlord and tenant law is to make sure that things which should not be taken into account will not be taken into account.  One of them is that goodwill shall not be taken into account because usually the goodwill is built up by the tenant and is not contributed to by the landlord.</P>
    <P>The second thing I say should not be taken into account&mdash;and it should be made impossible to take it into account&mdash;is fixing a rent in what I call a scarce commodity situation.  That is wrong.  It was never intended that that should be done.  The amendment of the law on Committee Stage of this Bill will direct the court, among other things, to take into account the fact that there is a scarcity of similar tenements or premises in the area.  I do not want the court to take into account the fact that there are more of such premises than are necessary.  That would not be right either.  I want the court to be obliged to proceed on the basis that the demand for such tenements in the area is normal, that there is a normal market, that houses are not lying idle.</P>
    <P>I do not want them to proceed on the basis that people cannot get houses in the area and that we would have an auctioneer going into the witness box and saying he had ten people looking for similar houses but he had no house to give them.  At times auctioneers can be colourful.  An auctioneer could say: &ldquo;I had ten people in last week for houses like this.  I had not one house to let.  I could have let ten if I had them.  `What would you get for them?'  `Anything I asked.&rdquo;'</P>
    <P>With all due respect to Mr. Justice Kenny, that is the situation which will be created here.  I am against that.  That is why I was surprised that the Minister did not see fit to re-incorporate the words he proposed to exclude from the section.  If <Col N="1298" /> he thought the words were ambiguous or hard to follow, I am sure Mr. Justice Kenny or the Landlord and Tenant Commission could have suggested words which would be clearer but which would have the same effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not concern lettings of dwelling houses except incidentally and in odd cases, and has very little connection with residential rents.  In Part II it is primarily a code for the renewal of business tenancies.  &ldquo;In a comparable area&rdquo; can mean any comparable area.  In the 1931 Act it was restricted to the vicinity.  The change was made to meet the very point Deputy Fitzpatrick was making.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the Minister for Justice moved amendment No. 26 to subsection (5) of section 23 of the Bill which was agreed to on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  That amendment deleted the words &ldquo;and in such circumstances that the supply of similar tenements is sufficient to meet the demand and the competition therefor is normal&rdquo; from subsection (5), leaving it as it now stands.  Deputies may further recall that the deletion of those words arose particularly from adverse comments made thereon by Mr. Justice Kenny in the Supreme Court.  That criticism by the Supreme Court was echoed and supported during the debate on this Bill in Seanad Éireann and was subsequently endorsed by the Landlord and Tenant Commission, who had been asked by the Minister for Justice to examine the provisions in question on foot of the Supreme Court criticism.  The commission in substance recommended the change in the law that was proposed in the Committee Stage amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, in speaking to that amendment, expressed the fear that the deletion of the words in question could lead to a situation where a scarcity of supply might mean that the court, in fixing a gross rent under section 23, would fix a rent that was inflated by that scarcity of supply.  The amendment he now proposes is apparently designed to eliminate that possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> The Minister for Justice has given this matter careful consideration but the proposed amendment cannot be accepted. In the first place, it seems appropriate to remind the House that the code of law with which we are now dealing is not, and was never intended to be, a code of rent control.  There is, indeed, a separate code dealing with that issue, and it would not be proper to attempt to insert rent control provisions in this Bill. The part of the code we are here concerned with gives the tenant security in his tenancy, protects his investment in any improvements he has made and prevents the landlord from exploiting the tenant's goodwill.  It does not otherwise purport to interfere with market rents.</P>
    <P>Secondly, on a careful examination of the Deputy's amendment, the Minister feels that the substance of it, compared with the words that were deleted from this section on Committee Stage, are so close to one another that acceptance of the amendment would virtually mean his rejection of the very arguments used to support the Committee Stage amendment. However re-examination does not lead to the rejection of those arguments. On the contrary, it appears to strengthen them.  To say that demand is to be assumed to be normal is to imply that it is neither too great&mdash;when supply is too short&mdash;nor too low&mdash;when supply exceeds demand.  Demand is surely only &ldquo;normal&rdquo; when supply and demand are in equilibrium and supply and demand are always in equilibrium at, and only at, an appropriate level of rent, high rent or low rent, depending on the levels of demand and of supply.  This brings us back to the unworkable concept deleted from the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Additionally, I am not at all sure that, even if the amendment were acceptable, it would produce the results Deputy Fitzpatrick desires.  In the first place, the words proposed in the amendment could, I submit, be validly interpreted in the following way.  In the Dublin city centre area demand for business premises often exceeds supply at the level of hitherto-prevailing rents.  Is the <Col N="1300" /> court, therefore, to be obliged to assume in Dublin city centre cases that that situation is to be ignored that is, that demand in that area is always stable?</P>
    <P>In the second place, the amendment appears to take no account of the situation&mdash;albeit a less common one&mdash;where supply actually exceeds demand at current levels of rent.  In such a case the amendment, as drafted, would itself result in the fixing of an artificially high rent, which presumably is what the Deputy seeks to avoid.</P>
    <P>All in all, I do not think that the amendment is either necessary or desirable.  I feel that this is one of the areas where we should lay down sufficient guidelines&mdash;but only sufficient guidelines&mdash;for the courts and allow them to use their discretion and proven sound judgement in applying the law in a just and even-handed fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In the first place, I am utterly amazed to hear from the Minister of State that this Bill deals almost exclusively with business premises and only in a marginal or peripheral way with dwelling houses.  That simply is not so.  This Bill goes out of its way to bring more dwelling houses under the scope of the Bill.  It goes out of its way to give more and more tenants of private dwelling houses the right to avail of a new tenancy, the right to come into court and claim a new tenancy.  The Minister of State rightly referred to Part II of the Bill, which gives the right to a new tenant. Section 13 states:</P>
      <P>(1)  This Part applies to a tenement at any time if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the tenement was, during the whole of the period of three years ending at that time, continously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant immediately before that time or of his predecessors in title and bona fide used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that if a person is a tenant of a premises for three years and is carrying <Col N="1301" /> on a business he is entitled to a new tenancy if he complies with the other provisions of Part II.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of section 13 (1) states:</P>
    <P>the tenement was, during the whole of the period of twenty years ending at that time, continously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant immediately before that time or of his predecessors in title, or</P>
    <P>There is no word there about a business premises.  I am speaking from memory but I think I am correct in saying that the period of 20 years is in substitution for 30 years in the old Bill.  The qualifying period for a new tenancy of a private house is being reduced by one-third from 30 to 20 years.  Probably the Minister has been handed his brief at short notice but it is not correct to say that this Bill is all about business premises and does not concern private premises.  I got from the Minister an admission that my interpretation is correct.  It will leave it open to the court to fix the rent on a scarce commodity basis and the Minister acknowledged that.  I think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>Neither is it correct to say that the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, is not about rent control.  Of course it is.  It entitles a tenant to a new lease on reasonable terms.  Goodwill is to be disregarded. Other guidelines are given but the words that are excluded were written into the 1931 Act and there can be no doubt about that.  I have been confirmed in my opinion as a result of what the Minister said.  As I said on Committee Stage, the words in the 1931 Act mean that the court is not to fix a rent on a scarce commodity basis.  The people who introduced the 1931 Act knew what they were doing.  What they were saying in the words they used is what I am saying in other words, namely, that the court is to assume that demand is normal, not abnormal.  I do not accept the Minister's argument that this could lead to the fixing of a very high rent against the tenant. That could only arise if there were houses or other tenements idle in the immediate area.  In such a case the tenant <Col N="1302" /> could move into one of those houses and not apply for a renewal of his tenancy. He could negotiate with the landlord on a reasonable basis and would not have to go to court.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Government have fallen for this argument.  I am surprised they have taken this backward step and are putting on the Statute Book a measure that will lead to the exploitation of tenants.  This trend is evident throughout the Bill.  In the section dealing with reversionary leases new ground rents are being created.  I refer to that matter in passing because I shall deal with it at length later.  Elaborate provisions are made for new ground rents which the Government were supposed to abolish.  I am amazed and disappointed that in 1980 a modern Government should seek to change the law in this way, should seek to change the law by inviting the courts to fix the new rent of long-standing tenants, who may have been in occupation for 50 or 60 years, on the basis of a scarcity of accommodation. That is what the Government are doing.</P>
    <P>Sometimes when I come across something like this in a Bill I wonder if I am reading it correctly.  When I moved this amendment I thought the Minister might have an explanation to show me that my interpretation was wrong.  I might have been a little embarrassed but at least I would have been satisfied that what I feared was not the case. However, the Minister brazenly said that my interpretation was correct.  He told me the Bill was not about private houses, even though it is and he went on to say that the Bill was not about rent control, but it is.  It is about fixing the rents of small business premises and private houses on a reasonable basis and renewing the rents on a reasonable basis.</P>
    <P>The argument that in Dublin city centre, if the amendment is accepted, tenants might be penalised by having their rents fixed higher, is not valid.  This could work adversely to a tenant only in a scarce situation, but all the premises we are dealing with have been occupied for a long time and in 99 per cent of the <Col N="1303" /> cases they are tenements in which the tenants are responsible for all repairs and the landlords have not to put a paint brush on them or a nail in them.  They are the tenants who are being exploited by this amending legislation, notwithstanding all the Fianna Fáil talk about abolishing ground rents, about making it easier to get houses and cheaper to keep them.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister of State should have been sent in here to try to justify this just because some judge did <Col N="1304" /> not like the phraseology.  A person coming across that phraseology would have to stop and think, but is that not what judges are paid for?  This has stood the test from 1931 to date and it was always interpreted as being an inhibition against fixing rents on a black market basis, a scarce commodity basis or on the basis that there were far more tenants looking for them than premises on the market. This provision is wrong and I strongly oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take all possible steps to promote a deeper understanding among the different communities in this island of the richness and diversity of our heritage and to encourage cultural co-operation among them in every way, building upon existing co-operation in historical and national monument research, in archival study and between the cultural organisations, especially between the two Arts Councils.</P>
      <P>A number of measures are under active consideration at present and any suitable opportunity that arises to achieve the objective the Deputy has in mind will be availed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that in the past there has been an appalling neglect of promoting a general and greater awareness of the common cultural heritage between the communities in the North and South?  Would the Taoiseach now indicate more fully what steps he hopes to take in this noncontroversial area to promote greater awareness?</P>

      <P>While I accept what the Taoiseach says to a limited extent, surely there is a common basis for agreement, a common cultural heritage between the two communities, North and South?  If the Taoiseach would work at that he would have a basis for some form of agreement between the two communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the practice of charging VAT on invoices by wholesale bottlers to retail vintners and that VAT is being charged twice on some accounts; and the action he is taking to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the matter raised by the Deputy refers to a misunderstanding among some traders that the recent budget increases in the tax element in the retail price of certain goods did not include VAT.  Consequently in some cases the amount of increase charged by wholesale bottlers to retail vintners was calculated on the basis that all of the tax increase announced in the budget was an excise duty increase to which the appropriate VAT rate would also apply.  I understand from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism that all cases are being investigated <Col N="1308" /> where complaints of overcharging have been made as a result of this misunderstanding among traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to confirm that refunds will be made to retail publicans who have had to pay this additional money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the increase, say, in regard to pint bottles of ale and stout of 6p under this budget is being invoiced at about 72p gross, and that VAT is being added on a second time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case it is a misunderstanding; it is a mistake.  Arising out of the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question, I should say that of course those who have been charged in excess by way of this misunderstanding will be refunded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the excise duty increase in the budget inclusive or exclusive of VAT, the actual increase?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the measures he intends to implement to bring Ireland's rate of inflation into line with that of our EMS partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of the inflation rate in Ireland, relative to that in other EMS member countries, will depend on the comparative contributions <Col N="1309" /> to inflation in the various countries by external and internal factors.  Holding our exchange rate stable within the EMS, which the Government are determined to do, will tend to bring the external contribution to inflation in Ireland in line with that in other EMS member countries.  On the internal contribution, the Government are determined, as I said in my Budget speech, on the disciplined pursuit of sound economic policies.  The development of incomes is clearly critical to the success of efforts to reduce the internal contribution to inflation, and the co-operation of the social partners in this area is vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting the Minister's own definition of an internal contribution, would the Minister agree that it is not unfair to characterise the recent budget as one which has contributed to our rate of inflation, some commentators say by as much as 4 per cent?  In these circumstances would the Minister please indicate to the House what measures he proposes to take during the year to wind down inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already taken measures in the budget in which those various indirect increases were announced to ensure that, in terms of real income, both by way of the new income tax allowances and the significant improvement in social welfare benefits, this will be a very real net benefit in terms of spending power.  As far as the actual impact on the consumer price index is concerned&mdash;which as the Deputy will be aware is not related to consumption; if consumption falls in respect of any of the items of discretionary expenditure on which taxes were raised in the budget, the consumer price index continues to go up&mdash;it is of the order, as I said yesterday in the House to the Leader of the Labour Party, of 3.8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Irish inflation rate this year, left to itself&mdash;giving us, say, an annualised rate of 20 per cent&mdash;means that the Irish pound will be very isolated indeed <Col N="1310" /> by the autumn of this year in the EMS, and that our exchange rate maintenance will be very difficult if our rate of inflation is at the figure suggested by comparison with that of other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, first of all, the Irish £ has been performing very well within the EMS.  Secondly, inflation rates are even higher among our partners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the last to suggest that this very open economy which is so energy dependent is not influenced by these external factors and that internal factors, over which we have exclusive control, become all the more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in this House yesterday and today that he has contributed directly to the rate of inflation 3.8 per cent.  What steps has he in mind that might reduce it by the same amount before the year is out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can put that interpretation on what I said if he likes.  I asked that the budget statement be seen in its totality and the Deputy is not doing that.  The totality of the budget statement was geared towards a very clear and consistent line relating to our balance of payments, borrowing requirements, budget deficits and a consistent economic and social policy.  It is unreasonable to pick out one element and say that that is a measure of the Government's statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister accepts that there is a valid contribution to be made at home for keeping our inflation rate within bounds, how does he visualise the reaction of the trade union leaders in the forthcoming talks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there was an internal contribution to the rate of inflation.  How does he envisage the trade union leaders will respond when the increase in the inflation rate has been contributed to by him and the Government in the recent budget?  The trade unions will have to seek compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the net impact of the budget will be to considerably increase the purchasing power in real terms of all people, including the social partners and the trade unions and I hope the response of the trade unions will take note of that.  After that, it is a matter for negotiation in the national understanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to a leading British stockbroking firm's assessment as reported in the media (details supplied) that the exchange rate of the Irish pound is likely to depreciate during the second half of this year and that there will be little improvement in the balance of payments deficit which would lead to a further drain on the external reserves and necessitate further foreign borrowings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Various reports of this kind are issued from time to time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on them.  However, I do not accept this report's assessment as regards the exchange rate for the Irish pound.  Our currency has been, and continues <Col N="1312" /> to be, stable within the European Monetary System and the Government are committed to protecting the stability of the exchange rate.  As regards the position on the balance of payments, the external reserves and foreign borrowing, I dealt with these matters comprehensively in my budget statement on 27 February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This report was issued by a prestigious British firm who put out reasonably accurate reports on the Irish economy before now.  Presuming the Minister read the report, what does he think of their analysis of the balance of payments situation, which they said would remain at a very high figure for the remainder of the year leading to further drains on our external reserves before the end of the year?  In particular what did he think of their analysis that a supplementary budget would be required by the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance of payments will not have any self-correcting mechanism.  It is a matter within our own control in terms of our export productivity to ensure that our balance of payments will be at an acceptable level.  In absolute terms it may be that the balance of payments figure might be close enough to the figure referred to in the report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allocated £500,000 to Dublin County Council in the current year for the Western Parkway/Southern Cross route.  This amount includes a sum of £100,000 to meet land acquisition costs on the section of the route between Greenhills Road and Naas Road.  The balance of £400,000 is to meet land acquisition costs and construction work on the section between Tallaght Road and Firhouse Road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the progress being made by Dublin County Council in relation to the acquisition of land for the Southern Cross route?  Is he aware that, unless some action is taken and more speedy progress made on the acquisition of land, traffic congestion in the Dundrum-Templeogue-Rathfarnham area will reach crisis proportions within a few years?  Is the Minister satisfied that the money allocated is sufficient to meet the county council needs and if not will he provide more money if requested?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned they are acquiring the land.  Some of the <Col N="1325" /> acquisition, as the Deputy probably realises, takes quite some time because of CPOs.  The Deputy may or may not mean that I should interfere in some way to hasten the acquisition of land.  I am not permitted to do that where a CPO is concerned because I am the final arbitrator with regard to the outcome of the CPO.  I imagine that Dublin County Council are doing their utmost to acquire the land, at first without CPOs, and then, if necessary, by using the CPOs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there appears to be terrible delays. There have always been delays in regard to CPOs.  There is a procedure which has to be gone through under the present legislation.  This procedure is constitutional and otherwise and it could end up in the Four Courts.  I am not a legal man.  We try to proceed as fast as possible with regard to appointing an officer to carry out the inquiry and then we have to await the report of the particular officer, try to hurry the thing up and try to get a final decision on it.</P>

Quite a number have been repaired since July 1977 and more and more money has been made available for the local improvements scheme since that time.  Quite a lot of work has been carried out throughout the counties but some counties, such as Mayo, are in quite a bad way despite the fact that they have been getting the largest allocation for the last two years. The number of roads awaiting repairs has grown rapidly in two years.  I would like to have more money available this year, or at least the same amount as last year, but in the present economic constraints I have allocated the money available as fairly as I can with regard to schemes that are approved and ready to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will outline the changes made in the national differential rents scheme, the categories of payments now included for assessment purposes by the rent authority and the additional categories of payment, including bonus, overtime and shift allowance not previously included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Following meetings during recent months between officials of the Departments of the Environment and Finance with officials representing local authorities, and with members of the National Executive of the National Association of Tenants' Organisations in regard to the terms of a draft national rents scheme for local authority rented dwellings in 1980, prepared by my Department, I met representatives of that association on Tuesday, 25 March and informed them of the amendments which I was prepared to make in the draft scheme as a result of their representations.  The following is a summary of the new scheme:</P>
      <P>The income to be assessed for differential rent will be the income from all sources, including social welfare payments but excluding income tax and social welfare contributions, overtime payments, bonus payments, special allowances for shift working, children's allowances, disabled persons allowances, supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Differential rent will be assessed at a fraction, varying from one-twentieth to one-seventh, of the assessable income.  In order to offset the effects of rent increases which would arise from the assessment in full, of incomes, particularly in the lower income groups, I <Col N="1331" /> have made substantial increases in the present assessable incomes to which the rent fractions apply.  For example, the lowest fraction of income hitherto assessed for rent purposes was one-twelfth of incomes up to £19 a week.  Under the 1980 scheme, income of up to £36 a week will be assessed at only one-twentieth and the upper limit of one-seventh rent fraction will apply only where the assessable income exceeds £55, as against £39 a week in the 1979 scheme.</P>
    <P>A revised method of fixing maximum rents of new and existing dwellings is being introduced which will result in a more equitable spread of maximum rents over all rented dwellings, new and old. Increases in rent resulting from this procedure will, in 1980, be limited to £1.50 a week in any case.  This increase will, of course, apply only in cases in which income warrants such an addition.</P>
    <P>Fixed rents of local authority houses&mdash;generally those let prior to 1960&mdash;will be increased by 30p a week. It is open to any tenant on a fixed rent to opt instead to be placed on a defferential rent.</P>
    <P>Subsidiary earners in a differential rented house will continue to contribute one-seventh of any income over £14 a week, up to a maximum contribution of £1.50 a week for any such earner.</P>
    <P>The minimum differential rent payable in any case will be 15p a week as against 10p a week in 1979.  The new scheme will come into operation at the beginning of May 1980.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer subsidy to meet loan charges on the provision of local authority rented houses will, this year, be £62 million, an increase of some £8.5 million over last year.  Local authorities are responsible for the costs of administration, maintenance, repair and insurance of their housing estates and to meet these costs are dependent on rental income and a proportion of the proceeds of sales and must meet the balance from their own resources including income from rates.  The new scheme is designed to ensure that tenants who can afford to do so will pay their fair share of rent.  I <Col N="1332" /> am satisfied that the scheme will go some way towards meeting the present substantial imbalance as between expenditure on the maintenance and management of the houses and receipts from rent.  Furthermore, I consider that it is fair and equitable to all categories of tenants and that no tenant will be required to pay a rent which he cannot reasonably afford.</P>
    <P>As in previous years, housing authorities have been requested to seek certificates of income from tenants in preparation for the implementation of the revised scheme.  Such income is, in general, the weekly rate of remuneration, exclusive of shift allowances, bonus payments and overtime.  No change has been made from previous years in the categories of income assessed for rent purposes.</P>

      <P>In notifying road authorities of road grant allocations for 1980, attention has again been directed to the provision and maintenance of road traffic signs.  Road authorities are from time to time reminded by special communications of the need to rectify deficiencies in the condition of signs.

      <P>Provisions for the regulation and control of parking are set out in by-laws made by the Garda Commissioner under the Road Traffic Acts. While I am conscious of the difficulties which disabled drivers face in parking their cars, there is the problem that exemption from parking prohibitions and restrictions could be a source of danger to the disabled drivers themselves and <Col N="1339" /> their vehicles, and to other road-users and could lead to traffic hold-ups.  I may add that disabled drivers are exempt, on written application to Dublin Corporation, from the payment of parking meter fees and that a similar concession applies in Cork city from the payment of disc parking fees there.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a statement.  This morning in the House on the basis of incorrect information and in the absence of Deputy Harte for reasons known to you, I said he had been refused the reason for the non-answer to a question <Col N="1344" /> of his.  Subsequently I discovered I had been incorrectly informed on that matter and I want to set the record straight.  In fact, he was informed of the reason.  The reason he was given was that the matter was one which occurred outside the jurisdiction and the precedent was against the answering of such questions. To give some examples&mdash;and they are merely examples&mdash;I wish to mention to the House that in Government I answered questions on the following subjects. Volume 274, Question No. 10, Crossmaglen GAA Park; Volume 273, Question No. 2, Northern Ireland internee; Volume 271, Question No. 28, British SAS; Volume 269, Question No. 40, Use of C.R. Gas; Volume 267, Question No. 11, Northern Ireland internees; Question No. 14, British forces in Northern Ireland; and, most relevant of all, Question No. 18, death of an Irish citizen killed on a concession road.  In the light of those precedents which are only a few arising from my own personal experience, I should like the Chair to reconsider the basis of the decision made in respect of Deputy Harte's question.</P>

By way of helping the Deputy, I gave him a number of similar cases that were rejected in the past and some of them occurred when the Deputy was in office.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  My concern was that if I did not challenge the matter now the ruling given to Deputy Harte that the question could not be answered because the matter happened outside the jurisdiction might be taken to be a binding precedent for the future when there are many precedents in the opposite direction.  It seems to me most undesirable that this House should not be able to ask whether Ministers have inquired into matters that occur in <Col N="1346" /> Northern Ireland.  In so many cases when these matters have been raised questions have been answered and the responsibility for making inquiries about them has been accepted.  It has also happened in cases concerning Irish citizens in Britain.  The idea of a precedent being created that such matters occurring outside the jurisdiction cannot be raised here is one that we could not accept and I would ask the Chair to look at the matter again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes the recent increases in Associated Bank interest rates.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the four associated banks on Friday, 11 April, announced increases in their lending and deposit rates with effect from close of business on that date.  On the deposits side, the increases were 1.5 percentage points for all sums up to £25,000 and 2.5 percentage points on sums of £25,000 and more.  Lending rates went up by 1 to 2.5 percentage points, depending on the category of borrower and the term of the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of these changes is that the lending rates now being charged by the associated banks range from 18 to 21 per cent.  Because they affect the majority of borrowers in all walks of life, they have given rise to a good deal of comment.  The Government, therefore, have decided it would be proper to afford <Col N="1348" /> the House the opportunity to consider these events.</P>
    <P>I trust that Deputies will use the occasion to debate the matter calmly and with a due appreciation of its importance and, as regards some aspects, its sensitivity.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are influenced by several factors, domestic and external.  In our case, as a small open economy, the external factors loom large.  Since June 1979, when the associated banks last changed their rates, the rise in rates abroad has continued unabated.  Every member state of the EEC has increased rates at least once, and in some cases, more frequently, since June last.  Even Germany, a country of low interest rates, has raised rates steadily so that they are now almost 50 per cent higher than in June last.  In Belgium also the rate of increase has been 50 per cent and in the Netherlands 59 per cent.  It may come as a surprise to hear that the increase in the associated banks' prime lending rate, after last week's move, is at 16 per cent, the lowest in the Community.</P>
    <P>Countries outside the EEC have all been experiencing higher interest rates, notably the United States where the prime lending rate has reached an all-time record at 20 per cent.  The litany in fact is almost endless.  The main cause of this development is the increasing determination of the western world to bring down inflation.  This is a big factor in the recent policy actions of the United States authorities, which have &ldquo;spill over&rdquo; effects through the international Eurodollar markets.  Another important element is the problem of dealing with growing surpluses of the oil producers as rising oil prices eat at the economic stability of all our countries.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked what have these events abroad to do with Ireland? More particularly, what have they to do with the domestic interest rates of the associated banks?  For the record, let me remind the House that there are 45 banks licensed and carrying on business in the state.  Four are the associated banks.  Traditionally, they have operated <Col N="1349" /> agreed scales of charges and interest rates.  With their long history and presence in every part of the country, they are not unaturally seen as &ldquo;the banks&rdquo;.  Indeed, for many they are the banking system.  But let us not forget the other 40 or so banks.  These are the non-associated banks, a category that scarcely existed 20 years ago but which now account for some 25 per cent of the total resources of the banking system.  These banks include domestic and foreign institutions. They operate in a relatively free market where interest rates are determined according to the supply and demand for funds.  This market is sensitive to economic developments at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The interest rates of the non-associated banks are not left solely to the vagaries of the market.  The Central Bank helps to smooth the interest rates in the interbank market and prevent sharp seasonal variations in non-associated banks' rates.  Generally not only non-associated banks, but all bank interest rates must inevitably reflect market forces.  If not and if interest rates, important as they are, were made an end in themselves, some other policy aim, such as the maintenance of the exchange rate, would be seriously endangered.</P>
    <P>For instance, only recently the German authorities have found it necessary to increase their interest rates in order to moderate the depreciation of their currency, perhaps the strongest in the world, against the US Dollar.  Low interest rates here, at a time of high international rates, could produce outward capital flows endangering the exchange rate and leading to a devaluation-inflation spiral.</P>
    <P>Capital outflows would deplete the reserves.  It could also be that the banking system would simply contract in the face of a limitation on lending rates when market conditions suggested that rates should be higher.  Moreover, low levels of deposit rates would be unfair to savers and would discourage savings.  This would be an incentive to increased consumption, <Col N="1350" /> with adverse effects on the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>If the Central Ban were to inject funds into the inter-bank market to reduce market interest rates the ultimate result would be capital outflows and loss of external reserves.  In the longer run an injection of funds into the market need not succeed in keeping market interest rates down.  The reserves' losses would themselves reduce liquidity in the economy and tend to push interest rates back up again.  Ultimately, the external reserves would be exhausted with consequence that can readily be imagined.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank, in fact, has temporarily reduced the banks' primary liquidity ratios, which has released about £50 million into the market, keeping interest rates somewhat below the level, at which they would otherwise be.  In addition, the Central Bank has short-term credit facilities in place for banks, to be used at their request, and has earlier this year released funds in some quantity into the financial market.  The rates, nevertheless, have tended to rise because of the upward movement in world interest rates and the financing of the current balance-of-payments deficit this year.</P>
    <P>The fact is that if the forces tending to push up interest rates were resisted too strongly there would be a tendency for the external reserves to fall as capital inflows are deterred and capital outflows encouraged.  Once it is appreciated that the broad trend of interest rates cannot be frustrated, the difficulty of trying to control one set of financial institutions, in this case the associated banks, should become clearer.  If one were to judge by the amendments put down by the Opposition, however, it is not appreciated. Perhaps, the Labour Party have some formula for controlling interest rates without unpleasant consequences for our economy?  or perhaps they would be content to see the associated banks lose resources with a real reduction in banking business and a drying-up of credit facilities for the majority of people?</P>
    <P>As the Central Bank indicated in its statement on Friday, large interest rate <Col N="1351" /> differentials have developed between the associated and non-associated banks. Their ability to attract funds was being impaired, while, at the same time, demand for their relatively cheaper credit was growing.  A degree of conflict was developing between interest rates and monetary policy with its aim of ensuring adequate external reserves and an orderly, controlled expansion of domestic credit.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is appropriate to refer to the EMS connection.  Our link with our EMS partners is our commitment to keep the exchange rate for the Irish pound from devaluing or revaluing by more than a certain margin <i>vis-á-vis</i> other EMS currencies.  Prime lending rates in the other EMS countries now range from 10.75 to 19.50 per cent. There is some flexibility for exchange rate movement and there is always the possibility of realignment of currencies within the EMS band.</P>
    <P>The main Opposition party blame the Government for depriving the people of the possibility of cheaper credit opened up by membership of the EMS. &ldquo;Possibility&rdquo; is the key-word.  Provided we accept the appropriate disciplines and the necessary measures to bring our inflation rate more into line with that of our partners, then, in time, we could aspire to lower interest rates.  But even then we could not ignore international trends.  I gave some examples earlier of the way rates have been moving in the EEC.  They were nominal rates.  It is also worth noting that some analyses indicate that, when account is taken of movements in prices, real interest rates in this country are among the lowest, if not the lowest, in the Community.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect to be able to stand aside from these developments in EMS countries if we are to maintain the stability of our exchange rate in the EMS band.  If we allow our rates to get out of line we stand to lose capital.  Loss of funds in this way would, in turn, add to the pressures that are already on our external reserves as a result of our balance of payments deficit and would call into <Col N="1352" /> question the Government's ability to hold our exchange rate in the EMS.</P>
    <P>This is an appropriate point to mention the exchange controls which, though they afford a degree of protection, cannot insulate us from external influences. Exchange controls relate to capital movements.  Leads and lags in relation to payment for our trade, even in relation to one month's transactions could, on their own, exceed the total level of official external reserves.</P>
    <P>As regards financial transactions, exchange controls do not and cannot relate to non-residents who have large balances and holdings of financial and other assets within the State, all of which could be run down at their wish.</P>
    <P>As regards residents, they have large liabilities to abroad and could run them down without being restricted by exchange control, which must allow residents to pay their debts abroad.  In addition, exchange control cannot force residents to borrow abroad and it may very well be that, as in this year, we need the private sector as well as the Government to effect significant capital inflows.  All of these factors involve capital flows which add to or take from the liquidity of the financial markets here and so change interest rates.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment in the press about the costs to the productive sectors of the rise in bank rates.  Firstly, I should point out that lending to industry by banks other than the associated banks accounts for about 55 per cent of total lending.  A substantial portion of industry therefore is already paying rates of interest which are even higher than those currently being charged by the associated banks.  In the case of the latter the extra full-year costs are about £8 million for manufacturing industry, £10.5 million if building and construction is included as well and £14-15 million for agriculture.  These figures compare with net output values of roughly £3 billion and £1.2 billion in industry and agriculture respectively.  The costs quoted are gross and will of course be offset to the extent that these sectors <Col N="1353" /> benefit from the higher rates being paid on deposits.  Some proportion of the increase will also be chargeable against tax.  I would not however wish to suggest any lack of Government concern at the current level of rates or the fact that the effect on the productive sectors is not what we would wish it to be.</P>
    <P>The £8 million gross cost to industry on an annual basis will have some impact on production and employment. However, if the main banks, which serve the economy countrywide, were not as a result of pressure from the interest rate differentials to have credit to give the effect on the economy could be much more damaging and, moreover, failure to act now could lead to crisis measures later on which might have considerably more serious implications for output and employment.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation is that the increases are unavoidable and not out of line with the experience in other countries in recent times.  They should be seen as part of the deteriorating international economic environment from which we cannot escape.  Naturally, there have been renewed calls for the Government to introduce an exchange risk guarantee scheme under which Irish companies could borrow abroad at low interest rates.  This of course would involve a contingent commitment of Exchequer funds and for practical purposes is tantamount to a subsidy.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would like to mention that substantial assistance of this kind is already provided for both the industrial and agricultural sectors and is freely available to qualifying firms and enterprises. Loans for investment by small and medium-sized industries are available from the European Investment Bank through the Industrial Credit Company at attractive rates of interest and with the Exchequer carrying the exchange risk.  Almost 90 per cent of Irish industry fulfils the criteria for eligibility and to date over 300 applications have been approved and financing of over £30 million has been arranged.  A similar scheme for agri-business is available <Col N="1354" /> through the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have authorised the Industrial Credit Company to borrow up to the equivalent of £50 million in foreign currencies on the capital markets for onlending to industry at keenest going rates, again without exchange risk to the final borrower.  Deputies will recall that towards the end of last year the ACC were authorised to engage in a similar operation amounting to £25 million on behalf of the farming community I am happy to report that this was such a success that I have recently authorised the corporation to engage in a further £25 million foreign borrowing on similar terms.  The Government do not see this as the limit of their commitment to support industry and agriculture.  If the demand is there the Government will be more than willing to ensure that it can be satisfied.  I have drawn attention to these scheme because I want to underline the fact that the Government are not denying the productive sectors access to credit at keenest rates nor exposing them to exchange risk.  What I am not prepared to concede are subsidies which must be paid for by all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>One of the amendments before the House states that there is an obvious conflict between national economic objectives and the commercial and profit levels of the banks.  The interest rates problem is a symptom of the difficult international environment in which we strive to pursue prudently our economic policies.  I want to refute unreservedly the suggestion that the determination of those rates is subordinated to the profit objectives of the banks.  In view of the approximate equality of lending by and deposits with the associated banks the profitability implications of the changes in interest rates are not significant.  The result will be to augment associated banks' profits in the aggregate, but to a relatively small extent; the net effect on each associated bank will depend on its structure of lending and deposits.  The Central Bank is satisfied that associated banks' profits are not excessive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> Given that the increases in lending rates were judged to be the minimum necessary in the circumstances, the only way to achieve a contraction in profits would be to increase deposit rates further.  Moreover, given the structure of associated banks' recources&mdash;with the bulk of their deposits falling within a range that is directly competitive with the building societies&mdash;the effect would have been to put even greater upward pressure on building societies' rates.  This suggestion, in fact, is nothing more than an attack on the role and competence of the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is an institution set up by Act of the Oireachtas and endowed by the Oireachtas with a wide measure of autonomy and specific powers and responsibilities in relation to the currency, credit and the supervision of the banking system.</P>
    <P>The bank has on more than one occasion publicly affirmed its overriding role in relation to bank profits, namely, to try to see on the one hand that the banks earn sufficient profits to enable them to remain secure repositories of the public's savings and, on the other, that their profitability is not so great as to reflect an excessive high net cost of their services to the Irish economy.  The Bank is and has been as concerned that the banks do not earn excessive profits as that they earn sufficient profits. However, it has advised me that in its judgment, based on the objective criteria it has applied since 1973, taking one year with another the banks have not earned excessive profits.  The two major groups in fact experienced a fall in pre-tax profits in the six months to September last.</P>
    <P>The bank is aware that a determination of profit adequacy on the basis of its, or any other, approach does not offer an assurance, when there is an absence of price competition, that the banks are keeping their level of costs under adequate observation and control.  The bank is also aware of its own responsibility in this regard.  It has consistently endeavoured over the years to exert pressure on the banks to improve efficiency <Col N="1356" /> in terms of cost and the service offered to the public.  This has been done in the context of the rationalisation of the two major groups, control of their branch networks, the controlled admission of competing institutions from overseas, control of the margin between deposit and lending rates in the context of changes in the level of interest rates, and detailed examination of costings in connection with requests for increases in charges, with approval withheld in major instances.</P>
    <P>There are of course aspects of bank profits which are of concern to me, as I indicated in my budget statement.  I have asked the Commission on Taxation to look into these matters urgently.  As regards the Central Bank, however, I am satisfied that it is discharging responsibly its duty to oversee bank profits in such a manner as to ensure the integrity of the banking system and the widest interests of the community in general.  At this point I might mention that I have been advised that the banks in fact originally put proposals which would have ensured no increase in their profits.  This would have been achieved by increasing deposit rates by a greater amount.  The Central Bank, however, mindful of its wider public responsibilities, appreciated the adverse effects that would have ensued for building societies and other savings institutions.  In the event therefore it was agreed to limit the increase on smaller deposits to 1.5 percentage points.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's solution for the ills of the system as it sees them is to take the financial institutions under effective public control.  The public will have its own views on that recipe&mdash;even during bank strikes it was notable how little demand there was for such action. The proponents of effective public control&mdash;whatever that may mean&mdash;do not say whether all banks would be included or only the four associated banks.  Nor do they say how the institutions, once under public control, could be subjected to some form of cheap money policy without running the attendant economic risks.  The experience of some other countries is relevant in this regard.  In <Col N="1357" /> France and Italy, for example, where there is significant public ownership or control of banking, the minimum commercial lending rates are 14.50 and 19.50 per cent respectively.  In these countries the banks compete for funds and interest rates reflect domestic conditions and international trends.</P>
    <P>I now come to the role of the Government. The Government did not approve the increases.  In accordance with normal protocol in these matters, as Minister for Finance I was informed of the proposed changes shortly before the announcement and of the reasons why the Central Bank considered the changes to be essential. But no Government approval was sought or given.  This was in line with the usual procedure.  As then Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, indicated in reply to a question in this House on 31 October 1973, &ldquo;the level of interest rates is a matter primarily for the Central Bank&rdquo;.  I mentioned earlier that when the Central Bank was set up in 1942 it was given considerable autonomy.  I would like to recall here some remarks of the Minister for Finance of the day, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is intended that there should be the fullest co-operation between the Government and the Central Bank. The Government does not, however, propose to interfere with the administration of the Bank which will be independent in the carrying out of its functions.  This independence is possessed by almost every Central Bank throughout the world and is a very desirable provision.</P>
    <P>These words summarise the relationship that has existed between the Central Bank and every Government.</P>
    <P>The Government readily appreciate that the interest rate increases are unwelcome. They realise that they will add to the problems of many firms and farmers faced with unfavourable trading conditions.  They are aware that house purchasers are concerned about their position.  Neither do they welcome the possible effects on other savings media <Col N="1358" /> or the increased costs that may fall on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We should not delude ourselves that inflation is not the real enemy.  If I may revert here to my budget statement, the Government have initiated the action necessary to bring order into the public finances and reduce our balance of payments deficit.  We cannot compensate ourselves for the rising cost of oil. Equally we cannot divorce ourselves from the unsettled world economy, with its tighter trading conditions, uneasy financial markets and rising interest rates.</P>
    <P>Despite the current increases in interest rates I believe that investment and exports will continue to expand.  The Government will be watching the situation closely and will engage in direct and continuing consultations at home and abroad.  In the course of these consultations we will be exploring the possibility of the rates being reduced having regard to the effect of their present levels on general economic activity.  I shall be raising with my fellow Finance Ministers, at the informal meeting of the Council of EEC Finance Ministers this weekend, the question of the level of international interest rates and the problems being caused by the apparent competition that is developing between certain countries.  I shall be emphasising to them that it would be of little solace to any of us to conquer inflation if in doing so our economies or those of our neighbours were forced into deep recession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot conceal from the House that I find the Minister's speech a little disconcerting.  Whether it is a speech directed not towards the Opposition benches but towards the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism to explain certain things to him which the Minister for Finance thinks he does not understand or whether it is a document which has emerged from the Central Bank in the past which was agreed on their behalf I do not know, but it bears no relationship whatever to what has been happening in recent days.  From <Col N="1359" /> this speech no one would know that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism had announced publicly that he was seeking a reduction from the banks. There was no reference whatever to that in the speech.  It might never have happened. Limerick might be wiped off the map as far as the Minister's demeanour is concerned.</P>
      <P>Similarly, as to the events of last Thursday to which I shall return, when the Government attempted to intervene in the matter ineffectively that also is completely ignored in the speech.  The speech is so far removed from any of the realities of the situation of the last week that it makes us wonder what is the point of this debate.  What are we here for if this is the kind of pap produced in this House??  I cannot say that the Minister was misleading deliberately but he was in fact misleading the House when he told us near the beginning of his speech about other EEC countries and the increases in their interest rates.  He said that Germany had raised its rates so that they are now 50 per cent higher than in June last.  In Belgium the rate of increase has been 50 per cent and in the Netherlands 59 per cent, and the increase in interest rates is only 16 per cent here.  What is relevant to that is to know what the interest rates are in these countries. For example, in the Netherlands the deposit rate for one month's money is, I understand, between 10? per cent and 10? per cent.  The deposit rate in Italy is 13 to 15 per cent.  In France it is between 12? and 12? per cent and in Germany between 8? and 9 per cent. These are the actual interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question with which this House has sought to concern itself and which the Minister has sought deliberately to obscure is why in this country at this time our interest rates have to be as high as they are.  He had in his speech a misleading section dealing with exchange control in which he attempted to explain why exchange control measures are of no value effectively and make it impossible for us to have different interest rates from those of other countries.  This, of course, is nonsense.  If our Government <Col N="1360" /> were pursuing the kind of sane policies being pursued in other EMS countries, then it would be possible for us with the exchange control measures we have to have interests rates like theirs.  For example, in Germany, where the deposit interest rate is 9 per cent or just under, there are exchange controls of some kind between Germany and the United Kingdom.  There is not a vast outflow of money to the UK because the Germans know that the rate of inflation in the UK is such that their money would be at risk in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The interest rates that different countries have reflect the stability of their internal economy, the good or bad management of that economy, the rate of inflation and the rate of borrowing by the Government of that country.  The reason why our interest rates here are so much higher than elsewhere is the reason that the Minister never referred to at all at any point in his speech.  He ignored totally the reasons derived directly from the way in which the Government have managed the economy.  There is no other reason; and the attempt to suggest that exchange control measures are ineffective and that there are no circumstances in which you can have different exchange rates in different countries because there are ways around exchange control is unworthy of him, knowing, as he does, that there are countries in Europe where the deposit rates are now less than half what they are here and that that does not involve a massive outflow of funds from Germany to Ireland as a result.</P>
    <P>The basic problem that we face and the reason why interest rates are as they are is that the combination of inflation generated by the Government through tax increases and subsidy cuts with consequent high wage settlements, and also high State borrowing, have forced the Central Bank to defend their currency and their foreign reserves by restricting credit so stringently, by such a small amount, so much less than the rate of increase in inflation that reductions in the volume of credit in real terms are involved. That has created a supply-demand <Col N="1361" /> situation which has forced up interest rates.  The Central Bank have had to do that because, having reviewed this Government's budgetary policy and having found them so grossly inadequate as did the gilt-edged markets the following day when the price of Government securities fell and the Government's borrowing rate was pushed up by 1 per cent within 24 hours, the Central Bank, as the body who have the final task and the ultimate responsibility of defending our currency decided to cut back stringently on the volume of credit available in such a way as to force up interest rates because of the operation of supply and demand.  This situation follows directly from the budget the immediate impact of which on the following day was to push up the rate of interest on Government borrowing by a further 1 per cent.  The heart of the issue lies here.  I will return later to the details, the fumbling of the relationship with the Central Bank and the attempt by members of the Government to pass the buck to the commercial banks.  For the moment I want to stick to this central issue.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House remember the EMS debate.  The whole concept put forward by the Government and supported by us was that, despite the complications that would arise if&mdash;as seemed likely especially at the end of those negotiations when Britain opted out &mdash;our £ for £ parity with sterling were broken, membership would, nevertheless, be made worth while by the opportunity to pursue an independent policy on inflation and to get interest rates here lower, as they should be and need to be in an economy with the potential and need for economic growth.  We knew that the cost of that decision would be considerable and the decision to support EMS membership was in some ways agonising, particularly for those of us who have a special concern with our relationship with Northern Ireland.  We knew also that the effect of EMS membership and the likely break with sterling that would ensue in due course would impose costs on the business community as well as having the political effects that <Col N="1362" /> I have mentioned of introducing a currency different from that of Northern Ireland.  However, the potential advantages for us of imposing exchange controls and running our own economy efficiently and managing it well and of being able to get interest rates down were so great, it seemed, that these risks were worth taking and these costs worth paying. That was the philosophy of the Government and we supported it with many qualms because of our doubts which we expressed then as to whether the Government would have the skill, the energy, the courage or the competence to pursue the policies that would enable us to secure the benefits of EMS membership in lower interest rates and lower inflation.</P>
    <P>Our fears and qualms in that respect have been vindicated amply by what has happened since.  The whole of the thesis on which EMS membership was based was undermined by the Government.  By their policies they have first pushed up borrowing to a totally inappropriate level and have added to inflation.  About half of the increase from 6 per cent to around 20 per cent of the rate of inflation is the direct consequence of increased taxes introduced by the Government and cuts in subsidies.  About half of the remainder is attributable to the indirect effects of this on the level of wage increases.  There is, of course, a residue of imported inflation, the increased oil prices and increases of other import prices but that does not account for much more than a quarter of the total.  I am sure most economists would agree with this.</P>
    <P>No country with borrowing at this level&mdash;the level of borrowing remains basically at 12½ per cent of GNP&mdash;and with inflation at this level of 20 per cent because of incompetent Government management, could maintain its position with other EMS currencies unless the balance were restored by the most stringent credit controls.  This was the direct, inevitable, foreseeable and undoubtedly foreseen results of the Government's budgetary policy this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> The Government could not have failed to know just how their budget would be received, first by the gilt-edged market, the drop in the value of securities and the 1 per cent increase in interest rates following within 24 hours and then by the Central Bank on whose board the Government are represented by the Secretary of the Department of Finance. These credit controls, which were the inevitable consequence of that budget, which nobody could have failed to foresee would be the consequences of a budget which failed to tackle our financial problems, inevitably forced up interest rates.  It is a simple matter of supply of and demand for money.</P>
    <P>The failure to cut the underlying level of borrowing below 12½ per cent of GNP, despite the window-dressing to make it look lower, was bound to be greeted by that fall in the value of Government securities, as investors losing confidence in the Government, attempted to sell them, thus pushing up the interest rates for Government borrowing, with indirect effects on interest rates generally.  The credit controls forced on the Central Bank by the Government were equally bound to force up interest rates further, because of the operation of the same forces of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>Nobody should be in any doubt that the Government knew what they were doing when they brought in the budget they did.  It could only have the effect of increasing interest rates.  Moreover, these actions by the Government were taken against the background of a situation in which the Government and all of us knew that the associated bank rates were already artificially lower than the market rates of the non-associated banks, to such an extent that for months previously many customers of associated banks had been using their overdraft limits to the full to borrow from the associated banks and to lend on deposit to non-associated banks at higher rates.  The money market situation has become unstable and it would be difficult to hold indefinitely even if the Government had pursued saner budgetary policies.  Already in 1979, <Col N="1364" /> faced with the critical situation in the associated banks, the Central Bank had to make advances to them, first by rediscounting exchequer bills and then by making them loans in order to maintain their liquidity in the face of this drain, an action which in the short run was inflationary.</P>
    <P>The new policies adopted by the Central Bank in February must have been immediately known to the Government as the Secretary of the Department of Finance is on the board.  These policies included the decision on auctioning exchequer bills fortnightly, which has since mid-March yielded 17½ per cent interest rate on exchequer bills.  That is the borrowing rate of the Government, which is, of course, always lower than the rate at which non-Government, borrowers can secure funds.  At the same time Government agencies have been offering high interest rates.  The ICC have been offering a deposit rate of 19 per cent for a year and the ACC have been offering 18¾ per cent for seven days.  I am told that the rate of the ACC, who are operating on behalf of the Government, is now one of the best and normally the best on the inter-bank market, so that the Government, through their agencies, have been taking the lead in pushing up interest rates, while hypocritically talking of keeping them down.</P>
    <P>The Government were given ample notice&mdash;it has been stated unusually long notice&mdash;of the intention of the Central Bank to permit an increase in the associated bank rates.  The Government did not react, having knocked off for Easter, until last Thursday, the day on which the Central Bank board, including the Government's representative, the Secretary of the Department of Finance, finally announced the increases, ranging up to 2½ per cent for large co-operative customers, those most likely to take advantage of the differential <i>vis-à-vis</i> the non-associated banks to make money by borrowing from the associated and lending to the non-associated banks. After this announcement, which the Government had known for some time <Col N="1365" /> was coming, and for which they, by their policies were directly responsible, they attempted to rescind the increases in the full knowledge that given the crisis they had created by their borrowing and inflation policies such a rescission would be impracticable, as the Minister today indicated, without either massive and growing destabilisation of the whole banking system or large-scale subsidisation of that system by the Government.</P>
    <P>After this announcement had been sent by the Central Bank to the associated banks the Government panicked and tried to stop what they had allowed to happen.  After frantic to-ings and fro-ings on Thursday last it proved to be too late to do so as word had already got out of the increases.  It is this which seems to have led to a split in the Government with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism clearly appalled at the consequences for industry of the result of the policies the Government have been pursuing.  He called for a voluntary reduction in interest rates by the banks.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to judge with precision what the interest rate levels for the associated banks are compatible with their continuing to be able to attract money on a necessary scale to keep lending even up to the limited level allowed by the Central Bank.  Perhaps there is some room for adjustment.  I have not got the expertise to judge that but any such room, if the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is right in thinking it exists&mdash;the Minister for Finance does not seem to think so&mdash;would be completely marginal by comparison with the overall level of interest rates.  The problem is a fundamental one.  Our interest rates are now double that of a fellow member of the EMS and anything that can be done by way of voluntary reduction is merely tinkering at the margin and not dealing with the fundamental problems which derive directly from Government policy.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of the Government's panicky desire to shift the buck was the announcement that they had <Col N="1366" /> asked the commission on taxation to turn their attention first to the level of taxation of banking profits.  Perhaps bank profits are undertaxed, perhaps the arrangements which exist with regard to leasing and the way in which those are being used by the banks, need to be reconsidered.  There may be a strong case for doing so.  Perhaps the bank's profits are excessive.  These are matters of judgement on which differing opinions can be held.</P>
    <P>If bank profits are excessive now and their taxation should be increased, then it was the case a <i>fortiori</i> much more strongly 12 months ago, because over that 12 months bank profits have not even risen with inflation and the Minister in his speech referred to the fact of a downward trend in the profits of the larger banks within the last six months. Why pick on this month, when according to the Minister bank profits are falling, to try to distract attention from the damage done by the Government's policies by raising the question of the level of taxation of banking profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission are not being asked to look at bank profits but to look at the question of taxation on those profits, and that is a rather different matter.

      <P>All those things just happened and the events of Thursday just happened and it just happens that <Col N="1367" /> there is no reference to any of them in the Minister's speech which dodges every real issue in this debate.  The most damning remark in the Central Bank statement authorised by the board containing a Government representative is that the level of domestic rates is not considered to be inappropriate having regard to the trend in interest rates elsewhere and the general economic situation.  As far as the trend in interest rates elsewhere is concerned, they are consistently lower than here in all EMS countries down to the level of less than half in the case of Germany.  The crucial words are: &ldquo;having regard to the general economic situation&rdquo;.  The Central Bank's view, given the general economic situation created by Government policy, is that it is necessary in order to protect our currency and reserves to have interest rates at this phenomenally high level.</P>
      <P>The finger is clearly pointed where the blame lies.  It just shows what the Central Bank thinks of the situation created by the Government, where in order to defend our currency we have to have interest rates of 19 per cent deposit interest. These kind of rates introduce all kinds of distortion of a dangerous character into our economy.  With rates like these for overnight money, 18¾ per cent from the ACC for seven days, a supermarket with a profit margin of about 3 per cent on turnover can increase its profits by one quarter by simply extending the period of paying its suppliers by a fortnight.  There is a strong temptation to do this in present circumstances and it could have a very serious effect on the liquidity of small firms especially, supplying supermarkets. The larger firms have the bargaining power to withstand any such attempt to extend the credit period but the smaller ones have not.  The figures are incredible.  A two week extension of credit would increase the profits of the supermarkets by 25 per cent because of the level of interest rates which this Government have introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the EMS we have most strict exchange control measures.  We <Col N="1368" /> now have a separate £ to that of the UK. In these circumstances despite the attempt by the Minister to devalue the importance of these exchange control measures, the only reason for high interest rates is domestic mishandling of the economy.  It is quite obvious that if our inflation rate were lower and our borrowing lower our interest rates could be lower, as they are in all the other EMS countries.  That would be true because credit control would not need to be so tight as to force up interest rates so that the supply and demand situation for credit would lead to lower rates, and also because we could have such lower rates without money leaking out given the exchange control arrangements that exist now.  Also in that situation far more people would borrow abroad because of the confidence there would be in the Irish currency, a confidence which does not now exist to a degree that makes borrowing abroad safe or wise for people unless they fall within one or other of the Government schemes mentioned.</P>

      <P>It is pointless for the Government to look for a scapegoat in the Central Bank.  The Minister for Finance has not done that, but other Ministers have been inclined to do so. The rate itself is representative.  The basic problem has been created by the Government who have thrown away all the potential advantages of EMS membership and have created a domestic crisis that need never have happened.  In the immediate future the Government have to look for palliatives.  A mortgage interest subsidy such as the National Coalition introduced will be necessary to mitigate the effect of the reported decision of the building societies to raise their rates by 2 per cent.  If that decision has been taken as reported I would urge the Government to take the necessary steps, as we did when mortgage rates were at a significantly lower level, to mitigate the effect on mortgages.  It may be that some palliative in that form, some shaving of the associated banks' <Col N="1369" /> interest rates, may be possible, as the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism thinks but as the Minister for Finance does not think.  Perhaps the two Ministers could get together and agree on that.  There cannot be much room for that in view of the fact that in the six months to January the resources of the associated banks have risen by only .2 per cent and the resources in the banking system as a whole by only 1.9 per cent. In these circumstances there is not much room for shaving bank interest rates in a situation where we have inflation at 20 per cent and Government borrowing equivalent to 12½ per cent of GNP.  The only real solution to this problem is that the Government tackle the mess they have created, take the necessary steps to reduce borrowing and to get inflation down, as the National Coalition did between 1975 and 1978.  There is no sign yet of any realisation of this.  All the Government have done in this budget is push inflation up from 15½ to 20 per cent.  All we see are divisions in the Cabinet and a most notable failure of economic leadership by the new Taoiseach, whose performance in the economic field in the face of his first real test has been inglorious to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse what the Minister said about the role of the Central Bank.  There will be grave danger for our currency if the role of the Central Bank is undermined. We borrowed significant sums from the Bundesbank less than a year ago and they were good enough to help us at that time.  I am not optimistic after the mismanagement of the economy by the Government since then, after the blowing of the £260 million of EMS money, about German reaction at this stage if any attempts were made to tamper with the Central Bank's role in the management of the economy.  I agree with the Minister on that.  But his failure to deal with any of the actual events that occurred in the last few days and his failure to refer to the differential in interest rates between us and other countries is an attempt to throw dust in our eyes in that respect.  The blandness of the Minister's entire speech could not suggest to <Col N="1370" /> anyone that our economy is at present in safe hands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless at some stage during this debate the Government benches announce the introduction of some form of instalment of mortgage interest subsidy, wonder will grow as to the reasons for having this debate this afternoon.  We have been treated by the Minister for Finance to a general lecture on monetarism which has been very interesting, but more important things are happening in the outside world this afternoon.  We have it from the building society chiefs that they consider it inevitable that following these bank interest rate increases their own interest rates will rise too.  That would spell dismal news indeed for all the thousands of householders throughout the country who are at present simply keeping their <Col N="1371" /> heads above water in terms of their household finances on present mortgage interest rates.  Since I understood this to be the whole point of this discussion today, I should hope that the announcement would be made at some stage during the debate.</P>
    <P>The decision that we are discussing has been imminent for some time.  It has been clear on the Dublin market since November last that there has been a discrepancy between the rates of interest of the associated banks and those of the non-associated banks.  While the Leader of Fine Gael may be correct in saying that the point had been reached where some people were borrowing from the associated banks and investing in the non-associated banks, the fact is that for the past two or three months the associated banks have not had any money to lend.  Members of the Government and especially the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism appear to act as though this question of interest rates has just arisen when it has been obvious for some time that the interest rates would be increased.  Apart from the fact that the Secretary of the Department of Finance is <i>ex officio</i> on the board of the Central Bank, everyone in the financial world, as well as those in industry and those seeking loans, was aware that there was this problem of a discrepancy and that it would have to be tackled sooner or later.  The mystery is that there has not been any action taken before now.  It is arguable that if action had been taken earlier, the rate of increase that has been imposed need not have been as sharp.  This increase in interest rates is a very severe blow to Irish industry in what is already a very difficult year for them.  Undoubtedly, the decision will lead to many bankruptcies. One does not wish to invoke that kind of scenario but it is an inevitable outcome of the hike in interest rates.</P>
    <P>Some people have argued that in the United States, for instance, interest rates have reached a peak and that they are now on a downturn.  In our situation the Government have stood idly by under a new Taoiseach and this is a Government <Col N="1372" /> who have been understood to have strong credentials and competence in the area of financial management.  There is little reason for anyone to be impressed by them in regard to their handling of this, their first serious problem of a financial character since the introduction of the budget.  But, apparently, the financial institutions are not impressed by the Government's handling of the economy. We know that on the day after the budget these people were not impressed by the Government's own housekeeping and that the Government representative in the Dublin Stock Exchange had to practically run from the building on the day after the budget because of so many people wishing to sell Government gilts.</P>
    <P>These high interest rates are a direct result of the Government's mismanagement of the economy and of their involvement in the kind of situation which has now become inevitable.  From 1977 on the Government got all wrong the recipe for maintaining the economic recovery which was then under way. These increased interest rates are bound to promote a recession and the Government must bear a large part of the responsibility for that situation.  It is inevitable that unemployment figures will increase as a result of the bankruptcies that will become all that much more frequent now.  The Taoiseach concedes that he anticipates a growth rate this year of the order of only 1 per cent.  That may be optimistic but a growth rate of this order must mean more unemployment.</P>
    <P>I know that there are unemployment problems in other countries, too, but the situation is more acute here because of the large numbers of young people who are out of work.  In the circumstances of growing unemployment for young people it was understandable that at the recent Youth Ard Fheis in Limerick, the Taoiseach was anxious that there should be more concentration on leisure.  Unfortunately, too many of our young people will be confronted with enforced leisure this year.  There will be even fewer opportunities this year than there were last year for school-leavers of whom about 50,000 are expected to be seeking entrance <Col N="1373" /> to the labour market in the autumn.  Our young people, therefore, will be the main casualties of unemployment.</P>
    <P>All the economic indicators are that these increased interest rates will lead to a deepening of our economic recession. Dearer money means that the small businessman, especially the small builder, will not be able to continue in operation.  Indeed, the situation will be very grave for anyone involved in the building industry if there is no relief given in terms of the subsidisation of mortgage interest rates.</P>
    <P>Financial institutions appear to lack confidence in the Government's ability to handle our economic problems.  The Minister for Finance conceded today that our balance of payments deficit this year will be of the order of £700 million. This situation coupled with the increased interest rates makes all the more likely the introduction of a budget in the autumn.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that some corrective action was necessary to remedy the discrepancies that existed between the interest rates of the associated banks and those of the non-associated banks but as I have said the question is why corrective action was not taken sooner.  The increased interest rates constitute a heavy penalty for industry especially, and what is even more regrettable is that the increases occur at a time when the credit guidelines announced last year are beginning to hurt Irish industry.  We can understand the result of this situation for the small builder, for instance, who is depending heavily on borrowing from the bank and who has houses only half finished.  The same applies to others in the construction industry who depend to a large extent on the co-operation of their banks.  What is to happen to such people if the Government are not prepared to help in some way to avert the kind of increases that appear to be in the offing if we are to take at their word the leaders of the building societies?  In the building industry in particular the number of bankruptcies will be higher on <Col N="1374" /> average than those in other sectors of industry.</P>
    <P>The kind of situation bequeathed to us now as a result of the increase in interest rates was inevitable since 1977.  I pointed out then that the Government in the bonanza policies they were pursuing&mdash;some of us called it the manifesto madness&mdash;were depriving themselves of resources of financial management that might be needed at another time.  At that time the economy was expanding but now it is contracting. The Government by their earlier behaviour have deprived themselves of any latitude in policy.  The kind of corrective measures taken with regard to interest rates need not have been so severe if the Government in their own financial management had adhered to the standards of sanity.  However, they threw discretion to the wind.  They took their political survival in the short term as their chief god and ignored the wider demands of economic sanity.  Now we have a 20 per cent rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in opposition one of their hobbies was to select one quarter of the year and thus calculate the annual rate of inflation.  If one were to do that with the inflation rate for the next quarter one would get a frightening figure.  Certainly we can say that in the 12 months to May our inflation rate will be in excess of 20 per cent.  In view of our membership of the EMS, if our inflation rate gets out of line with the other members it is inevitable that our currency and our economic policies will be affected adversely.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been in government in recent years knows that any attempt to wind down inflation is a difficult and, at times, an unpopular task.  It cannot be done overnight.  This Government have learned nothing about the job of winding down inflation and that is evident from the recent budget and from the way they have reacted to the increases in interest rates.  They added to our inflationary rate in the budget.  Some people say the rate has been increased by 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of dealing with trade unions and with employers' <Col N="1375" /> organisations.  Arguably the most important decision in the Irish economy is the rate of wages to be decided in any year. We are approaching that point now. From my experience from dealing with both sides&mdash;certainly from my knowledge of trade union leaders&mdash;I know they will commence negotiations this year on the platform erected by Fianna Fáil in the budget.  There has been a lot of talk about winding down inflation. At Question Time today the Minister for Finance conceded there must be an input here at home on how we wind it down.  The recent budget ensured the opposite.  We have given no assistance to the people involved in those vital talks in their efforts to come to reasonable settlements.  The Government do not accept the priority of winding down inflation.  If we are to tackle the unemployment problem we must reduce our rate of inflation.  There are no gimmicks that can assist us in that area.  It will come by consistent community effort, by teamwork across the board from a Government trusted by the people, not from a Government who, according to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism last week, had just realised interest rates would have to be increased. Everyone in the country knew this was imminent for months.  The advice of the Central Bank in the matter has been correct in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear that he believes the taxation situation of the banks should be looked at and all of us endorse that.  In fact, the entire taxation position of all Irish companies should be looked at.  It has been one of the criticisms of the Labour Party that Irish companies are too lightly taxed for hardly understood reasons.  Certainly I would welcome any new approach to the taxation of Irish companies in general. That approach can be made without endangering employment.  Companies in the industrial as well as the commercial sector should be seen to pay their fair share in the running of the State.</P>
    <P>The increases in the interest rates are the legacy of the economic mismanagement of the Government since 1977.  The <Col N="1376" /> only point in the debate is to note the kind of panic that appears to have gripped the Government in responding to the situation.  I agree with the sentiments of the speech made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism but I am mistified how a senior member of the Government could make such a speech in the circumstances.  Since well before the budget the Government under the new Taoiseach have known of the situation but they had not dealt with it.  It is a strange insight into this new whiz-kid Government.  The anomalous situation between the associated and non-associated banks aith regard to interest rates, the borrowing and lending on the inter-banks market, has been known for many months but has not been dealt with by the Government.  The Government have tried to persuade us they are thirsting for action but they have been strangely passive in dealing with the situation.  They have been quiescent as though it was only the business of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The way the Government have handled public finances is an integral part of the reasons which have led to the increases in interest rates.  The increases may have been inevitable for some months but there is no doubt that the bad reaction of the financial institutions to the first instalment of the new economic policy in the budget had more to do with their lack of confidence in the measures announced by the Government to bring public finances back into some kind of order.</P>
    <P>It is obvious they have no confidence in the ability of this Government to bring back order into public finances.  If the rest of the country are to suffer in terms of tight credit, the non-availability of cheap money and so on, one must return once more to the public finance plan announced by the Government in the budget and one finds that it is clear there was a good deal of cosmetic effect there. It is clear that the amount of money coming in from last year's Post Office dispute played a part in an apparent attempt to bring balance into public finances.  But, having taken these unique <Col N="1377" /> features into account, there has not been a convincing attempt by the Government to bring public finances back into order.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it is because of that that the gilt edge market went wobbly on the day after the recent budget.  I hope that before the end of the debate we will have something from a member of the Government announcing some relief for the householder, because mortgage interest rates have been threatened with a large increase if we are to believe those in control of the building societies.  They have said that their deposits have not been increasing rapidly in the last two months.  They have pointed to the existing interest situation and said there is need for change from their point of view as well as that of the banks.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, if this Government are culpable to a major extent for the present mess, then the least they can do for a period is to subsidise householders in this very serious situation.  In very good times the Government were not reluctant to subsidise practically everything that moved.  Now in a period of real hardship when our principal industry, the building industry, is threatened with unprecedented bankruptcies, it is time the Government would come in to give some assistance. Some of the leaders of the building industry have been close supporters of the Government.  From the point of view of our balance of payments, this industry is one we must protect as adequately as possible.  In the building industry there is little use of imported raw materials and therefore as a result of building activities there is little exacerbation of our balance of payments problems.  Therefore, even in the worst of times we should try to plan the expansion of that industry.  This year it may not be possible to plan for a great expansion of that industry&mdash;survival may be more the order of the day&mdash;but in the context of increased interest rates survival can be guaranteed only by some kind of subsidy arrangement as was done by us in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not go along with the Minister for Finance in denying the possibility that <Col N="1378" /> our exchange controls could not be used more extensively.  I think that the Government could be more adventurous in our use of EMS membership. Anything we may do in this area is circumscribed by our domestic inflation rate which hovers around 20 per cent. There is no doubt that the independent Irish £ remains in a perilous situation and will do so throughout the remainder of this year.</P>
    <P>While membership of the EMS may not arise immediately in this debate, there is need for a correction of interest rates, and I suggest that the cartel position of the four associated banks might be ended.  The Central Bank has been keeping a sharp surveillance of the situation. In EMS conditions it does not seem to be necessary any longer to have such close cartel arrangements between the four banks.  It would be better for all of us and for the banks themselves if more genuine competition were to operate between the four.</P>
    <P>My general indictment is directed where it belongs, at the door of the Government.  They are the people who have been in charge since 1977, who by subsidies and tax arrangements have tried to suggest to our people that it is possible to spend and promise our way into full employment.  The immediate authors of that policy, of that philosophy, unfortunately are no longer with us, but the heirs to that policy are here.  Only last week the Taoiseach indicated once more that he did not disagree with the economic policy of the Government since 1977.  Well he might say it because in every economic action of his Government we do not see any change from the policies pursued by the Government since 1977.  So sharp were the withdrawal symptoms of the party opposite when they were deprived of office between 1973 and 1977 that apparently they made a vow in Opposition that no promise, no expenditure and no decision, however fraught it might be with bad consequences for the community, would be resisted by them if they were returned to office&mdash;run from every problem, do not confront any issue <Col N="1379" /> but continue to send out the easy news to the community that there are not any problems.</P>
    <P>Thus we have had a budget that has added 4 per cent to our inflation rate, we are now heading towards 20 per cent at a time when we are approaching vital talks with national bargainers on a wage agreement for this year, we hope.  They still hope apparently that on the framework on this year's budget it will be possible to make arrangements for the winding down of inflation.  I do not think that on the record of the present administration under its new management we can be over-confident of a positive result.  The events of the last two days have not drawn from them any sort of sensible approach.</P>
    <P>We believe that if there had been an attack on this problem before Christmas and a closer alignment between budgetary policy and interest rates the increases now on us would not have been as extreme as they have turned out to be.  The most ominous part of the increase in interest rates is the potential disastrous effects on employment and on industry.  Our companies will be hit very hard.  It follows that it is not the people in control of the companies who will suffer immediately but the people on the shop floor who will lose their jobs.  It is with them that my sympathies principally lie because they will be the casualties at the end of the day of the economic mismanagement by the Government.  I hope that later in the debate the Government will announce some short-term alleviation for the householder in the serious predicament to which the Government have contributed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made to the effects of these recent increases in bank interest charges in regard to industry, the commercial and agricultural sectors of our economy.  While I share the concern of everybody else regarding the effects of these increases, as Minister responsible for the construction industry, and particularly for housing, my primary concern <Col N="1380" /> must be for the effects of the changes in relation to housing costs.  The increases must have a substantial impact on charges for bridging loans, credit facilities for builders and mortgage loans advanced by banks to house purchasers. In so far as house purchase mortgage finance is concerned I note that the associated banks have increased their mortgage interest rate by three-quarters of 1 per cent, to 16½ per cent, and a spokesman for the banks has recently been quoted as saying that there is no necessity for building societies also to change their present rates.  This will strike anyone who has read it, as it definitely strikes me, as the statement of a misinformed gentleman.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of uninformed comment in the press recently about the question of building society interest rates.  Some of the experts have arrogated to themselves the task of declaring for the societies what increases are to be effected in the investment and mortgage rates.  The same financial experts or wizards were equally brash on a previous occasion, in July 1979, when banks interest rates increased sharply, when they rushed into print announcing how building society interest rates were to change in harmony with the bank rates.  As we are all aware, the building societies have maintained their interest rates unchanged since 1 December 1978. I should like to compliment them on taking that stand in July of last year when the bank rates went up.  Indeed it must be said also that the fact that the building societies' rates did not go up did not interfere with the flow of deposits for the remainder of 1979, when they had a record year in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note also that this policy has resulted in a complete reversal of the traditional position under which there was an interest differential in favour of building societies <i>vis-à-vis</i> the commercial banks, or at least parity of interest rates.  As a result of the latest increase there is now a difference of 2½ per cent between the rate payable by building societies to their investors and that paid by the associated banks to investors <Col N="1381" /> holding less than £5,000 on deposit at present.  I should like to compliment the mature and responsible attitude of the building societies in this regard in controlling cash flows and effectively curbing the rate of increase of house prices.  I should like to take this opportunity also of acknowledging their co-operation given voluntarily and without legal sanctions on my Department's policies, designed to ensure that the funds available to them for lending on mortgages would be spread over as large a number of would-be borrowers as possible; that in this process, due weighting should be given to applicants for moderately-sized loans, especially applications from first-time house purchasers and, in particular, that their lending policies should support my Department's efforts to secure that all new houses purchased by mortgage represent reasonable value for the money paid by the buyers.</P>
    <P>In this context it is important to remember that while, apart from one special and quite exceptional case, the societies are not profit-making establishments in the strict sense, they are commercial undertakings which must compete on the open market for the steady flow of investment funds in order to maintain their work, which is of the greatest national importance.  The societies are essentially mutual institutions in which a large proportion of members invest their savings with a view to getting a loan from a particular society at some future date for the purpose of purchasing their own houses. However, it is also a fact that much of the funds invested with the societies comes from people who are interested in the rate of return they will receive on their money.  As mutual institutions the aim of the societies must be to provide a margin between the rate of interest they pay to the investor and the rate they charge the borrower which, after expenses and taxation, is sufficient to leave a small surplus to maintain adequate reserves and liquidity for the protection of their investors.  In these circumstances <Col N="1382" /> I regret that the societies should be singled out by some sections of the media for criticism and misguided comment from which other similar investment agencies appear to be immune.  In these circumstances I feel it necessary to refer to some aspects of the organisation and the operation of building societies relevant to the present debate, when borrowing and lending policies are under examination.</P>
    <P>A usual point of criticism about building societies relates to the margin which exists between the interest charged on mortgages and that paid to investors, the inference being that the societies are seeking undue profits or are operating inefficiently. Both concepts are wrong and, in particular, overlook the fact that the societies must pay tax on behalf of investors who receive their interest payments free of tax and are also liable to corporation profits tax on the residue.  It is well to place on record the fact that out of the interest of £14.15 paid on each £100 of mortgage finance borrowed it is calculated that £9 is payable to investors, £2.92 is paid as income tax on behalf of investors, management expenses account for £1.28, leaving an undistributed surplus of 95p which, after tax, leaves 66p only for reserve.</P>
    <P>I am aware also that the societies have been subjected to unfair comment on the grounds that their operating costs, especially their expenditure on advertising, are too high.  In this regard I would point out that Professor Cleary of Swansea University, who carried out an in-depth investigation into our building societies for the National Prices Commission, was satisfied that their operating costs were not unreasonable.  The societies themselves are well aware of the need to keep their costs at a reasonable level.  The keen competition between the different societies makes this essential for success and their management expenses are low by comparison with those of other financial institutions in the State.  This is particularly praiseworthy in view of the rapid growth and expansion of the societies in recent years.  Their assets have increased from £87 million in 1970 <Col N="1383" /> to over £1,000 million and the societies are now giving more than three times the number of loans they did in 1970.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an article which appeared on the front page of one of our leading dailies yesterday in the course of which it was remarked that the societies are still flush with cash.  It is true that the societies adopted a conservative approach in dealing with the windfall inflows of investment money following our accession to the EMS. They allowed liquidity to rise while gradually increasing their rate of approvals. This constituted a responsible approach enabling supply to keep pace with demand and reducing the inflationary effects on house prices which short-term, unlimited availability of purchase finance might have caused.</P>
    <P>In the event the societies paid out £200 million in 1979 compared with £147 million in the previous year.  They approved loans in 1979 for £276 million compared with £166 million the previous year.  So far this year, although net inflows for the first three months have totalled only £32 million, they have already approved loans totalling some £60 million.  This rate of approval is necessary if the Government's housing programme is to be financed.  It cannot be financed indefinitely out of the societies' liquid reserves.  The liquid reserves must be maintained at reasonable levels in order that societies can at all times meet their obligations.  It must be remembered that at any given time societies will have major commitments to fund loans which can be approved but have not yet matured for payment.  On 31 December last their commitments in this respect totalled £128 million.  At the same time adequate provision must be made to enable them to meet their commitments to repay investors at short notice.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that to finance their sector of the nation's housing programme this year they will require to pay out somewhere between £230 million and £250 million.  With net inflows for the first three months of 1980 totalling only £32 million it would be injudicious <Col N="1384" /> of the societies to relax control on the rate at which they are releasing loans.  A continuous substantial net withdrawal of funds can have very serious effects on the operation of the societies and the private housing programme of which they are the major support.  For example, in 1977 the societies supplied £119 million of the total sum of £171 million lent by all the lending agencies in the private housing sector.  In 1978 they lent over £147 million of the £233 million total advanced by all lending agencies to finance the purchase of private housing.  Last year they paid out more than £200 million of the total £293 million advanced for the purpose.  These investment policies of the building societies have in large measure been responsible for the fact that last year more new private houses were completed than in any previous year in the country's history.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the statements in the press report which I have mentioned, surveys made by some major building societies of accounts that have been the subject of withdrawals have shown up the worrying feature that the bulk of withdrawals are by old and by substantial investors who would not, as has been alleged, be interested in withdrawing their savings to buy cars and so on ahead of increases in VAT but who are attracted solely by the higher rates paid by other lending agencies, particularly the merchant banks who, even before last week's increase in bank rates, were already offering higher rates of interest. These facts are confirmed on examination of the monthly returns which are received by my Department.  While receipts from the six major lending agencies in the first three months of 1980 were £108,688,000 compared with £110,838,000 in the same period in 1979, withdrawals totalled £77.2 million compared with £46.16 million in 1979, leaving net inflows of £31.5 million as against £64.5 million in the first three months of 1979.</P>
    <P>I must make it clear that there is no power available to me under the Building Societies Act, 1976 to intervene in the <Col N="1385" /> settings by societies of their interest rates. This is for the very good reason that it was decided when the Act was being drafted that the societies themselves were the best judges of the appropriate interest rates necessary to generate sufficient inflow of moneys to enable the societies to meet their mortgage commitments. I agree that that is the right approach. The decision was endorsed deliberately by the Dáil and Seanad while the Bill was being debated.  The policy involved was supported at that time by the parties now in Opposition.</P>

      <P>It was supported on all sides of the House.  I understand that the societies have been considering carefully the question of revisions in their present investment and mortgage interest rates and in the process they have kept my Department and the Department of Finance informed of all the factors involved. Up to now they have made no final decision but, having regard to <Col N="1386" /> their responsible approach to similar policies especially in the recent past, I have no doubt that any changes they may decide to make will be fully defencible.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer back to May 1973 when the National Coalition introduced a subsidy to building societies. At that time the inflow of funds into the societies was low and tending to fall still further.  The building societies decided to increase the interest offered to investors by 1 per cent.  This would have necessitated an increase of about 1.5 per cent in the mortgage rate which at the time stood at 10 per cent.  The Government decided to give a temporary 1 per cent subsidy to enable the societies to pay an extra 1 per cent and hold the existing mortgage rate.  The subsidy subsequently was reduced to .75 per cent in August 1975 when the rate had increased to 11.25 per cent and it was abolished in February 1976 at the time when the mortgage rate had risen further to 12.5 per cent.  It should be emphasised that the subsidy was intended to encourage investment with the societies and, while indirectly it had the effect of reducing the mortgage rate, its primary purpose was to attract more money into the building societies.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the question of interest rates payable on house purchase loans I want to refer to the recovery which has been taking place in the case of the SDA loans or local authority loans scheme operated by all the local authorities.  This scheme had been practically eliminated under the National Coalition Government. Between September 1973 and 1977 no increase had been made in the loan and income limits.  Only £17 million was provided for the SDA loans for this purpose under the last Government's budget in 1977.  This year a total of over £63 million has been made available for house purchase loan schemes operated by our local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to say that I regret sincerely the influences beyond our control which have brought about the situation in which high interest rates must be charged.  I look forward to an early easing <Col N="1387" /> of the international situation which has necessitated this.  The fact that we live on an island does not in any way insulate us from worldwide economic pressures.  We are part of the EEC and, in turn, part also of an economic complex which comprises every developed nation and countries of the Third World. As a sector of that association, and particularly as a small nation with an open economy and still trying to achieve our full potential, it would be impossible for us to escape the effects of political, commercial and other market pressures which apply to every other country in the world.</P>
    <P>It is rather tendentious to criticise the Government for failing to control forces which have proved beyond the capabilities of the most powerful nations to curb.  The Deputies opposite who have been critical of the Government in this regard might in the same way consider advising the Government of the USA how that country might have prevented the highest interest rates in their history. We had a bank increase last summer and the building societies did not increase their rates.  This was not detrimental to them as far as their cash inflow was concerned. It continued right up to the end of the year.  There was a further bank increase in Britain last November.  The fact that we had then become members of the EMS surely means we were able to avoid the 3 per cent increase which took place in the sterling area at that time.  The EMS has been very beneficial in that respect where our interest rates are concerned.</P>
    <P>I understood the leader of the Fine Gael Party in his contribution to say that a decision had already been taken by the building societies.  He nominated 2 per cent.  This is not the case.  No decision has been taken by the building societies and, hopefully, it will not be too serious a matter if and when such a decision is taken.  Last July, when all the prophets of the financial world were saying that it would probably have to go up by 2 per cent or more, it did not move at all.  We have the same forecasts being made now and nominating the amount that it <Col N="1388" /> should and will go up, but it has not happened yet.</P>

      <P>I believe that some remedies are necessary at the moment. The situation in regard to bridging finance is a matter of serious concern to people purchasing houses.  The closing of sales of houses is being held up because people are unable to obtain bridging finance.  There are penalty clauses being invoked by the building firms and people are being faced with having to pay penalty interest rates on the purchase of their houses.  This is causing a lot of difficulty.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the Central Bank guidelines are exempt in regard to bridging finance.  Consultation should be held with the Central Bank in relation to this.  The local authority loans are £12,000.  Would the Minister extend that to £16,000?  The building industry is of immense importance because of the employment it generates.  If those local authority loans were increased to £16,000 it would bring about a vast improvement in our building industry.  I believe that the removal of the reconstruction grants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy can take it up with whomever he likes.  I am in the Chair at the moment and the Deputy cannot go on to deal with reconstruction grants.  I allowed him to deal with loans because this might <Col N="1389" /> have a remote connection with the matter under discussion.</P>

      <P>I beg the Chair's indulgence to explain.  There are difficulties in obtaining housing loans and because of this house improvement grants are essential for people who are unable to obtain housing loans and have difficulty in servicing those loans.  I hope the Minister will consider restoring the reconstruction grants because this would help to maintain our existing housing stock.  In cases of hardship it may be necessary to bring in special subsidies.  I ask the Government to give a firm commitment to ensure that subsidies are provided in the event of any further increases in building society rates.  I refer to the subsidies which were there when we were in Government.</P>

I believe that the international situation in regard to interest rates has reached its peak.  Surely the Government must be aware of this?  When the Minister for Finance was approached by the associated banks for an increase in interest rates he should have asked them to wait and see what way the matter would develop on an international scale.  If the Minister had asked the associated banks to wait he would have avoided this difficult situation.  If this is allowed to continue it will have serious effects on our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The central issue before the House in my opinion and in the opinion of most Members of the House is to what extent can the Government mitigate the abnormally high interest rates at present, bearing in mind the extreme limitations of Government intervention in the money market.  The <Col N="1390" /> options are very limited but that is not to say that Government economic policy over a period of two or three years cannot and does not have a very marked influence on the reactions of the Central Bank when they face historically high international rates.  Such has been the strategy of Government economic policy over the past two or three years, notably in the 1978 and 1979 budgets and the manner in which the Central Bank have handled the general current expenditure side and the manner in which they have managed consumer demand, that when the Central Bank were faced with the international phenomenon now evident around the world on the international money market, they had no option but to adopt the full rigour of the strategy open to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the interesting spectacle over the weekend of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, using the glorious diversionary tactic, when he found it hard to explain away the economic strategy of his Government over the last few years of turning on the banks.  He fed them to the lions and did what the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, is adept at, pretended that he was not even a member of a Government from mid-1977 to December, 1979.  I could not help calling to mind the debate which struck in my mind as we entered into the last general election. It was a confrontation on RTE radio between Deputy, now Senator, Justin Keating and Deputy Haughey then in the Opposition front benches. The broadcast took place at about 1 o'clock on the Sunday before the general election and Deputy Haughey castigated our Government and lashed the unfortunate Deputy Ryan, then Minister for Finance, for not attempting to manage the State finances, for not effectively reducing the rate of inflation and for not simultaneously providing a massive injection of public funds for State expenditure programmes and so on.  Such was the nature of the approach by Deputy Haughey in that interview with Deputy Keating, that Deputy Haughey won it hands down mainly because the population are fed at election time on soft options, <Col N="1391" /> particularly by Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>What have we had in the past two or three years?  We have had stop-go policies.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> on 8 April Mr. Ken O'Brien in an interesting analysis correctly pointed out that when allowances are made for technical Department of Finance book-keeping factors, the central Government fiscal injection for the first quarter was down by more than 20 per cent on the equivalent period for 1979 and when inflation was taken into account the real deflation was close to 33 per cent.  We see that every day of the week.  Even as vice-chairman of Dublin County Council I cannot go to a county council meeting without being faced with massive cutbacks right along the line.  That has followed a massive period of utterly irresponsible consumer inflation in 1978 and 1979 arising from the 1977 election promises.  Anybody who dared to suggest this was treated as an economic leper.</P>
    <P>If we had in our national and external reserves and in our domestic capital saving formation a basic reserve as we now enter the critical period of the first quarter of in effect a session, whereby one could give an elementary and selective subsidy to some household mortgages, and give selective subsidies to industry on the exchange rate guarantee, it might be possible for the Government to come in here this afternoon and inject money from scarce taxpayer resources and it might well have been possible for the State to undertake that kind of ameliorative strategy.  However, the coffers are bare because we are now paying in the first, second and third quarter of 1980 for the profligate handouts which diminished any concept of a national monetary reserve in our State.  We will pay for that in the worst possible way.  Those with jobs will pay as companies face increasing liquidity problems and the unfortunate young married couples trying to purchase houses for the first time and house purchasers with relatively low incomes and young families will have no prospect of subsidisation.  Those in greatest need will have to pay.  While I do not bleed for many personal loan <Col N="1392" /> borrowers, some of them are in need of additional finance.</P>
    <P>There must be no great deviation on the political side by allowing the Government to slide out from their responsibilities, to hold up their hands in horror and blame the commercial banks for not behaving.  The commercial banks are agents of monetary policy, agents of commercial activity and while I hold strong views about the extent to which their investment and profit policies are pursued, they are not the target to home in on, no more than are the Central Bank.  Let us be quite clear about this. We as politicians influence the course of economic events by virtue of our current capital programmes and if these programmes are rubbish, as two programmes at least in 1978 and 1979 were, it is inevitable that the Central Bank must exercise massive restraint and constraints when they come to acting in a more liberal way relative to interest rates.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest difficulty in explaining such elementary economic truisms to many of my colleagues not just in my party but in other parties because everybody starts fighting off the paper tigers, and even if some of the commercial banks have indulged in a conspicuous consumption of office blocks and have indulged in areas of non-productive contributions to the national economic development programme.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless what they are doing in the overall context of an impact on economic growth and on interest rates is not great.  I hold that view strongly.  It would be interesting to know the reasons for the Central Bank considering the change to be essential.  I do not know to what extent the Minister has any personal interest in the role of the Central Bank and neither do I know whether he had any consultations with the senior staff of the Central Bank or with members of its board but he tells us that he was informed of the changes shortly before they were announced and of the reasons for the Central Bank considering them to be essential.  It would have been <Col N="1393" /> interesting to have had those reasons tabulated officially instead of having them in the emasculated form in which they have been presented to us today.</P>
    <P>As a result of questions I tabled here recently we know that the Exchequer foreign debt increased by an estimated £480 million in 1979.  This was approximately 40 per cent of the increase in the national debt.  There is a proper way of proceeding in respect of trying to do something about interest rates in 1980. We know, too, that the national debt as a percentage of GNP in 1977 was 79 per cent, that in 1978 it had jumped to 83 per cent and that the preliminary estimate for 1979 is that the figure has risen to 88 per cent.  That is a nice recipe for handling a situation of high interest rates.  Is it any wonder that the Central Bank act in a jaundiced manner in that respect?  Let us take, for example, the percentage contribution to financing gross domestic physical capital formation from two sources.  First, to take gross national savings, the figures were almost 90 per cent for 1977, 91 per cent in 1978 with a decrease to 68 per cent in 1979.  Net foreign disinvestment as a percentage contribution to financing gross domestic physical capital formation was 11 per cent in 1977, 9 per cent in 1978 and 32 per cent in 1979.  I am an advocate of economic planning and development but my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, would need to take some of the questions and answers back to Trinity College to have them analysed, preferably by Professor McAleese and a few others who could teach the Deputy the implications of some of the data which is readily available to all politicians in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are told that the proportion of public sector borrowing requirements financed externally for 1977 was 37 per cent, that for 1978 it was 38 per cent and that for 1979 the estimated figure is 51 per cent.  These figures take account of foreign currency borrowings by the Exchequer and State bodies as well as sales of Government securities and this is at a time when there is so much emphasis on <Col N="1394" /> the Central Bank maintaining vigilance over our exchange rate fluctuations.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there are extensive discussions between the Central Bank and the Government on a regular basis because it is not the nature of the Taoiseach to talk to anybody.  He presides over economic affairs.  He is presidential in his approach.  He consults but he keeps his counsel to himself.  He does not exchange the parameters of alternative strategies because to do so would not be his style.  This problem also concerns the Cabinet because it is not subdivided by him by reason of his not having much time for the general economic expertise of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many Members of the House read the Irish Bank Review.  In the current edition, Mr. S. McKinnon, who is the assistant secretary of the Irish Banks Standing Committee, tells us that the stability of the Irish £ within the EMS was not achieved without a substantial fall in our official external reserves from £1,252 million at the end of 1978 to £975 million at the end of 1979.  He goes on to say that the economy in 1979 was marked by two unwelcome features&mdash;substantial balance of payments and budgetary deficits. Mr. McKinnon then point out the necessity for recognising that a country's membership of a hard currency regime requires vigilant economic management in order to ensure that the balance of payments, if in deficit, must be kept within manageable proportions and that a minimum level of external reserves be available to meet temporary fluctuations in balance of payments situations and in net capital outflows.  The warnings were there for the Government.  In their recent statement the Central Bank pointed out what the situation was when they said that the official external reserves at the end of 1979 represented about 2.4 months' imports compared with 4.1 months' imports at the start of the year and that while the current cover is similar broadly to that in respect of many other countries, the rate of decline in reserves during the past year has been too marked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> This was one of the issues which was reiterated to the Government again when the Central Bank brought forward the formal decision to increase interest rates. Therefore, I wish to sum up this aspect of my comments by saying that the serious economic mismanagement of the State's finances both in 1978 and in 1979 leaves us virtually in an economic pauper's grave as we enter the middle of 1980.  My intention is to endeavour to find out how to ameliorate the worst effects of the situation.  The Government must pre-occupy themselves with the maintenance and the protection of employment, regardless of whether that means increased taxation, for instance.  I am thinking particularly of certain sensitive industries, notably those which have been hit most by the fluctuation in the exchange rates.  The proposal by the CII for a selective subsidy in this regard is reasonable.  We know the repercussions in terms of economic and social cost of any major increase in unemployment and the utterly devastating impact of such a situation on many sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to read the speech made on Monday last by the Director General of the CII when he said that since last autumn the confederation have urged the introduction of an exchange rate guarantee scheme for manufacturing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been any response to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  He said that the confederation had urged that part of the tripartite employment fund be allocated for this purpose.  When we in the Labour Party talk about effective public control we are not talking about wholesale nationalisation.  In his speech the Minister implied that the Labour Party were going pell-mell for total nationalisation of the commercial banks and so on.  The Labour Party are a little more sophisticated than that in their general economic understanding.  I agree with some of the criticisms made by Deputy O'Malley regarding the windfall profits of the banks as a result of high interest <Col N="1396" /> rates.  They could have been diverted by general persuation on the part of the Government into a solid contribution instead of the pretty miserable tripartite employment fund.  A sum of £10 million is not talking turkey in the context of influencing economic events.  There is no reason why there should not be a contribution of another £30 million into that fund by the associated banks.  To use the words of the Minister for Labour, they could make a patriotic contribution and that money could be used, at least in part, in relation to the exchange rate guarantee scheme for manufacturing industry. Other contributions could also be made.</P>
      <P>There is need for a sensible contribution by the Government in relation to mortgage interest rates.  I do not mind disclosing that I have a £3,000 mortgage which I took out in 1964 with Irish Life at 6 per cent.  I do not think that I should get any subsidy.  Many young couples who are buying a house this year need some help because they are being crucified.  There is no reason why selective assistance should not be given.  I am not talking of young people who get a gift of £10,000 from wealthy parents, who take out a mortgage of £35,000 and who spend £50,000 on a new house.  I do not think such people merit consideration for mortgage subsidy but many young people, first-time mortgage holders, need help.  Scandalously high rents are changed for private rented dwellings and if we are to keep the private housing sector going, help should be given to those in need.  The money should be paid directly to those obtaining the mortgage.  It should not go to finance a trip to Miami or somewhere else as happened quite frequently in the case of the £1,000 grant.  What happened then was that house builders increased the price of houses by £1,000, they laughed all the way to the CRV distribution centres and the Government were delighted because they were at their profligate best at that time.  There is no doubt that some assistance should and can be given by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why the commercial <Col N="1397" /> banks should not be involved also.  If I were Minister for Finance I would introduce a temporary profits surcharge. They would not exactly collapse and their officials would not all go on strike. Probably they would put in another wage claim for looking after that change as they appear to get a wage increase for every minor changes made.  There is no reason why such a temporary surcharge could not be imposed.  Unless measures of this kind are taken we will have very serious difficulties in two sectors in the months ahead.  Credit may be outstanding and exchange rate fluctuations could crucify some sensitive export firms.  The tripartite conference are accustomed to dealing with this area.  The employment subsidy schemes in operation could act as a model in that regard and help could be given also to mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has an obsession now that money is not available for anything. If another 8,000 or 10,000 industrial workers go on the dole queue in 1980 the economic and social cost will be substantial. That is quite apart from the cost to the Department of Social Welfare who will have to pay pay-related unemployment benefit and the Revenue Commissioners will also suffer.  There should be joint consultation between the Central Bank, the commercial banks and the economic Ministers and a serious effort should be made to ensure the maintenance of productive employment in the next six months in the hope that we may work ourselves out of a very short recession. However, I am afraid it looks like lasting longer than that.</P>
    <P>I submit that the suggestion I have made are moderate and reasonable.  The Labour Party have a jaundiced view about the extent of the contribution of the commercial banks.  There is a need to get the State rescue sector moving rapidly.  There are 1,700 full-time employees in AnCO.  Now is the time to prepare programmes for workers who may be out of jobs in the months ahead. There are 750 people employed in the IDA.  I do not know how many people are employed by CTT but I know that <Col N="1398" /> since the last recession in 1974 there are hundreds more employed in State agencies. There is no reason who they should not work to stave off the worst effects of redundancies and liquidations.</P>
    <P>The Government mismanaged State finances in 1978 and 1979.  The budget has given another injection to inflationary trends at a time when there was no need for it, when we needed another 4 or 5 per cent added to the inflation rate like we needed a hole in the head.  I am afraid I do not have any great confidence in the silent expertise of the Taoiseach in these matters, or in the promotional expertise of the Minister for Finance in that regard.  We are now reaping the whirlwind of the economic strategy and mismanagement of the Fianna Fáil Party's manifesto in 1977.  The national reserves of monetary control and general reserves to meet this kind of critical situation do not now exist and, as a result, we have here a critical and depressing debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had two Government Ministers here this afternoon&mdash;the Minister for the Environment who spoke for half an hour totally irrelevantly from a brief prepared quite obviously by the building societies&mdash;I shall revert to that later because I have very strong feelings about the fact that a Government Minister should come in here defending to the extent the Minister for the Environment did here this afternoon the building societies&mdash;and the opening contribution of the Minister for Finance which was, as Deputy FitzGerald pointed out, a speech which could have been prepared by the Governor of the Central Bank.  Indeed, in justification, I happen to agree with a lot of what that Minister said and I happen to agree with a lot of the conclusions of the Central Bank about the necessity for the commercial banks increasing their interest rates.  But it is not the function, nor was it the intention of this debate, that the Minister would come in here and merely hand out the Central Bank line on the effects of the economy of the increase in the bank interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that it was <Col N="1399" /> well before the Easter recess, a month or so ago, that I made an effort here to get a Private Notice Question down about interest rates.  Deputy Cluskey, Leader of the Labour Party, did likewise.  Both were turned down at the time.  At the time of the rumoured bank interest rate increase the Taoiseach would not allow Government time to debate the matter. Subsequently, in a debate on the setting up of the special employment fund under the national understanding, I endeavoured to raise the matter of interest rates under, I think it was, section 3 of that Bill, when you, Sir, ruled me out of order, saying it was not relevant to the debate.  Of course I accepted your ruling, but when the Chair changed some time later, when the section was being debated and when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair, I thought I would try it again, when the Minister, not the Chair, drew the attention of the Chair to the fact that I had earlier been ruled out of order, again obviating any possibility of this House discussing the interest rates before the increase took place.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the House the Minister for Finance was asked a question by Deputy T.J.Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan).</i> I want to make another reference to something that happened here today and yesterday as well.  I am quoting here from the unrevised copy of yesterday's Official Report during Question Time:</P>
    <P>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Before the increases were announced did the Minister make any approach to the banks about the increase? I asked him also whether the speech made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in Limerick represents Government thinking on bank interest and if so, what action he proposes to be taken. Finally, will the Minister take steps to ensure that the increase in bank interest or in interest rates will not be passed on to house purchasers in the form of mortgage interest increases? <Col N="1400" /> Mr. O'Kennedy: Most of the matters referred to by the Deputy will be covered in the course of the special debate which has been arranged for tomorrow.  As far as one point is concerned, I can tell the Deputy that I had, as is customary with Ministers for Finance, consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's first question was whether before the increases were announced the Minister made any approach to the banks about the increase. The Minister does refer to that in his speech here today, though not directly. Then Deputy Fitzpatrick asked the Minister for Finance whether the speech made by his colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in Limerick represented Government thinking on bank interest and, if so, what action he proposed to take.  There is not a single word in the Minister's speech today about the obvious divisions in the ranks of the Government about this matter in spite of the fact that he did say yesterday that most of the matters referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick would be covered in the course of the special debate to be held today.  In fact only one of the matters was referred to today. Finally Deputy Fitzpatrick asked the Minister if he would take steps to ensure that the increase in bank interest or in interest rates would not be passed on to home purchasers in the form of mortgage interest increases.  The Minister's response today to that request is:</P>
    <P>The Government readily appreciates that the interest rate increases are unwelcome ... It is aware that house purchasers are concerned about their position.</P>
    <P>That is the response of the Minister for Finance to the proposed increase in mortgage rates.  Are this Government so cocooned within their Departments and their cars that they are not mixing with ordinary people at all?  Are they so unaware of the difficulties people are having in living with what may well be&mdash;as has been said here a number of times <Col N="1401" /> today&mdash;an inflation rate of 20 per cent? Do they understand the difficulties people are experiencing in meeting mortgage rates?  The response today of the Minister for the Environment was half an hour spent here in the House justifying the building societies.  There may be a case for putting up the building societies' rates; I do not know, but it is not the function of the Minister for the Environment, even though he has a legitimate interest in what building societies do because he depends on them to provide the finance for many houses in the private sector.  They constitute an important and very necessary arm of the total financial bodies in the country being, in the eyes of ordinary people, first in line as regards finance for housing. But to do as the Minister for the Environment did here this afternoon&mdash; justify for half an hour their stance over two years&mdash;is not his function and is certainly not what is expected in a debate like this.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance interrupted Deputy FitzGerald when he was speaking here and said that Deputy FitzGerald was misquoting him about the instructions he had given to the Commission on Taxation; he said he had not asked them to investigate profits; he had asked them to investigate taxation of profits.  Again yesterday, in reply to a question by Deputy Horgan&mdash;I am quoting from the unrevised copy of yesterday's Official Report during Question Time&mdash;the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>In the event, yesterday, at the inaugural meeting of the Commission I did refer the question of profits and tax on profits of the financial institutions and others to them for urgent consideration for interim reports.</P>
    <P>It is difficult now to know what he has referred to the Commission because he denied quite categorically here two hours ago that he had referred the question of profits to them.  Yet yesterday&mdash;unless my memory was playing tricks on me&mdash;he said:</P>
    <P>...I did refer the question of profits <Col N="1402" /> and tax on profits of the financial institutions and others to them for urgent consideration for interim reports.</P>
    <P>When replying the Minister would need to explain exactly what he has done as regards the Commission, whether the position is as he said here this afternoon or is in accordance with what he said here yesterday.  There are now two different accounts of what he has done on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy B. Desmond have given the reason that increased interest rates have come about now.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to attack the banks, as the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism did last weekened, or for the Minister for Finance to suggest that it is totally outside forces that are at fault; of course there are inflation effects resulting from increased oil prices but there are far more inflationary effects resulting from the stance and attitude of this Government over the last two years, causing far greater inflationary problems than anything the Arabs have done with the price of oil.  This year's budget alone has increased our inflation rate by 25 per cent, an increase directly as a result of the budget, of 3.8 per cent, on top of the 15 or 16 per cent, or whatever it was at that time.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot wash their hands of that when it is being reflected in increased interest being charged by the banks.  Generally it will be found anywhere in the world that when inflation increases interest rates increase again and over a period of time interest rates will be more or less in a line with rates of inflation.  Until we tackle and cure the problem of inflation we are going to have high interest rates.</P>
    <P>That is why the Government have done more to increase the rate of inflation than have any other external source in this country, with the stance of their budgets of 1978 and 1979.  This year it was not so much the content of the budget.  Members of this House, who would be relatively well informed, and newspaper journalists, who may perhaps <Col N="1403" /> be even more informed but at another level relatively uninformed, are not the type of people whose attitude to our currency is affected by what they see in that budget.  In that regard Deputies in this House, journalists and many other people do not matter.  We are talking about the managers of huge financial sums, be they Arabs, insurance companies, international banks or multinational companies.  These are the people who move money in and out of countries, who affect the rate of exchange, who take account of the balance of payments when they are moving moneys in and out and who affect the rate of interest applied here.  This decision of the Government to allow the rates to increase last weekend was an inevitable consequence of their own stance over two years, and the decision was applied. It is quite clear that it had been under consideration for a considerable time. The Central Bank said that the question of an increase in the associated bank rates had been under review for some months past.  Therefore the Government were not unwarned about this.  We tried to raise it in the House here about three weeks ago.</P>
    <P>Of course in another way the Government were informed continuously on a day-to-day basis about what was happening in the Central Bank.  The Secretary of the Department of Finance is Director of the Central Bank.  Since the Central Bank was set up 30 or 40 years ago every Secretary of the Department of Finance has been a director of the Central Bank.  Even though the Central Bank are independent of the Government&mdash;&ldquo;independent in the Government&rdquo; is the phrase used in the Central Bank&mdash;the Government through the Secretary of the Department of Finance know precisely what is happening as regards interest rates and what problems there are in the Central Bank every day, apart from the formal accounting of the Governor of the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance who is, for want of a better word, his employer.  When a change in interest rates takes place it is the custom&mdash;perhaps it is written into an <Col N="1404" /> Act&mdash;which has always been adhered to that the Governor of the Central Bank informs the Minister for Finance of the day that they have given permission for such a change.  Normally because the Minister has been in continual touch through the Secretary of his Department with what is happening, he will say &ldquo;Yes, we agree to that&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, we do not agree to that and look at it again&rdquo;. Everybody in this House on no matter what side will agree that the Central Bank should not in any way be interfered with by Government or politicians. They must be independent of them.</P>
    <P>In this case the Governor contacted the Minister for Finance and informed him of the proposed increase.  The thing that surprises me is that this was not announced on Good Friday.  It would have been in keeping with the Fianna Fáil Party to announce it on Good Friday and hope that it would be swallowed up over the long weekend as has happened with many of their unpopular measures and that people would not notice it.  I suppose that somebody had a bit of sense and said that the people were wise to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Everybody is looking forward to the Minister's contribution and he will have his chance to speak.  I said that they should remain independent of the Government but that the Governor informs the Minister for Finance when a change in interest rates is to take place.  Perhaps he does this through courtesy or it may be written into an Act.  I am surprised that the Government did not make an effort to get this unpleasant news out over the last weekend, as they did with the announcement regarding food subsidies 18 months ago and as they have done with a number of other unpopular measures since then. They endeavour to get them out when the public's attention is diverted by holidays or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was informed last <Col N="1405" /> Thursday either he told the Taoiseach or the Government before he answered the Governor.  If he told the Government, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism now sitting opposite was part of the final decision-making even though not in the sense of a normal decision-making where they would have the right to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Certainly he was aware of it before he made his &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speech on Friday night in Limerick. Many people were surprised that Deputy O'Malley would make such a silly speech and be so uninformed about the way the change took place in bank rates and that he would attack the commercial banks.  I am not a bit surprised because I have heard Deputy O'Malley making gaffes of a similar nature previously from a base of great ignorance when he was on his side of the House.  He suggested that we join OPEC and made the theme of a long speech the reason why we should not join the International Energy Agency.  He said that we should avoid this cartel of wealthy servants of the US.  He used some phraseology like that.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised at his ignorance as regards the chain of events that leads to an increase in bank rates.  If anybody thinks that he has done this to rock the Fianna Fáil boat then such people should think again.  I assure the present Taoiseach that he is in absolutely no danger from the paper tiger over there who will have a lot of words but no action. If Deputy O'Malley wants to rock the Fianna Fáil boat the place to do it is up in those lobbies, but he is not going to do that.  He will continue to pretend that he is sniping from the sidelines and to hope that he will get press coverage for it, but we can be sure that there will be no action.  He did say at his press conference the other night in Limerick that they intended to approach the associated banks and seek a voluntary reduction in the interest rates.  He may have been misquoted but that is what was stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Perhaps he was not at the Cabinet meeting to discuss the interest rates last weekend.  Perhaps he is not informed of these things and did not know until he read in the papers that he is going to influence the Government to approach the associated banks for a voluntary reduction in interest rates.  As he obviously will be replying to the debate, he should tell us if he has made that approach, if so, what response he got and, if the response was in the negative, what he intends to do now.  The least he can do after his headline grabbing exercise of last weekend is to inform us what is the follow-up to the action he proposed should be taken last Friday night.  The Minister for Finance, quite clearly in his speech today, is rebutting every one of the proposals and the arguments put forward by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  There is no doubt that those increased rates will have a very damaging effect on agriculture, industry, the commercial sector and householders.</P>
    <P>Last year was not a good year for the agricultural community.  A lot of people engaged in agriculture were forced into very heavy borrowing from the banks and they are just as much affected by an inflation rate of 20 per cent as the rest of the community.  Those people appear to be facing prospects of price rises which will be very much lower than the rate of inflation no matter how much they will be.  On top of that they will now be asked to pay increased interest rates on their borrowing.  This will force many farmers to sell their farms or to sell their stock.</P>
    <P>Most farmers are essentially businessmen nowadays.  They are very different from what they were 30 to 40 years ago.  They are like small to medium sized business people, depending on the size of their farms.  I do not believe members of the Government appreciate the fear under which people who owe money to the banks live.  They are scared of the telephone ringing, they are scared of everyone who walks into their yards or firms, they are terrified of every person they meet on the street who stops them and looks for money that this will be the <Col N="1407" /> final straw which will eventually shame them and put them out of business. Many of those people are facing that prospect in the next six months, not just in agriculture but in business as well. Not alone will their businesses be sold with the loss of the shareholders' funds, which will probably be grabbed by the banks as collateral against their loans, but many jobs will be lost.  Industries which have been labouring under very heavy borrowing and because of inflation have to borrow more heavily to finance their stock will again be asked to pay increased interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this morning that lending to industry by banks other than the associated banks accounted for 55 per cent of the total lending.  He evidently thinks this is a point in favour of his argument that the Government need do nothing.  This is as a result of the restriction on credit last year when they were forced out of the associated banks, forced into paying higher interest rates and are now being forced into paying even higher interest rates.</P>
    <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister, when he is replying to this debate, that the non-associated banks will now not be preserving the parity between their rates and the associated banks, which obtained up to last Friday. Despite the 55 per cent who are outside the associated banks, which the Minister for Finance appears to think are in some more favoured category, they do not want to be outside the associated banks because their position is as already as bad as those who are inside the associated banks.  Those people will now be faced with paying another 2½ per cent on top of very high interest rates already, with a consequential loss in jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister stood up today with his &ldquo;boy stood on the burning deck&rdquo; attitude saying that he would not be prepared to consider subsidies, which would have to be paid for by all the taxpayers.  What does that mean?  We are already subsidising in one form or another many industries in other sectors of life.  The tax on exports relief is a form of subsidy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> The relief of tax for artistic people is a form of subsidy.  The grants through the IDA are a form of subsidy.  Why draw the line now, when there is a chance of saving some of the small to medium sized businesses?  Why not adopt what the Confederation of Irish Industry asked the Government to do in regard to interest rates?  They have made some very sensible suggestions, one of which, as Deputy Barry Desmond said, has been with the Government since last October and they have had no reply since.</P>
    <P>This is not a Government looking for action, looking to cure problems, to find solutions, to create employment.  When a body such as the Confederation of Irish Industry could make a suggestion to the Government six months ago and not get a reply yet, this is not a Government looking for action.  This suggestion sent to the Government could be part of a package of other measures which could be taken to relieve industry of some of the detrimental effects of this increased interest rate.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about mortgages.  We had a totally irrelevant defence by the Minister for the Environment of the building societies for half an hour this afternoon, which had nothing to do with the motion on the Order Paper.  It is not the Minister's function to defend the building societies.  The proper relationship between the Minister for the Environment and the building societies should be a cool but a healthy respect for one another.  The building societies have a function and the Minister has another one, which is to provide housing at the cheapest possible price to as many people as possible.  That is one of the Minister's many functions and he uses the building societies for that purpose. They do not need defence in the House by the Minister as they are well able to defend themselves.  What is required from the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment and whoever will reply to this debate, and it is something we have not got from the two Ministers who have already contributed, is an indication&mdash;it was quite <Col N="1409" /> obvious from what the Minister said today that he has accepted in everything but words that the building societies will put up their mortgage rates very shortly&mdash;that the Government will introduce subsidies by the amount of that increase so that the moregage rates for householders will remain at today's level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last weekend I referred to the impact of the increase in interest rates on our job creation effort and the difficulties which these increased rates were likely to cause to a number of firms.  I made those comments in the context of the increasing evidence in recent weeks that Irish firms were feeling the impact of expensive and scarce domestic credit.  Because inflation is high, industry requires additional working capital in order to fund even a constant level of business activity.  This means that many firms are faced with a choice between additional borrowing and a reduction in production volumes by dropping the least profitable lines. Similarly, expanding firms are faced with the choice of further high cost borrowing or a reduction in their rate of growth.  It is inevitable that high interest rates require projects which can give an unusually high return.  At present some firms are not investing an additional working capital and are postponing expansion projects because of the high cost and lack of availability of funds.  The effects of these decisions of these firms is likely to be a slower than expected rate of industrial growth in 1980 and a slower than expected drop in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential to our economic growth that investment continues at the very high rates which we experienced during the last two decades.  The growth of the 1960s here was fuelled by rapidly increasing investment.  In the 1970s the IDA continued to have a dramatic influence on industrial performance through their investment programmes. During the last decade manufacturing output increased by an annual average of 6 per cent, one and a half times the <Col N="1410" /> rate of growth of the whole economy. Exports increased at an annual average of 15 per cent compared with 8½ per cent for world trade generally.  Annual investment increased from 13 per cent of GNP to over 29 per cent and growth in productivity in recent years increased to levels above that of France and Germany. Over the past four years manufacturing employment increased by over 8 per cent in contrast to very small growth in Germany and a fall in other European countries.  This kind of growth in our industrial sector has been necessary to accommodate the drift from agriculture, the burgeoning growth in our population and the failure of older traditional industries which had grown up behind tariff barriers.  Without this solid base of productive effort, we would not be able to afford many of the present expenditures on social welfare, health, education and housing.  Today we need even more critically to maintain this kind of progress in our industrial sector.  After the two best years in our history for increased employment we still have 8 per cent unemployment.  Given the flow of school leavers which will occur over the next few years and the expected job losses for a variety of reasons in existing industry we need to generate at least 15,000 new jobs in industry each year in order to make a worthwhile impact.  We need a continuation of productive investment to maintain the momentum of economic growth.  We need continual productive investment to provide jobs for a growing population of school leavers and to generate the wealth to redistribute through our social programmes.</P>
    <P>Our economy is not only small in world economic terms but it is also a very open economy.  Being small means that our economic policy, no matter how hard it tries and no matter how much we think we can determine external affairs, will only have a negligible impact on the general level of world activity.  It also means that the prices of the goods and services which we buy and sell on the world market are effectively fixed for us. The second characteristic of our economy, the openness, is essentially a <Col N="1411" /> function of our smallness.  It is simply impossible to produce all the goods which we require domestically.  The Irish market is too small a base on which to build the desired improvements in living standards.  These improvements can only be achieved if the market for Irish goods is expanded and this is the reason that from the late fifties on we became staunch advocates of free trade.  The extent of the openness of the Irish economy is demonstrated by the fact that this year imports and exports combined are expected to be equivalent to about 110 per cent of our GNP.  This smallness and openness makes us very vulnerable to fluctuations in world economic activity.  Certain of the major countries appear to be trying to outbid each other so as to ensure the flow of internationally mobile funds into their economies and thereby maintain or enhance the value of their own currencies. Even if we were to accept that current international interest rates reflected economic reality it is something we as a nation cannot afford to live with. About half of our manufactured output goes to export markets.  In these markets as I have already said, we are price takers and not price makers, consequently we do not easily have the option of being able to pass on higher interest charges.</P>
    <P>The situation is made all the more difficult on account of the slow down this year in the rate of growth of some of our major trading partners.  In fact, in the UK which continues to be our most important export outlet a decline in consumer demand is forecast for the next two years as is a decline in economic growth.  Because of the competitive and cut-throat environment in which our industries must operate in both the home and export markets, they cannot automatically adjust their prices upwards to cover the burden of cost increases such as energy costs, interest and fairly rapidly increasing wages. Since the increased interest rates were announced, I had undertaken a quick review of their likely impact on inward manufacturing investment.  We are looking <Col N="1412" /> to this source to provide about half of our new industrial jobs over the next few years.  I am somewhat relieved to be able to say that the effects are not likely to be too serious on this sector, principally because these projects whose businesses will be based on export markets by and large, can avail of a range of financing facilities such as leasing, section 84 loans and preference share financing.  These facilities have the effect of reducing the overall cost of borrowing for these projects but we are still left with the position of domestic companies.</P>
    <P>The higher interest rates will mean that some of them now earning marginal profits or in a break-even situation will soon suffer losses.  In order to minimise the scale of these losses some manufacturers may have to cut back on production and may have to lay off workers.  At present there are about 1,200 manufacturers employing 50,000 workers which belong to sectors which are sensitive in one degree or another.  Many companies in these sector had, through expensive investment and adaptation, survived the recession and were just in the last year or so beginning to find their feet.  The effect of the recent rise in interest rates on job maintenance in some of these sensitive sectors could be quite damaging. For example, about one quarter of the jobs in the clothing and footwear sector are in firms operating on very low margins which rely heavily on the banks to finance their day-to-day working capital needs.  Quite a few firms in the textile, wood, furniture, paper and printing industries now find themselves in a difficult situation.  The firms most at risk belong to the small industry category.  This is a subsector of industry which the IDA and SFADCo have been making vigorous efforts to promote and develop over the past two years.  Some of the valuable work of these agencies could well be undone with the blow of the recent increase in interest rates.</P>
    <P>In this regard one source of regret to me is that our smaller and more sensitive firms do not choose to avail themselves more of the lower interest rates prevailing <Col N="1413" /> in certain other EEC states.  I understand that there has been some move in our bigger firms in recent months to borrow in these attractive markets.  I hope that this development will increase and intensify in the months ahead. However, despite the facilities which are already provided by the ICC and the ACC and the additional facilities planned to which the Minister for Finance referred today, there still remains the problem for small firms which because of their size are unwilling to take the risk of exchange losses arising from currency adjustments.  There are a number of suggestions that I would make to them and to larger firms in that respect.</P>
    <P>The history of our membership of the EMS over the 13 months since we became members has been a good one, of considerable stability as illustrated by the ability of the Irish pound to maintain closely its relationship with the other currencies in the system.  The position is that, for example, somebody who had borrowed in deutschemarks 13 months ago and who was called on to repay his borrowings today would not suffer any exchange loss.  So far as some of the currencies which fluctuate from day to day are concerned a person in that situatoon would have made a very marginal capital gain on his transaction.  The Central Bank have been particularly successful in its maintenance of the value of the Irish £ in the EMS but we have had to pay a price for that in certain other respects, one of which would be in the level of interest rates.  This in itself has been a penalty but the price that has been paid has produced an exceptional stability in our currency since our joining the EMS, during which time there has been much instability in the relationships of world currencies to each other.  Irish firms, and in this context I include business generally and farms, might well consider the advantages that would have accrued to them had they borrowed in these currencies during the past 13 months.  They might well take into account the efforts of the Central Bank to maintain the stability of our currency and the advantages that will <Col N="1414" /> accrue from that situation.  In addition, they might consider to a much greater extent going into these markets to borrow.</P>
    <P>The fact that up to March of last year we had traditionally a very close relationship with the £ Sterling leaves many people to judge the performance of the Irish £ simply with reference to the £ sterling but that currency for particular and special reasons has been very much higher during the past year than it would have been in normal circumstances.  We all have a duty to seek to inform people generally of the necessity of remembering the stability which has been achieved in regard to our currency.</P>
    <P>In effect, the State is taking up the exchange risk involved in the ICC and the ACC moneys which, with the additional moneys referred to by the Minister for Finance will amount very shortly to substantial sums.  I have under consideration the question of the feasibility of introducing here some form of self financing means of guaranteeing the exchange rate.  It is understandable that the Exchequer is loath to involve itself in greater exposure in this respect than the considerable exposure to which it is subject at the moment but I do not consider it impossible to devise a means whereby a self-financing system could be evolved. In this connection there is a subhead in the Estimate for my Department for this year to cover the State's exchange risk in this regard.  There was such a provision last year also by way of a supplememtary estimate.  The State's experience during the past 13 months has been a relatively happy one because we have not lost out in the exchange risk involved in borrowing in EMS currencies.  As I said in Limerick at the weekend we are extremely concerned about these problems.  I do not wish to exaggerate the problems because to do so would cause panic but neither do I wish to understate them.  At the same time, I wish to emphasise that these problems exist. We are very concerned that interest rates should now be so high and we should like to see them being reduced if at all possible.  As I said in Limerick we will be <Col N="1415" /> examining the position in this regard during the coming weeks.  As well as the interest rates themselves we will be examining the position of how the reluctance of much of Irish business to borrow at the reasonable rates that are available on the Continent might be overcome.  We shall be examining the question of how some support might be given without extending the already considerable Exchequer support in this regard, a step which the Minister for Finance and the Government would wish to avoid if at all possible.</P>
    <P>At this point there may well be raised the question of whether institutional changes are required to facilitate our adjustment to international monetary trends as we have experienced them in the past year with particular reference to the new exchange control regime which we entered into in March of last year. This is a question that should be asked widely now because since March of last year the ball game in respect of monetary policy and monetary controls has changed very considerably and far more fundamentally than most people realised.  The new system has meant an adjustment process for the Central Bank in particular.  Certain steps have been taken by them in the process of adjusting to the dramatic and radically new situation in which we find ourselves.  There may be room for further steps to be taken and the kind of further steps that I would consider to be worthy of consideration at this time are whatever steps may be feasible to insulate us as an economy to a greater extent against the kind of international turbulence that we have seen in foreign monetary systems during the past year or so.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whatever steps might be found appropriate to put us in a position to tailor our own monetary policy to a greater extent to conform with the disciplines of the EMS as opposed to the fundamentally different system which existed for us up to March of 1979, it is vital that we examine what steps can be open to us to ensure that our economy is not so exposed to international damage <Col N="1416" /> being caused to it.  Paradoxically enough, our openness in the past was probably greater when we were tied to sterling, because whatever happened in London was forced automatically onto us regardless of whether it was appropriate to the Irish economy and even though in some instances that I can recall it was positively damaging to our economy and something that we would not have undertaken ourselves.  Despite our being a very open trading nation living in a very open environment in the world economy generally one of the advantages of our membership of the EMS has been to give us a certain level of protection.  It should be borne in mind that whereas before when there was an outflow of funds, caused for example by interest rates moving above those of the associated banks, that outflow of funds inevitably was out of the country and the economy. The situation is different today.  The outflow is only partially out of the country and out of the economy.  As I understand it, the outflows complained of in recent weeks were out of one part of the banking system into another part of the banking system.  The overall effect on the economy may be only relatively marginal and that is a new dimension to which we should address ourselves.</P>
    <P>These are some examples of the way in which I think the position has changed radically in the past year.  I do not think in the present circumstances that the banks automatically should take up the kind of view that might have been valid and perfectly reasonable up to March 1979.  The circumstances have changed so radically that to apply the pre-1979 rules willy-nilly to the present situation is no longer valid or totally justified.  I accept it is partly so but is no longer totally the case.</P>
    <P>We have failed through a certain reluctance on the part of business generally, including farmers&mdash;I suppose it is understandable and one cannot altogether blame them&mdash;to avail of the chances open to us in borrowing on the European markets.  Anyone who did so a year ago and who finds himself called on to repay the money today is in a very advantageous <Col N="1417" /> position.  I think that at least part of the solution of our present difficulties may lie in trying to devise means whereby avoiding additional risks to the Exchequer one could open up greater avenues of access to the attractive money available there today.  The concern that has been felt during the past year, while understandable, has not been justified in practice.  One would be foolhardy at this stage to make a forecast about the future when the whole international monetary scene is so volatile but I do not think the prospects in this respect are too much worse than they were last year.  The efforts made by the Central Bank to protect our currency and to hold its stability have paid off.  As I said earlier, if we have to pay a certain price in some respects for that let us as a nation take advantage of the good results of the price that we have to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy E. Collins on his work, initiative and industry in producing for the benefit of this House such a fine Bill to fill a very obvious void in our educational system.  He has gone about it in a positive, practical and constructive way.  He could have approached it in a negative way, asking the Minister why he was not producing such a Bill.  But to avoid that type of a situation Deputy E. Collins, after months of research, hard work and industry, put this splendid Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening remarks last evening Deputy Collins gave us the obvious <Col N="1421" /> reasons for the need for such a Bill.  I was disappointed at the attitude of the Minister when he felt that he could not accept this Bill, saying that he would vote against it.  In his reply the Minister referred to the Vocational Education Act of 1930.  That to me was the Minister hiding behind a 50 year old Act, which is reprehensible.</P>
    <P>While that legislation introduced in the 1930s has withstood the test of time it cannot be expected to meet the needs of the 1980s as we move closer to the 21st century.  Even after careful perusal of that Act I failed to find any reference to the term &ldquo;adult education&rdquo;.  There was reference to &ldquo;continuation education&rdquo; and to &ldquo;technical education&rdquo; but none, as far as I could find, to &ldquo;adult education&rdquo; and I would be obliged if the Minister would tell me if he can find any such reference.  That 1930 Act was never envisaged or intended to carry on, promote, or assist adult education as it has developed since the 1930s.</P>
    <P>Here I am not decrying the splendid work of the VECs.  Indeed it is a fitting tribute to the then Minister for Education that an Act introduced by him should be relied on by the present Minister for Education, some 50 years later, in the task of providing adult education.  I am fully aware of the splendid work being done by the VECs throughout the country as I have been for the past 15 years a member of South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee. I know at first-hand the splendid work they have done in their schools, particularly in the adult education field.  I am in no way critical of that work, of any of the other VECs throughout the country, or of the other splendid voluntary bodies who over the years have served our adult population well.</P>
    <P>At this stage, however, we feel something more is needed in the development of Irish education.  What is proposed here by Deputy Collins is the formation of a Council for Adult Education, a body that would co-ordinate, regularise and unify all of the splendid organisation and effort at present being put into adult education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> The Minister is afraid of new structures. He is afraid that this new council will cost quite a lot of money.  Any money spent in the setting up of this or a similar council would be well spent because he would have an overall umbrella organisation, watchful and careful of moneys being dispensed.  They would be formulating a policy for all the Republic and there would be no wasteful duplication of effort, time or money.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister in his reply did not indicate to this House that he or his Department were thinking of initiating somewhat similar legislation. Like all Bills first introduced, this is not perfect in every sense, but it could be amended.  I have no doubt that Deputy E. Collins would be in agreement with any amendments put forward by the Minister and by Members of the Labour Party so that in the final analysis we would have some Bill to cater for this new development in adult education. That there is need for such a council is beyond all doubt and I have no doubt that the Minister is fully aware of that very fine report of the committee chaired by Con Murphy entitled <i>Adult Education in Ireland</i>, published in 1973.  This committee sought reports and submissions from many organisations and towards the end of their report are listed five or six pages of reputable organisations fully representative of all sections of Irish industrial, cultural and educational life making submissions to this committee appointed by the then Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister now going to turn his back on these submissions and on the Murphy report?  Surely there should be some continuity in a Department of Education.  Ministers for Education come and go, but there should be continuity of purpose.  If a Minister in the early seventies felt that there was a need to set up this committee and the committee have met and produced a very fine document, surely the report cannot be summarily tossed aside and by-passed and the work undertaken by them just written off as being a non-essential, unimportant or having no function.  When a <Col N="1423" /> committee set up to report into matters put quite a lot of expense, trouble and careful research into their report which then is not acted upon, that is deplorable. This report mentions that there is a need for a council for adult education.  It was in the knowledge of that report and of the full backing of all these organisations who have contributed so much either on a statutory basis or in a voluntary capacity towards adult education in Ireland that Deputy E. Collins introduced this Bill to set up a council for adult education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister is aware of the discussion document on an NCEA award structure for recurrent education.  The NCEA authorised a working party to inquire into an award structure and they likewise have come up in their report with a recommendation for such a council, if not specifically at least implied.  We have Aontas, an organisation who have done so much for adult education.  They also have come out very much in favour of such a council.</P>
    <P>The Minister is retreating back into the 1930s under the shadow of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  He has stated that in his opinion there is no need for such a council and that the work can be done quite capably and ably under that Act.  I commend the Minister on his recent appointment of 50 adult education officers throughout the country. This is the first step towards giving true recognition to the role of those engaged in adult education in Ireland.  I have no doubt that sooner or later the officials in his Department will see the light and the urgent need for such a council.</P>
    <P>We have the report undertaken by Ciarán Benson on behalf of our Arts Council, <i>The Place of the Arts in Irish Education</i>.  He likewise has indicated his wish for such a council as a co-ordinating body to overlook and oversee and to have a unity of purpose for all these multitudinous organisations throughout Ireland who are engaged in adult education.  Anyone must admit that so many organisations involved at present in adult education, all doing <Col N="1424" /> splendid work, are bound to overlap in many respects.  There is bound to be dissipation of energy, time, moneys and resources which are so scarce.  In the spirit of that, Deputy Collins, the Fine Gael spokesman on Education, primed by those various interests in adult education, produced this Bill for this House. The Minister in tossing this aside glibly and saying that the interests of adult education are being catered for adequately is doing a disservice not alone to parliamentary life here in Dáil Éireann but also to the whole concept and theme of adult education throughout the country. The old phrase is that it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. Here Deputy Collins has shown his commitment to adult education, particularly to this aspect of it.  He has gone to the trouble of introducing this very worthwhile Bill which will meet the fate of many other Bills introduced by Opposition spokesmen.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his reply that he is very much aware of the impact of adult education in rural Ireland, but I maintain that we have touched only the tip of the iceberg.  A tremendous amount more could be undertaken, given proper development and the proper council, to permeate every single area of Irish life. Regarding family life there is the old concept that if you educate a parent, particularly a mother, you educate a family.  There are the workers, and nowadays with the progress of technology there is an urgent need to learn and relearn new trades so that we will be able to meet competition from our European counterparts.  All citizens and, ultimately, the State would benefit if we had a sound system of adult education. Nowadays, especially with the curtailing of the working week and the difficulty of getting employment, it is the duty of any Government to prepare people for their leisure hours so that they are better able to cope with the extra free time they have at their disposal.  A lot can be done in adult education to prepare people who are forced into early retirement so that after leaving their employment they can become interested in pursuing adult education courses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> We have only touched the tip of the iceberg.  As one delves into this adult education field one can see how important it is in all our lives.  When one is dealing with an educated electorate the problems of Government are better understood. A more educated people will react positively and constructively to the problems facing any Government and the economy.  I believe for those reasons the Minister must take a look at the role he is prepared to play in this very vital sector of adult education.  The importance of the role of adult education has been recognised not alone in Europe but throughout the world.  We need a policy statement from the Minister, what his attitude is in relation to adult education so that those involved in this field will at least know where they stand.  We also need to hear from him his determination to introduce legislation.</P>
    <P>The time has now come for action. The action most needed is the introduction of legislation to take account of the new problems facing the educational world.  The Minister should set up the structures for this in his Department. There are so many groups interested and working towards adult education at the moment that there are bound to be <i>ad hoc</i> policies, disunity and conflict.  The Minister should ensure that every statutory body and voluntary organisation will know what their role will be and be complementary to each other, not opposed to each other, in every respect.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to state where he stands with regard to adult education, his policy in relation to it, the role he sees for adult education in the educational sphere and to tell us what legislation he hopes to introduce and the structures he will get his departmental officials to improvise. At an international level, we are fully aware of the importance all nations have been placing on education.  I will not bore the House by stating what other countries are doing.  Some of them have shown us the way.  We should not rely on what other countries are doing in this regard but should take our courage in our hands, take the initiative and be world trend-setters in this regard rather <Col N="1426" /> than falling behind what other countries have done.</P>
    <P>France adopted a system some years ago where a training levy was imposed on all industries.  I am sure this is the wrong time to talk about any further levies on industry but at least it shows the commitment of the French Government and the importance they attach to the development of adult education.  The German Government are considering plans for adult education.  I am told that in Denmark a number of their Ministers were formerly principals in high schools, which is the nearest thing they have to an adult education scheme.  In Yugoslavia there is a movement set up, a workers' university, which has been well established.  In Italy a scheme for 50 hours paid education per year was implemented. The new Government in India have provided for total parity between adult education and primary education.  UNESCO have adopted a resolution in this regard, to which we are signatories.  The OECD have also produced a document on comprehensive policies for the development of adult education.  The Council of Europe in Strasbourg have done something similar, as has the EEC.  We are not alone in this. Other countries have seen the value of education.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, irrespective of his attitude to date on this Bill, for the sake of adult education in this country, to have another look at the role his Department are playing in this very vital field of adult education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should an effort be made at this stage to introduce another vehicle in relation to adult education when there seems to be enough vehicles and structures available to allow for general advance in this field? I am surprised at this Bill being introduced now.  I hope its introduction is not merely for the sake of optics, to give the impression of some activity.  Legislation alone does not bring about a real advance on the ground.  It takes time for many decisions to work their way down to where we want effective action.  The <Col N="1427" /> setting up of another structure would involve a lot of duplication and it would blunt a lot of the enthusiasm that is there at the moment.  We have sufficient agencies involved already which are being used by the Minister to advance adult education.  Having listened to Opposition speakers I gather that the reason they are knocking the 1930 VEC Act is that it is 50 years old.  Just because it is 50 years old is not a reason to change it or replace it although perhaps it could be changed in a positive way.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a clear indication of his interest in adult education in a very real and practicable sense, not in the theoretical sense of introducing a Bill like this but by his appointment of 50 adult education organisers who are at present active in the field and are working with local communities.  Their presence on the ground has afforded recognition and a fair tribute to the many agencies that have pioneered and developed adult education.  I cannot stress too much the importance of the practical side of this evolution.</P>
      <P>Just imagine what the establishment of a council structure would mean at this point in time.  It would mean a huge transfer of resources and material and the amount of interplay that would occur would obviate the progress we all want to see on the ground.  Another structure would bring about a lot of unnecessary duplication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the organisers that have been appointed by the Minister.  One has been appointed to the VEC in Wicklow and he is actively meeting with local groups.  Many of these local groups see the formation of a sub-committee within the VEC as a useful and worthwhile development and they highlight the importance of localisation.  We have often been told of the necessity to leave the affairs of the community within the community. Why not in the case of education leave those developments in the community?  Why move these developments under the umbrella of a centralised council?  If the CAEI were to be launched into the educational arena, which already has many abbreviations, it <Col N="1428" /> would add a certain amount of confusion and lack of genuine advance.  The function of the organisers appointed in conjunction with the sub-committees of the VEC is to identify the educational needs of adults in the area.  The country is relatively small but educational needs in various areas are dissimilar especially when one considers the rural situation as against the urban situation.  I prefer the localised approach of the sub-committees and the organiser who can pinpoint the deficiencies in adult education in a particular area.  A council would give the more general aspect of matters rather than pinpointing the essentials.</P>
    <P>Looking at appendix I of the Circular letter No. 42/79 about the appointment of adult education organisers I note that the function of the organiser is to cover practically all of the aspects of adult education.  The organiser must identify the educational needs of adults.  How better could these needs be identified than at local level?  The organiser must also examine the existing provision of adult education courses and facilities and this can also be done better at local level.  The function of the organisers is also to suggest possible areas of co-operation between agencies and services in the provision of adult education.  A council could do that but a council would be working on a completely different plane.  The organiser could also prepare for the VEC adult education subcommittee, a draft annual programme of adult education activities. That would ensure that leisure needs were catered for, it would also take cognizance of early redundancies and free time in an area and it could enable those courses to be provided in a local establishment.  There are also other aspects where these co-ordinators could get involved.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that these organisers are approximate to the local groups.  Many voluntary organisations will be further encouraged by the immediacy of contact.  The proposed council would centralise and by virtue of centralisation would slow down the on-the-ground <Col N="1429" /> impetus which we complement. At this point a council would move towards centralisation.</P>
    <P>Adult education legislation <i>per se</i> does not bring about a real increase immediately. We would have a lot of ongoing discussion and to-ing and fro-ing where people endeavoured to find out where their spheres commenced and stopped.  There would be a shocking amount of over-lap which would not bring a great deal of advance.  The local community has a local axis and in relation to the VEC Act the local VEC is a very important cog in this axis.  The people really treasure and take pride in the school.  They feel a part of it and want to see its development.  They respond to its flexibility and this flexibility is such as to enable it not alone to respond to the needs but also innovate for localised needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has actually shown a positive advance in adult education, not a theoretical advance, by utilising the available framework in a very practical way.  Committees of the VEC have pioneered adult education through the years.  I should like to pay tribute to them for their involvement and would not like to overlook the involvement of many primary schools and voluntary secondary schools in adult education. Their commitment is known and appreciated. They can readily develop within the field of adult education.</P>
    <P>At a localised level they can have representation on the adult education sub-committee.  They can get involved also with the huge number of voluntary agencies, some of whom have an annual grant from the Department, who are doing tremendous work in this field.  They are moving ahead and developing still further a programme of practical adult education.  We all know and esteem voluntary agencies such as ICA, Macra na Tíre, Macra na Tuaithe, National Youth Council and Aontas.  They cater for the different needs and interests of adults.  They continue to give distinguished service and within these groups there is a flexibility and an on-the-ground <Col N="1430" /> local organiser.  If this council were to be established, it would dampen this localisation and on-the-ground enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>When one speaks of adult education one must take cognisance of the involvement of RTCs, universities with their extramural departments many of which have diploma courses in adult education, and also the agricultural advisory service. They cater for the adult population and for people who have just left school by their many winter classes and lectures. AnCO also provide a vital role as do the agencies of other Government Departments.  When one considers the different groups in vocational schools, primary schools, voluntary secondary schools, RTCs and local branches of voluntary agencies, liaison in adult education can be most effective at county or area level.  Adult education sub-committees have and can have representatives of voluntary bodies who have much expertise and a lot of advice to offer in the realm of adult education matters.  It must be advantageous to the sub-committees and the adult education organiser.  Secondary, comprehensive and community schools should also participate in these sub-committees.</P>
    <P>One must stress the practicability of the advance of the Minister for Education in the field of adult education.  There is an on-going development.  In each small town and village and in larger towns and centres there are people who are involved with those who develop and make adult education available.  This is a very definite advance and a utilisation of resources in a very beneficial way.  The establishment of a central body at this time in the evolution of adult education could dampen this local enthusiasm by its very remoteness from the real needs and involvement of local communities.</P>
    <P>When one considers the many abbreviations that there are at present in education would the launching of the CAEI show enlightened advancement in this sphere?  It may be the final straw that would bring about the necessity for a key for a ready reckoner for each <Col N="1431" /> citizen so as to interpret and identify the various groups and factors who are involved in education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>If one examines the different groups whose initials we hear mentioned regularly and throws in another abbreviation in the form of the CAEI people's minds will boggle.  If Deputies read over the reports of the various congresses of the different bodies held during Easter&mdash;ASTI, TUI, INTO, all good and laudable bodies, CHRS, CCSS, FIPESO&mdash;they would know what we are talking about.  Would throwing in another player, the CAEI, being the council for adult education in Ireland, advance that situation?  Perhaps one might come up with a different form of title.  Does this really bring about the practical advance we all desire?  I do not think so.  Its arrival on the education scene would bring about a huge transfer of development with resultant duplication, wastage of resources, stifling of expertise and would be very negative in the main.</P>
      <P>Deputy Griffin drew some comparisons and spoke in terms of many laudable programmes that have been launched in different countries.  It is not feasible to compare an adult education programme in India with one in Ireland. Thankfully, we do not have even a minute percentage of the illiteracy of that unfortunate country.  If Deputy Kenny wants to comment on that I will give way to him.</P>

    <P>People take great pride in what they have at local level.  They would not want <Col N="1432" /> to see any of their involvements moved to a central council.  I fear that might happen.

      <P>I would like to compliment Deputy E. Collins on producing this Bill and for giving the House the opportunity to discuss this very important area of our educational system.  The need for adult education is beyond doubt and many contributions I have heard reinforce that view.  The area of adult education, as has been stated in the Murphy Report and in various comments by people in the educational field for whom I have great respect, cannot be over-stressed. The only objection made by Deputy Murphy to this Bill was the abbreviation. He said that was the most confusing part of it.</P>

He complimented the Minister on umpteen occasions for pushing, shoving and trying to improve the situation.  The Minister provided 50 officers who are now in the field.  My county has two officers whom I know personally.  Both are fine gentlemen doing good work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy talked about the dangers of centralisation and the lack of any local community input.  The present system is having the opposite effect because what we have now is a grafting operation.  We have 50 officers in the field grafted on to the present structure which is one of the most centralised in Western Europe.</P>

      <P>The VEC, of which I <Col N="1433" /> was a member for some years, are responsible to the Minister for Education and dance to the tune played in Marlborough Street.  Nobody in this House is naive enough to think they dance otherwise.  There is no specific section of the Department with responsibility for adult education.  This is unfortunate and when one considers the radical social changes that have taken place in the past few years, one cannot but be struck by the difficulties many adults have in coping with their environment. Nothing has been done to alleviate the pressures on the people.  While the grafting of a system on to a system which was meant for full-time education of young adults in the vocational system will do good work and will be beneficial to those who avail of that service, obviously we must have a separate structure, a statutory framework, to deal with this problem of adult education, and it is a very grave problem nowadays.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy talked about retraining, leisure pursuits and so on.  There are people living under stress, who do not have enough funds to meet their needs, who have social problems, housing problems and so on.  The part adult education courses will play in relieving them of some of these pressures and in alleviating some of their anxieties would be very great.  Many people find they are ill-prepared to meet the problems confronting them in today's world.</P>

I am disappointed that he would not see the sense in the Bill and at least give us his version of what is adult education.  I do not understand the Minister's attitude because there is no reason to believe that a separate framework would involve extra expenditure initially but it would indicate a commitment on the part of the Government to what they say is our greatest national asset.</P>

      <P>Of course I agree but there is an insidious attempt by Deputy Murphy to point to us as downgrading the work of the 50 officers already in the field.  There is no such intention on our part.  All of us in this party are behind the work of those officers and we wish them every success.  But of course any of these officers would be happier to be working in a system such as the one proposed in this Bill.  However, I do not suppose that Deputy Murphy has talked to his local officers in this regard.</P>

      <P>The provision of adult <Col N="1436" /> education or of recurring or continuing education as it is sometimes referred to is something that we cannot afford to approach in a haphazard way.  We must ensure that our people get the opportunities they deserve and if we regard our people as our greatest asset we must be prepared to allow that asset to be developed to its full potential.  Unless we have the guts and the commitment to provide by way of statute for a system that would give our people a chance in later life, to educate themselves in their chosen fields we are failing in our duty to them.  The Minister is now failing in that duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps to some extent it is indicative of the Government's real interest in adult education that on the very day on which this Bill first came before the House for discussion&mdash;that was yesterday&mdash;every vocational committee received a circular from the Minister directing them to increase their fees for all adult education classes by 40 per cent.  Perhaps that is nearer to the truth than some of the righteous fulminations we have heard from the Government side both yesterday and today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The courses are well worth the fees involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to set up one single statutory authority with regional authorities and with county committees in order that there might be a clear understanding on the part of all those involved in adult education as to whom they were responsible and in what way the service was to operate.  We all know that the authority are charged with the statutory obligation of providing adult education and this obligation is discharged by the vocational education committees with, I regret to say, varying degrees of efficiency and of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has grown up a situation in which some community schools provide an extensive range of adult education courses.  The same applies to some of the voluntary secondary schools and to the comprehensive schools.  The People's College and the Adult Education Institute <Col N="1437" /> and such organisations provide a different range of services but they are not responsible to any overall control or co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the concept enshrined in the Bill was a good one and one that is long overdue not only in relation to adult education but in relation also to other aspects of education.  Many of those who, on a non-party basis, are interested in education look forward to the day when we might have a regional education authority and a county education authority.  This Bill would have been a forerunner of the concept of regional education.  It would have been a step forward in the whole sphere of education apart altogether from the worthwhile contribution that it would have made in the area of adult education.  For this reason I was surprised by the attitude of the Minister but I was taken aback at the cavilling attitude displayed by the Labour Party spokesman in outlining their approach to the Bill and in their criticism that what is needed in adult education is finance and not structures. That is an over-simplification because both finance and structures are needed.  I was amazed on reading Deputy Horgan's speech to discover that having said that, the remainder of his speech was devoted almost exclusively to the fact that there was a need for the restructuring of the adult education system. One would have expected a greater appreciation on the part of Deputy Horgan, having regard to his experience in the field of education, than that displayed in his contribution.</P>
    <P>Let us take, for instance, the VEC in Deputy Murphy's constituency who may be operating enthusiastically but who might very well be next door to a committee that are operating to the very minimum statutory requirements, who do not in any way co-ordinate the courses being provided between one centre and another and who do not co-operate with the voluntary secondary schools or with the community or comprehensive schools in their area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has appointed 50 adult education officers but I know of one <Col N="1438" /> community school within the area of my committee who chose not to co-operate with the organiser assigned to the area on the basis that they did not like the system and wished to operate independently. There is no control, statutory or otherwise, whereby they could be made to fit in with the system for the good of the community and in the interest of the organised provision of adult education on the widest possible level.  That is the sort of problem that would have been eliminated by the acceptance of this Bill but it is the sort of problem that would appear not to have been comprehended either by the Government side or by Labour.</P>
    <P>In making these comments I should like to pay tribute to Aontas and to the voluntary organisations who have struggled despite lack of support and lack of encouragement down through the years to provide the level of adult education that is now available but which is available on an uneven basis.  Not so many years ago the CEO of a vocational educational committee who were not one million miles away either from Deputy Murphy's constituency or mine, when he was asked the number of people attending his adult education courses said, &ldquo;There are 1,400 this year but we are working hard to bring it down to 800&rdquo;. Is the House seriously suggesting there is no need for a statutory overall controlling authority who can see to it that that kind of man is made to do his job?  Fifty adult education organisers have been appointed and that has been of considerable help.  However, the more those organisers become involved in the field, as they should be, the more difficult it becomes for them to provide information and service to their committees because of the lack of administrative back-up staff.  I appreciate this is a problem that was bound to arise but it will become more acute as the organisers become more successful.  That needs to be taken into account.  Another matter that must be considered is the derisory payments to teachers who participate in adult education courses and also the rate of travelling expenses.  Most of the teachers <Col N="1439" /> who participate, especially the specialist teachers, must have a real interest in the development of adult education because from a financial point of view it cannot be beneficial to them.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects that must not be forgotten is that we are moving more and more towards a non-work society where the population will have more leisure time but will not necessarily have more disposable income. They will spend more time out of the workplace but will not be given more money.  If we do not find outlets for them, if we do not help them to develop their interests, we will have the recipe for a social time bomb.  People may have to face the prospect of a shorter working week but may not have extra money and it is important that they know how to spend their leisure time.  They must be given proper resources to develop their interests, to retrain and to develop their skills.  Until we provide adult education on that co-ordinated basis we are not providing a proper service.  In addition, we are not recognising the social time bomb that will exist.  Adult education at the moment is being approached in a haphazard way.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes a single statutory authority to oversee the very uneven provision of the service.  This would be good from the point of view of education in general by providing the first of the regional and the county educational authorities without the intrusion of any of the other vested interests.</P>

It is a good Bill, but Fianna Fáil and the Minister do not want to give credit to it.  They are frightened of changes and of new structures.  I am sad to see that the Minister has been subsumed by his civil servants.  I did not think it would happen.

      <P>It is most unfortunate that the Minister has been hoodwinked into taking a negative attitude to a basic structural change in education.  We had the Murphy report on adult education and chapter 4 of that report dealt with structures.  The summary of recommendations coincides closely with what is in my Bill.  Obviously, I paid attention to it. I examined the structures and I saw advantages in introducing a Bill and in proposing to set up a council.  I want to make it clear that the Murphy report recommends such legislation and it recommends many things contained in my Bill.  I am on good ground in introducing the Bill and Fianna Fáil are on bad ground in rejecting it.</P>
      <P>One of the most respected voluntary bodies involved in adult education is Aontas, the National Association of Adult Education.  They have been praised by the Minister and everyone in this House.  I should like to quote a press release of Aontas dated 14 April 1980 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> Aontas welcomes publication of the Adult Education Bill.  The Executive Committee of Aontas, the National Association of Adult Education, has welcomed the publication of the Council for Adult Education Bill, 1980, circulated recently by Mr. Edward Collins, T.D., Fine Gael spokesman on education.  The Executive Committee considers the Bill to be a significant contribution to the discussions on the development of Irish adult education.  The Bill is interpreted as being a serious attempt to give a new status to the whole area of adult education which is seen as a particularly desirable development.  The Executive Committee has written to Mr. Collins, T.D., requesting clarification of a number of points in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I consider that a welcome acknowledgement by Aontas.  I also consider it to be a condemnation of the Minister's failure to take this opportunity to have a serious attempt to look at the matter.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that the opposition to this Bill is spurious and ill-founded.  The Bill would provide a social weapon to fight inequality in our society.  Deputy Horgan last night spoke of the one million who left school in the sixties without any formal certificates. This is an indication of the great need for a proper structure of adult education because many men and women now working have to tackle social changes and they want to be able to keep up with those changes.  They want to be able to know about their opportunities, to be better informed.  Perhaps they want to improve their position in life, their position as parents.  They might want to know their constitutional rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> the institutions of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are some of the reasons for providing a proper structure of adult education which is not there now.  There is a very unequal distribution of the present provision for adult education services. Deputy Boland spoke of one county in which there is an active VEC, but in other counties there is only a minimum service.  The voluntary bodies, and organisations such as VECs and <Col N="1443" /> county committees of agriculture, have done a lot in this field but there is a need to bring these organisations together. This can be done only by a national council for adult education which would co-ordinate national effort at local and regional levels so that local and regional interests would become involved.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that my Labour colleagues do not see fit to support the Bill because of their own policies in this respect.  I assure them that the structures provided for in the Bill would give an impetus to local and regional involvement. There is no attempt to do anything more than to ensure such local involvement in adult education which would help us to face up to the problems in our society. There are many people crying out for a proper adult education programme.  If that is not provided there will be a social upheaval.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> The council suggested in the Bill would fill the gap that now exists in this field of education.  At the moment there is no co-ordinating agency in the Department. All they do is to provide 50 additional adult education advisers.  That is not tackling the problem.  There is need for a national body to co-ordinate regional and local interests.  I do not know where we would be without the voluntary bodies, the VECs and the county committees of agriculture.  We want to have adult education put on the same basis as any other sector of education. There is need for further financial commitment in this field and I do not make any apology when I seek money for this purpose.  If we do not face these problems we will be in for a serious social upheaval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  When I raised the question it seemed to be taken by Members of the House as a joke but it is far from being a joke in the perimeter between Dublin city and county where it has been of grave concern for a long time.  There was an instance where a horse jumped over a fence on to the bonnet of a car and wrecked and ruined the car.  The legal result was that the motorist was responsible because the accident occurred on the road and he injured the animal, and he was liable for any costs.</P>
      <P>Within the last week a collision between a motor-cyclist and a wandering horse resulted in the death of the motor-cyclist. This is a very serious matter.  As the law stands at the moment, in cases of collision between a third party and a stray animal the onus is on whoever the party may be, generally a motorist, if he happens to collide with the animal on the road.  Not alone is the motorist not guaranteed any recompense but he is liable for any injury caused to the animal.</P>
      <P>At the moment in cases of animals found wandering on the road the fines are completely unrealistic.  The Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1851, lays down that the maximum fine that can be imposed is two shillings.  Everybody here realises how much two shillings is worth today.  It may have been worth something in 1851.  There is a later Act under which these charges can be brought and which provides a maximum fine of £6.  However, we have consulted with the Garda and they have told us that they are reluctant to bring charges under this Act because they have to prove that there has been negligence on the part of the owner before they can get a conviction.  Naturally if someone has been negligent and has allowed animals to wander for a year or two or three and no accident has ever occurred, he is not going to go forward and say that this has been a habitual thing.  Therefore, the Garda find that it is nearly impossible to get a conviction under this Act whereas it is possible to get a conviction under the 1851 Act.  But the maximum fine imposed in that Act is two shillings and one Justice threw a case out of court, saying that he would refuse to hear it because of the unrealistic fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go into several other matters but because we had a vote tonight we are <Col N="1447" /> very limited in time.  I do not want to make political capital out of this.  This matter concerns my constituency of Dublin-Finglas and it may concern Ballyfermot and other areas also which border on the city.  I am going to give some of the time allowed to me to my colleague, Deputy B. Ahern, who is also a Deputy for my area on the Government side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague on the opposite side for giving me the time.  As everybody probably knows from reading the papers, the problem with stray horses is that, apart from three or four accidents which caused deaths in the last year, the legislation which covers it goes back to the days of the cowboys in 1851, 1861 and 1870 when the city was a big open place with corrals at every house and there was no need to have a proper place for horses. There is the 1851 Act, the 1961 Traffic Act and so on but the only Act we are talking about in this regard is that of 1935 which enables the Minister to act. Section 2 (1) of this Act says:</P>
      <P>Every local authority shall provide in the functional area of such authority such pounds as the county registrar shall, with the approval of the Minister, direct either generally or in any particular case, and every local authority shall maintain in accordance with this Act every pound provided by them under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin, a city with a million people, has only one pound located in Rathfarnham and a corral in Coolock which does not operate and this proves that the local authorities of Dublin city and county are not doing their job.  Will the Minister direct the local authorities to stop allowing people to die?  Apart from the problem of animals straying through gardens, there are derbys through the streets in Deputy Belton's and my constituency as well as in other constituencies. The local authorities should stop saying that it is the job of the Minister for Justice or the Minister for the Environment. They should take action under the 1935 Act where it clearly states <Col N="1448" /> that the Minister has powers.  They have been asked to act on this but they have not done so.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister instruct local authorities to act under this 1935 Act?  It should then be an easy job to put heavy fines and proper poundage charges on all these wandering animals.  Very little can be done at the moment when there are not any places to lock them up.  It is not a function of the Garda authorities because they have too many other problems.  The 1935 Act clearly sets out the functions of local authorities in relation to doing their job properly in this matter.  There is land all over the north side of Dublin where such pounds could be provided.  Deputy Belton and I have raised this matter on many occasions with the local authorities.  It is only with reluctance that we have brought the matter into this House because we have failed to get the local authorities to do anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Luke Belton and Deputy Bertie Ahern for their contribution this evening on this subject.  I would like to assure Deputy Belton that I did not regard it as funny when he gave notice this morning that he intended raising this matter.  I believe it was the most important thing that was raised during the first 45 minutes of our debates this morning.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that tragic circumstances have prompted this debate and I sympathise with the family and the relatives of Mr. Sheehan, who lost his life recently as a result of an accident with one of these wandering horses.  The problem of wandering horses has been with us, unfortunately, for a very long time and we seem to be going around in circles in relation to it.  There is no easy solution; if there was I would like to assure the Deputies that legislative and administrative measures would have been introduced a long time ago to eliminate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sides to this particular problem, the criminal side and the civil side.  There are a number of bodies with <Col N="1449" /> responsibility in this area.  There has been a certain amount of buck passing here and nobody wants to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>We have the local authorities, who carry the main responsibility and, as was said, are not playing their part in this particular area.  The Department of the Environment have an involvement here and the Department of Justice and the Garda Siochána also have an involvement. In fact, I wonder why I should be dealing with this debate tonight but the position is that, seemingly, I should be the person to deal with it.  I come into the picture largely because of my overall responsibility in relation to the discharge of their duties by the Garda Siochána.</P>
    <P>The position in so far as the Garda authorities are concerned is that where it is possible to do so they impound wandering animals in local pounds.  In this city there is one pound in Rathfarnham and there was a sort of pound in Coolock, which is no longer functioning.</P>
    <P>In cases where it is possible for the Garda to identify the owners of the animals, which of course is extremely difficult, they prosecute them for obstruction of traffic contrary to Section 98 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, but that is a very rare thing.  The rounding up of wandering horses, rodeo-style, in this day and age should not be a function of the Garda Siochána.  I am convinced, and I am sure Deputy Ahern and Deputy Belton are equally convinced, that the Garda have more than enough on their plate in trying to tackle crime and vandalism in this city without having to go around like cowboys rounding up horses.  I am sure the Deputies agree with me that this job is appropriate to the local authorities and to people who can be employed by them to do this type of work.</P>
    <P>The local authorities should provide proper transport facilities to move these wandering animals to the pounds.  The traffic is bad enough in this city and in every city and town in Ireland without having these horses causing grave annoyance to people.  These horses cannot <Col N="1450" /> be driven through the streets.  The Garda are already stretched to the limit of their resources in fighting crime and doing other more important work.</P>
    <P>The provision of pounds is a matter for local authorities.  They have not been as attentive to the discharge of their responsibilities in this regard as they might have been.  I got an up to date report from the Garda today on the situation in the area which has been covered here by Deputy Belton and Deputy Ahern and I was told that there is a very big problem there.  They also said that the Superintendent in K Division, which covers this particular area, has been negotiating with Dublin Corporation for the last ten years for a pound but has failed to get one from them.  I have powers under the 1935 Act. I am sure any Member of the House would hate having to use those powers but I have no option at this stage.  I am quite prepared to use those powers.  I have requested, and now, I am afraid, I will have to direct Dublin Corporation to provide proper facilities not just in Finglas but in Coolock and other areas because the number of these animals&mdash;more than horses are involved&mdash;is increasing.  Dublin Corporation will have to face up to their responsibilities in providing the pounds that are necessary and in providing the work force which is required&mdash;on a full-time basis&mdash;to man those pounds.  If it is necessary for the Garda to give protection to the people manning those pounds&mdash;because in the past they have been badly treated and beaten up&mdash;then the Garda will play their part.  County councils must be made to provide the facilities.  I will give Members of this House, who are members of local authorities, every possible help to try to do something worthwhile about this matter.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Belton that in my own city of Limerick it is also a problem. It is also a problem in Cork and in many towns throughout the county.  It is not just in the Finglas/Blanchardstown area but also right around the city of Dublin that public money is being ploughed in <Col N="1451" /> to make the areas in question look nice and tidy and those horses are driven in&mdash;sometimes in a well organised fashion&mdash;and they destroy everything they come in contact with.  People are helpless.  We should be prepared to call a spade a spade at this late stage.  If I have to direct Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council or any other corporation or county council to do what is expected of them, I am quite prepared to do it.  I will this week or very early next week direct Dublin Corporation with whatever statutory powers I have under the Pounds (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, to do what they should have done within the last ten years when we have failed in negotiations to get pounds.</P>
    <P>I recently met an all-party deputation from Limerick city, which is bedevilled by this problem.  As a result of that deputation, I have agreed to increase substantially the poundage fees to cover the full costs of running the pounds, which would help the local authorities to get over any financial problems which might be there in this regard.  I refer to fees which will cover not just feeding but also transport costs to get those animals to the pounds.  We should face up to this problem, which is not the hardest one to face up to, and say that we will tackle it <Col N="1452" /> through the local authorities and not be trying to depend on the overstretched force of the Garda Siochána to try to do work which they have not time to do or should not be asked to do.</P>

      <P>With regard to the recent arrest of Mr. Vyacheslav Bakhmin in the Soviet Union, it is most disturbing that his arrest appears to have arisen out of his membership of the Moscow Investigating Committee on the Misuse of Psychiatry for Political Ends.
