      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 6 (resumed), 7, 8 and 9.  By agreement it has been decided that the House should sit next Tuesday at 3 o'clock with Questions from 3 to 4 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Taoiseach not honouring the undertaking he gave in the House last week that he personally would be responsible for answering questions directly related to statements made by him in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey has written to me about that and I have replied.  Perhaps when the Deputy receives my reply he can raise the matter again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the Taoiseach's reply which in the last line said that it would interfere with ministerial responsibility.  That is somewhat of a joke considering that the Taoiseach treated his Ministers with public contempt in some of their ministerial responsibilities.  It is a fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy that an elected representative, particularly one who occupies the position of Taoiseach, should be responsible in this House and answerable for statements he made in relation to national policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely no change in the procedure adopted here by me from that which has obtained for decades and for a number of people who held the office of Taoiseach.  I am following precedent fully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;statements made by him would be answered by him in this House.  I refer to two questions directly related to the Taoiseach's speech at the Ard-Fheis covering matters of national policy.  The Taoiseach has again refused to be answerable to this House and to the country for statements which he has made on national affairs.  It is not good enough to get into the limelight in ministerial Departments and not be answerable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in order when the Taoiseach offered his assurance last week that he would answer such questions and has since refused to do so.  It is surely in order to raise that in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is quite simple and straightforward.  My position and the position of my predecessors has <Col N="1983" /> been and is that so far as a question is put down to me about a matter which is my responsibility as Taoiseach, or seeking clarification of some statement which I have made in that capacity, I will deal fully with it in the House.  So far as questions are addressed to me which, even though I may have made statements about an aspect of policy, are in effect simply seeking statements of policy which are the responsibility of particular Ministers, I do not answer those questions. That is in accordance with established precedent and tradition in the House and I do not intend to depart from that.  Both Deputies may continue this personal harassment as much as they like but I will deal with the office of Taoiseach as I see fit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote the two questions:</P>
      <P>With reference to the Taoiseach's statement during his address to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that a review of the extent of this country's reliance on foreign-owned industry is needed, if he will indicate who will carry out that review, what its specific purpose will be and when it will commence.</P>
      <P>The second question is:</P>
      <P>If in view of the Taoiseach's statement at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that there are still areas of discrimination and difficulty for women in Irish society, he will indicate which aspect of existing discrimination against women the Government is most immediately concerned with and the proposals he has to end such discrimination.</P>
      <P>There is no way in which those questions would not be the responsibility of the Taoiseach, who made the statement.  The Taoiseach should be answerable to this House and to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that the words used by the Taoiseach just now that he would answer questions arising from matters for which he is responsible in his capacity as Taoiseach were not used last week.  The words &ldquo;in his capacity&rdquo; were not used last week so the Taoiseach has gone back on the assurances given last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that the Taoiseach deal with integrity, honesty and honourably in his official dealings in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the question of a transfer of questions is irrelevant to this matter.  What Deputy Cluskey is seeking is to continue this vindictive campaign of personal harassment of me in my office as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is quite obvious from both the questions Deputy Cluskey has read out that both matters are the responsibility of particular Ministers and therefore should statutorily and according to proper parliamentary procedure be dealt with by those Ministers.  That is the tradition <Col N="1985" /> of this House; it is well established precedent. This is simply an attempt to continue this process of personal harassment which, I would point out to Deputy Cluskey in particular, is rebounding on him and not on me.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1980: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill stated that the purpose was to continue in existence the scheme of rates relief on agricultural land with certain modifications for 1980. The name of this Bill is a complete misnomer because it is anti-small farmer legislation and is another fraud being perpetrated on the agricultural community. We all agree that rates on agricultural lands are an unfair, unjust and iniquitous form of taxation.  They do not take into consideration the ability of the person to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are entitled to be annoyed with the double talk and double think of Fianna Fáil in relation to taxation and with the smear campaign which was so successfully carried out prior to the last general election.  Fianna Fáil complained at that time about farmers' taxation which had been introduced prior to 1977.  We in Fine Gael lost heavily in the last election because of our farmer taxation policy.  Farmers were told at that time that if the National Coalition were returned to power farmers' income tax <Col N="1992" /> would be greatly increased and that they were anti-farmer and were out to tax them out of existence.  Fianna Fáil were supposed to be the farmers' friends and if they were elected things would change overnight.  When taxation was imposed on farmers with £75 poor law valuation Fianna Fáil canvassers went around in the dead of night up the lonely roads and boreens to the farmers and told them that if they were elected they would reduce the burden of taxation which they were paying.  We know now that the situation is completely different.</P>
    <P>As far as rates are concerned, no Government ever did more for the farmers than the National Coalition because they took health and housing off the rates.  If they were on the rates today the rates in every county would be at least eight times higher than they are at present.  The rates in Westmeath would be £18 in the £ and in County Longford they would be about £21 in the £.  I am old enough to remember President de Valera promising to give complete derating to farmers.  He made that promise when the rates were 6/- or 7/- in the £.  We know what has happened since.  When Fianna Fáil were in opposition in 1974&mdash;are we allowed to quote from Seanad debates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote from a Dáil debate when the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, was speaking on the Financial Statement.  When they were in Opposition they promised the sun, moon and stars to the farmers and other sections of the community but when they came into power the opposite was the case.  The present Taoiseach is trying to convince the people that the house that Jack built is in ruins and is falling down around our ears.  We will not let him away with that because he is as much responsible for the last two and a half years as the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Molloy or any other Minister who got his walking papers very quickly when he became Taoiseach.  Deputy Lynch, on 4 April 1974, was advocating <Col N="1993" /> extension of the relief on rates on private houses and agricultural land, that is if income tax was to be introduced for the farming community.  He said that a good case could be made for derating agricultural land completely and he practically wept for the farmers.  I shall quote from the Official Report, column 1515 of 4 April 1974 where he stated that:</P>
      <P>...they indicate that rates are already a heavy imposition on many of them, especially the progressive ones. Therefore, there would be now a much stronger case to extend te Fianna Fáil policy of relieving homes, to relieving agricultural land from rates, if the incidence of income tax is going to bear more heavily on farmers as time goes on.  It has been pointed out&mdash;and I think the point has been well taken&mdash;that farmers are the only producers whose means of production would be subject to income taxation. Another point which I think has been well taken is that about 50 per cent of their output, 50 per cent of their products, goes for export, whereas those in industrial production enjoy complete freedom of taxation from profits deriving from those industrial exports.  This is a point the Minister will have to take into account&mdash;obviously he has not done so at this stage&mdash;in order to ensure that fair taxation will be applied across the board.</P>
      <P>What has happened since?  One cannot blame farmers who turned against the Government in 1977&mdash;who, because they believed in equity, introduced taxation on large farmers&mdash;when they heard those statements that Fianna Fáil would relieve the farmer of his rates.  We know that the rates in every county are about £5 higher than they were then and that instead of only farmers with £75 poor law valuations paying income tax a farmer from £40 upwards will pay.  Under this Bill the subsidy which was available to them for many years has been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch went on to compare farming with industry.  In industry if a man were to buy a tractor or machinery he would get a full allowance in his income <Col N="1994" /> tax but the farmer will only get one-third of the cost of a tractor or other implements if he purchases them for his land.  Is that equity?  Is that what the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, promised the farmers when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition?  It is nothing new.  They have broken their word very often in the past.  He called at that time for fair taxation which would be applied across the board.  This is not fair taxation but a heavy and savage imposition on small farmers.  It also flies in the face of the main objectives of the Minister's statement in the budget.  The three main objectives stated by him were, first, to introduce greater equity in the taxation system.  Where is there greater equity in this?  There is very little equity between the taxation on farmers and industry.  A farmer with £39 valuation gets the full subsidy while a man with £1 more valuation, even if he has ten children, has to pay rates which are increased by almost £300 per year.  Secondly, the objective was to protect and to improve the position of those on lower incomes.  Surely a farmer with a £40 poor law valuation is on a low income.  Is anything done to improve this position?  There certainly is not.  A farmer with a PLV of £40 is in the £50-£60 per week bracket.  This is another savage attack on those unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>The third objective was to protect the source of economic growth.  Small farmers were excellent producers in the past.  During the last war they stood between us and hunger and want.  They worked long hours to increase production when the call went out.  For many years they were hewers of wood and drawers of water.  There is no denying that from 1973 to 1977 or 1978 their incomes increased but last year was a disaster for many small farmers.  Anybody who knows anything about farming will remember that between May and November last year cattle prices dropped from £50 per hundredweight to as low as £34 per hundredweight.  Prices increased recently but unfortunately the Englishman or the factories are benefiting while the small farmer is not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1995" /> The last election was fought on the platform that we were trying to tax farmers out of existence.  We introduced farmer taxation.  I lost votes because I had to defend our action.  We believe in a fairer and more equitable distribution of wealth.  In 1973 when we came into office 5 per cent of the population controlled 75 per cent of the wealth of the country and the other 95 per cent of the population had to make do with what was left.  Our Coalition Minister was a hard-working intelligent fighter who went to EEC meetings and brought home the bacon.  What happened since 1977?  Is it a coincidence that since he left office farmers' prices have remained static while their overheads are increasing and the Government are piling more and more taxation on them.</P>
    <P>Before the last election I saw Deputy Clinton on television discussion programmes with Fianna Fáil Shadow Ministers for Agriculture.  I remember the performances of some of those gentlemen and the promises they made. They claimed that all the taxes the Coalition had showered on the small farmers would be removed as soon as they got back into power.  Has that happened?  It has not.  We were told farmers would be given more subsidies to increase further production, more assistance and less taxation. Those were the words used on a television programme.  What happened to those promises?  The opposite happened. We have more and more taxation of small farmers.  The large farmers are reasonably well able to look after themselves but the small farmers are not.</P>
    <P>Since the subsidy was taken off lime the price has doubled.  Because the subsidy was taken off artificial manure the price has increased by 70 per cent to 80 per cent since 1977.  Subsidies have been taken off food.  The small farmer has to buy food the same as everybody else. That is another increase in indirect taxation. Last year the 2 per cent levy was introduced.  Small farmers who did not pay income tax were obliged to pay £10 or £12 on each beast sold.  If they sold 10 cattle they had to pay from £60 to <Col N="1996" /> £80 tax.  That was unfair and unjust as the Government realised later.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition left office a farmer with a PLV of £75 had to pay income tax.  In 1978 Fianna Fáil reduced that figure to £60.  Last year they said that would be reduced to £50.  Did they keep their word?  Not at all.  They were not satisfied because in two years they had squandered the peoples' money, the country was in a mess and they had to get the money somewhere.  This new form of taxation was introduced.</P>
    <P>Will it be down to £30 next year and the following year down to £20?  The Drover in the Saturday <i>Independent</i> and many others, even Fianna Fáil backbenchers, people one would expect to speak out on behalf of the small farmers are silent.  Do they see any ray of hope for the small farmer?  The farmer with a PLV of £40 will pay at least £6 extra in rates and taxation as I will explain in detail later.</P>
    <P>Take the counties I represented so far&mdash;I do not know what will happen today when we see the new constituency boundaries.  This year a County Westmeath farmer with a PLV of £60 will pay £571.80 rates.  Had the subsidy remained his rates would be £304.96.  He is paying an extra £266.84.  A farmer with a PLV of £50 is paying £476 rates this year, losing a relief of £238.  A farmer with a PLV of £40 is paying £381 this year.  Had the subsidy been allowed his rates would be £171.54.  Because of the actions of the Government who promised to reduce farmer taxation and who always claimed that the small farmer who for many years supported Fianna Fáil, was the backbone of this country, this farmer's rates have been increased from £171.54 to £381.20.  He is paying £209 more.  Is that fair?  Where is the equity, where is the justice?</P>
    <P>The number of holdings affected in Westmeath is 928 and the reduction in the agricultural grant this year is an average of £217,000.  Would you call this a relief Bill for farmers?  It is certainly a relief Bill for the Department because they are saving £217,000 in Westmeath alone.  So much for the <Col N="1997" /> Fianna Fáil Government who have always claimed they represent the small farmers of Ireland.  But could one expect anything else?  We can remember a few years ago when the small farmers, from Cork to Donegal, marched to Dublin to protest against their low standard of living. They demonstrated peacefully outside Leinster House and they were arrested.  When the present Taoiseach was Minister for Agriculture he left them sitting on the steps in Merrion Street, passed them by and refused to meet them.  I admit he has changed since then. He seems to be all things to all men.  He is trying to get all the votes to keep him there as leader of his party.</P>
    <P>In County Longford the rate this year is £12.67 in the £.  In 1979 it was £11.52 and the gross rate of a farmer with a £41 PLV was £161.68.  With the cut in the subsidy that man's rates will amount to £418 this year, an increase of £256.32; but we must add to that the 10 per cent increase in rates.  This means that that farmer will be paying roughly £460 in rates this year, an increase of £299.  Where is the equity there?</P>
    <P>A single farmer with a PLV of £39.99 will pay about £170 in rates because he will enjoy the subsidy, but his brother or neighbour who lives next door, with ten children and 2p more PLV, bringing it up to £40.1, will pay £460 in rates. Where is the equity in that?  This is a Government who spoke about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, about representing the small farmers of Ireland.  They are misrepresenting and crucifying them.</P>
    <P>Take a farmer with a £50 PLV in Longford.  In 1979 his rates were £188. This year without the subsidy his rates would be £576, but we have to add the 10 per cent increase in rates which means that he will be paying £316 more in rates, roughly £6 per week extra taxation. According to the farm management survey, the income of that farmer would be £3,078 in 1979 figures, less than £60 per week, less than a road worker receives, less than a large farmer pays to his agricultural labourer.  As a result of this Bill that man will be paying £316 a <Col N="1998" /> year more in 1980, reducing his income from £60 to £54 per week.  We must add to that the drop in cattle prices and the projected reduction in the price of barley.  We must also take into account the increased cost of living and the increase in the price of feeding stuffs.  All this will bring his income down to less than £46 a week.  Is that justice or equity or fair play?  How do the Government expect any such farmer to survive let alone use initiative or have confidence? Many farmers in Longford are trying to get work.  They will be competing with workless in the towns for any jobs there may be going in factories or on the road. The Government are piling up more and more trouble for themselves.</P>
    <P>In North Longford there is a lot of bad land and in south Longford farms are subject to flooding by the Shannon for many months.  Take a farmer there with a PLV of £59.  In 1979 his rates were £361.  This year that rate will be £678, a difference of approximately £300, but we must add the 10 per cent increase in the rates and we find that such a farmer will be paying £350 more this year.  In County Longford there are 223 farmers with a PLV of between £40 and £50 and 137 between £50 and £60&mdash;360 farmers who are being caught by this Bill.  They did not expect this kind of treatment following the promises made in the manifesto.  They were fooled in 1977 by announcements on radio and TV which told them that Fianna Fáil would reduce their taxation.  Many of them voted for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The people are slowly but surely finding them out and are waiting for the day when they will wreak their vengeance on a Government which so deliberately misled them to get back to enjoy for themselves, not for the rest of the country, the fruits of office.  Those 360 extra farmers are caught with this extra burden of increased prices.  What the farmer has to sell is static.  As I said earlier on, the price of cattle dropped from £50 a hundredweight down to £34 and the cost of living went up due to the higher prices than in 1977.  The question must be posed as to how this treatment <Col N="1999" /> of the small to medium sized farmer&mdash;because that is what those who are now caught in the net are&mdash;fits in with the three objectives stated by the Minister for Finance in his budget.  Does it introduce equity?  Does it improve the position of those on lower income?  Does it protect a source of economic progress?  The answer must be no, no, no, to the three questions.</P>
    <P>The country today is certainly in a mess of the Government's own making because of their manifesto of 1977 to get into office, because of their promises to reduce, instead of increase, taxation.  The Government at that time gave the impression that everything was up for grabs.  They abolished wealth tax and rates on houses and castles.  A millionaire could have a home on an island, a house in the city and another house in Cork, Donegal or other parts of the country.  Those are all free of rates. The speculator in the city could have five, ten, 15, 20 houses let out to tenants and those are all free of rates.  Where is the justice and where is the equity there, when a small farmer living at the end of a boreen with no amenities of any description with potholes that you could be lost in cannot get money from the county council even to make a road into his house?  As somebody said, GNP now means gross national potholes and they are not too far out.  Westmeath and Longford County Councils cannot make any improvements to the roads.  The men they have have to be kept busy patching the roads and fixing up the potholes.</P>

      <P>1978 was the first year that the subsidy for rates was removed.  Fianna Fáil did not promise that in their election manifesto.  When they went on television and radio prior to 1977 they were telling the farmers of Ireland &ldquo;We will take that shower off your backs who are increasing taxation. We will reduce taxation.&rdquo;  However, in 1978 for the first time in the history of this State the subsidy was taken off rates.  They reduced the PLV from £75 to £60, then down to £50 and now, lo and behold, it is down to £40.  We are entitled to ask will it be down to £30 and then £20?  The dead hand of Fianna Fáil is again descending upon the small farmers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are short of money, we know that.  We are entitled to ask why they have made such a mess of the financial affairs of this country.  We know that certain members of the Government blame their manifesto and the promises made.  It should be remembered that in 1977, when the National <Col N="2001" /> Coalition left office, our growth rate was 6½ per cent&mdash;the highest in Europe&mdash;and inflation was at 9 per cent. Today the growth rate is down to zero and inflation is at 20 per cent, so it is necessary for the Government to introduce this kind of legislation to take the money from those unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another anti-farmer piece of legislation and will have a savage effect on the small farmers, on their wives and families.  These people are now already ground down and are being ground further down by the increased cost of living and other increases.  It is nonsense for the Minister for Finance to state that rates for those people will be allowed against their income tax.  The vast majority of those under £50 or £55 valuation will have no income tax to pay, but because they are now in the income tax net they will have to pay an accountant £150 or £200 to look over their books and to tell them that they are not liable for income tax.  That is as a result of this Bill and the action being taken by the Minister and the Government to narrow the net down to £40 poor law valuation.  The small farmer is here being asked to pick up the bill for the wealthy, the people in the castles and those who are very well off.</P>
    <P>What surprises me is the complete wall of silence in the Fianna Fáil Party. There is not a single backbencher in that party in the House to speak.  I doubt if the person present will speak on this Bill. I challenge the Fianna Fáil Members, who have been so vocal in the past about farmers' taxation and especially taxation of small farmers.  I challenge them to go behind their Government and say they are loyal and are prepared to support this Bill.  I doubt if that will happen.  You will have the double talk and the double think.  They will say one thing here and another when they are in the little boreen canvassing the farmers.</P>
    <P>This is an iniquitous tax.  Any tax which does not take into account the ability of the person to pay is unfair and basing it on poor law valuation is most unfair and unjust.  Many of those valuations <Col N="2002" /> are over 100 years old and there is no sense or reason in them as they exist at present.  You will see good land in one part of a county which will be valued at 60p per acre and go to another part of that same county or to an adjoining county and you will see similar, or not so good, land valued at £1 or £1.50 per acre.  The sooner a change is made in the system the better.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Government have taxed the small farmers in such a cruel and harsh way.  In order to exist under the already crushing burden of taxation the vast majority of such farmers and their families have to work 14 or 15 hours a day for 52 weeks in the year.  They do not work a five-day week for six or seven hours each day.  Most of them never have a holiday.  By their actions the Government are crucifying them.</P>
    <P>The confidence of the farmers has been eroded.  What we want is action that will restore that confidence.  The Minister for Agriculture will have to fight here and in the EEC to protect the farmers.  If we had a Minister and Fianna Fáil backbenchers who were interested in the plight of the small farmers we would not have this Bill before us.</P>

      <P>My first reaction to the Bill is that its title is a complete misnomer. One cannot in any circumstances look on this Bill as a relief to the farming community.  I should imagine a more correct title would be Rates on Agricultural Land (Imposition) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from South Tipperary and many of my constituents are members of the farming community.  I am the only Fine Gael Deputy in County Tipperary and it would be highly remiss of me if I did not try to impress on the Government and on the Minister for Agriculture in particular the views of the farming community in my area.  I met them recently and I can tell the House they are shattered at the huge impositions imposed on them in the budget.  They complain there is nothing in the budget to give them confidence and hope for the future.  They look on it as a sell-out of <Col N="2003" /> the farming community who have been sold out to the marching feet of the PAYE sector.  They consider the Government have succumbed to the marchers and have victimised the farming community.  This Bill is a further example of that victimisation of the farming sector.  They consider the Government have an anti-farmer bias, especially in view of the many levies recently imposed by them.  This Bill is a further example of the Government's insensitivity to the needs of the farming community. The Minister of State must be aware of the feelings of the small farmers in Waterford and in South Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State must be aware of the feelings of small farmers and of the farming community in general in South Tipperary and in County Waterford.  How effective their representations to him will be remains to be seen.  Lip-service has been paid by the Government to the value of agriculture to the whole community.  I have said before that, apart from our people, our greatest national asset is the nine inches of topsoil of our country.  Advances have been made in the recent past, especially since our entry into the EEC, to develop this great national asset but more needs to be done.  Whatever about the prospect <Col N="2004" /> of oil offshore or mineral wealth beneath our land, to me the nine inches of topsoil is our greatest asset.  All of the energies of the Government should be directed to getting maximum output from the rich agricultural soil of Ireland.</P>
      <P>This Bill does nothing to give confidence to the farming community.  In South Tipperary alone 1,170 additional farmers will be further penalised and in North Tipperary a total of 906 additional farmers will have the relief removed if the Bill goes through the House.  I should like to impress on the Minister the feelings of the farmers of South Tipperary.  Last year was a disastrous one for farming in general and anyone even moderately acquainted with farming will realise that.  There was a late spring, prices fell, inflation was high, costs were high and markets were bad. Not alone was the farming community assailed from within by the disastrous decisions taken by the Government with regard to levies and so on, but at EEC level there was a total anti-farmer bias. There is a lack of commitment on the part of many EEC countries to the CAP and there is a complete lack of adequate finance at home and abroad for the farming community.  Farmers will tell one they could not afford to use the necessary amount of fertilisers this year. Two days ago I heard on the radio a spokesman for one of the large farm machinery companies saying that so far this year was the worst year on record for the sale of farm machinery.</P>

      <P>I am only touching very briefly on these points.  I maintain that the farming community are not given value for the increased rates they must pay this year.  In rural Ireland many farm homesteads have no running water, no sewerage or toilet facilities and no scavenging service.  Recently, in South Tipperary, after great pressure the county council decided to but an extra scavenging truck to service part of the community.  The elegibility of farmers' sons and daughters for scholarships has been greatly reduced.  In many cases where a farmer's son or daughter is not eligible for a scholarship or grant at university or a third level college the father cannot afford to send that boy or girl to college.  The farming community are getting less and less value for the increased imposition of rates.  Also in the case of loans and grants for new houses especially&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of rates rather than the relief of rates.  The title of the Bill is a misnomer.  This is a further inposition on the farming community. Various farming organisations have <Col N="2007" /> protested as vociferously as they can at this further imposition.  The Minister stated glibly that rates paid may be charged as an expense against income tax but, as has been pointed out <i>ad nauseam,</i> it is all very well to say that but in the case of the farmer who is not liable to income tax, whose income does not reach the required figure of £1,700 for a single person, or £3,400 for a married couple, that argument does not hold.  It is poor consolation for him to know that he can write rates off against income tax.  This is another means of taking an already scarce commodity, money, away from the farming community. We are told that 48 per cent of the total value of our output is in the agricultural sector.  This is very poor recognition by the Government of the role the agricultural community play in the economy when the Government are continually thinking of ways and means of depriving farmers of the finance they so badly need.  we are told that this Bill, together with rates, resource tax and other levies will take a further £66 million of money sorely needed for proper development and expansion.</P>
      <P>The Bill does nothing to give confidence to the farming community, confidence so badly needed when farmers are being taxed and assailed from within by the Government, when their efforts on behalf of the economy are not appreciated and when every day brings a further levy or increase affecting the farmer imposed by some Department.  Also, on the eec level there is the possibility of the super levy being imposed.  This results in a total lack of confidence in the farming sector.  The Minister must be aware of this.  His two or three Ministers of State based in rural Ireland must surely acquaint him of the up to date position in the farming community who now see how much they were deceived in taking Fianna Fáil at their word, especially in the infamous and disgraced manifesto.  They were promised the sun, moon and stars if they could get rid of the Coalition Government: they would enter a Utopia with eternal spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> Fianna Fáil, as usual, failed to fulfil their promises.</P>
    <P>In a statement issued recently by the IFA they stated categorically that farm income is lower now relative to the PAYE sector than it was prior to our entry into the EEC.  This is a terrible indictment of the agricultural policies pursued by the Government and by successive Ministers for the farming community. What is needed is a policy of planned development in which the Government acknowledge the role the farming community and the agricultural sector play in the economy.  They should give them true recognition of this role and, working in unison with the farming community, plan and work out how they could maximise our membership of the EEC and achieve greater productivity from the land.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing to achieve that aim.  It does the reverse.  It penalises the small farmers.  While South Tipperary is noted for its large farmers, there are quite a number of small farmers.  To base anything on the Griffiths Poor Law Valuation System which is 120 years old is compounding an iniquitous system.  It is totally iniquitous to base another system of rates or income tax on a system which is completely outmoded. Small farmers whose incomes will not reach income tax liability level will be forced to pay 100 per cent increase in their rents if their rateable valuation is £40.  In South Tipperary one need own only a very small holding in some areas to have a rateable valuation of £40.  This would be deemed an uneconomic holding elsewhere.  I speak on behalf of those people and I urge the Government, even at this late stage, to withdraw the Bill, but I suppose this is a pious wish.</P>
    <P>Last year the incomes, in real terms, of the farming community fell by at least 25 per cent.  This year a basic increase of 7.9 per cent is hoped for but they will be lucky to get 5 per cent.  With inflation this year which is expected to run at 22½ per cent, with the input cost of fertilisers, petrol, diesel, electricity and a host of other increases, the farming community will in real terms get no increase whatsoever. <Col N="2009" /> They look at the PAYE sector and see certain pay increases being granted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the small farmers in south Tipperary and north Tipperary I urge the Minister to have second thoughts about this Bill in view of the lack of any increase in farming income <Col N="2010" /> this year, and to maintain the grant relief at the existing level of £60 rateable valuation.  If he would agree to that, he would be telling the farming community he appreciates the difficulties they are experiencing at home and abroad, that he appreciates their contribution and the value of their efforts in the agricultural sector.  He would get something which is badly needed at this stage&mdash;their full co-operation with the Government in formulating a plan which would give some ray of hope and confidence to the farming community.</P>
      <P>I urge him seriously to consider the various points raised by all Deputies who spoke on this Bill.  The amount of money the Minister will gain is sorely needed at the moment to be put into machinery, farm buildings and further expansion.  What he is doing is tantamount to blood sucking.  He is drawing off the essential life blood of the farming community.  The money they so urgently and badly need is being syphoned off from them, money which could be put into their land to increase production and to avail of the somewhat limited opportunities in the EEC.  I suppose, as in the past, these pleas will fall on deaf ears, but at least the Minister will be aware of the feelings of the small farmers and some Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in congratulating the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment on his promotion and on his return to the glory that once he knew.  I hope he will be successful in that office.  I find it difficult to understand how the Minister and the farming members of the Government can introduce a long list of Bills into this House reducing the income of the farming community.  I cannot understand why there is this silent acceptance by the farming lobby within the Government of the introduction of these measures.  They seem to think the farming community must submit with pleasure to them.  I can assure the House that there is total opposition to the measures referred to by previous speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a long list dealing with income tax, levies, loss of rates abatement <Col N="2011" /> and resource tax.  I appeal to the farming lobby within the Government to abandon the resource tax which they intend to introduce on farmers whose valuation is over £75.  It is penal to put on them a levy of £3.50 per acre, plus liability for income tax, plus other impositions to which I have referred.  We must give some thought to the whole question of valuations.  I want to refer particularly to people who live adjacent to our shores. The Griffiths valuation and other valuations have been excessive and because of those valuations the impositions have been excessively high.  In every Bill which goes through here, valuation seems to be the basis on which their taxation is assessed.</P>
    <P>People living adjacent to our shores were supposed to enjoy rights to sand, gravel and seaweed in the landlord days. Those rights are no longer enjoyed by those farmers because of prohibition Bills and prohibitions by the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism on the removal of sand and gravel from our seashore.  Their valuations are excessive.</P>
    <P>This is termed a Rates relief Bill.  It is not a relief Bill in the sense that it imposes more taxation on farmers, but it does give relief to the Exchequer in some measure.  I refer to the position since the National Coalition left office.  Prior to that there was no allowance for people with over £70 valuation.  In 1978 there was no allowance for those over £75.  In 1979 the figure was reduced to £60 and nobody with over £60 valuation got any rates abatement.  Now in 1980 nobody with over £40 will get rates abatement, either primary or supplementary.  In County Clare people with between £60 and £70 valuation number exactly 213 and the group with between £40 and £60 is 697.  That means that nearly 1,000 people will not now enjoy the benefits of rates relief and you cannot expect those people to be overjoyed about this imposition.</P>
    <P>It has been said that 1979 was an unprofitable year for agriculture.  This year there is restriction of finance for farming, <Col N="2012" /> and purchases and inputs have had to be restricted.  Because of rumblings of levies and other impositions there is a fear of instability in dairying areas and this must be corrected if we are to have some confidence in future in agricultural development.  Over a number of years we have had constant improvement in every area of agriculture and investment was pretty high.  There was encouragement to take credit in order to purchase land and to develop that land.  That being so, it seems rather like cheating now to come down on a community who have a big influence in generating employment throughout the country and who if given normal encouragement will continue to be very productive.  At the moment there is a sourness amongst that community, who work very long hours.  If the price of food had to be determined by the work done in a 40-hour week by farmers it would be very dear indeed.  The minimum hours worked by a farmer would be possibly double those of people in industry, and obviously the farmer has no overtime concessions.  He has to accept losses and the varying climatic influences which affect every area of farming. Therefore, it is not surprising to find the farming community reluctantly carrying on a very important job.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know why those hardships of taxation were imposed all at the one time.  It is unfair distribution.  I hope that the resource tax will be abandoned because it would be the last straw in taxation.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say on the Bill other than that, with my party, I oppose it.</P>

      <P>First, I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  It proved to be such a wide-ranging debate that it is difficult to confine one's reply.  I have sat here for all of the speeches since the introduction of Second Stage and I found it difficult to follow a lot of the reasoning of the speakers from the Opposition benches.  They made an effort to claim that the Bill was not properly named the <Col N="2013" /> Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill. Of course it is properly named and if such legislation were not passed by the House many people would not be getting the relief that this Bill is giving to them. That is the purpose of the Bill, but in the discussion here we went up boreens and into farm buildings, barley fields, machinery and PAYE.  I could only think that the Opposition must be trying to take the minds of some people away from what is contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Rates relief of course has been provided over the years by a series of temporary Acts and the last of these expired on 31 December last.  If there were no Bill there would be no relief.  That is what the Bill is all about, and it is as simple as that.  The primary purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to authorise the payment of £37.7 million for the relief of rated occupiers of the land and it is well worthwhile as far as ratepayers are concerned. They would not like us to get away from that fact and nothing said here by Opposition speakers will succeed in taking away from the smallholders the knowledge of the relief that they are getting under this Bill.  Rightly, they will welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked me when the agricultural grant was introduced first.  The agricultural grant was introduced first in 1898 and that is quite a long time ago.  Deputy Fitzpatrick then went on to talk about the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the promises contained therein.  Again he introduced matters other than rates.  I wish to confine my remarks to rates and to point out to the House and to Deputy Fitzpatrick that every line in that manifesto which applied to rates has been fully honoured, that the benefits promised have all been delivered.  We have had the derating of domestic dwellings, of farm buildings, of community halls and secondary schools. All of these benefits have accrued to the people and no words of Deputy Fitzpatrick or of anybody else in Opposition will succeed in confusing this fact.  Indeed if they endeavour to confuse it we shall continue to bring home to the people the benefits they have derived <Col N="2014" /> from that manifesto particularly in so far as rates are concerned.</P>
    <P>There was the intimation also of how much money the Exchequer will be saved by this Bill.  That could be put the other way round: how much relief taxpayers will be given under this Bill.  I would estimate that relief to taxpayers will be £6 million in 1980 but that does not mean that the grant will be £6 million less than in 1979.  In fact the grant is approximately £37.725 million in 1980 as against £39.8 in 1979.  Those figures should put the record straight in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House also that the record of Fianna Fáil in regard to rates is one of which we are particularly proud because it was we who introduced derating of smallholders.  I think it was Deputy Quinn who mentioned the year 1920 when asking me about derating.  There was no derating of agricultural land at that time.  Deputy Quinn and other speakers also suggested that next year we might see the introduction of a Bill lowering yet again the threshold from £40 valuation to £30, or even lower.  This Bill provides that the ceiling will be £40 valuation for three years, including this year.  Therefore farmers in that bracket can be assured that that threshold will not be lowered in that period.  It was Fianna Fáil who introduced the derating of small farmers of £20 valuation and under by relieving them of all rates on land.  This Bill continues the full derating of these smallholders.  I do not think the Opposition would like to be seen to be objecting to that.  In fact land holdings of less than £20 valuation represent almost 80 per cent of all rated occupiers of agricultural land.  Relief to this category will absorb almost £22.8 million of the total relief of £37.7 million.  Therefore all the comments we have heard about the small farmer and small landowner being penalised under this Bill surely must go by the board in view of those facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy O'Brien advanced the argument that because relief was being excluded for farmers with higher valuations they were <Col N="2015" /> being asked to pay for domestic derating.  This is simply not the case. Farmers, like all domestic ratepayers, have been relieved of rates on their dwellings.  Also, farmers were given the additional benefit of having their outbuildings derated since 1978.  A conservative estimate of the annual cost of this would be over £11 million, a considerable sum of money given by way of relief from which farmers as well as other sections of the community have benefited.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange expressed concern about the jump in liability of a farmer with £40 valuation as against one with a valuation of £39.  I should like to put the record straight here.  A farmer on £39 valuation receives the benefits of the reliefs but not full derating; he will pay rates on £17.30 of that valuation and the State, through the grant, pays the balance.  The farmer with a valuation of £40 is liable for full rates but his dwellinghouse and outbuildings are now fully derated, which is of considerable benefit to him.  Needless to say we did not have mention of these things by Opposition speakers here this morning.</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy L'Estrange saying that 929 more farmers in Westmeath would lose relief and 361 in Longford. Putting that the other way round, it is a fact that 7,386 holdings in Longford and 11,179 in Weatmeath are fully derated because they are under £20 valuation. Again, we are dealing with the vast majority of ratepayers in both counties, as indeed we are throughout the country &mdash;in Longford there will be a further <Col N="2016" /> 1,096 and in Westmeath an additional 1,576 with valuations under £33, with a complete derating on the first £20 of their valuations.  Tremendous relief is being given small farmers under this Bill. Because of this I can understand why Opposition Deputies were taking us up boreens, into outbuildings, barley fields, PAYE machinery and so on in order to detract from these facts in people's minds but we shall continue to remind them.</P>
    <P>I should tell Deputy Griffin that under the provisions of this Bill 6,312 rated landholders in south Tipperary will continue to be fully derated and a further 1,518 holdings in south Tipperary will receive full relief on the first £20 valuation. The valuations of those latter holdings range between £20 and £33.  In North Tipperary the full derating applies to 7,825 holdings and the full derating on the first £20 applies to 1,992 holdings.</P>
    <P>This Bill is properly named because of the reliefs it will mean for our small farmers. We are proud of our record in regard to the derating of those who need this relief most.  So far as income tax is concerned, those farmers who do not have to pay this tax have nothing to worry about.  I doubt if the Opposition could be sincere in regard to the relief being given by way of this Bill to the small farmers.</P>

    <Title>Turf Development Bill, 1979: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise from £60 million to £100 million the limitation on the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna for the performance of their functions under the Turf Development Acts.</P>
      <P>The Board's first development programme, adopted in 1946, had as its main features the production of one million tonnes of sod peat annually, improvements in the Lullymore briquetting plant and the establishment of the first generation of turf fired power stations. The second development programme, launched in 1950, concentrated chiefly on milled peat production and since that date the annual milled peat output has been built up to around three million tonnes.  The implementation of that programme led to the erection of four additional turf fired power stations and two additional briquette factories.</P>
      <P>In 1974 Bord na Móna commenced their third development programme to expand peat production.  This programme was subsequently extended and now covers development of about 62,000 acres providing for the production per annum of 2.75 million tonnes of milled peat, 32,000 tonnes of sod peat and 650,000 cubic metres of moss peat in addition to existing production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in development operations under the programme and in some instances bog areas are approaching the production stage and production will commence this <Col N="2020" /> year.  The operations involved in the programme extend over Counties Tipperary, Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Galway, Roscommon, Longford and Mayo.</P>
    <P>Some of the additional milled peat will be used in two new briquette factories which are planned to produce 390,000 tonnes of briquettes annually.  One of the factories at Littleton, County Tipperary, designed to produce 130,000 tonnes of briquettes per annum is nearing completion and production will commence in 1981.  The second factory, which is at present in the planning stage, will be erected in the Ballyforan area, County Roscommon, and will have an output of 260,000 tonnes of briquettes per annum. It will use the milled peat to be produced at the nearby Derryfadda group of bogs from which a production of 700,000 tonnes per annum is planned.  It is proposed to build the factory in two phases, the first of which will be in production in 1984 and the second in 1987.  When all these factories are in full production, total production of briquettes in all the board's five factories will be 750,000 tonnes per annum which is over twice the present production level.</P>
    <P>The balance of the production of milled peat under the programme will be used in existing electricity generating stations and in two 40 megawatt generating units to be erected by the Electricity Supply Board, one at Shannonbridge, County Offaly and the second at Lanesboro, County Longford, as extensions to existing stations.  It is expected that the first of these new units will be in operation in 1982-83.  The additional production of sod peat will be used to offset to some extent the reduction in output from existing sod peat bogs as they become cut out.  The moss peat will supplement the board's present production of 1.25 million cubic metres per annum, the bulk of which is for export.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna expect to be able to maintain the full production capacity of their existing three briquette factories in the present year.  As the House is aware, demand at present is greatly in excess of <Col N="2021" /> supply so that the quantities available are being distributed to customers of the board in proportion to their purchases in 1976 which was the last year in which briquette supplies were able to meet demand. The position will not be improved until the new briquette factory at Littleton starts producing early in 1981.</P>
    <P>Bog harvesting conditions in 1979 were the worst recorded in the past 20 years.  Despite this, machine turf supplies will be maintained at last year's level but demand for machine turf is greatly in excess of available supplies with the result that for the first time, Bord na Móna have had to restrict sales to existing customers.</P>
    <P>At present the board employ 5,100 persons on average throughout the year. The full implementation of the Third Development Programme will mean additional employment for 2,200 persons on average.  These will include persons engaged in turf production and allied operations on the bogs and employment at the Littleton and Ballyforan briquette factories.  Apart from direct employment by Bord na Móna the increased production of briquettes is also estimated to provide additional employment in the briquette distribution trade for something in the region of 250 persons. The programme has already generated employment for 700 persons in 1979 and this figure is expected to reach 1,000 persons in 1980.  In addition to the above, up to 200 persons have been employed by contractors to the board mainly in relation to the erection of the Littleton briquette factory.  Moreover, apart from providing employment at the board's own engineering workshops, the programme also generates indirect employment in outside engineering firms in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The present limitation of £60 million on the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna was fixed by the Turf Development Act, 1975.  At that time the cost of the programme was estimated at £28.5 million.  Due to an extension of the programme to include a greater acreage of bog than was originally planned for development, and the subsequent inclusion <Col N="2022" /> of the proposal to build a briquetting factory at Ballyforan and also because of inflation, the original estimate will be greatly exceeded and the capital cost of the programme is now estimated at £120 million.  The board's borrowings are expected to reach the £60 million limit early in 1980 and consequently it is now necessary to raise the limit to provide for further borrowings.  The board expect to reach the £100 million limit in 1982.</P>
    <P>In the case of the first and second development programmes the necessary capital was advanced by the Exchequer. While the third development programme was also financed in the earlier years by the Exchequer, the indications are that from now on the board will be relying on borrowing most of their requirements from the European Investment Bank and the New Community Borrowing and Lending Instrument.  These are EEC agencies through which loans are made for priority investments in infrastructures and the energy sectors in accordance with Community objectives and to foster economic growth.</P>
    <P>I feel that Deputies generally will welcome the evidence which this Bill provides of the Government's intention to pursue a vigorous policy of expansion of Bord na Móna's activities.  The board's operations are beneficial, not alone for the valuable employment and economic activity which they generate in particular areas, but on a national scale. Our turf resources have assumed a new importance in the present climate of restricted and increasingly costly oil supplies. It is fortunate that in recent years when our excessive dependence on oil has become painfully illustrated we had in existence a State body with the organisation and technical capability to embark on a major programme to expand development of indigenous fuel. This is a tribute to the foresight and courage of those involved in the setting up of the board.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that there are calls for an even greater expansion of our turf development schemes but it must be accepted that, substantial <Col N="2023" /> though the effort is, there are unavoidable constraints.  Not all our bogs are suited to the mechanised development necessary for large-scale commercial exploitation.  Bord na Móna are at present investigating, surveying and assessing the potential for development of other bog areas which are not included in their present programmes.  As a result of this investigation, it is likely that further proposals will evolve for an expansion beyond the activities covered by the third programme.</P>
    <P>The Central Development Committee who operate under the aegis of the Minister for Finance have investigated the prospects of increasing turf production in the western counties and has submitted a report to me which I will be examining shortly with considerable interest.</P>
    <P>New development work must be accompanied by long-term programmes to bring into economic use the areas which are being cleared of usable turf deposits. The House will be aware that this aspect has been under continuous study and an interim report on this subject by a committee was published some months ago. This report concluded that much more research and pilot development schemes were necessary before definite conclusions could be reached on the best use of cut-away bog areas.  We will be pressing ahead with this work.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill introduced by the Minister.  Anything that provides for development of turf in all its forms is to be welcomed by this House. Over the years Bord na Móna have made a substantial contribution to the social and economic life of this country through their development of a very important resource and, as the Minister said, an indigenous resource, turf and bogland.  Bord na Móna are engaged in a very important social and national area of activity.  Down the years this House has on numerous occasions expressed its satisfaction at the way in which they went about their business.  That is as true <Col N="2024" /> today as it has been in the past.  One must compliment the board on their foresight in broadening their base of activity which now comprises four areas&mdash;producing machine turf, milled peat, briquettes and peat moss.</P>
      <P>Since the setting up of the Turf Development Board in the `thirties and Bord na Móna in 1946 we have come a very long way in this area of activity.  In 1973 and 1974 with the first chill winds of the oil crisis blowing in our faces, dramatic changes took place in our attitude to the whole question of fuel supply, availability, cost and so on.  We had come through an era of cheap fuel and this cheap fuel mentality took hold of us until 1973 and 1974 when we were rudely awakened by the effects of the oil crisis not in relation to cost but also to availability of the commodity.</P>
      <P>A more careful scrutiny of fuel usage must continue to be undertaken and there must also be a detailed assessment of our needs and the types of fuel which we ought to be using based on availability and cost.  The temptation would be, because of the crisis which brought about our present dilemma in the area of fuel, to over-exploit our native resource.  That can be done provided we make the resources in money terms available to Bord na Móna.  I am sure they are capable of producing more than they are at present, if they wish to.  The overriding factor is that while turf can provide a certain percentage of our fuel needs its impact on our total requirements would not be that great.  Having said that, it would be unwise to go overboard in exploiting that resource thereby diminishing the chances of having an alternative fuel supply available to us in case of emergency.  It would be wise to apply the same conservation policy to the use of this resource as we are being asked to apply to the use of imported fuels, oil and coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We owe it to the next generation not to over-exploit this resource but to leave it in the form of an alternative to people who might be more in need of it when more dire circumstances confront them <Col N="2025" /> in later years.  While the third programme is geared for expansion it is at a controlled rate.  The House can go along with that idea.  The third programme as the Minister outlined came into being in 1974 and the targets outlined in it&mdash;six million tons of milled peat, ¾ million tons of briquettes and 1.9 million cubic metres of moss peat&mdash;are achievable and sensible with an eye to conservation of the resource.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies in their report on the activities of Bord na Móna detailed the up-to-date achievement of the board in the context of the third programme targets.  At this stage it seems as if the targets set will be achieved.  As regards milled peat at present we have 2.9 million tons as against a target of 6 million, about 50 per cent of the target has been achieved.  In the case of briquettes the target is ¾ of a million and we have over 300,000 tons.  In the case of moss peat on a target of 1.9 million cubic metres we have exceeded the 1 million cubic metre mark at this stage. That is a fine achievement and the board ought to be complimented for it.</P>
    <P>This source of energy is a wasting asset. It is non-renewable but it is unique in that it leaves a residue which is of paramount importance in the form of cutaway bog.  The Minister did not, except in passing, refer to cut-away bog. From my experience of the activities of Bord na Móna in a neighbouring constituency and from the report of the committee I should like to comment on what may become the problem.  I appreciate that the interim report of the committee set up to consider the possible uses of Bord na Móna's cut-away bogs is not available.  This whole question is one which must be faced before long and some definite policy produced in relation to the different aspects of this national asset which, as time goes on, is increasing in area.  We are talking about large areas of reclaimed land which as blanket bog were not economically viable in the area of agriculture but which, with the turf removed, could become a definite agricultural asset if given proper treatment. <Col N="2026" /> Fóir Teoranta in consultation with Bord na Móna, have succeeded in bringing about ways and means which are economically viable and beneficial to develop cut-away bogs, despite the high cost of maintaining standards of production which are taken for granted in the normal type of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>These are purely technical matters.  I understand from the interim report and the joint committee's report that there are no technical problems in relation to the development of this cut-away bog. The economics of the approaches adopted by the two bodies&mdash;Fóir Teoranta and Bord na Móna&mdash;give a very reasonable and favourable picture of what can be done.  It is a viable operation.</P>
    <P>The other area which must be looked into is whether to redistribute this asset. As we know, Bord na Móna had to purchase these lands and have now become the owners of very large tracts of this country. That is fine in so far as they acquire these bogs for a specific purpose, but having terminated their own specific function in the extraction of turf and its derivatives from bog land, while this land may have been marginal agricultural land, it has now become productive agriculturally.  I do not know if Bord na Móna are in a position to exploit this asset to its full potential or if they, as a State agency, ought to do it. This is a big question which must be gone into.</P>
    <P>I presume that when the committee's final report on the possible uses of Bord na Móna cut-away bogs is available, a decision as to what is to be done with this land must be faced.  Land has always been a very emotive subject in this country and I do not think a State agency ought to become&mdash;as they would be at that stage&mdash;a massive landowner without any obligation to hand this land back to the original owners or to hand it over to an agency specifically designated for its development in its new form.</P>
    <P>While it has been established that there are no technical difficulties and there is no doubt the viability of <Col N="2027" /> the operation in developing cut-away bog, the policy question of who should do this, for whom and by whom, must be faced.  I hope the Minister will turn his mind to that question at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned specifically with the provision of extra borrowing powers for the board.  From what the Minister said there is no question of the Bill not being justified.  As the third programme will cost around £220 million and there is obviously need for this additional facility if the board are to continue their work.  I want to refer to the board's finances.  The relevant paragraph on page 6 of the 1978-79 Bord na Móna Thirty-Third Annual Report reads:</P>
    <P>Under present policy the financing arrangements for the Third Development Programme require the Board to obtain a much higher proportion of capital monies from non-Exchequer sources, and in foreign currencies, which not alone increases the interest burden but creates a new cost risk in possible exchange losses.  The Board would welcome a review of this new policy in order that the appropriateness of non-Exchequer financing to turf development might be further considered.</P>
    <P>We are back to the not so old and very urgent problem here.  This problem must be referred to because it was causing such concern that it deserved a mention in the board's annual report.  The urgent matter specifically referred to is the risk involved due to exchange rates.  This does not apply to Bord na Móna only; all industries are concerned with this problem.  The question of whether those risks might be under-written by Government guarantee is something that must be faced fairly and squarely, and fairly soon.  When a semi-State body refers to it, how much more does a private enterprise unit have to look to its problems in this area?</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are a very large industry. We are talking of 5,000 plus employees, hopefully rising to something in <Col N="2028" /> the region of 7,000 on completion of the third development programme.  It is not an industry which can be taken lightly. Because of its nature there is another aspect to it&mdash;it fulfils a very important social function.  In this House when the words &ldquo;social function&rdquo; are mentioned, it is taken for granted that somebody is getting something for nothing and that a service is being provided purely to meet a social need.  Bord na Móna have been in the happy position that while they have performed an important social function, in doing so they have provided for a social need, mainly because of the locations of their operations.  In deprived areas there is but one source, large tracts of bogland from which moss peat and other commodities can be extracted. While paying their way, Bord na Móna also have provided employment in areas where otherwise employment at that level would not be viable economically. They are in that fortunate position and at the same time they are meeting a social need from the employment point of view, though not from the viewpoint normally accepted in regard to industry in general.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the financial situation.  The whole area of financing the board has been referred to elsewhere, in evidence taken from board members by the joint committee, and I do not wish to go into detail on the issue. However, I should like to refer to the board's annual report in which one member of the board saw fit to express disagreement with the assessment of stock values held by the board from year to year.  This matter has attracted the attention of other people, and I am not in a position to say that the attitude adopted by this member of the board is a correct one.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the audited accounts are satisfactory and that there is not a sleight of hand involved, but this member expressed his personal opinion that the value of the stocks held was a depressed value and that this assessment had been done deliberately to take into account more difficult production years. As the Minister has said, weather plays a <Col N="2029" /> very important part in the board's operations. At any rate, because of the approach to this matter, there arises the difficulty of assessing properly the financial performance of the board.</P>
    <P>Apparently there has been a fairly substantial reduction in profits, from a figure of more than £500,000 to £206,000, thus leaving the board with a smaller margin for reinvestment.  Looking back at returns for other years, despite development programmes undertaken by the board there was in some instances a fall in production in the last five years.  For instance, in the case of briquettes, there has been a 1 per cent fall in the last five years, although the Minister has stated that with the expansion of briquette production there would be a resultant increase in income from this source.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the Central Development Committee under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the possibility of expanding Bord na Móna activities along the western seaboard. Rightly or wrongly, there has been an idea abroad that despite the large areas of bog along the western coast, there is not so much suitable for turf extraction on an economically viable basis.  To put it in a simpler way, we have not got in the west enough of the right type of bog, but bog we have, and I should like to know whether the research element in the third development programme could include the possibility of a new approach to turf extraction from shallow bog.</P>
    <P>Until now, it seems that the whole technology of the board has been directed at the extraction of turf from deeper bogs.  The acid test of any new technology would be whether the extraction of turf from shallow bog would be viable economically.  If it were, Bord na Móna would be able to expand enormously their area of activity along the western seaboard where there is a vast area of useless land that cannot be farmed. Though that land has some possibilities in relation to turf production, we are being told it would not be economically viable.  I suggest that we look into it thoroughly because if <Col N="2030" /> production from that land could be made to break even at least, the social dimension involved would justify development of that useless land.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the board on the very worthwhile national function they are performing on and its sensible use of an indigenous source of fuel.  I hope that in the years ahead they will continue to provide the social service which they are now known to provide.  A social service in a peripheral way, combined with a workmanlike, professional approach to this unique area of activity, the production of turf, and that they will continue to research into other areas of new commodities which could be viable in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party fully support this Bill.  Many in the country do not fully appreciate Bord na Móna's very considerable and growing contribution to economic and social development.  Admittedly it is generally accepted that in 50 years' time we shall have very little turf left but in the past decades and each year that wasting asset&mdash;an important national asset&mdash;turf, decried a little during the years I felt, has given employment to over 5,000 people, particularly so to communities around the country where there was a low level of economic activity, and that employment is, by and large, very secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna have a major export in peat moss and have thus helped the balance of payments of a poor country. The critical importance of turf as a substitute for costly imported fuel is now fully appreciated, but the general activities of the board should be fully appreciated. I did not fully appreciate the role of the board until recently as a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I had not adver ted too much to the fact that Bord na Móna is the second largest producer of peat fuel in the world.  Those of us who over the years have had an opportunity of visiting their installations realise that they have a particular technological skill and that skill has been generally <Col N="2031" /> recognised.  I approve of and support the decision here to raise by £40 million the limitation on the borrowing powers of the board to enable them to discharge their functions.</P>
    <P>I confine my comments to one or two aspects, the aspect referred to by Deputy O'Toole and some suggestions of mine to the Minister regarding the future growing importance of cut-away bogs.  I urge the Minister on this issue to establish with great care either an inter-departmental committee or a new, broadly-based committee representative of the various interests concerned, to report on the question of the future use and development of cut-away bogs.  The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies fully appreciate that the subject is not within the terms of reference of the existing inter-departmental committee and feel that perhaps a look at the situation in depth should be set in train by the Minister.  Having said that, I urge great care in the setting up of the committee. There are interests which in the decades ahead will cast a very covetous eye on this precious national asset.  There are those who hold the view that the thousands of acres of cut-away bog should pass back into surrounding private ownership. I do not at all share this view. Bord na Móna have created, by virtue of their work and their contribution to the national economy, a very large tract of land under public ownership.  Public money has been put into that land to exploit it in the national interest and to produce turf and the cost of development of those bogs has been very substantial. It would be reprehensible&mdash;I cannot think of any stronger word&mdash;that any policy should be devised whereby ownership of that land would return in small, haphazard pieces to a multitude of adjacent private interests.  We are very well aware here of the difficulty which faced Bord na Móna in generally bringing those holdings together in the first instance and the general consolidation of those areas so that they could be effectively drained, effectively developed and ultimately made productive.  It would be <Col N="2032" /> entirely inappropriate that any of the pressures&mdash;and I am quite sure that there will be in the years ahead enormous pressures exerted on successive Ministers for Energy&mdash;to allegedly hand back, to use a very inappropriate phrase, ownership of these tens of thousands of acres should succeed.</P>
    <P>I refer the House to the annual report of Bord na Móna for 1976-77 in which is made an entirely valid point in relation to the land left after the private use of turf.  That report stated that many thousands of privately owned cut-away and marginal land remain undeveloped because of the fragmented structure of ownership which inhibits drainage and development essential for the full utilisation of the real potential of those lands. It would be unfortunate if the cut-away lands of Bord na Móna were disposed of in a manner that prevented their full exploitation particularly in terms of agriculture and forestry.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we appreciate the enormous value, particularly the long-term value, of the lands concerned.  I am a member of the Economic and Social Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe and in recent years I have had the opportunity of visiting a number of European countries.  When I see the intensive land usage, the enormous value attached to land and the intensive cultivation even of relatively unproductive land, in Europe, I get rather angry at the way we have not fully exploited the potential of land usage here.  I urge the Minister to set up a new committee but he should be very careful of the terms of reference of such a committee.  The committee should be asked to report on the future general utilisation of those areas, not their disposal.  I do not think that should be considered at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a member of the joint committee and perhaps he could tell me who is advocating the return of the cut-away original owners. There was some reference to this in the committee's report but I am not sure who is advocating this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the <Col N="2033" /> Minister that it was not I who advocated it.  The pressures will be enormous on the Minister.  I think there will be a national consensus on this matter.  Personally I would have every confidence in the Minister to lay down the principles of such development and I hope that during his tenure of office in his current portfolio he will lay down the principles in a very explicit manner.  Bord na Móna are in a vacuum in relation to the issue.  I should like the Minister to give consideration to this matter.</P>
      <P>I would urge care in relation to the construction of turf-fired power stations. One or two State-sponsored bodies have not been entirely subject to what I would call conventional scrutiny in terms of their capital expenditure on some major installations.  NET are a classic example in that regard.  It is amazing how costs are allowed to escalate in some areas beyong all reasonable proportions.  I urge care in considering expenditure in this case but I do not think my comment in that regard will unduly inhibit the board.</P>
      <P>The development programme should go ahead rapidly.  I have no doubt that in the years ahead employment in this area will increase by an extra several thousand persons, particularly in rural Ireland.  I feel sure the contribution of the board to economic and social development will be decisive.  Accordingly, I fully support the Bill.</P>

That was demonstrated in his earlier statements on wind power and nuclear energy.  It typifies the man himself. He has started a new Department with great energy and vigour.  He has provided a greater openness so far as the energy debate is concerned.  This is important in the context of people's feelings regarding the uses of energy and, in particular, the possibility of nuclear energy.

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some reservations about the borrowing by Bord na Móna of large sums of money on the expensive European and world money markets.  One of the immediate issues facing Bord na Móna is the price control system.  It may be unwise for a backbench Deputy to raise the spectre of energy-related prices so far as briquettes are concerned.  For several years past turf prices have been held well below their true market level.  With the everincreasing cost of oil and coal Bord na Móna are selling their products at a hopelessly underpriced value.  Nobody appreciates the problem of pricing more than Deputy FitzGerald, Leader of the Opposition, who used many column inches in <i>The Irish Times</i> in his day as an economic guru proving how stupid it was to use turf when oil was so cheap. He agreed that turf should be developed as an employment scheme in much the same way as walls were built during the famine.  That argument has been overtaken by the prices charged for oil and coal by what I regard as the new controllers of world power, the Arabs.  This out-of-date pricing approach stems from a policy of the prices commission and the Department which in fixing prices allows only for cost increases and makes no allowance for changes in market value of turf or briquettes.  The effect of that policy is bad in two ways; it stimulates an artificial demand for Bord na Móna products and hence we have virtually a black market in briquettes. They are whipped up within hours of <Col N="2035" /> delivery.  On some occasions the truck is followed through town to buy up the available supplies of briquettes.  Secondly, it makes it impossible for Bord na Móna to finance their own development programme out of revenue and forces them to borrow at exorbitant interest rates on the international money market. The cost of borrowed money is prohibitive and prevents the development of the smaller bogs.</P>
      <P>The question of prices is also relevant to turf supplies to the ESB.  From what I can gather from talking to people and reading between the lines in the annual report of the ESB and the annual report of Bord na Móna and the present report just received from the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, the attitude within the ESB&mdash;I want to stress here that it is not openly expressed&mdash;is that if they had to pay the market-related price for Bord na Móna turf it would no longer be economic to operate the older turf-fired stations which by modern standards are very low in efficiency.  There are strong grounds for suspecting that the lack of efficiency is largely due to lack of sustained maintenance which has had a cumulative effect over the years and lowers their efficiency.  I ask the Minister to have a look at that aspect of ESB usage of turf-fired stations particularly in view of the cost of energy today. The efficiency of these stations is less than it should be largely due to lack of development.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond referred to cut-away bogs.  I hope the Minister will assure us that these bogs will not in any way fall into private hands.  I completely support Deputy Desmond and others who express this view.  If there is no lobby, that is fine.  If nobody seeks to take the land and distribute it in parcels of 50, 100 or 500 acres, very well, but we should make it clear, as I hope we will, that to allow cut-away bog which, in the next 20 years will amount to almost 100,000 acres&mdash;the size, I suppose, of a small county&mdash;with its great development potential into private hands would, in my view, be a wrong decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> To distribute it between one farmer and another in the locality would be equally wrong.  It has enormous potential for horticultural purposes and so on.  Only the scientists will be able to decide the best uses to which it should be put.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of Deputies would join me in the hope that cut-away bog acreage will be kept in the hands of the State.  I do not know if there is a lobby&mdash;I hope the Minister will tell us if there is or not&mdash;but this is an enormously valuable national resource and I do not think he should yield to anybody on this issue.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to look at the possibility of amalamating the Forestry Division and Bord na Móna in some way.  The activity of Bord na Móna is seasonal, mostly summer and forestry is a winter activity, mostly winter.  The employment content, rather than being seasonal, could be year-round for thousands of people employed in Bord na Móna.  This was advocated by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and also by the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Norton.  It is self-evident that a Government Department, by its very nature, is not adapted to deal with the administrative and physical work of commercial operations.  Over the years Bord na Móna have adapted and found the expertise for the development of bogs and I urge the Minister to look at the possibility of bringing about an amalgamation in the interests of development of our national resources and in the interests of employment.</P>
    <P>I cannot sufficiently stress the importance of examining the question of the cut-away bogs and dealing with it as a matter of urgency.  It is an important issue and we cannot delay much longer in making decisions on it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to pay tribute to the staff in Bord na Móna.  They are people dedicated to the development in the national interest of our natural wealth. Their contribution is one this House recognises.  I am glad that the Minister has brought in this Bill to provide the necessary moneys, borrowed as they may be, and as I said earlier with some <Col N="2037" /> reservations the moneys might well be far less if the pricing system in relation to turf and briquettes were energy-related, but that is another day's work.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increase of £40 million being provided by way of this Bill.  The Bill is especially appropriate to the constituency I represent and it provides us with an opportunity of raising some points on turf development. In the west there is an enormous amount of blanket and virgin bog&mdash;about 570,000 hectares&mdash;much of which is very poorly drained and which varies from bog of shallow depth to bog of much depth.</P>
      <P>In the past ten years there has been a dramatic change in the attitude of our people towards the simple and humble bog.  Just as the camel is referred to often as the ship of the desert, the donkey might well be referred to as the ship of the bog so far as the west is concerned because since the beginning of the century turf has been drawn from the bog with the help of the donkey.  However, the question of access to the bogs today is a very important factor in encouraging people to cut turf.  Since the oil crisis many people realise that the simplest and most reachable form of energy on which they can draw is the bog.  In the west a large amount of the untouched bog could be used if there were proper access to it.  Quite an amount of this bog is held either in commonage or by private owners with Bord na Móna having control of some of it.  Many of the bogs are unreachable and we have reason for believing that many thousand of potential users would avail of this form of energy if the bogs were accessible.  A switch of this extent to turf would make some impact on the usage of oil, a commodity that is costing us much more than we would wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is within the portfolio of the Minister for Energy to do so, perhaps he would consult with the Minister for the Environment and with the Minister for Agriculture, because of his association <Col N="2038" /> with the Land Commission, regarding the provision of financial assistance for the purpose of creating access to areas of bog that are capable of being developed.  This question has been raised time and again during budget debates.  It has been raised repeatedly, too, at various county council meetings but the message would appear not to have sunk in yet.  Consequently, we have not been able to get the necessary finance to enable us to do a decent job in providing efficient access to boglands.  One appreciates that access roads to bogs are used only during the turf harvesting period but during this time they are used extensively.  The provision of funds for the creation of access to bogs, even to a minimum degree, would assist in drawing from those bogs sufficient quantities of energy to make some impact on the amount of oil being used, particularly by people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>On several occasions, by way of parliamentary questions, I have raised with the Minister for Energy the question of providing a peat briquette factory at Bellacorick in Mayo where there is a peat-burning station in existence.  The Minister's answer was fair in that the surveys undertaken indicated that the depth of bogland, taking the region as a whole, is too shallow to warrant the setting up of a peat briquette factory there.  I am aware, though, that since the results of the survey concerned were made known, Bord na Móna have taken control of further sections of the bogland concerned and are developing it.  I trust that this development will continue on an increasing scale.  In an area which for many years suffered seriously from unemployment and from emigration there lies in the continued expansion of these areas of bogland the capacity to increase much needed male employment.  I urge that at least some of the extra £40 million being granted to the board be used for taking over extra bogland where possible.  The price of such land is not becoming any cheaper.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the recent decision to institute a station for a biomass experiment in that area.  I understand that the number of trees to be planted on an experimental <Col N="2039" /> basis will top the 1 million mark.  I take the assurance given to me recently by the Minister that the level of planting to be carried out there would be sufficient to fuel the proposed station for that region.</P>
    <P>Regarding those boglands that are held by shareholders in various commonages I urge the Minister to consult with the Minister for Agriculture in an effort to have speedy solutions reached so that work might go ahead in reducing sufficiently the level of bogs to enable them to be put into use.</P>
    <P>There are areas of bogland which are physically of a fairly high level and which I presume would be suitable for tree planting and that is another matter to which the Minister should direct his attention.  From various excavations that have been carried out in relation to drainage experiments it is obvious that all of the area concerned was once a tree-growing area.  Since timber and turf development go hand-in-hand the question of planting in this context is important, too.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing demand for peat briquettes but production must be increased if this demand is to be met.  It is unfortunate that instead of briquettes being brought to the west in increasing quantities, the traffic is not the other way.  However, I accept the findings of the survey concerned to the effect that bogs in the region are too shallow to warrant the setting up of a peat briquette station.  Since Bord na Móna were set up some years ago quite a number of achievements have taken place.  Quite an amount of employment has been generated and they have done their work well in the years since they were set up.  I welcome the fact that the increase here is of the order of £40 million.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to make two points to the Minister for Energy.  The first is that he should do something about the creation of new entrances and access roads to bogland that can and will be developed by thousands of potential users.  This will have a continuing <Col N="2040" /> effect upon the oil demand for central heating, and I am sure the Minister himself will welcome that.  He is in a position to do something about it, perhaps through Bord na Móna, the Land Commission or the Department of the Environment, and I urge him to do so.  The other point is that Bord na Móna should be encouraged to continue their expansion of the takeover of suitable bogs, particularly in the western regions, for the purpose not alone of production of an increased amount of peat but also of increasing the capacity that lies there for continued male employment.  That region suffered very heavily from emigration and would benefit greatly from an increased amount of male labour which would result from these boglands being taken over.  The area of bogland that could not then be used suitably for production by Bord na Móna possibly could be converted to the Department's programme for the biomass experimental station.  To that end I urge that the Minister set about this in the context of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed for their welcome for this Bill and the remarks that they made in regard to Bord na Móna and their records.  All of them expressed well-deserved appreciation of the work of Bord na Móna.  I also thank Deputy N. Andrews personally for the kind and generous remarks which he made with regard to myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment on a number of points raised which arose indirectly out of the Bill in relation to the work of Bord na Móna.  Firstly, Deputy Kenny was commenting on the question of the problem of access to bogs.  He was speaking primarily of the bogs in the west of Ireland which are not being developed by Bord na Móna and cannot be developed, at least in the traditional way, because of lack of depth in the bogs.  As far as access to bogs and access roads are concerned, county councils have authority to devote money to this purpose.  Some county councils in the west of Ireland have discussed this problem.  Not surprisingly, they have <Col N="2041" /> come to the conclusion that the Government should make more money available to them, but by doing that they are saying that they do not consider that access roads to bogs constitute a first priority for them.  If they did they would devote part of their funds to this purpose.  They chose not to do that but say that the Government should do so.  As far as my Department are concerned, the only funds I have available for this purpose at present relate to specific and limited cases of access roads in the west to certain turf-burning ESB stations.  They are, of course, of a limited application and the funds I have do not extend and may not be extended to the kind of case that Deputy Kenny and a number of other Deputies from time to time have advocated.</P>
    <P>I am having a look at this whole question of development of bogs in private ownership of the kind that Deputy Kenny has in mind, and the question of access will be one of the aspects being examined.  I should mention that Bord na Móna themselves are operating under what informally is called their fourth programme.  It is informal, and that is the examination of the possibility of a role for Bord na Móna in the development of some bogs which they are not able to develop in the traditional way. New techniques will be required, and almost certainly if it is to be done, Bord na Móna will have to operate in conjunction with other people, perhaps co-operatives in the area and so on.  New methods of drainage and cutting of turf on a mechanical basis will be needed and some developments are taking place in this regard on inventions and experiments which are very interesting for the future.  I cannot say at this stage that any of them have reached the point where we can say that we have the answer to the problem, but the effort is going on and I would hope that in the not too distant future we will see considerable advances in this area.  This is important from the point of view of utilisation of all our indigenous fuel resources but it is also important for the area concerned from an economic point of view.  Indeed, the whole history of Bord na Móna shows <Col N="2042" /> that the effect of Bord na Móna activity has been quite dramatic in areas where there was no prospect of economic development apart from the bogs. Therefore, the possibilities in this regard are quite important form the point of view of economic development of the areas concerned, apart from a national point of view as well.</P>
    <P>I did refer in my introductory speech to the role of the Central Development Committee who operate under the aegis of the Minister for Finance.  That committee has been examining the specific problems in relation to the development of the smaller and generally privately-owned bogs.  Perhaps I should mention that that committee, amongst other things, makes grants available for machinery for the development of such bogs.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to two aspects of cut-away bogs: firstly, the question of ownership and what would happen in the future in regard to their ownership.  There seemed to be some suggestion&mdash;indeed there seemed to be some suggestion in the Report of the All-Party Committee to which I adverted when Deputy Desmond was speaking&mdash;that these bogs, when cut away, should be handed back to the original owners or, presumably, their descendants from whom they were purchased by Bord na Móna.  I am not aware whether such a suggestion has been made but I may say quite frankly that, if it has been.  I would regard it as grotesque that such a suggestion should be made.  The very farthest one could expect that suggestion to go would be that Bord na Móna would sell the portions of cut-away bog that would become available.  Whether that should be done at all is quite another matter because this whole question of consolidation of ownership and the difficulty that presents is one with which we are familiar.  One would have to be very cautious not to undo the benefits achieved by consolidation of ownership in that way.</P>
    <P>It might be of interest to the House if I give some details of what is expected to happen in regard to the availability of cut-away <Col N="2043" /> bogs.  Bord na Móna have purchased to date, in 12 counties, approximately 70,000 hectares, that is approximately 180,000 acres, which is being drained and developed for peat production and from which, up to the end of 1978, 80 million tons of peat have been produced.  It is estimated that two-thirds of the fuel deposits in this area have yet to be harvested.  The board's third development programme which commenced in 1974 will mean an increase in the area of work by the board, so that ultimately Bord na Móna bogs will total approximately 80,000 hectares or 200,000 acres.  This represents an area almost the size of County Louth. The whole area will gradually be available for other developments over the next 50 years as the bogland is cut away, although it will be only after the commencement of the next century that the annual rate of bogland becoming available in that way will reach substantial proportions.</P>
    <P>Research work has been going on in regard to the uses to which cut-away bog might be put.  That research work has been going on for quite some time.  I adverted to the Report of the Inter-departmental Committee on this matter. That committee was set up in September 1977 by the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The report produced is an interim one.  It was submitted to the Government in June last and it indicated the various purposes for which Bord na Móna cut-away bogland could be used.  Basically that report suggested five possible uses: firstly, farming enterprise, and these were envisaged broadly as coming under the headings of livestock enterprises, based on grassland, or arable farm crops, or vegetables and other horticultural crops. Secondly, commercial forestry; thirdly, amenity purposes; fourthly a combination of the other uses I have mentioned, and, fifthly, the use for biomass.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems to be solved in regard to the use of cut-away bog under any of the headings I have mentioned but work is progressing in <Col N="2044" /> trying to establish the best uses to which they could be put.  My own guess, and it is merely a guess, is that the correct use would probably involve a combination of some of the uses I have mentioned, indeed with variations in different areas. We ought not to overlook, in some areas in particular, the potential importance of cut-away bog for amenity purposes.  We tend naturally enough, to think in terms of purely productive purposes.  But there are some areas where the use of cut-away bog for amenity purposes&mdash;involving the creation of artificial lakes, woodland walks and wildlife sanctuaries&mdash;could be very important for our people and also as potential tourist attractions.  But, of course, I am speaking only of certain areas of cut-away bogland.  The fact that bogs have been, and will continue for a long time, to provide fuel dictates that in circumstances in which we are striving to use our indigenous resources, the suggestion automatically arises of considering the use of cut-away bog for biomass, for the growing of timber and other crops which can be used as fuel and, in particular, for the generation of electricity. It seems to be a natural use, continuing the kind of use to which nature has given rise in the very creation of bogs.  Of course the great advantage from our point of view in biomass is that it is renewable.  The House will be aware that there is work going on at present in this regard.  It is impossible to say what will be the outcome of the assessment of the possible uses of cut-away bog.  However, I must say I am anxious to expedite consideration of these uses as much as possible and to see results in that area as soon as it is possible to get them.  But obviously it would be a mistake to be rushing into making decisions in this regard without adequate information as to the implications of the possible uses, the result of the research going on in regard to these uses and the methods of overcoming the problems identified.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which reference was made by some Deputies, including Deputy O'Toole, was the question of the financing of Bord na Móna.  Indeed Deputy O'Toole quoted from a part of <Col N="2045" /> Bord na Móna's Annual Report in this regard.  There are two general comments I should like to make on this aspect of the matter.  Firstly, Deputies speaking in the debate and the Joint Committee reporting on Bord na Móna advocated a revised pricing policy in regard to their products, basically on the understanding that the price of their products would be fixed on an energy-related basis.  I must confess that it seems to me that whatever may be the arguments against that approach in present circumstances&mdash;having regard to the world and domestic fuel situations&mdash;the argument in favour is incontrovertible. I am taking steps as Minister for Energy to bring about that situation.  Of course, it is not entirely within the competence of the Minister for Energy but concerns other Ministers and the Government in general.  We are moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an inherent contradiction between approaching the matter in that way and, on the other hand, advocating some special subsidised provision of capital for Bord na Móna. To some extent that is included in the reference made to this topic in Bord na Móna's annual report quoted by Deputy O'Toole.  I suppose it is natural enough that any business, whether it is a State or a private enterprise, will go after capital if they can get it cheaply or for nothing, but it does not seem to make sense to think in terms of an energy-related price for the product of Bord na Móna and at the same time to seek some special cosseting of Bord na Móna in regard to the provision of capital.</P>
    <P>By their access to capital from the European Investment Bank, Bord na Móna are obtaining funds at attractive rates.  In so far as funds have been available from the Exchequer at rates of interest not otherwise available, that situation cannot last for very long as the Exchequer rate of interest catches up with the current rate of interest on Exchequer borrowings.  Having regard to that fact, the availability of capital to Bord na Móna through the European Investment Bank should be an attractive proposition.  As in any foreign borrowing, <Col N="2046" /> there is an exchange risk but the risk is minimised by the fact that borrowing through the EIB is in a package of currencies.  Since these would be EMS currencies the risk of loss is very much reduced.  Anybody who had borrowed since we joined the EMS would not have suffered any appreciable loss to date because there has been only minor movement within the bands.  One can afford to sustain a fairly substantial loss and still gain having regard to interest rates payable as against the normal commercial interest rates payable in this country.</P>
    <P>If one accepts the argument that the product should be disposed of at a commercial rate, an energy-related price, one must also accept that Bord na Móna should be financed on a commercial basis and not cosseted.  They are well able to stand on their own feet in the commercial market and I look forward to seeing them successfully doing so in the future.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the major items raised by Deputies and I thank them for their approach.  I regret it if I have omitted any points.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the financial cosseting of Bord na Móna. While I quoted an extract from the report concerning the exchange risk involved, I did not expand on the whole area of risk.  There is one anomaly which is becoming very obvious when the underwriting of the exchange risk is men tioned.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism said in the House last week that it would cost the Exchequer money.  If it is to cost money, there will be a loss to Bord na Móna or to some other enterprise, whether public or private, if the underwriting takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> The only circumstance in which a loss to the Exchequer could occur would be through devaluation but suggestions of a possible devaluation are vehemently denied.  If there is not a danger of devaluation there is no risk involved and consequently no loss to the Exchequer. It is a matter of restoring confidence rather than paying out hard cash.</P>
    <P>While I agree that the Minister's approach is logical in that if commercial energy-based prices are applied to a product, normal commercial terms must be applied to the money supply.  I was talking in the broader context of underwriting of the exchange risk.  If I am to follow the arguments logically the end result will purely restore confidence and it would not cost money as there would be no risk.  This is according to the arguments put up by the Minister's colleagues.</P>

      <P>When I talked about cosseting Bord na Móna commercially I included what the Deputy was talking about.  I am not talking just about Bord na Móna.  There are a number of Irish industries who wish to be cosseted in a way in which industries in other countries are not cossetted.  No country would guarantee against any change in the value of the currency.  By definition one cannot do that.  What the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy referred to was a scheme whereby they would be self-financing.  There would be no question of financing from the Exchequer but, if people have this fear, this will reassure them because there will be a scheme whereby if there was a change in the value of the currency they would be reimbursed although it would be a self-financing scheme.  That does not arise in regard to Bord na Móna.  As we are running out of time I cannot elaborate on that but I have tried to show my attitude in what I said earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to replace the present system of control of the contents of most packaged goods&mdash;which is based on the principle that each package must contain at least the nominal contents indicated thereon&mdash;with a system based on the principle that, on average, each package contains the nominal quantity indicated thereon.  The Bill is necessary for three reasons, first, to meet EEC requirements; secondly, to facilitate exports by bringing the law into line with practice elsewhere and, thirdly, to introduce tighter control on the contents of prepackages and thereby benefit the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed new system is based on two directives of the European Community&mdash;Council Directive No. 75/106/EEC of 19 December 1974 on the approximation of the laws of member states relating to the making up by volume of certain prepackaged liquids, and Council Directive No. 76/211/EEC of 20 January 1976 on the approximation of the laws of member states relating to the making up by weight or by volume of certain prepackaged products.  These require that each package must contain on average at least the nominal quantity marked on the package, that the contents of all packages must lie above the absolute tolerance limits set out in the directives and that the vast majority of packages must lie above even stricter tolerance limits also set out in the directives. Packages qualifying will bear an &ldquo;e&rdquo;-mark indicating acceptability from a metrological point of view and this mark will act as a passport for the goods on to other EEC markets.  Broadly speaking, a major advantage of the system is that it will facilitate easier access to all EEC markets because of its uniformity and general acceptability in the Nine.  A quantity control function will ensure, by statistical sampling techniques, that <Col N="2049" /> packages are in accordance with the directives.  And, as there will be no question of a packer being able to operate on a minus tolerance only, the consumer will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>Through a committee established when the need for this legislation was first recognised, the various industrial interests and representatives of retailers and consumer groups were consulted to ensure that the measure introduced would be so designed as to protect the interests of all concerned whilst at the same time enabling industry to pack at maximum efficiency.  This last consideration is quite significant to the competitiveness of industry on home and export markets.</P>
    <P>Arising from this consultation and at the request of industry, the opportunity has been taken when preparing this legislation to expand its scope beyond the rather modest terms of the EEC directives so as to enable our packers and consumers to gain the maximum advantage from the proposed system.  This has been done by proposing that a much wider range of packaged goods be subject to the average system than is the case under the directives.</P>
    <P>To ensure compliance with the system, I am establishing a special inspectorate which will concentrate mainly on checks at the premises of packers and importers.  In addition, a retail monitoring network will be established which it is expected will sample up to 75,000 individual packages annually thus greatly expanding the level of surveillance at retail level and enhancing the protection afforded the consumers.  I should point out that another feature of the proposed system will be the transfer of responsibility for sub-standard packages from the point of sale to the point of packaging or import as the case may be, thus correcting what might be regarded as an anomaly in existing law whereby in many cases the retailer was legally responsible for packages which had already been made up before receipt by him.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, expect that all industry will be able to switch over to the <Col N="2050" /> new system overnight and accordingly have made provision for the issuing in certain circumstances of temporary derogations from the system.  I am confident that when adopted and fully operative the new system will increase the efficiency and competitiveness of our packers and will provide Irish consumers with a comprehensive protection against sub-standard packages.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him happiness and success in his position.  This is the Minister's first time to introduce a Bill in the House in his capacity as Minister for State and I wish him every success.</P>
      <P>The Packaged Goods (Quantity Control) Bill, 1980 is, as the Minister said, merely implementing two EEC Directives, 75/106 and 76/211 involving statistical sampling at the point of manufacture or importation.  There is also a change here concerning liability and as time goes on consumers will generally realise that this change is of a significant nature.  As has been said, responsibility up to now has rested with the retailer at the point of sale and this is seen to be a rather unfair burden particularly in the case of many items where the retailer had no hand, act or part in either the production, manufacture or packaging of the said items.  Yet, in law this unfortunate analogous position obtained where the person offering the commodity at the point of sale was held responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us to the question of product liability, which I am sure the Minister will turn his mind to in the not too distant future.  It is a matter that has been attracting attention for some time in Brussels.  Needless to say this suggestion has, for obvious reasons, met with a fair degree of opposition from vested interests. But, small though it is, the provision in this Bill which shifts liability from the retailer at the point of sale to somebody else is a step in the right direction. Hopefully the logical expansion of that approach will lead to product liability as we understand those words, <Col N="2051" /> the responsibility of the person who is responsible for producing the goods.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Bill which is to be welcomed is that it gives the consumer a fairer crack of the whip in that he is now in a position to evaluate more accurately what he is purchasing, at least as far as quantity is concerned if not quality.  I hope the legislation now going through Seanad Éireann, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, will look after the quality aspect of goods and will favour the consumer in the long run.</P>
    <P>One of the things that intrigues me&mdash;and it came up before in the Consumer Information Bill&mdash;is the provision that states that markings must be easily legible without opening the package. There are problems here in that there are certain goods and commodities which because of their very nature cannot be opened until the point of consumption. In the case of guarantees and warranties and so on a person may ask a retailer to sell him an article which is on display in his shop window and the retailer goes upstairs or downstairs and produces what one must assume is the same commodity packed in a sealed container. One goes home with it and there is no way of reading the small print until the wrapping or covering is undone.  Am I to take it that the provisions of this Bill will ensure that all relevant information, the minimum information necessary under this Bill, will have to be legible on the container of the commodity?  It is something I assume will happen and something which will add to the protections now being given to the consumer to which the consumer feels, and rightly so, that he or she is entitled.</P>
    <P>The five basic rights of the consumer, the right to protection of health and safety, the right to protection of economic interests, the right of redress, the right to information and education and the right to representation&mdash;which is the right to be heard&mdash;are enhanced in this Bill.  This is particularly so in regard to the right to information and education. Will there be some standardised <Col N="2052" /> form of marking or some code that would be easily recognised among the member states of the EEC?  There is reference to a marking indicating acceptability from a metrologic point of view. I would like to know if it is envisaged that there would be some simple form of code that would be easily recognisable and if this could be worked out with our eight colleagues in the EEC?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that to ensure compliance with the system he is establishing a special inspectorate which will concentrate mainly on checks at the premises of packers and importers.  This is a very welcome development.  In relation to this I would also like to know if the complaints which this inspectorate might receive of for instance, noncompliance with this Bill or Act as it then would be, will be referred to the Director of Consumer Affairs?  What follow-through will there be by the inspectorate in the Minister's Department to ensure compliance with the regulations under the provisions of the Act?  It is good to see that the Minister is expanding the inspectorate to ensure an extended surveillance service at retail level but there must be a follow through.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention one other aspect of the Minister's statement.  It concerns what he calls derogations from the system.  I appreciate that it is a new system of marking and will cause certain flutters in the packaging and distribution end of industry and trade, which, of course, will ultimately add to the cost of the commodity being packed.  I would like to know what the Minister means by temporary derogation.  For how long will these people be allowed to derogate from the provisions of the Bill when enacted? What steps will be taken to ensure the expeditious implementation of this Bill?</P>
    <P>All in all the Bill is to be welcomed.  It is as a result of very long and arduous consultations within the member states of the EEC and I hope the Minister will ensure that it is implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill.  It is a long time <Col N="2053" /> since packaging departed from its purely functional role and became part of the sales effort directed at consumers.  It is a matter of regret that over time, and particularly in recent years, the relationship between the size of the package on display in the supermarket or corner store and the weight or volume of the contents have assumed a geometrical progression as one marvels at the capacity of manufacturers to disguise with copious quantities of cardboard, plastics and fresh air the exact contents of their packages.  In these circumstances it is all the more important that the consumer should be protected by the introduction of adequate legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not only glad that this is being brought in on foot of an EEC directive but that the Government have not been content to do the minimum necessary to keep us in line with the directive, as they might conceivably have done, but have gone beyond that to bring other goods in under the scope of the Bill.  It is essential if the shopper&mdash;I speak as someone who does his own share of shopping&mdash;is to compare the value for money offered by different manufacturers that he or she be under no illusion as to the contents of goods.  He will now be aware, as a result of this legislation, that there will never be less in a package than the average number.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to know the size of the proposed inspectorate.  I trust their work will have the effect of protecting the consumer.  Ideally we would like to hear from the Minister, perhaps in an Estimate speech every year, how this legislation is working out, how many prosecutions are brought and how many offences are committed.  Ideally we would like to see no prosecutions brought.  If the inspectorate is of an adequate size and there are a small number of prosecutions, we can assume that the packaging legislation is being reasonably well looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the penalties clause I notice that it is rather stiff, as it should be.  In the case of a first offence, an offender is liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000 and in the case of a second or <Col N="2054" /> subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding £10,000.  One point is whether it would be open to us&mdash;the Minister might consider this between now and Committee Stage&mdash;to take specific action in relation to manufacturers who are habitually in breach of the Act, or importers who show themselves to be in breach of the Act, by banning the sale of their products from shops until they satisfy the inspectorate and the Department that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that the minimum contents regulations and legislation are being observed. This, rather than lengthy court proceedings, might be more efficacious in bringing the manufacturer or importer to heel.  It would be far easier administratively to cope with importers who would be in breach of the Act by preventing entry of their goods if this could be done in accordance with common market rules, than it would be to do something to an Irish manufacturer. That is just a suggestion I throw out to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are fully in agreement with the need for this legislation and we are glad that the Minister has gone as far as he has.  We urge him to take any reasonable steps that seem to be necessary to ensure that the legislation when it is passed will be adequate to protect the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important thing about any code of packaging is that it be understood by the consumer.  There is a tendency for bureaucracies to create legislation which causes difficulties for industry and requires them to provide all kinds of information which could cost an amount to put on their packets and when it is put there the public cannot make much use of it because it is in such a complex form that they do not understand it.  This can arise from excessive zeal on the part of the legislator to put everything that might conceivably be relevant on to the packet.  The result is that the really important things are subsumed amidst an immense amount of other less important detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise what is important to the shopper and only to put <Col N="2055" /> what is important on to the package rather than putting on a mass of information that people will not have time to digest.  The amount of time people have for deciding which brand of soap they will buy in a supermarket is very little. They are moving fairly fast and just pick one.  They do not have time to take four of them out on a page and take notes on the different characteristics given and get their calculator and make a calculation to see if there is a slightly higher amount of cleaning agent in one soap as compared to another and then decide which to buy.  The amount of time it would take to do that would absorb more money in terms of time than the amount that might be saved by buying the better brand of soap.</P>
    <P>The information provided should be immediately digestible and relevant to the public.  If it does not meet that characteristic it only imposes an unnecessary cost on the manufacturers which is reflected in the prices charged to the consumer.  There is some argument that some regulations designed to protect the consumer can result in exploiting him by resulting in higher costs. It is important to look critically at the legislation with a view to ensuring that only the most relevant information is put on the packages.  Food is one area where there is a greater need for information than any other.</P>

These employees are, of course, covered by the social insurance system which provides flat-rate pensions for old age, retirement, invalidity and widowhood.  The need for improved pension provisions for all workers was considered in the Green Paper &ldquo;A National Income-Related Pension Scheme&rdquo;.  The preparation of proposals arising out of that paper is now at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>Smallholder recipients of unemployment assistance in the areas specified by the scheme with land valuations of up to £20 normally have their means from their holdings calculated on a notional basis by reference to their land valuations.  Any smallholder whose means are assessed on a notional basis may opt to have his means assessed on a factual basis if he considers that this would be to his advantage.</P>
      <P>Some 3,000 smallholders have already opted for factual assessment and are receiving unemployment assistance at the rates generally applicable, which will be increased by 20 per cent from April next.  This option is entirely at the discretion of the smallholder and if having opted for factual assessment, it emerges that the result would operate to his disadvantage, he may continue to exercise his right to remain on notional assessment.

      <P>If they opt to be assessed and try to establish whether they would do better under the factual rather than the notional system if they find it will to the notional system if they find it will be to their benefit.  There is no question of victimising them.  Notional assessment is available and will be available to them at the existing rates.  The Deputy spoke of the budget speech and said this matter was not referred to.  I will read from the reference of the Minister for Finance in his budget statement:</P>
      <P>Smallholders in specified western areas drawing unemployment assistance have the option of having their means assessed on a factual basis or a national basis.  The vast bulk of smallholders are on a notional basis which, in effect, is concessionary both by reference to present levels of farm income and to the means test applied to other unemployment assistance claimants.  The Government have, therefore, decided that the rates of unemployment assistance paid to persons who opt for the notional system of means assessment will be maintained at their October 1979 level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Smallholders who opt to continue on the notional system are operating at a very considerable concessionary advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other beneficiaries.  This is not the first occasion on which those in the notional system have had benefits frozen.  They will not benefit from the 20 per cent increase, but those who opt for factual assessment will benefit.  In effect, they <Col N="2064" /> will be disclosing their actual incomes and in that way they will show that they are qualified the same as any other person on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely these people deserve something more.  This applies only to the six western underdeveloped counties.  Therefore, is the Minister not discriminating against people in those counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The multiplier involved in this notional assessment was introduced in 1966.  It was £20 per £1 valuation.  It was increased in 1976 and 1979, and in 1977 smallholders with more than £20 rateable valuations were excluded from the notional system.  Prior to that the number of smallholders who benefited has risen from 8,000 in 1965 to almost 30,000 in 1976.  Therefore, there was a large increase under the notional scheme.  The number is now about 21,000.  Despite the increases in the multiplier, it is clear this does not reflect the true level of means.  For instance, in the case of a holding of £5 valuation the means are assessed at less than £3 per week.  The farm management survey and other studies indicate that on average multipliers for smallholdings of less than £100 per £1 valuation are concessionary in present terms.  This is not to sav that in some individual cases the true income will not be substantially less due to exceptional circumstances such as a very poor holding or an incapacitated or elderly owner.  In such circumstances the person concerned can opt for a factual assessment which is designed accurately to reflect his true circumstances.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if employees of universities who have had social welfare contributions deducted from their salary are entitled to a contributory old age pension on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>All employees of universities who pay social welfare contributions at the ordinary rate giving entitlement to all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts may qualify for contributory old age pension on attaining age 66 years provided that they satisfy the statutory contribution conditions for such pension.  The contribution conditions for contributory old age pension are as follows: 1.  The claimant must have entered insurance before the prescribed age.  (This varies between age 56 and age 60 depending on the claimant's date of birth); 2.  He/she must have 156 contributions paid; 3.  He/she must have an average of at least 20 contributions paid and/or credited from 1953 (or from date of entry into insurance if this is later than 1953) up to the end of the last complete contribution year before attainment of pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, most universities revised their sick pay schemes for their permanent <Col N="2071" /> and pensionable employees and applied to my Department for a decision as to the rate of social insurance contribution payable in respect of them.</P>
    <P>As those bodies are public authorities and as their sick pay privileges were regarded as adequate for the purposes of the Social Welfare Acts, it was decided that a modified rate of contribution was payable in respect of their permanent and pensionable employees.  This modified rate of contribution does not confer title to old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>All such persons will qualify for a pension in their own right from the universities when they reach pension age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Prior to 6 April 1979, all part-time employees who were employed for the purposes of an employer's trade or business were insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, irrespective of the duration of the employment or of the amount of the remuneration.  In addition, persons such as private domestic workers who were employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer's trade or business were insurable for all benefits if they worked for a total of 18 hours or more in the week for one or more employers or, if working for a total of less than 18 hours in the week, were mainly dependent for livelihood on the earnings from such employment or employments.  All other part-time employees were insured for occupational injury benefits and under the Health Acts.</P>
      <P>As from 6 April 1979, the date of the introduction of the PRSI contribution scheme, the position is that irrespective of the nature of the employment any person who works for 18 or more hours in the week in one or more employments, continues to be insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  Where the total number of hours worked is less than 18 hours in the week, the employee continues to be insured for all benefits if he or she is mainly dependent for livelihood on the earnings from such employment or employments.  Any person who works for a total of less than 18 hours in the week and who is not so dependent continues to be insured for occupational injury benefit and under the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any employee, part-time or otherwise, who has already been compulsorily insured for benefits which include contributory old age, retirement and widow's pensions may, subject to prescribed conditions, preserve their <Col N="2073" /> rights to these benefits by payment of contributions on a voluntary basis. There is no provision under the Social Welfare Acts which permits payment of voluntary contributions to establish title to disability benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if his attention has been drawn to the vast potential for aquaculture, the research available and the steps being taken to promote and educate the co-operatives, fishermen and farmers on this potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am well aware of the potential for aquaculture in this country and I am doing everything possible to develop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have been carrying out research on the farming of salmon <Col N="2078" /> and trout, oysters, mussels and escallops over a period and the National Board of Science and Technology are at present carrying out site surveys around the coast to identify the most suitable areas for development.</P>
    <P>The Department together with the various agencies concerned, inluding An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, have organised and/or taken part in seminars designed to promote aquaculture development. Advice and guidance is also being given by these bodies to potential fish farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Minister for his reply; but this new development in fishing, aquaculture, is a matter in which we have fallen behind.  We are about ten years behind at present.  Would the Minister not consider himself holding a seminar so as to educate some of the small fishermen and small farmers around the coasts about this very vast and potentially lucrative market and encourage them to develop the small bays of our shores?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Deputy that the interest is there. It is being expressed to me weekly at least as regards aquaculture and mariculture, that I might take up the matter with the Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to see if they would organise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had a national seminar perhaps we could both attend and give our views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's acceptance of the fact that we have fallen somewhat behind in developing aquaculture, is he satisfied that Bord Iascaigh Mhara as at present constituted and staffed are the right agency or vehicle to develop this aspect of our fisheries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some merit in falling somewhat behind because aquaculture and mariculture are very much at the pioneering stage in many countries.  We can learn from the mistakes they have made and see that they <Col N="2079" /> are not repeated here.  My own experience of Bord Iascaigh Mhara&mdash;Deputy White will probably agree as a result of his visit to Abbotstown&mdash;is that they are very much on the ball.  They know what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing that as far as research is concerned we are on a par with any country, as far as development is concerned does the Minister accept that we are behind?  The Norwegians, for example, are at present cultivating 7,000 tons of salmon, eight times more than we are catching around the entire coast. Surely he must accept that we have fallen drastically behind as regards aquaculture and mariculture development.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, further to the decision of the authorities concerned, to cease drainage work by agreement in the Pollardstown Fen until 14 April 1980, and the initiation of two surveys on the effect of drainage on the future of this Fen, if he will indicate the outcome of this work to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey of Pollardstown Fen carried out by officers of my Department has now been completed and confirms the unique scientific value of the fen and the need for its conservation. As announced in a recent press release I have now authorised my Department to enter into negotiations with the landowners concerned with a view to the purchase of the fen for conservation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in replying to an earlier question that he had no money to compensate the fishing industry in Ballycotton which had suffered from the storm in March.  Would he indicate what funds, if any, he has available to purchase the Pollardstown Fen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we have decided to acquire the fen and hopefully this will be done by negotiation.  I do not wish to enter into any conflict with the owners.  I hope no further arterial drainage will be contemplated or carried out there.  I should like everybody's co-operation not to muddy the waters in regard to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution. As regards the moneys available to me, when we prepared our budget last year we were conscious of the fact that we had an obligation under the Wildlife Act to make provision for certain matters of a conservation nature that would arise.  I have made provision and I have funds available.  But when one is negotiating regarding the purchase of land it would be unwise to mention the amount of money available lest they might wish to take it all.  I should not like that to happen, particularly as it is in Kildare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <P>25.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the precise <Col N="2082" /> assurance given by the Taoiseach to the personnel involved in the campaign to protect Lough Sheelin, County Cavan, from the effects of water pollution; the manner in which he proposes to implement those assurances; the timetable involved in the implementation and the changes in legislation, if any, required, to give effect to the assurances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that letters on the Taoiseach's behalf issued in reply to representations from a number of bodies and individuals on the subject in question.  The terms of these letters showed some variation but the general tenor was that the Taoiseach and I were determined that whatever difficulties were in the way should be overcome and the lake restored to its pre-eminent position as a trout fishery.</P>
      <P>The problem in Lough Sheelin arises from an over enrichment of the lough due to the entry of an excessive quantity of nutrients.  As a first step I have set up a technical committee comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Agriculture, the Agricultural Institute and the Inland Fisheries Trust to consider methods of dealing with the problem.  I expect to receive that committee's report very shortly and I can assure the House that there will be no delay in implementing whatever course of action is considered the most appropriate for dealing with the problem.  It is not possible to say at this stage whether any changes in legislation will be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the inter-departmental committee and that it has not completed its deliberations, but would the Minister not agree that a solution must be found by this autumn in order to avoid the next season of pig slurry?  Would he not agree that the general consensus is that some kind of storage facility is required at one end and grants or subsidies for transporting slurry out of the lough basin into another catchment area where it can be used? Having regard to that and to the two assurances given, could he indicate what kind of financial resources, if any, he has <Col N="2083" /> to give substance to the assurances by himself and the Taoiseach?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that the spreading of slurry can only be carried out in the period from April to September and that storage facilities need to be made available not only in the Sheelin catchment area but possibly also in the area outside the catchment to which the slurry is brought.  We have thought about this and we have had discussions with the parties involved.  While the mechanics of the matter have not yet arisen&mdash;the Deputy mentioned the cost&mdash;all I can do is assure the Deputy that whatever moneys are necessary to put this project into operation this year will be made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual farmers have the right to do their farming in their own way.  While I appreciate that some of the problems do not come from individual farmers but from pig industries, I think you cannot take away the right of a farmer, within reason, to use slurry as a top-dressing on his own land with the normal safeguards against polution.  I think it would be wrong of us to interfere to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister realises, particularly in the immediate area around this lake, that other types of <Col N="2084" /> fertilisers should be used.  This is affecting a very valuable lake and something drastic will have to be done about it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will make a statement concerning the recent circular of March 1980, from the accountant of his Department issued to subscribers stating that it has not been possible to bring the issue of telephone accounts up to date and, that it has been decided not to issue the normal accounts for the January-March quarter but combine them with the April-June account to be issued in May 1980 to cover rental for the six months period January to June 1980 and the charges for calls made in the period October 1979 to March 1980, and if he will outline the collection procedures in cases where hardship may arise in the payment of these accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The position generally in relation to the issue of telephone accounts is as stated in the circular letter issued to all subscribers.  Telephone accounts could not issue during the postal strike last year and despite every effort to recover the lost ground the issue of the last quarter's accounts for 1979 was almost three months later than normal. Accordingly, the issue of a further combined account for the first two quarters of the current year has been necessary in order to bring the telephone accounting cycle back to normal.  In accordance with practice, a reasonable period of time will be allowed in which to pay the combined accounts and in cases of hardship sympathetic consideration will be given to requests from subscribers to delay payment or to pay by instalment over a period.</P>

The Department forward notices of vacancies for unestablished night telephonists to the board's placement officer at the same time as nominations are sought for the vacancies from the National Manpower Service.  In addition to that the Department examine posts which would be suitable for the employment of disabled people, as it is not very easy to slot those people into positions which are suitable to them.

      <P>Because of the mountainous nature of the terrain TV reception from the transmitter at Mullaghanish is poor in parts of west Cork and RTE therefore provided transposers at Castletownbere, Clonakilty, Glengarriff and Roscarbery.  Although these transposers have improved the position, there are still many pockets in west Cork&mdash;Including the area mentioned by the Deputy&mdash;where RTE consider that TV reception is less than adequate. There are of course many other areas of this kind throughout the country. RTE say that it is not possible to deal with all areas, of poor or inadequate reception at the same time.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's attitude to the study on transport policy prepared by the National Economic and Social Council was outlined in the statement released by the Government Information Services on 11 March 1980.  The statement read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government welcome the report of the National Economic and <Col N="2093" /> Social Council on Transport Policy.  It is an important analysis of the major issues in transport policy in Ireland and will help in the examination of various aspects of transport policy at present being made by the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport expects to receive shortly, from the Transport Consultative Commission, its report on the arrangements for the provision of passenger transport services in the Dublin area.  In addition, management consultants have been engaged to carry out a study of the financial position of CIE.</P>
    <P>The report of CIE by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies is another useful contribution to the debate on future transport policy.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the widespread public concern about the transport system and recognise the need for early decisions on the further development of national transport policy.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Transport Consultative Commission on Passenger Transport Services in the Dublin Area, which was referred to in that statement, has since been published.  One of the commission's recommendations is that a Dublin Transportation Authority should be established with overall responsibility for ensuring the integrated planning and operation of transportation in the Dublin area.  As already announced by me, the Government have decided that a Dublin Transportation Authority should be established and I have set up a task force to take the necessary steps to ensure the Authority are set up as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Pending the establishment of the new Authority, the task force are also being given responsibility for traffic management, for example for securing the introduction of bus priority measures and the enforcement of road traffic regulations, and also for the further evaluation of road and rail investment plans in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister two questions and, in so doing, to congratulate him on having taken the decision to set up a Dublin Transportation Authority, much sought by all parties in this House.  Could the Minister say what is the status of the proposal of CIE referred to in the report of the Transport Consultative Commission relating to rapid rail and whether or not that is now ruled out?  Secondly, does the Minister consider it would be helpful&mdash;in order to ensure the most satisfactory working of the new transportation authority&mdash;that major decisions by local authorities, say, on infrastructural developments such as motorways or roads for the moment at least, and by that I mean a matter of months, should be deferred until such time as the transportation authority have met and considered how these proposals would mesh with their plans?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The broad answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but there are factors which have changed the situation from what it used to be as regards the supply of crude oil to the oil companies, the methods by which it is shipped and the economics of that operation and also the kind of product that is required from crude oil and what can be produced at Whitegate. There are a number of factors which may affect the ability of the companies to utilise Whitegate to the full.

      <P>I understand that the board issued a firm quotation for supply in January 1980 to Roscommon County Council, who accepted it and issued the necessary order for supply on 19 March 1980.  I also understand from the ESB that the connection will be made, probably this week, but certainly before the end of next week.</P>

The mother's anxiety about her daughter's welfare and desire that she return home have been conveyed on a number of occasions.  The girl has been informed that funds would be made available for her to travel home if it were her wish to come here and that she would be provided with a valid travel document for this purpose.

      <P>Preparatory work for the Madrid meeting has been under way in my Department for some time.  In reply to a similar question in May 1979, the approach being followed in the preparatory work was outlined.  Since that time work has intensified as the date of the Madrid meeting approaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major part of our preparatory work <Col N="2107" /> is being carried out jointly with our partners in the European Community. During Ireland's EEC Presidency we devoted a good deal of attention to furthering Community preparations for Madrid.  A considerable amount of the groundwork has now been accomplished in Community preparations.  The monitoring of the implementation of the Final Act by all the participating states is of course a continuous exercise and in that sense the preparatory work is obviously open-ended.</P>
    <P>Apart from joint work with our Community partners, preparations for Madrid include an assessment of our own situation with regard to implementation of the Final Act and also extensive contacts with countries outside the Community.

      <P>In the period since the signature of the Helsinki Final Act in August 1975, representations have been received from a number of Irish citizens&mdash;individually and as group members&mdash;concerning alleged breaches of the Final Act by other signatory states.  The Government's concern for the implementation of the Final Act has led us to take careful note of such representations.  On many public occasions since the adoption of the Final Act, the Government's position on the need for full and balanced implementation of the terms of the Act has been very clearly stated.  We have also used other suitable channels to make known our concern in specific instances.  I hope the Deputies will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to go into <Col N="2108" /> detail on the representations which have been made in individual cases.

One can do it on a verbal basis by making the appropriate representations at diplomatic level rather than making formal representations which, more often than not, tend to be taken in a defensive manner.

Since that time my Department have continued to follow as closely as possible the situation with regard to Shcharansky and others in a similar position in Eastern Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present in Lesotho two different groups of Irish teachers involved in education projects. Some of these are engaged in projects under the bilateral aid programme administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs; others are sponsored by the Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO), which is an independent semi-State agency funded by a grant-in-aid administered by my Department from the Vote for International Co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, I believe, referring to a group of 12 secondary teachers, whose assignments are funded by APSO.  A decision relating to these teachers, including any proposed withdrawal, would be taken by the executive committee and board of the agency.  I am not aware that such a decision has been taken.</P>
      <P>Five technical teachers are engaged in Lesotho in a technical diversification project, under the bilateral aid programme.  It is not proposed that they be withdrawn.</P>

It is a question of cutting our cloth according to our measure and seeking to ensure in a year of budgetary constraints that the amount allocated <Col N="2112" /> will be spent in the most economic manner possible.  With regard to the teachers to whom Deputy Quinn referred, I have not got the information as to when exactly they went out there.

      <P>With regard to Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA), there has not been a reduction.  Allocations to ODA have increased by over 450 per cent in the past six years.

While I agree that the bilateral element has reduced, the multilateral element, through Lomé aid in particular, and United Nations agencies has increased.  The net effect taking everything into consideration, which is the aid given to overseas development, is that this year there is a 12 per cent increase over the amount paid in 1979 and a 22 per cent increase over the allocation last year.

Does he agree that our commitment to some of the international multilateral agencies was reduced in the known performance of the call-up date of funds from those agencies, particularly the EDF fund from the EEC?

Hopefully, we will be able to do that.  We are looking at the situation with a view to finding a way to do that.  I should like to enter a cautionary word. Our allocation of about .2 per cent of GNP compares very favourably with other countries.  It is the same as Switzerland, is just behind Japan, .23, ahead of Finland, .17 and ahead of Italy, .07.

      <P>We do not have to have a slagging match, we can see the Government's record on the statute book.  In view of the unsatisfactory position that the budget has forced on the Minister, will the Minister outline the Government's thinking on the time-table envisaged in meeting this target?  Will the Minister also indicate if there is any thinking at all in his Department that he will stand over and give to the House as to what should be the balance between multi-lateral aid contributions and bilateral aid contributions?  What is the <Col N="2119" /> time limit and what is the balance between multi-lateral aid commitments and bilateral commitments within that target?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantial increase in our multi-lateral allocations by reason of Lomé 2 which means that we have an international commitment as part of the community to give these moneys on that multi-lateral basis.  I hope to be able to transfer from that column to the bilateral column so as to meet commitments before the end of the year.  That, as the Deputy appreciates, has happened before.  At the end of this year I would like to get back on stream again with regard to our targets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Minister and the ODA section satisfied that reaching the UN target through multi-lateral agencies is the most effective way to give aid? Is the Minister happy that many of these multi-lateral agencies are dispensing aid in the way we would like?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies.  We closely monitor multi-lateral aid and we acquaint Irish firms and personnel with what is involved and they have moved in on the expenditure of multi-lateral aid due to our contacts with them to the benefit of Ireland as a whole.  However, I agree that bilateral aid is a more effective way of doing the thing because of the inevitable administration involved in the multi-lateral application of funds.  As members of multi-lateral organisations like the EEC and the UN we have to discharge our responsibility.  A percentage <Col N="2120" /> is allocated to each country.  We allocate the percentage in our budgets.  In some cases we do not reach that.  I do not think we will reach our Lomé figure this year.  If it looks as if we will not, I intend to transfer that money over to the bilateral aid area.  I will come back to the House on that.</P>

      <P>The Bilateral Aid Programme has been developed in the light of the wishes of the recipient countries. Possible areas for co-operation are first of all discussed between officials. While every attempt is made to facilitate the Government seeking assistance, where this is deemed appropriate, it is made clear that it may not be possible for us to respond immediately, for example, because of difficulty in recruiting suitable personnel or because of the costs involved.  Before a decision is taken to implement a proposed project a draft budget and timetable are drawn up; but in the course of implementing a project extending over more than a year these are obviously subject to revision in the light of circumstances.  It is not our general practice to commit specific total amounts for projects which are to be carried out over a number of years.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed that there will be participation under the Bilteral Aid Programme in any of the programmes listed by the Deputy in the current year, although there may be, in some cases, in 1981.  I understand however, that a doctor sponsored by APSO has recently left to join the staff of the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Lesotho.</P>

      <P>Deputy J. Ryan has received permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the reasons why officials in the Department of Agriculture have been instructed that all representations made to this Department concerning applications under the farm modernisation scheme must be processed through the office of the Minister of State at the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I thank the Chair sincerely for granting permission to raise this very important matter.  In my view it is vital for the continuing viability and independence of our civil service.  I have been 25 years in public life and seven years in the Dáil.  I would like to pay tribute to the civil service, both at local authority and at Departmental level.  In my experience they have always been very helpful and concerned for the welfare of our people. Indeed I might add their task at times is very difficult with exceptional work <Col N="2130" /> pressure, shortage of staff and, on many occasions, shortage of finance which deprives them of the opportunity to give their maximum efforts to ensuring a proper service for our people.  This type of viability and independence in our civil service is an essential facet in any democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My raising this matter today is the outcome of what happened last week.  As I have normally done in the last couple of years, I telephoned the Department of Agriculture about a simple matter of farm modernisation grants for three farmers in my area whose grants had been approved but who were still waiting for the cheques; some of them need the money very badly.  I was amazed when I was told that the necessary information could not be given as instructions had been issued to the officers of that Department that in future all such inquiries would have to be channelled through the Minister's office.  I was very alarmed at this development.  However, I went home at the weekend and this morning once again, at 10.10 a.m., I made the same effort to obtain the information to assist my three constituents in obtaining their farm modernisation grants and I was given the same answer.  This is what prompted me to raise this matter in the House this morning.  I regret that I may have been a bit disorderly; it is not my usual form.  But I felt so strongly about it that I had to raise it in the House.  It was categorically denied by the Minister that he had issued any such instructions.  It may be that the Minister of State issued the instruction.  I do not know.  But following the discussion this morning I once again telephoned the Department and was again told that the information would have to be channelled through the Minister's office and was given the same reason.  Because of my dissatisfaction and my concern in the matter I tabled a Private Notice Question, as has already been outlined, which was, perhaps rightly, ruled out of order. Surely my efforts and the answers I received are sufficient proof that there has been ministerial interference in the very good relations that have existed between Deputies and Departments.  I say <Col N="2131" /> this in the plural because I have evidence of a similar tactic evolving in another Ministry.  One might say at this stage, having read this morning's newspapers, that this is an echo of the Garda allegation of political interference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned as a public representative&mdash;and all public representatives would be concerned&mdash;about this attempted shutting out of selected politicians.  It must concern all who respect democracy.  The right of public representatives to represent their people must be vigorously defended. Otherwise Dáil Éireann, because of this erosion of power, will be similar to the local authorities whose power has been eroded in the last couple of years through recentralisation.  This is a trend that I fear.  We have been sent here to represent our people and look after their interests and if some party or Government attempt to interfere with the national and democratic right of representation it is a negation of democracy.</P>
      <P>Let me take it a stage further.  Where will the man in the street stand in this whole affair?  Where can he go now for assistance?  Apparently the Minister is now the all-powerful one.  No one else will be allowed to resolve problems.  This attempted erosion of the right of public representatives democratically elected by the people must be stopped.  It may be seen by some as a simple matter.  But as far as I am concerned this is not the open Government that we were promised.  It is not a desirable development to have ministerial representation and not public representation.  I am concerned and that is why I asked to raise this matter here this evening.  I want to be assured that this is not a trend that is going to creep in because I am concerned for democracy when the powers of public representatives are eroded.  It is doing away with one of the lifelines and the bloodlines of democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle, through the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this question to be raised.  I also would like to pay tribute to the civil service. I have dealt with the civil service for a number of years and I have found within that body a willingness to co-operate at all times.  But there is a principle involved here today, the right to know as a public representative.  I was horrified here this morning when I first learned the position that there was a change in regard to the procedure for dealing with public representatives.</P>
      <P>Some three weeks ago I made representations on behalf of an individual in my constituency.  At that time I was informed by the civil servant who dealt with the case that if, in three weeks, the cheque for the farm modernisation grant had not been paid, I should contact him again.  This morning I made the same approach.  Once more a very civil person came on the telephone but regretted that he could not deal with me saying that it was a matter entirely for the Minister's office and I had no choice but to get in touch with the Minister's office. I felt at that stage that there was a ministerial stranglehold on the civil service. But this fear was modified when, during the discussion today, the Minister for Agriculture denied that he had given any instructions to the civil servants.  If he did give such instructions, I wonder is it wise because if we are to return back to the office of the Minister we are going to have a duplication of services.  I wonder has the Minister thought of getting extra staff.  This procedure is slowing down replies; it is delaying the making of payments and it is delaying justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister who worked for farmers and is still working for them can imagine some farmer who had borrowed £20,000 two years ago at 17 or 18 per cent approaching him three weeks ago having in his possession four or five letters from bank managers pressing him for repayment. That person may be legally entitled to £12,000 or £15,000 and cannot get it.  When that goes on for 12 months one can understand people asking me to <Col N="2133" /> query their payments.  They will be waiting for me in my constituency tonight.  I have to go back and say &ldquo;Unfortunately, the people who promised me on that occasion are not in a position to speak to me today&rdquo;.  I will have to explain that I was told by responsible people in the civil service that they cannot deal with me and that it is now a matter for the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>I am worried and feel that my powers as a public representative and advocate of the people are eroded.  There is also an aspersion cast on the civil servants.  I am not for a moment suggesting that the Minister told a lie today.  I do not believe he would do that but if the civil servants are correct in what they told me there is some sinister purpose behind it.  What are they hiding?  All we are doing is seeking information for our constituents who are owed large sums of money which should have been paid a long time ago.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned rang the Department themselves what would they be told?  Would they be told: &ldquo;We cannot deal with your claim in spite of the fact that we hold your money&rdquo;?  I should like the Minister to make a statement on the matter so that if there has been any misunderstanding regarding interpretation of instructions it can be cleared up.  I think the Minister will do that.</P>
    <P>If there is an erosion of access by public representatives to look after their constituents, the people will suffer.  There is nothing more natural for a person in financial trouble or who needs money than to approach his local representative. It has often been said that our powers are being eroded and that administration is being centralised more and more.  This is happening in other areas, but I accept the ruling of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that I may not mention other Departments. We find in our constituencies that we have no power.</P>
    <P>It might be difficult for the Minister to explain the decision he is alleged to have made regarding payments.  People down the country who are waiting for their money will feel frustrated.  The Minister should make a statement so that we can <Col N="2134" /> tell them that there has been a misunderstanding and that we are not being used as buffers between the Government and the people and that their money is in safe hands.  There is a lot of uncertainty as regards payments.  There will be no incentive for farmers to develop because the people who borrowed money cannot get the grants they are entitled to.  They depend on the public representatives.  I appeal to the Minister to make a statement saying that what we were told was a misunderstanding and not a lie.  I am not suggesting any one in the civil service would tell a lie or that the Minister told a lie today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to fully clarify this matter.  I go along fully with what Deputies Ryan and O'Brien have said about it being a very important matter and principle.  I also go along with their tribute to the civil service and the service that is provided by Deputies, Senators and public representatives generally.  This is an essential service and I recognise it as such.  I agree fully with what the Deputies said.</P>
      <P>As regards the issue raised this morning and the specific accusation that was made by the Deputies that I, as Minister for Agriculture, had given an instruction that all queries would be dealt with through the Minister's office, there are two Ministers of State at the Department of Agriculture and that means there are three Ministers but it was specifically I, as Minister for Agriculture, who was mentioned.  I knew that what had been said was totally wrong because I had not issued any instruction to any section in the Department about any matter concerning representations by anybody, public representatives, members of the public or whoever.  It is generally recognised, even if I say so myself, that since I went to the Department my office is an open door at any time for anybody with any problem concerning agriculture matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the discussion was progressing Deputy Creed said the Minister was present so I felt I should make my position <Col N="2135" /> clear.  I turned around and saw that the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, was present. I nodded to him to see if he had given any such instruction.  He answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; and I made the statement that I did categorically denying that I or my Minister of State gave any such direction. To come to the kernel of the matter, the pressure that has been on the farm modernisation section in the Department has been enormous in recent months for many reasons&mdash;reasons about uncertainty of grants because of what happened in other areas of grant assistance, tighter credit control and also the fact that many people are completing work much quicker than they did in the past. Due to the pressure on this section and the amount of representations being made, many of them phone calls by Deputies, the Minister of State, Deputy Hussey, who was delegated responsibility for the farm modernisation section, in consultation with the officials in his office and the farm modernisation section, last Thursday, due to the volume of work and to the complaints about delays in getting cheques out to people when they were sanctioned for payment, had an arrangement with&mdash;not a direction&mdash;the staff in his office and those in that section.  Duplication of representations by Deputies and Senators through the Minister's office and again by phone&mdash;I am not saying the Deputies involved here did that but there was a lot of that kind of activity which was a duplication of work&mdash;did not lend itself to achieving the results all of us want to achieve on behalf of farmers, which is paying them as quickly as possible for work which they have done and which has been passed.  To that extent the matter raised, whether it is called an arrangement or direction, did happen.</P>
    <P>This question was raised because, the Deputy said, all representations to the Department concerning applications under the farm modernisation scheme must be processed through the private office of the Minister of State.  No such direction was issued by the responsible Minister of State, Deputy Hussey.  He <Col N="2136" /> mentioned that the duplication of applications from public representatives directly to the Minister's office and the section dealing with the farm modernisation scheme was complicating the system and leading to enormous extra activity.</P>
    <P>Because of the implications involved in such a process and because it was brought to my notice for the first time this morning, the matter was changed and the position has been restored to what we all expect from our very efficient and effective civil service, that is, co-operation on any matter.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I categorically deny what was said this morning&mdash;that I had issued such a direction. On behalf of one Minister of State present, I said he did not issue the direction. The staff of the Minister of State with responsibility for that scheme made this arrangement because of the duplication of queries.  Often public representatives do not have the necessary information to assist the civil servants&mdash;reference numbers and so on&mdash;and this leads to further delays.</P>
    <P>It has always been my ambition that people who are entitled to money under a grant scheme should get it as quickly as possible.  Because of increased activity, the quicker completion of jobs and tighter credit position, people expect to be paid grants much more quickly.  For example, in the last six months this section paid out £32 million.  In the same period last year about £12 or £13 million was paid.  From this Deputies can see that there has been increased activity in this area.  It was because of this build-up of pressure and the wish of all concerned to send out cheques and have proof of payment and receipt by the farmers, that the discussion took place last Thursday,</P>
    <P>Nobody can blame a civil servant for saying it was a ministerial direction when it came from the office of the Minister of State.  I do not think it was intended as such but that is the way it was interpreted.  In no way and under no circumstances would I, as Minister, <Col N="2137" /> direct any section in my Department not to deal with representations from any source&mdash;Deputies, Senators or the general public.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to say that over the last week there was not as much activity as usual in that section because of a decrease in the number of inquiries from public representatives and, as a result, applications are almost up to date and the processing of grants is as we would like it to be.  I want to take this opportunity to tell Deputies what the <Col N="2138" /> present position is and what I hope it will remain.</P>

      <P>My Department have an arrangement with the Dublin Central Mission of the Methodist Church whereby at any one time up to six persons are accommodated in the centre after they have been discharged from prison or from a place of detention either finally or under the supervision of the welfare service of my Department.  A capitation grant, currently at the rate of £41.50 per week, is paid in respect of any such person so accommodated.  The annual payments made so far on this basis are as follows: 1976, £90.00; 1977, £452.00; 1978, £3,122.50; 1979, £3,821.00; 1980&mdash;up to 31 March&mdash;£890.00.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department made a contribution of £10,000 in 1975 towards the capital costs of establishing the centre. Other contributions were made by the Department of Local Government&mdash;as it then was&mdash;Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board.  The welfare service is represented on the management committee of the hostel.</P>
      <P>To complete the picture, I might add that another part of the building is rented by my Department as a day centre and as workshop accommodation for persons who are released from prison or from a place of detention to the supervision of the welfare service.  The day centre is run exclusively by the welfare service.</P>
      <P>Apart from the foregoing, my Department are not involved in the work of the centre.</P>

      <P>Improvement works to Glasnevin Cemetry costing approximately £120,000 have been carried out by Dublin Corporation under the environmental improvement schemes programme in the years 1978 and 1979 on behalf of the Dublin Cemeteries Committee. These works included the making and surfacing of pathways and the general levelling and tidying-up of the cemetery grounds.  These works have to a large extent alleviated the unsatisfactory conditions which prevailed up to 1978 and as far as I am aware no complaints in regard to the state of the cemetery have been received since that year.</P>

      <P>The social welfare officer who investigated the claim of the person concerned has appealed against the decision of the local pension committee to award pension, on the grounds that the claimant's means exceed the statutory limit. The appeals officer will give his decision when my Department have been informed that the deed of transfer of the claimant's holding has been stamped.</P>
      <P>Appeals officers who are the final deciding authority in relation to claims to non-contributory pensions normally require, however, that a deed of transfer of land should be stamped before accepting it for the purpose of a claim.</P>
      <P>In view of the delays which can occur between signing and stamping I am having the administrative procedures examined with a view to determining whether it is possible to expedite such payments.</P>
