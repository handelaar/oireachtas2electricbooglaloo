      <P>Molaim an dara léamh a thabhairt don Bhille seo chun An Foras Náisiúnta um Ard-Oideachas, Baile Átha Cliath, a chur ar bhonn reachtúil.  Is mór an pleisiúr dom an chaoi seo a bheith agam chomh luath i saol an fhorais nua.  Mar is eol don Teach bhí an Foras Náisiúnta i Luimneach faoi lán tseol ar feadh roinnt blianta sul ar ritheadh an Bille ina leith. Ba mhaith liom a rá ag an dtráth seo go bhfuil an Bille nua seo ar aon dul leis an mBille sin.  Phléamar an Bille i leith an Fhorais i Luimneach go mion sa Teach seo agus sa Seanad.  Sna toscaí tá súil agam go mbeidh ar ár gcumas glacadh leis an mBille seo gan an iliomad aithris ar na díospóireachtaí a bhí ann le linn don Bhille faoi Luimneach a bheith á phlé againn.  Na hathruithe a deineadh de thoradh na díospóireachtaí sin, tá a rian le feiceáil ar an mBille seo freisin agus measaim go ritheann sé le réasún go mbeadh na Billí don dá fhoras ar an dul céanna.</P>

    <P>Measaim go mba chóir dom anois cuid bheag de chúlra an scéil a thabhairt i láthair. I 1969 do hiarradh ar an Udarás um Árd Oideachas tairiscint a fuarthas ó Choiste Ghairm Oideachais Bhaile Átha Cliath maidir le bunú coláiste nua Teicneolaíochta agus Tráchtála i mBaile Munna a scrúdú agus moltaí ina leith a chur faoi bhráid an Aire Oideachais, Ins an tuarascáil ón Údarás um Ard-Oideachas, a cuireadh ar fáil i mí na Nollag 1970 moladh go n-aithneófaí an géar-ghá <Col N="907" /> a bhí le níos mó saoráidí oideachais den triú leibhéal i mBaile Átha Cliath, go mór mhór i limistéar na teicneolaíochta. Thaobhuigh an t-Údarás um Ard-Oideachas leis an tairiscint go mbunófaí an coláiste nua i mBaile Munna dá mbeadh na h-údaráis chuí go léir sásta nach raibh suíomh níos lárnaí ar fáil.  Ghlac an tAire Oideachais leis na moltaí seo agus shíolraigh An Foras Náisiúnta um Ard Oideachas i mBaile Átha Cliath as an mbreith sin.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition Government's decisions of 13 December 1974 in relation to higher education included the following in relation to the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin:</P>
    <P>(i)  The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin shall be a recognised college of either of the Dublin universities with the capacity to evolve into a constituent college of one or other of the Dublin universities or to become an autonomous degree-awarding institution.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The majority of the members of the Governing Body of the NIHE Dublin shall be nominated by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Education and shall include representatives from the trade unions, agriculture, business, industry and educational interests.</P>
    <P>(iii)  A Council for Technological Education, later restyled National Council for Educational Awards, shall be established to plan and co-ordinate courses and to validate and award non-degree third-level qualifications in the NIHE Dublin, and other institutions.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin shall be a designated institution for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(v)  The Governing Body of the NIHE Dublin shall consist of 25 members.</P>
    <P>On 5 March 1975 the Government approved a list of names of persons to be <Col N="908" /> invited to act on the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.  An acting director was appointed on 18 June 1975 and the first meeting of the governing body was held on 19 June 1975.  The terms of reference of the governing body include responsibility for the planning, in consultation with my Department, of the form and structure of the institute, the courses and staffing requirements, and all other details of the new institution, and for making recommendations to the Minister for Education consequent on these consultations. The term of office of this <i>ad hoc</i> governing body has been extended until the institute are established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I must record my appreciation of the work of the governing body.  It is a challenging task, but never simple, to oversee the establishment and development of a new institution.  We were fortunate to have a group of people who were generous with their time and expertise.</P>
    <P>On 14 December 1976, the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin was designated by the then Minister for Education as an institution of higher education for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.  A director for the institute was appointed on a permanent basis and took up duty on 21 March 1977.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Education, one of my first actions as Minister was to restore to the National Council for Educational Awards their degree awarding function.  On 18 November 1977, I announced that the NCEA were to be the degree-awarding authority in the case of students who successfully completed degree level courses in the NIHE, Dublin&mdash;and also in the NIHE, Limerick, the Thomond College of Education and the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>In May 1978, the Government decided that the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin would be a third level educational institution offering degree, diploma and certificate courses with a mainly technological bias and that the institute would cater for students in the Dublin area and the country generally. The Government authorised me to negotiate <Col N="909" /> for the acquisition of the site at Ballymun and to invite tenders for the building of phase I of the institute&mdash;a college of commerce capable of accommodating 800 students.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems in establishing a new institution of this type in the Dublin area is the difficulty of obtaining a suitably located site big enough to provide adequately for the requirements of the institution.  The price of land in the Dublin area adds considerably to the cost of the project.  Before finally deciding on the Ballymun site a number of other possible locations were considered.  Either these were too small in area, or they were too far out from the city centre and required vast investment in infrastructure&mdash;roads, water, sewage and other services.  The site at Ballymun was finally decided on as the most feasible site available.</P>
    <P>Renovation work on part of the existing Albert College buildings commenced in January 1980 and has only recently been completed, providing about 3,000 square metres of accommodation.  Work on the new commerce building also commenced in January 1980 and it is expected that the commerce building will be ready for occupation in autumn 1981.</P>
    <P>The commerce building will accommodate 800 students and the renovated part of the Albert College buildings about 200.  The total cost of site purchase, construction works, and equipping these two buildings will be in the region of £6½ million.</P>
    <P>Due to the delay in completing the renovation work at the Albert College buildings, the first group of students will not be admitted to the institute until 11 November 1980.  To compensate for this late opening the institute will continue their summer term into July 1981.</P>
    <P>The demand for places in the institute has been so high that the accommodation is being pushed to the limit and a bigger number of students will be admitted than originally intended with the limited facilities. About 240 students will be admitted to six degree courses&mdash;business studies, accounting and finance, computer applications, communications studies, analytical science and electronic engineering.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> The form of selection of students is based on leaving certificate results plus aptitude tests.  About 55 per cent of students will come from outside Dublin city and county indicating that the institute are national in their appeal.  About 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the students will be mature students, showing the institute's commitment in this area.  The programmes will be practically oriented and the institute will operate a system of monitored industrial placement.  The benefits for all concerned of this type of relevant practical work experience are important. The student gains useful experience and an advance insight into his eventual working environment.  Employers become familiar with the abilities and skills of the institute's graduates and a very valuable feedback is provided between academics and employers on the requirements of industry and on the new and different skills available.</P>
    <P>The role of industrial liaison is most important in any technological institute. The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, are already moving to implement this role in different ways.  In addition to the industrial placement element of courses, the institute are considering part-time courses for industry and business.  They have recently appointed a head of industrial liaison to develop and co-ordinate the institute's interaction with industry.  Many of the senior staff have come direct from industry, some of them being Irish returning from abroad, and industrialists sit on academic selection boards.</P>
    <P>The outline and structure of the courses have already been approved by the National Council for Educational Awards and the first two years&mdash;in some cases the entire four years&mdash;of each programme have been planned in detail by the institute and approved by the council.</P>
    <P>The institute have a firm commitment to new technology, and applied research programmes are being devised.  All staff have a proven record in research and a commitment to the development of research.  The institute have already begun their first research project in the applied physics area with a grant awarded by the National Board for Science and <Col N="911" /> Technology.  This underlines the real commitment of the institute to applied research, a fact which has additional significance in that it has been achieved before the students arrive.  The next phase of buildings will concentrate heavily on the provision of places for technology&mdash;science and engineering&mdash;and will provide 2,700 places.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are identical with the provisions of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, Act 1980, passed by both Houses earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the interpretation of the various terms used in the Bill. Section 2 establishes the institute which shall be known in the Irish language as An Foras Náisiúnta um Ard Oideachas, Baile Átha Cilath, and in the English language as the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.  Section 3 defines what is meant by membership of the institute.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the functions of the institute.  The functions are:</P>
    <P>(a)  to provide degree level courses, diploma level courses and certificate level courses, and, subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, such other courses, including post-graduate courses as may seem appropriate to the governing body;</P>
    <P>(b)  to engage in research in such areas as the governing body may deem appropriate;</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to the approval of the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás</P>
    <P>(i)  to buy and acquire lands or buildings,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to institute, and if thought fit, to award scholarships, prizes and other awards,</P>
    <P>(d)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to maintain, manage, administer and invest all the money and assets of the institute.</P>
    <P>(e)  to accept from donors gifts of land, money, or other property upon such trusts and conditions, if any, as <Col N="912" /> may be specified by the donor, provided always that nothing in any such trust or condition is contrary to the provisions of the Act;</P>
    <P>(f)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to do all such acts and things as may be necessary to further the objects and development of the institute.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the establishment of a governing authority for the institute, to be known as the governing body, and prescribes its structure and functions.  More detailed provisions for the operation of the governing body are set out in the First Schedule.  The governing body is to consist of a chairman, the director and 23 ordinary members.  The chairman and the 23 ordinary members shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister. The manner of appointment of the 23 ordinary members is set out in section 5 (4) and is as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  nine shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with the provisions of section 5 (5) which draws particular attention to the need for adequate representation of industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce and the professions;</P>
    <P>(b)  three shall be appointed who shall be members of the academic staff of the institute who shall be chosen by the academic staff in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(c)  one shall be appointed who is a member of the non-academic staff of the institute chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(d)  two shall be appointed who are full time students of the institute chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(e) three shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staffs of the colleges of technology managed by the <Col N="913" /> City of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee;</P>
    <P>(f)  two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staff of regional technical colleges;</P>
    <P>(g)  two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the management boards of regional technical colleges; and</P>
    <P>(h)  one shall be appointed on the recommendation of the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the functions of the governing body.  The governing body shall manage and control all the affairs and property of the institute and shall perform all the functions conferred on the institute by this Act and shall have all such powers as may be necessary under this Act for this purpose.  The governing body may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as it thinks proper to assist it in such manner as the governing body shall direct and the governing body may assign to any committee so appointed such duties as it thinks fit. The acts of any such committee shall be subject to confirmation by the governing body unless the governing body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a post of chief officer of the institute, to be known as the director.  The Second Schedule sets out the conditions governing the appointment of the director.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the establishment of an academic council for the institute and prescribes the functions of the council.  The academic council acts as specialist advisers to the governing body on academic matters.  Its functions relate to the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the institute.  The membership and terms of office of the academic council are determined by regulations made by the governing body.  Section 8 (3) lists particular functions of the council as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to design, develop and implement <Col N="914" /> appropriate programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(b)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the establishment of appropriate structures to implement such programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(c)  to make recommendations to the governing body on programmes for the development of research;</P>
    <P>(d)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students generally;</P>
    <P>(e)  to make, subject to the approval of the governing body, and to implement the academic regulations of the institute;</P>
    <P>(f)  to propose to the governing body the form of regulations to be made by the governing body for the conduct of examinations and for the evaluation of academic progress;</P>
    <P>(g)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the award of fellowships, scholarships, bursaries, prizes or other awards;</P>
    <P>(h)  to make general arrangements for tutorial or other academic counselling;</P>
    <P>(i)  to exercise other functions, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, which may be delegated to it by the governing body; and</P>
    <P>(j)  to implement any regulations which may be made by the governing body concerning any of the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>With the approval of the governing body, the academic council may establish such and so many committees either consisting wholly or partly of persons who are not members of the institute as it thinks proper to assist the academic council in the performance of its functions and may determine the functions of any committee so established.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the staff serving in the <i>ad hoc</i> institute may be transferred to the service of the statutory body and protects the conditions of service, <Col N="915" /> pay and pension rights of the transferred staff, which will not be any less favourable than the conditions they enjoyed while serving as members of the staff of the <i>ad hoc</i> body.</P>
    <P>Section 11 places responsibility on the institute to prepare and submit to the Minister, as soon as possible after the passing of the Act, a pension scheme for staff.  All provisions of any pension scheme submitted by the institute will be subject to the approval of the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service.  Every approved scheme will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>Section 12 requires the governing body to submit to the Minister annually a report of the work of the institute.  The section also provides that the institute will give the Minister any information about its operation that he may require from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that in each year there shall, in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, be paid by the Higher Education Authority to the institute, out of moneys received by the Authority under section 12 (1) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, a grant or grants or such amount or amounts as the Authority thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Section 14 requires the institute to keep accounts which must be submitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When received by the institute the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be submitted with the accounts to the Minister.  The Minister will lay the accounts before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables the institute to charge fees for admission to courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions or any other event held by the institute or for admission to any event held at the institute.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is the usual provision that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the <Col N="916" /> Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the short title and the commencement date.</P>
    <P>The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, is being established statutorily at an earlier stage of its development than was the corresponding institution, the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  But the era of development since 1972 when the NIHE Limerick first opened its doors has brought the focus strongly to bear on the necessity to establish major institutions of this type.</P>
    <P>Now, an institution like the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, is not merely accepted, but widely welcomed. Its advent could not be more opportune, at a time when manpower requirements show clearly the need for an increase in the supply of trained technologists. The institute will contribute substantially to meeting this demand, with emphasis on the areas of electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, analytical science, biotechnology and computer applications.  The institute completes the integrated, complementary complex in the third-level non-university area, constituted by the RTCs, the Colleges of Technology, the NIHEs and the NCEA.  It will interact with the RTCs in the same way as the National Institute for higher Education, Limerick. The National Council for Educational Awards will have an important co-ordinating role to play in awarding credit for council-approved programmes in the various institutions.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been modelled on the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, Act, 1980, which was discussed in detail in this House earlier this year.  I would, therefore, expect a speedy passage for this Bill.</P>
    <P>Molaim mar sin an Bille don Dáil mar thogra a bhfuil lán-mhuinín agam as ó thaobh leas na tíre agus an oideachais.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have had an in-depth discussion on the NIHE Limerick Bill, 1980 and I have no wish to go over the ground which we covered in that debate, on the Second, Committee, <Col N="917" /> Report or Final Stages.  The Minister knows my views on the Bill and I do not wish to delay the House by repeating them.  The work done on the NIHE Limerick Bill was worth while and resulted in an Act being passed which was far superior to the Bill introduced on the NIHE Limerick.  We did a lot of work on the Bill and we improved it substantially.  The Opposition can take some credit for the improvements which were made to the NIHE Limerick Bill in this House.  We still have the basic differences of philosophy in relation to the NIHE.  I am against restricting the National Institutes for Higher Education, Limerick or Dublin, to getting their awards from the NCEA.  I do not think that monopoly is justified.</P>
      <P>It would be in the interests of third level education if these institutes had the facility to approach the universities or other award-making bodies for their awards, as well as the NCEA.  This would lead to a healthier development of the institutes, to cross-fertilisation of ideas and to a greater degree of mobility between the academic staffs of the universities and the institutes.  There are a number of positive advantages in allowing the institutes to go to other award-making sources for their awards.  I would hope that there would be cross-fertilisation between the academic staffs.  It is very important that there should be and should be seen to be a movement between the two sectors in order to ensure that our standards are maintained and there is a cross-fertilisation of ideas.</P>
      <P>The provision in relation to mobility both horizontal and vertical between the students in the NIHE and RTC sectors is important <i>vis-à-vis</i> our universities as well.  We have not discussed that in depth in the House.  We should state quite clearly that a solid provision must be made for the mobility of students who graduate from the certificate level to diploma level and on to the degree levels in our institutes, our regional colleges and our universities.  It is very important that we should have a policy of open access to our universities from our regional technical colleges and our national institutes for higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> This should be mentioned more than it has been mentioned to date, because it is an important aspect of our developing education policy.</P>
    <P>The composition of the governing body is satisfactory when compared with that in the NIHE, Limerick Bill.  I am pleased that a representative is to be appointed from the governing body of NIHE, Limerick. Section 5 (4) (e) provides:</P>
    <P>three of those members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staffs of the Colleges of Technology managed by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee;</P>
    <P>That is important, as it was in the NIHE, Limerick, Bill where there was a connection between the Thomond College and NIHE Limerick, that NIHE, Dublin, is seen to be co-operating with the colleges of technology and, I would hope, the regional technical colleges in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the role of the Higher Education Authority.  The Minister is trying to by-pass the HEA when it comes to the development of technical and technological education.  I want to state again that I would prefer a comprehensive system of third level education.  The HEA is the best vehicle to achieve that.  I am convinced the composition of the HEA should be expanded to take into account representation from the non-university sector.  Its functions and role should be expanded substantially to ensure the overall development and financing of third level education.  In time that could lead to a unified structure at third level which is both logical and necessary if we are to have a proper development of our third level education sector.</P>
    <P>There is a danger of duplication of courses and resources which must be avoided.  The Minister is very much involved with the RTCs and the other designated institutes come under the HEA.  That is wrong.  It is unnecessary and, in certain circumstances, it may be somewhat wasteful.  This is a basic difference of political philosophy between the Minister and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> The Dublin area is very important in relation to third level education.  Because the demands for third level education have become so apparent, there is a need to declare a crisis in the Dublin area.  The universities do not seem to be able to cope with the increasing numbers seeking places.  The recently announced regional technical colleges for the Dublin area have not been discussed in this House. There was an announcement about the geographical location of some of them, but we got no time plan.  We do not know when they will be built.  It is vitally important that the Minister should take this opportunity to state in the House what positive action he has taken to establish these regional technical colleges in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote briefly from a report of the NIHE, Dublin, entitled &ldquo;Plan for the Physical Development of the Institute, May 1978&rdquo;.  Paragraph 3.2.2 states:</P>
    <P>It is worth nothing that the Institute's Plan projects a need for a minimum additional provision of 9,300 higher education places by 1986 in the Dublin area if Irish participation rates are to match the current European average.</P>
    <P>This Physical Plan suggests that a little over half of these places will be provided by the Institute, the remaining places being provided as suggested in 3.2.1.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3.2.1. states:</P>
    <P>The Governing Body has discussed the matter of the ultimate student population of the Institute.  It is convinced that, in order to retain an overall institutional unity of community and of purpose, it is desirable that its ultimate enrolment should not exceed 5,000 EWTS places.</P>
    <P>In proposing this size it also suggests that desirable participation rates as suggested in its Plan can be achieved through the establishment of Regional Technical Colleges in the Greater Dublin Area.</P>
    <P>Looking at the overall situation in relation to the demand for third level places, it can be safely said in the context of a <Col N="920" /> rising population that the present third level student population of around 37,000 will double by the end of this decade. Therefore, we need forward planning. There is an urgent need for forward planning in the Dublin area to provide these places.  I was pleased to note that the Minister made a statement about the establishment of regional technical colleges in the Dublin area.  I should like him to give serious commitment to matters such as time schedules and finances in connection with the establishment of the RTCs because they are urgently required in the Dublin area.  If something is not done soon, the Minister and the Government will be doing an injustice to people in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to what is popularly known as the Dublin Institute of Technology should be discussed on this Bill.  There appears to be a conflict of opinion between the Minister and the City of Dublin VEC regarding the future of certain courses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;to be run by the vocational committee.  It is important that the position be clarified.  The six colleges of technology under the aegis of the City of Dublin VEC have done very good work in the field of technology during the years.  This should be acknowledged in this House and I acknowledge it without hesitation.  Fine Gael sees the DIT as having a greatly expanded role and they consider it should be given parity of esteem with the NIHE, Dublin.  It should be given the necessary finance and resources to undertake the tasks allocated to it.  Fine Gael would like to see the colleges of technology designated under the HEA Act.  We would support implementation of the proposals contained in the report of the working party on higher technological education in the Dublin area which was produced in 1976. We would transfer certain higher level courses from the Dublin colleges to NIHE, Dublin.  We believe this would be in the best interests of the longer-term development of non-university educational development in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to see the colleges of <Col N="921" /> technology given autonomous structures. We feel that third level colleges are entitled to this.  It would enable them to respond to local needs and to develop an independent policy in relation to their own future.  We consider this a political objective that is worthy of attainment.  I hope the Minister and the City of Dublin VEC will come to satisfactory terms in relation to the transfer of these higher level colleges to the Dublin Institute of Technology and that there will be co-operation between all involved in this area.</P>
    <P>However, we need a higher commitment from the Minister and the Government in relation to the resources being made available in the technological sector. The 1980 budget will not give encouragement to anyone when one takes into account the increase in population and the predictions in relation to demand for places in the university and non-universities sectors.  It should be stated here that the Vote for higher education in the 1980 budget showed reductions in two vital headings.  With regard to the Vote dealing with building grants and capital costs for universities and colleges of designated institutions of higher education, the amount provided in 1980 was £6,210,000 whereas in 1979 the money provided was £6,389,800&mdash;an actual reduction in money terms and a substantial reduction in real terms when one takes into account an inflation rate of the order of 20 per cent.  Another reduction was shown under the subheading dealing with capital grants for furniture and equipment for universities and colleges and for institutions of higher education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Chair not accept that in order to build NIHE, Dublin one needs money and that that comes out of the budget usually?  I am not satisfied that the Minister or the Government are tackling the problem regarding NIHE, Dublin.  Apart from the statement about the proposed establishment of RTCs in the Dublin area, I have not seen any solid planning or time schedules in relation to the establishment of these colleges. That is indicative of the priority of the Government with regard to third level education.  We have nearly a three to one ratio of applicants to places in our universities.  That is a serious state of affairs and is a direct reflection on the failure of the present Government to invest in third level educational institutions. I hope this lack will be made up by the national institutes for higher education, the regional technical colleges and the colleges of technology, but they are bursting at the seams and the Government have not given any indication of an onward investment and expansion programme.</P>
      <P>One matter of particular interest to me is the approach being adopted by the institute in the selection of students which will be based on an assessment of the leaving certificate results plus an aptitude test.  This approach is different from that adopted by the universities which is based on the results of the leaving certificate or matriculation examination alone.  I have stated on a number of occasions in this House that I am against using the leaving certificate by itself as a <i>modus operandi</i> in the selection of students for the universities. The regional technical colleges base their assessment on the results of the leaving certificate plus an aptitude test and an interview and that is a more mature way of selecting candidates.  If research were done on the success or otherwise of the selection policy of the regional technical colleges I am confident it would prove to be a better system than that which obtains in the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard of a number of first-year <Col N="924" /> students who are taking veterinary science or medicine simply because they had enough points to do so and in spite of the fact that when doing their leaving certificate they did not have either of these careers in mind.  This seems an extraordinary way to decide on a career. Others with fewer points who might have wished to study veterinary science or medicine have had to content themselves with taking arts, commerce, social science or law.  We have a new system of deciding careers based on the points system and it is not the most acceptable way of selecting students for universities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the way the NIHE, Dublin, is evolving.  It will be a very important force in the development of technological education and professional expertise.  I note that they have appointed an industrial liaison officer and they poached a head of department from the regional technical college in Waterford to fill this vacancy.  It was a very good selection.  This is an important development and will allow the institute to have expertise in its relationship with industry. In general I am rather pleased with the quality of the staff who have been recruited to the institute and I wish them well in their pioneering efforts.</P>
    <P>I am sorry there was a delay in the building of phase one but I am pleased to note that the institute will continue its summer term into July 1981.  This is the kind of flexibility I like to see in such circumstances.  It is felt that the optimum student population should be 5,000 and I am pleased that full development of the institute should be completed by 1988. At least the institute have established a time-scale and I hope the Government will be able to match it by ensuring that the facilities will be made available to bring the institute to full standing and full capability in relation to student intake.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the next phase of building would concentrate heavily on the provision of places for technology and would provide 2,700 places.  He did not state when the building of phase two would commence or the stage of planning it has reached at present.  Can we expect that building will commence in 1981 or <Col N="925" /> will there be an interminable delay in the building of this highly important phase?</P>
    <P>I do not feel any need to go into the various sections of the Bill because we already did so when dealing with the Limerick institute.  However, one change is introduced in section 8 (3)(d) which states:</P>
    <P>to make recommendations to the Governing Body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students generally.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; has been introduced in this Bill and was not contained in the Limerick Bill.  I wonder if there is any particular significance in the use of this word.  Has some responsibility been taken by the governing body in relation to this matter without reference to the academic council?  Perhaps the Minister would comment.</P>
    <P>I wish every success to the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin. It has a commitment from this party but it needs above all a commitment from the party in power to ensure that the resources and funds will be made available for its speedy development.  That development should take place between now and 1988 on a planned, phased basis and without any hindrance or faltering in any of those years by the Government in office.  I wish the director, Dr. O'Hare, and the staff of the college good luck in their pioneering work.  I feel sure that the future of the institute is assured not only because of its present staff but because of the type of educational pioneering work it is involved in and that work is vital to the future of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the Bill in broad outline and also welcome, on the first occasion that we have had an opportunity to do so in this House, the <i>ad hoc</i> establishment of the NIHE Dublin and the valuable work which its director and staff are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that I would like to point briefly to a couple of difficulties that arise in relation to the Bill.  We are presented with a Bill for the establishment of a national institute for higher education in <Col N="926" /> Dublin but the institute which is being created by this Bill is somewhat inadequately anchored either by the terms of the Bill or indeed by the Minister's speech.  In its overall educational and indeed political context it is somewhat like Mohammed's coffin, suspended between Heaven and earth without any visible means of support.  I would like to have heard the Minister pay more attention&mdash;and perhaps he can do this when replying&mdash;to two aspects of the proposed national institute's existence and development.</P>
    <P>The first of these is its relationship with the regional technical colleges in general and the proposed new regional technical colleges in Dublin in particular.  If it is to follow the general outline set by the NIHE in Limerick it is fairly evident that this relationship will be crucial to its success. So we need to know and we need to know now, and certainly I imagine those involved in the development of the institute need to know now in more detail than they or we or anybody else at the moment know, precisely what the Government's policy is in relation to the establishment of such subsidiary institutions upon which the NIHE will depend for many aspects of its intake and for its success.</P>
    <P>The second area which is grey at the moment&mdash;and it is not unrelated to the first one&mdash;is the relationship between the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin and any or all of the institutions which are at present organised and run by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  In an interjection to Deputy Collins earlier on in the debate the Minister said that there was absolutely no objection from the City of Dublin VEC to the establishment of the institute or to any courses that the institute might be running, if I heard him correctly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I said that there was no conflict between what the Minister is doing or saying and what the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept what the Minister <Col N="927" /> says.  The Minister says there is no conflict between what he is saying or what he is doing and what the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee are doing.  On the other hand, anybody in this House with any experience of politics in general and of institutional politics in particular will know that the prospect of tension, to put it no more strongly than that, between this new institution and existing institutions is a very real one.  They will know also that the Minister as the man who holds the purse strings, especially in this highly expensive area of education, has an overall responsibility to ensure that any differences of opinion are minimised, that a conflict is not allowed to develop.  They will know too that if the success of the City of Dublin NIHE were to depend on the financial strangulation of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee colleges then the cost of that victory in terms of goodwill, in terms of co-operation, in terms of the necessary development of third level and technological education in this city might well have been too high.</P>
      <P>There is more hinted at than said in this debate at the moment and I am not talking just about the debate in this House but about the debate on the development of higher education in Dublin which is taking place outside this House. The committee itself holds its own counsel by and large and so does the Minister. But we would appreciate in the House more frankness from the Minister on the difficulties which he sees arising in this area and on the ways that he would like to approach some of them because difficulties there will be.  At the very least there will be difficulties involving the possible duplication of courses and facilities. It could be argued that the possibility of duplication of courses and facilities is slight and that we need, as report after report has pointed out, more technological places at upper second level and third level.  But it is one thing to provide more technological places at third level and another entirely to ensure that they are not simply in duplication of existing technological places in other institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The degree of co-ordination and co-operation <Col N="928" /> that is going to be demanded of all third level institutions in the future is going to be greater rather than less than it has been in the past.  Knowing what I do of third level institutions I am not sanguine about the possibilities for such co-operation at the best of times.  At the worst of times, when institutions are being either ignored or goaded into some particular course of action or having the financial tourniquets applied with more vigour than sophistication, the possibility of co-operation and co-ordination becomes more remote, and if the Minister does not want to get involved in a running battle involving the NIHE Dublin and other institutions in the city he will really have to do more groundwork than has been evident to date and certainly than has been evident in his speech.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of the new institute which deserve comment, positive in some areas and interrogative in others.  The Minister has stated, and we must all agree, that anything which is called a national institute of higher education must have a national role.  It must have a national role in relation to the kind of courses it provides and it must have a national role in relation to the intake of students.  In this context the Minister's statistics are very interesting.</P>
    <P>He says first of all that something like 55 per cent of the earlier applicants for places in the college come from outside the Dublin city and county area.  In the second place he says that admission to courses is by means of leaving certificate results plus an aptitude test.  We would be very interested to know in this House the degree to which, if at all, geographical origin is taken as any kind of an indicator of the suitability or otherwise of a candidate for a place in the college.  I would doubt it but certainly it would be interesting to find out whether the ratio of those non-Dublin city and county students accepted for places was roughly equivalent to the ratio of the total number of applicants.  Of course we are talking in terms of successful applicants of very small numbers.  But there will be a tension certainly in relation to a new institute located in Dublin, given the overwhelming pressure on technological <Col N="929" /> courses in Dublin from students in the Dublin city and county area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins talked about the pressure on university places.  To the best of my knowledge the pressure on some of the technological places in Dublin leaves some of the universities absolutely standing. The Minister is probably well aware of the fact that the opening of the doors of a new technological institution in Dublin will be greeted by many Dublin parents and young adults with a delight which may be somewhat temporary when they discover it is expected to serve a national role in terms of the students it admits as well as in terms of the courses it provides.  Basically that pressure will continue to exist until the Dublin RTCs are really off the ground and, if I may mix my metaphors, in full production. But, looking ahead, I can foresee some of that pressure coming to rest on the broad, capable shoulders of public representatives in the Dublin area from parents whose offspring have been, as they feel, unfairly denied a place in the new national institute.  I have never sought to interfere nor would I in the admission procedures of any such institute.  I am laying down a marker in that respect now if any parents should happen to read this debate.</P>
    <P>The other things I wanted to say about this Bill and institute have slightly wider import.  I note two things in relation to what the Minister has said.  First of all, that the institute has a firm commitment to new technology; secondly, that it has apparently an equally firm commitment to the principle of industrial liaison.  I do not think that these two aspects of the institute's work and the problems they raise can be exaggerated.  In relation to the new technology and to technology in general I believe we are facing a major cross-route in our economic and industrial life.  The development of new technology offers this country, as it offers many others, the prospect of substantially enhancing the wealth-producing capacity of our work force and of our economy.  At the same time, if it is badly handled, inexpertly handled, if it is crudely handled and, above all, if it is handled ovewhelmingly by greedy people <Col N="930" /> rather than by people with a concern for the whole community, one of its major visible effects will be a further reduction in employment, certainly an increase in unemployment.  I would hope&mdash;I have argued this case with the Minister from time to time and I do not think he is basically hostile to what I am saying&mdash;that the new institute's commitment to the new technology is not a blind commitment to new technology at any price; nor on the other hand should it be any kind of a Luddite attitude.  I think it is often forgotten in relation to the Luddites that, when they broke up the machines, they did not do so because they disliked machines but rather they broke up the machines because the improved productivity for which those machines were responsible did not reach them in any real increase in the wages they were entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>I should like to see in the institute, and in all institutions of this kind, a commitment to technology going hand in hand with a political&mdash;and I use the word with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo;: polis, city, people, the community&mdash;commitment to examining the effects of new technology and indeed the distribution of the wealth created by new technology.</P>
    <P>The other point to which I have just referred is the question of industrial liaison. Again it is not unrelated to the first point because I would hope, certainly, that when the institute embarks on its industrial liaison programmes it does not send out its students, nor indeed its staff, to industry whether public or private&mdash;and I hope that public industry will be included just as much as private&mdash;in the spirit of sending out neophytes who have something to receive only and nothing to give.  If industry, public and private, is to benefit from the establishment of the institute, if the institute itself is to benefit from the industrial liaison procedures it is already setting up, then the relationship between the institute and industry will have to be a two-way one.  Industry will have to accept that the law of the jungle is not necessarily the law of progress for this or any other community, just as the institute will have to accept that drawbridges have to be <Col N="931" /> built out from every educational potential ivory tower.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the small print of the Bill bears the marks of the very extended discussion we had on the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, Bill earlier in the year.  From that point of view, I certainly do not anticipate the Bill causing us any major problem in procedural terms.  But I should like to hear the Minister, when he replies, refer in rather more detail than he has done to date to the points I have mentioned in my speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>: First of all I want to thank the education spokesmen from the Opposition for their contributions.  Remarks were made that, through working together on the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, Bill, we came out with an improved Bill which was subsequently enacted.  At the time I am on record in this House as having thanked the Deputies opposite for their contribution and for making this possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take up the points made by Deputy Collins, for a start, the Deputy pointed out that he thought that the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, should have more than one assessment and award-making body involved in the institute.  I am on record in this House&mdash;and have given reasons for it&mdash;as being totally opposed to that position. Apart from anything else, getting a new technological institute under way and burdening it with more than one award-making body would seem calculated to induce educational schizophrenia, with students looking everywhere in so far as their qualifications were concerned and not being able to concentrate on getting a line on the particular method of assessment and the handling and developing of their subjects.  The House knows very well that during the traumatic period when the universities were involved perforce, not of their own free will, in this whole area there were misunderstandings, suspicious and attacks. Perhaps, in fact, what was really happening was due to the different ethos of the <Col N="932" /> university system from that which we were seeking to develop in these technological institutions.</P>
    <P>I am at one with Deputy Collins on the question of mobility, both vertical and horizontal.  Some of Deputy Horgan's remarks relate here as well, in that he wanted something said in regard to the relationship between the new RTCs in Dublin and the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin.  The whole idea in developing its own ethos for this area of education was that it should not be hidebound by any of the traditions of the third level non-technological or the university area.  The basic idea was that a student could pursue his or her course at the regional technical colleges to a certain grade or degree&mdash;two, three, four years&mdash;and have vertical mobility in so far as the national institutes were concerned. That is still our purpose.  With regard to horizontal mobility, the idea was that there should be mobility between the regional technical colleges themselves and between the regional technical colleges and the national institutes and in many cases there is already a certain accommodation for horizontal and vertical mobility with some of the universities or university colleges.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the allocation of three places from the colleges of technology which are under the aegis of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee finds favour with Deputy Collins. Both the national institute and the colleges themselves will benefit by this. I cannot accept Deputy Collin's point regarding the Higher Education Authority. This Bill in no way seeks to by-pass the Higher Education Authority.  In fact, as I said in my opening speech on section 13, the very important role of this Authority in relation to the institute is outlined.  The Deputy's reference to the new RTCs is highly relevant in that they will be feeding into the national institute and be building the technological foundations. The House knows that the decision has been made with regard to these four.  The exact location and provision of sites are under consideration at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to the ratio or <Col N="933" /> percentage of participation.  I think he was quoting from the plan for the development of the institute.  I am in total agreement that there is a need to keep in step with Europe, percentagewise.  One <i>caveat</i> that I should like to enter is that when we are giving statistics about Europe, very often we are giving the wrong type of statistics.  Many students of the technological colleges spend as many as seven or eight years before graduation and when we are counting Europe, we are counting them.  I have put it on record before in this House that we are in too much of a hurry out of all our educational institutions, that we are into the third level too quickly and very ambitious to get out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;at a very young age. When, with the present secretary of the Department of Education, I visited Eindhoven, The Netherlands, we discovered that the course was a five year one but that six-and-a-half years was the average time spent before graduation by the students in that institution.  When we are giving statistics in age groupings and comparing with European statistics, we should be very careful that we are comparing like with like.  Very often we are not so doing.</P>
      <P>The reference to any conflict between the Minister for Education and the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee puzzles me completely.  There is no such conflict.  Time and time again, whenever given the opportunity, I have paid tribute to the&mdash;I think magnificent is not too strong a word&mdash;work that the City of Dublin Vocational Education Technological Colleges have done.  They were alone in the field at that advanced level for a very long time and were working under disadvantages.  I see an increasing role for them in technological education and I shall return to that point again.  Far from there being any conflict, we want all their expertise and experience for the development of technological education throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same or a similar point was made by Deputy Horgan, which he answered <Col N="934" /> himself.  The demand for technological places is very high indeed.  He said that in many areas the university problem is child's play compared with the problem of the technological colleges.  In these circumstances, I cannot see how there is, or can be, any duplication.  If there are so many looking for places on electronics or mechanical engineering courses with many being turned away, all I can say is that I would love if we had reached the stage when one would be run down at the expense of the other or, to put it another way, if the problem were that we had so many places that technological institutions were in conflict with each other trying to get customers, then I should be happy indeed.  I cannot see that happening, even in ten years' time.  I, therefore, see it as an obligation on me, as Minister, and on the committees charged in this area with responsibility for developing technological education, to provide as many places as we possibly can.  The House will agree that the Government have been very successful in the development in recent years of the chemical and the electronics industries.  There is a grave obligation that this arm of the Government should not let down the other arm of the Government in this regard. There is an obligation on us to expand technological education and the provision of places along these lines in these areas, so that we can develop both industrially and educationally, as we must do if we are to survive.</P>
    <P>I thought I would get a compliment from Deputy Collins on the speed with which we have developed the NIHE in Dublin so far.  We had to provide a site which cost far too much.  In my innocence I had thought that I would get the site cheaper from Dublin Corporation but they must have had a reasonable profit on it.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Horgan and his flight of fancy about Mohammed's coffin midway between heaven and earth, I assure the Deputy that we have given the NIHE in Dublin a local habitation and an aim.  It is firmly anchored in Ballymun in the old Albert College and there is no doubt about what it stands for either in its physical location or its philosophical <Col N="935" /> location in our educational system.  I referred in passing to its relationship to the RTCs.  In referring to it, both Deputies put their fingers on a very important aspect of the institute in Dublin, as in Limerick, in that it should relate closely to the RTCs.  I do not agree with Deputy Horgan that the RTCs are necessarily subsidiary institutions, because by their definition they are institutions in their own right.  As far as developing the courses taken at the RTCs is concerned, they can be leads into the national institute. Deputy Horgan was also concerned about the technological colleges under the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The Deputy more or less answered himself in saying that the need was so great that we had to develop more places.  It would be crazy to allow any hostility to arise between the technological colleges and the national institutions seeing that the need is so great for development in this field.  Perhaps in ten years' time if we continue to develop we will have a different situation, but now what we really need is more places in the technological field.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan emphasised the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; and talked about the national role.  I do not read much significance into the question of statistics as to where students are from.  That reference was included in my speech to indicate that, although it is called The National Institute for Higher Education Dublin, people who are not from Dublin are not necessarily excluded.  The courses have to be national and must be thought of in the context, that I have already referred to, of the very great development particularly in electronics and the chemical industries in recent years.  The statistics stand up as being among the highest in the world, which illustrates our success in attracting this type of industry.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with what Deputy Horgan said when he indicated that he thought we were at a major crossroads in our development and that this new technology will play an important role in enhancing our wealth-producing ability.  I also agree that there will be social problems connected with it.  The Deputy referred <Col N="936" /> to the Luddites in the past as adopting a certain attitude not because they hated machinery but because of the increase in production which deprived them of their own ways of making a living.  There will be a serious social dimension to this development and in developing our technology courses <i>pari passu</i> we will have to be more than careful about the social aspects.  We have in the world at the moment serious problems arising from the micro developments.  The House is aware that one of the most prestigious newspapers in the world in a neighbouring country is in danger because of inability to solve the social and industrial problems that arise from development. We will have more and more of that. Therefore, it is important that our technological education should be developed and that the general public as well as those who will spécialise in the colleges should know what is happening and should know the social implications of it. Lack of knowledge often induces fear.  If our technology is properly developed we will dispel fears and we will be in a position to help those who are framing social policies to meet this type of technological development.</P>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Horgan said about industrial liaison aspects, the experience in Limerick, and in many of the continental technological institutions as well, would bear out the contention that both industry and the educational institute benefit by this process.  It adds a necessart dimension to the educational institution side of things and to the industrial side.  Sometimes if we are over involved in the educational sector we might be inclined to imagine that industry only needed to learn.  It is true that the educational institution is also in the business of learning about industry.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there was any significance when Deputy Horgan spoke about a drawbridge rather than a bridge as between the institution and the industry. Drawbridges can be drawn up.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and their assurance of help in getting the Bill through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I object to paragraph 6, page 11 where it states:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Governing Body&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann or for election to either House of the Oireachtas, or is nominated for election to, or is appointed to be a representative in, the Assembly of the European Communities,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that should be in the Bill. I said this on the Limerick Bill.  I think it is adequately covered in (b) (i) and (ii) in lines 25 <i>et al</i>, where if a person is entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein or if he is for the time being a representative in the Assembly of the European Communities he shall not be eligible to be a member of the governing body.  The distinction is that if a person is elected or appointed he should not be eligible to be a member of the governing body.  That is fair enough although I do not see anything wrong with being a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities <Col N="942" /> and being a member of the institute but certainly where a man is only nominated to be a candidate or to contest an election I do not think that it should automatically debar him from membership of the governing body.  That is too harsh, as I said in the case of the Limerick Bill.  I repeat that here.  I do not think the nomination to contest an election should debar somebody from being a member of the governing body whatever about being a Member of a House of Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is a point that we have all talked about and we recognise that there are arguments on both sides. Would the Minister think, not necessarily in relation to this Bill but possibly in relation to an amending Bill, that the point might be met by requiring that persons who are nominated for election should not, between the period of nomination and the election, attend meetings of the governing body so as to avoid any charge of conflict of interest that might arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: As Deputies have said, this is a knotty problem that arises regularly. I must confess that when I was in Opposition I expressed much the same sentiments as Deputy Collins now expresses.  We did make one advance. The original intention was to exclude staff members from standing for the Houses of the Oireachtas or the Assembly of the European Communities.  That original intention has been changed.  I think that &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; as a Member of Seanad Éireann refers to those Senators who are nominated rather than elected. That is the significance of the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; there.  The whole idea of being able to attend to the duties of the governing body and be a fully involved member of the Assembly of the European Communities seems to be an impossible one. The improvement that has been made in this part of the Schedule is as far as I can go at the moment.</P>

    <P>shall disclose to the Governing Body ...</P>
    <P>Would it not be a better <i>modus operandi</i> in this area if members of the governing body were to declare in writing directorships, shareholdings and so on as we are supposed to do in the Dáil?  Would that not make their commitment to impartiality stronger?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

The important thing is the obligation imposed in paragraph 7 (1), the actual disclosing of the interest, and the obligation not to take part in any deliberations or decisions in relation to a contract.  The whole business has to be recorded in the minutes of the governing body so that there is a written element in it.  This should meet the Deputy's point.</P>

      <P>Is é seo an tríú hinstitiúid nua oideachais den tríú leibhéal a raibh sé de chúram orm a bhunú ar bhonn reachtúil, agus ar mhórán bealach is é an institiúid is mó tábhacht díobh go léir.</P>
      <P>Is annamh an deis a bheith ann chun coláiste oideachais nua a bhunú do mhúinteoirí. Tá bunú coláiste den saghas seo níos neamhchoitianta fós sa mhéid go bhfuil na saoráidí atá ag teastáil le haghaidh traenála i scileanna praiticiúla agus fisiciúla chomh ilchasta agus chomh costasach sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá na saoráidí sa choláiste seo, laistigh <Col N="945" /> agus lasmuigh, go hinmholta.  Tá an bhéim ar na scileanna praiticiúla chomh maith leis na scileanna teoiriciúla.  Go dtí seo reachtáileadh na cúrsaí traenála do mhúinteorí i scileanna praiticiúla agus teoiriciúla in ionaid éagsúla, roinnt mhaith díobh in ionaid shealadacha.  Go deimhin fuair an-chuid múinteorí oiliúint shár-mhaith amach sna cúrsaí sin ach de ghnáth ní raibh caighdeán na saoráidí a bhí ann sách árd chun múinteoirí a oiliúint a mbeadh sé de chúram orthu saoránaigh an Stáit a thraenáil don saol atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Is institiúid náisiúnta é Coláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan agus líonann sé bearna fadthréimhseach in ár gcóras oiliúna do mhúinteoirí agus soláthraíonn sé scoth na saoráidí chun múinteoirí a oiliúint i réimsí áirithe saineolaíochta.</P>
    <P>Bhí a lán daoine le fada an lá den tuairim gur chóir coláiste a bheidh ann le múinteoirí a thraenáil sna réimsí nach raibh leagan buan traenála orthu.  Mar sin féin tháinig an socrú faoi bhunú na hinstitiúide go dtugtar Coláiste Coláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan air anois ó dhá fhoinse.</P>
    <P>Sa chéad áit, i 1969 d'órdaigh an tAire Oideachais go gcuirfí tuarascáil faoi mhú-inteoirí a oiliúint i gcorpoideachas in Éirinn ar fáil mar go raibh imní air gur deineadh faillí sa ghnó seo le tamall anuas.  Mhol an tuarascáil go mbunófaí coláiste chun fir óga agus mná óga a oiliúint mar mhúinteoirí corpoideachais.</P>
    <P>Sa dara háit, chuir an t-Udarás um Ard Oideachas tuarascáil ar fáil i 1970 faoi thraenáil múinteorí, in ar moladh go soláthrófaí na cúrsaí traenála do mhúinteoirí ábhar speisialta in institiúid amháin, agus go reachtálfaí na cúrsaí seo i Luimneach.</P>
    <P>Thángathas ar dhá shochrú.  I dtosach socraíodh go mbunófaí coláiste corpoideachais i Luimneach.  Ceannaíodh suíomh ar bhruacha na Sionna in aice an ionaid ina mbeadh an Foras Náisiúnta um Árd-Oideachas.  Thosaigh an obair ar an bhfoirgneamh&mdash;an chéad choláiste oiliúna sna hoileáin seo chun múinteoirí corpoideachais a oiliúint a tógáladh go speisialta le haghaidh an ghnó seo.</P>
    <P>Ag an am chéanna bhíothas ag smaoineamh ar institiúid a bhunú chun múinteoirí <Col N="946" /> ábhar speisialta a oiliúint agus i 1974 shocraigh an Rialtas go gcuirfí an dá institiúid le haghaidh múinteoirí a oiliúint le chéile i Luimneach ar an suíomh céanna faoi aon bhord stiúrtha amháin agus go dtabharfaí an Coláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan mar ainm ar an institiúid nua.</P>
    <P>Bhí tosú an Choláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan chomh teoranta san go raibh sé deacair d'aoinne ag an am a shamhlú go mbéadh sé ag borradh agus ag fás mar atá sé anois&mdash;coláiste nuaaoiseach oiliúna do mhúinteoirí, a sholáthraíonn cúrsaí oiliúna i gceithre réims í agus go bhfuil sé i gceist níos mó cúrsaí a phleanáil i 1981 agus sna blianta atá romhainn.  Ní raibh ach roinnt scoláirí i gcúpla seomra i Luimneach a bhí ar chíos nuair a thosaigh an chéad bhliain den chúrsa cheithre mblian.  Úsáideadh an táras gleacaíochta agus na saoráidí spóirt a bhí ag an gColáiste Réigiúnda Teicneolaíochta i dTrá Lí&mdash;a bhuíochas sin do Choiste Ghairm-Oideachais Thrá Lí.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh sé furasta do na mic léinn na dá gcuid múinteoirí.  Ach taobh istigh de bhliain tháinig grúpaí mac léinn eile a bhí tar éis an chéad chuid dá gcuid traenála a chríochnú in institiúidí eile.</P>
    <P>Nuair d'athraigh na grúpaí seo chuig an suíomh ag Plassy ní raibh ach na saoráidí gleacaíochta a bhain leis an bhfoirgneamh nua críochnaithe agus fuaireadar na céad léachtaí i bhfoirgnimh réamhdhéanta a sholáthraigh mo Roinn dóibh.</P>
    <P>Ainneoin go raibh an tús teoranta, d'fhás an coláiste bliain i ndiaidh bliana agus tá sé fós ag fás.  I 1975 tháinig na céad chéimithe amach as an gcoláiste. Bhronn an Chomhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais na céimeanna san.  I 1976 agus 1977 ba é Oilscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann a bhronn na céimeanna san, agus ó 1978 i leith bronnadh iad ag an gComhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Tá na cáilíochtaí seo ar aon chéim i gcaighdeán agus i stádas leis na cinn a bhronntar ag Ollscoil ar bith.  I 1978 tosnaíodh ar an dara céim i dtógáil an Choláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan. Arís, is foirgneamh é seo atá beartaithe go speisialta chun múinteoirí a oiliúint i réimsí speisialta, adhmadóireacht, miotalóireacht, <Col N="947" /> tuatheolaíocht agus tráchtáil. Críochnaíodh an foirgneamh i samhradh na bliana 1979, agus i bhfómhar na bliana sin cláraíodh mic léinn den chéad uair in adhmadóireacht, miotalóireacht agus tuatheolaíocht.</P>
    <P>Is suimiúil an scéal é forbairt an Choláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan mar ionad chun múinteoirí speisialta a oiliúint.</P>
    <P>A college for training teachers of physical education was first conceived in 1969 by my predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, when he requested Captain Michael MacDonagh, Inspector of Physical Education at the Department of Education and Dr. John Kane, then Head of Physical Education, St. Mary's College, Strawberry Hill, now Professor of Physical Education at Loughborough College of Education, to prepare a paper on the training of physical education teachers in the Republic of Ireland.  At that time, two colleges, St. Raphael's (Sion Hill) and Ling College, were engaged in the training of women physical education teachers but there were no facilities within the state for the training of men as physical education teachers.  There was no established national standard of qualification.</P>
    <P>In their paper Captain MacDonagh and Dr. Kane suggested that a new college be set up for the training of men and women teachers.  Conscious of the growing recognition of the importance of physical education in the curriculum, the Minister accepted this recommendation in principle and the decision was taken to establish a national college of physical education at Limerick.</P>
    <P>A site of approximately 54 acres was purchased at Plassey, Castletroy, adjoining the site of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  A programme was organised whereby groups of young men would start their course at St. Mary's Strawberry Hill from 1969.  In 1972 young women who had taken an initial year of training at St. Raphael's and Ling joined the Strawberry Hill group.  When the National College of Physical Education opened in 1973, all these students were transferred to Limerick <Col N="948" /> from Strawberry Hill to complete their courses and to graduate from Limerick. A board of management was appointed to plan and oversee the development of the new college, and an acting director was appointed on 1 September 1973 for a three-year period.</P>
    <P>The specially designed facilities available in the physical education building&mdash;the first purpose-built physical education college in these islands &mdash;compare favourably with any physical education college in Great Britain or in Europe.  The following indoor facilities are available: a large sports hall 36 × 24 metres, a fully equipped gymnasium 24 metres × 12 metres, four squash courts; a 33 metre, six lane swimming pool; diving pit with one metre and three metre diving boards, dance studio. The building also contains a lecture theatre capable of seating 150, lecture rooms, reading rooms, seminar rooms, laboratories, administrative offices and student common room.  As to outdoor facilities, the college is situated a matter of yards from the Shannon, which is used for many water activities such as canoeing. Lough Derg is upstream for sailing activities.  There is an all-weather play area 70 × 100 metres, five outdoor tennis courts and an eight-lane international size athletic track.  An additional 35 acres adjoining is being purchased and in all nine playing pitches, of which five are of top quality, and three practice areas are provided.</P>
    <P>The physical education course aims to produce highly specialist teachers of physical education who are in addition able to teach another area of the school curriculum competently to leaving certificate level.  The course, therefore, consists basically of four elements&mdash; physical education studies&mdash;theory and practice&mdash;elective subject, pedagogics and teaching practice.</P>
    <P>Concurrent with the proposals for the development of the training programme for teachers of physical education, the Report on Teacher Education, published by the Higher Education Authority in September, 1970, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that courses for the training of teachers of specialist subjects should be concentrated <Col N="949" /> in a single institution and centred in the Limerick Institute for Higher Education, which was not then established.  In 1972, the Minister for Education, Deputy Pádraig Faulkner, informed the Government that it was the intention that the National College of Physical Education would be an independent college pending a decision on the siting of the centre for the specialist teacher training courses which were conducted by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In May 1973 approval in principle was given for the provision of a single institution for the training of teachers of specialist subjects, which was to be treated as an additional phase of the college for training teachers of physical education, and it was decided to seek a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&mdash;World Bank &mdash;for the construction and equipping of the institution.  The World Bank subsequently approved the application for a loan and the work of construction of the second phase of Thomond College was completed in January 1979.</P>
    <P>The Government's decisions of 13 December 1974 on higher education included the following in relation to the College of Education for Teachers of Specialist Subjects at Limerick and the National College of Physical Education:</P>
    <P>the College of Education for Teachers of Specialist Subjects, Limerick, and the National College of Physical Education, shall have a Joint Governing Body of twenty-five members, and shall be a recognised college of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On 5 November 1976 the Government approved the title &ldquo;Thomond College of Education&rdquo; for the institution for which the joint governing body would have responsibility.  On the same date the Government approved a list of names of persons who should be invited to act on the governing body of Thomond College of Education, and the first meeting of the governing body was held on 8 March 1976.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work of the board of management who had all the headaches of getting the College of Physical Education off the ground, and <Col N="950" /> also to the <i>ad hoc</i> governing body which has been responsible for the affairs of Thomond College since 1975 and whose term of office has been extended until the college is established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>A director for the college was appointed on a permanent basis and took up duty on 1 September 1976.</P>
    <P>As an exceptional matter, the National Council for Educational Awards was authorised to be the degree-awarding body for Thomond College of Education, then the National College of Physical Education, in 1975.  The college was granted recognised college status by the National University of Ireland in 1976 and the university was the degree-awarding authority for students of the college who graduated in 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, when I became Minister for Education one of my first actions as Minister was to restore to the National Council for Educational Awards its degree-awarding function.  On 18 November 1977 I announced that the NCEA was to be the degree-awarding authority in the case of students who successfully completed degree-level courses in Thomond College of Education.</P>
    <P>The first groups of leaving certificate students for the courses in general and rural science, metalwork and engineering science, and woodwork and building science enrolled at Thomond College in autumn 1979 for the first year of four-year degree level courses.  The National Council for Educational Awards will be the degree-awarding body for these courses.  Two of these groups, the metalwork and woodwork students, going into their second year in autumn 1980, have been joined by two groups of students with a training in trade in the appropriate skills.  The students with a trade background hold senior trade certificates, have completed a full statutory apprenticeship and have undergone comprehensive written and practical examinations, oral examinations in Irish and English and a searching interview before being selected.  They have been exempted from the first year of the course and will be paid a weekly maintenance allowance during their period of training.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> A one-year course for training graduates as teachers of commercial subjects will commence at Thomond College in autumn 1981.  Thomond College will also provide in-service courses for teachers in areas such as educational management, adult education, remedial education and educational technology.</P>
    <P>Student-teachers of all specialties have common core-areas of study&mdash;pedagogics, education theory, teaching practice; and core subjects &mdash;English, Irish and Mathematics. Through the National Council for Educational Awards a consistency of standards and a central examination system is achieved.</P>
    <P>Ní misde do gach scoláire tréimhse éifeachtach a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht fhaid atá sé ag freastail ar an choláiste ionas go bhfaighidh sé oilteacht agus líofacht sa Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the college is an attractive building designed to be in conformity with the all-over campus development plan.  Approximately 6,000 square metres of additional accommodation have been provided in this phase. There are three lecture theatres, each capable of seating 100, nine classrooms, ten laboratories, and workshops, four drawing rooms, an educational technology suite incorporating a laboratory, a workshop and a teaching resources centre, a business machines room, an audio-typewriting room, social areas, staff common room and staff and administrative offices.</P>
    <P>A further 30 acres of land will be purchased in 1981 to accommodate the outdoor requirements of the rural science course, so that the total area of land available for the use of the college will be in the region of 120 acres.</P>
    <P>One of the unique features of the college is the amount of outdoor teaching space required to mount the physical education and rural science courses.  I have outlined earlier the outdoor facilities required for physical education.  For the rural science programme it will be necessary to provide for trees and shrubs, fruit trees, bush fruits, soft fruits, kitchen garden, flower garden, lawns, bee-keeping, <Col N="952" /> nursery plots, museum plots, transplant plots, experimental plots, glass houses, small animal house, crop plants, farm animals, animal buildings, food storage space, manure compost, and so on.  It is also necessary to provide for rotation of crops.</P>
    <P>In the current academic year, 283 students have been enrolled at the college. The total planned capacity of the present buildings is approximately 800 students.</P>
    <P>I now propose to summarise the main provisions of the Bill as it has been presented.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the interpretation of the various terms used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 establishes the college which shall be known in the Irish language as Coláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan, Luimneach, and in the English language as Thomond College of Education, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Section 3 defines what is meant by membership if the college.</P>
    <P>The functions of the college, set out in section 4, indicate its special purpose. The functions are:</P>
    <P>(a)  to provide suitable degree-level courses for the purpose of the training of teachers for service in such schools and institutions as may be determined by the Minister;</P>
    <P>(b)  to provide courses for teachers already serving in such schools and institutions as may be determined by the Minister;</P>
    <P>(c)  to provide such other courses as the Minister may from time to time determine;</P>
    <P>(d)  to engage in research in such fields as the governing body may deem appropriate;</P>
    <P>(e)  subject to the approval of the Minister, after consultaion with an tÚdarás&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to buy and acquire lands or buildings;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to institute and, if thought fit, to award scholarships, prizes and other awards;</P>
    <P>(f)  subject to such conditions as the <Col N="953" /> Minister may prescribe, to maintain, manage, administer and invest all the money and assets of the college;</P>
    <P>(g)  to accept from donors gifts of land or other property upon such trusts and conditions, if any, as may be specfied by the donors, provided that nothing in any such trust or condition is contrary to the provisions of this Act;</P>
    <P>(h)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to do all such acts and things as may be necessary to further the objects and development of the college.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the establishment of the governing body, and prescribes their structure and functions.  Like the national institutes for higher education, the Bill provides for a 25-member governing body consisting of the chairman, the director and 23 ordinary members. The chairman and the 23 ordinary members shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  The manner of appointment of the 23 ordinary members is set out in section 5 (4) and is as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  seven shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with the provisions of section 5 (5) which draws particular attention to the needs for adequate representation of industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce and the professions.</P>
    <P>(b)  three shall be appointed who shall be members of the academic staff of the college who shall be chosen by the academic staff in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(c)  one shall be appointed who shall be a member of the non-academic staff of the college chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(d)  two shall be appointed who are full-time students of the college chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(e)  three shall be appointed on the <Col N="954" /> recommendation of the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick;</P>
    <P>(f)  two shall be appointed on the recommendation of An Chomhairle Oiliúna;</P>
    <P>(g)  one shall be appointed who shall be a member of the staff of a university in the State, or of any college or institution which is a constituent college of, or is recognised by, such a university.</P>
    <P>(h)  one member shall be appointed who shall be a member of the academic staff of the colleges of education for primary teachers; and</P>
    <P>(i)  three shall be appointed after consultation with such bodies representative of the interests of second level education as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the functions of the governing body.  The governing body shall manage and control all the affairs and property of the college and shall perform all the functions conferred on the college by this Act and shall have all such powers as may be necessary under this Act for this purpose.  The governing body may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as they think proper to assist them in such manner as the governing body shall direct and the governing body may assign to any committee so appointed such duties as they think fit. The acts of any such committee shall be subject to confirmation by the governing body unless the governing body dispense with the necessity for such confirmation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a post of chief officer of the college, to be known as the director.  The Second Schedule sets out the conditions governing the appointment of the director.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the establishment of an academic council for the college and prescribes the functions of the council.  The academic council act as specialist advisers to the governing body on academic matters.  Their functions relate to the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the college.  The membership and <Col N="955" /> terms of office of the academic council are determined by regulations made by the governing body.  Section 8 (3) lists particular functions of the council as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  to design, develop and implement appropriate programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(b)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the establishment of appropriate structures to implement such programmes of study.</P>
    <P>(c)  to make recommendations to the governing body on programmes for the development of research;</P>
    <P>(d)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students;</P>
    <P>(e)  to make, subject to the approval of the governing body, and to implement the academic regulations of the college;</P>
    <P>(f)  to propose to the governing body the form of regulations to be made by the governing body for the conduct of examinations and for the evaluation of academic progress;</P>
    <P>(g)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the award of fellowships, scholarships, bursaries, prizes or other awards.</P>
    <P>(h)  to make general arrangements for tutorial or other academic counselling;</P>
    <P>(i)  to exercise any other functions, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, which may be delegated to them by the governing body; and</P>
    <P>(j)  to implement any regulations which may be made by the governing body concerning any of the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>With the approval of the governing body, the academic council may establish such and so many committees either consisting wholly or partly of persons who are not members of the college as they <Col N="956" /> think proper to assist the academic council in the performance of their functions and may determine the functions of any committee so established.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables the college to appoint such members of staff as are necessary subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance and to determine the conditions of service and pay of such staff subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the staff serving in the <i>ad hoc</i> college may be transferred to the service of the statutory body and protects the conditions of service, pay and pension rights of the transferred staff, which will not be any less favourable than the conditions they enjoyed while serving as members of the staff of the <i>ad hoc</i> body.</P>
    <P>Section 11 places responsibility on the college to prepare and submit to the Minister as soon as possible after the passing of the Act, a pension scheme for staff. All provisions of any pension scheme submitted by the college will be subject to the approval of the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service.  Every approved scheme will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>Section 12 requires the governing body to submit to the Minister annually a report of the work of the college.  The section also provides that the college will give the Minister any information about their operation that he may require from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that in each year there shall, in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 be paid by the Higher Education Authority to the college, out of moneys received by the authority under section 12 (1) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, a grant or grants of such amount or amounts as the authority think fit.</P>
    <P>Section 14 requires the college to keep accounts which must be submitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When received by the institute the report of the Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="957" /> General must be submitted with the accounts to the Minister.  The Minister will lay the accounts before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables the college to charge fees for admission to courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions or any other event held by the college or for admission to any event held at the college.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is the usual provision that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the short title and the commencement date.</P>
    <P>Thomond College of Education is a national institution and fills a long-felt gap in our teacher training system.  It provides superb facilities for training teachers in particular areas of specialisation. A college such as this is particularly relevant to current educational needs when the emphasis is on encouraging and developing practical skills as well as factual and theoretical knowledge, and on the pursuit of the dictum <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that in view of the difficult circumstances which in recent years have confronted the tanning industry in Western Europe generally, a degree of public concern as to the future of the two factories mentioned could arise.  Responsibility for the operation and well-being of the factories of the company concerned is primarily a matter for the directors and management.  My Department, along with State agencies such as the Industrial <Col N="964" /> Development Authority and Fóir Teoranta, are maintaining continuous contact with the company and are endeavouring to ensure that appropriate action is taken to promote continued operation and the maintenance of employment at the highest possible level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Are steps being taken to reduce, if not to end, the import of leather goods, particularly shoes, from third countries since such imports are the root cause of the problem we are talking of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: So far as the company in question is concerned the main problem is the UK market to which the bulk of the company's sales has always gone. The greater part of third-country leather coming onto the UK market is from Brazil. I understand that the Commission have taken some steps to discourage the export of cheap leather from Brazil into the Community.  The matter is not one on which we can take action unilaterally apart from making our views known to the Commission, in so far as these affect the UK market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: In referring to third-country imports, I am talking in the context of leather goods imported into the EEC generally and that, of course, includes the UK.  I would not agree that the present problem is being created totally by leather imports from Brazil.  Rather, it is due largely to the importation of finished leather goods, including shoes, from the Far East in general and particularly from such countries as Taiwan and Hong Kong.  I should like the Minister to take steps to stop these imports.</P>

SFADCo have sold almost 200 sites for house building in the Shannon town area to private developers.  In addition, SFADCo have also developed a further 217 sites which are to be sold.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that the growth of Shannon is being retarded because of the lack of housing or flat accommodation. In fact the population of the town has increased by more than 1,000 during the past three years.</P>

Therefore, it will come increasingly under the jurisdiction of the responsibility of the county council as developments take place in the coming years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to which Ireland, the European Community and South Africa are contracting parties, provides for measures by a contracting party to restrict imports in certain circumstances but these restrictions must not be applied on a discriminatory basis.  There is no provision under the GATT for the imposition of restrictions against goods in the circumstances envisaged in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am assuming the Deputy is referring to pensions paid by way of annuities under life assurance policies.</P>
      <P>Since 1960 all life assurance policies issued in this country have been expressed in Irish currency, both as to benefits and premiums payable, and the question of paying in sterling does not arise.</P>
      <P>In regard to policies issued before 1960 and denominated in sterling, I understand that, following the break in parity between the Irish and UK currencies, most of the life offices concerned gave policyholders the option of selecting between the two currencies with future premiums and benefits to be paid in the currency selected.  Whether a policyholder is entitled to receive in sterling the benefits payable under an insurance policy denominated in sterling depends on the contractual terms of the policy and whether any option given was exercised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of the wide divergence in the price of carpets of the same quality; if carpet prices are subject to his approval; and, if not, if he will take the necessary steps to ensure that prices are regulated and controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am aware that there is a very large range of carpets on sale here and there are wide variations in quality, design and price.  However information on the comparative qualities of the different carpets is not available to my <Col N="974" /> Department.  Under the price control mechanism the major Irish carpet manufacturers, who are, in fact, selling a significant percentage of their output on the highly competitive export market, are complying with the requirement that their selling prices on the home market are comparable to their selling prices on their export markets.</P>
      <P>The margins taken by retail outlets on carpet sales are not subject to statutory price control.  The position is that such outlets adopt different marketing strategies involving competitive pricing on the one hand and a range of customer services on the other.  This enables the potential customer to decide on which sales approach best meets his individual requirements.  I am satisfied that, having regard to the wide number of sales outlets and the intense competition in this field, market forces are operating effectively at the retail level.  However, if the Deputy has received any complaints about the prices being charged for carpets I will arrange to have the complaints investigated by the prices inspectorate of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that, in a recent survey of the price of carpets, carpets manufactured by the same company and of the same quality and brand name showed a difference in price in Galway of £3.50 per square yard and in Cork a difference of £8 a square yard? Does the Minister not regard this as outrageous? Does he not think that purchasers of carpets need some protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: All purchasers need protection. For the Deputy's information the prices inspectorate have received very few complaints about overcharging for carpets.  They estimate that they only receive one or two in the course of a year.  If the Deputy has some complaints my Department would like to look into them.  The Irish Goods Council have reported that we import almost 80 per cent of the total market in carpets.  That is one reason why the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; effort is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister not <Col N="975" /> agree, in regard to his statement that competition should control prices and that the competition among the different firms is sufficient safeguard, that the normal purchaser is unaware of the different categories of carpets?  Would the Minister not agree that it is time that his Department took serious action in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are different designs and different qualities.  There are firms who send out people to lay the carpets and in other cases the purchaser just buys the carpet off the rack and takes it home with him.  This is a very wide field in which to safeguard the consumer.  As I said in my reply, the whole thing is tied in with what the selling price is on the export market.  If the Deputy has cases of overcharging I would be glad to have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>It follows from this that I do not propose to give details about what the report does or does not contain or about what parts of it have or have not been implemented. Indeed, the nature of the document is such that it is not appropriate to talk in terms of accepting or rejecting it. The fact is that it is a very long and detailed report dealing with a wide spectrum of Garda organisational, administrative and other matters and contains a great deal of factual material, analysis and comment in addition to actual recommendations.</P>
      <P>Its contents are a source of advice and assistance to management in the continuing process of improving and strengthening the administration and organisation of the force and the Deputy may take it that due regard has been and will continue to be given to its recommendations in arriving at decisions in relation to such matters as the strengthening of the Garda management structure, the deployment of manpower, the civilianisation of clerical posts, the reappraisal of systems of training and promotion and personnel policies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will outline, with reference to his reply to a parliamentary question on 17 June 1980 relating to a request from the Irish Association of Civil Liberty for a meeting with him, why he indicated on that occassion that he had no record of the receipt of such a request, in view of the fact that a meeting had been requested in a letter dated 22 May 1980 which was acknowledged by his office on 27 May <Col N="979" /> 1980; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>: I regret that my reply to the Deputy's question of 17 June 1980 incorrectly stated that I had no record of the receipt of a request from the Irish Association of Civil Liberty for a meeting with me.  The error was due to the fact that the letter, dated 22 May 1980, from the association dealt only with the question of delays in the giving of judgments in the High Court, while the only specific reference in the Deputy's question was to the need to reform court procedures, with the result that the question was dealt with by a different section of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state with reference to a previous parliamentary question and to the Garda Commissioner's report the meaning of &ldquo;detection&rdquo; as used in respect of crime statistics; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: I assume that the previous parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers is one to which I gave a written answer on 13 December 1979 stating that I was informed by the Garda authorities, on the basis of their knowledge of the situation in a number of other countries, that it is common practice for police statistics to show as &ldquo;offences detected&rdquo; or &ldquo;offences cleared up&rdquo; all offences in respect of which charges are preferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Garda Commissioner's annual crime report, the expression &ldquo;offences detected&rdquo; relates to indictable offences only and covers, in addition to offences in respect of which charges are preferred, a small number of offences of which the perpetrators are known but in respect of which charges are not preferred because, <Col N="980" /> for example, those concerned are dealt with under the juvenile liaison scheme or are mentally incapacitated or have died. Although the expression &ldquo;offences detected&rdquo; is not, in fact, used in the crime report in respect of non-indictable offences, &ldquo;detection&rdquo; in that instance would refer only to offences in respect of which proceedings are brought, as no useful purpose would be served by endeavouring to keep statistics of the very numerous minor offences that are dealt with by, for example, the administering of a caution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to be clear on this. Is the Minister confirming that when the Garda Commissioner's report refers to &ldquo;detection&rdquo; he is not talking about a conviction? Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: I said &ldquo;detection&rdquo; in that instance would refer only to offences in respect of which proceedings are brought, as no useful purpose would be served by endeavouring to keep statistics of the very numerous minor offences that are dealt with by, for example, the administering of a caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister see two problems, if not dangers?  One is that an artificially advantageous picture may be presented by presenting figures of detection as if they were for crimes cleared up on the basis of securing a conviction when that is not the case; for example, where the Garda felt they had a case but did not go ahead with it for one reason or another?  Does he see a possibility of opening up our whole system to the temptation of assuming guilt because some of the crimes detected&mdash;the Minister will please correct me if I am wrong&mdash;include crimes or alleged crimes in respect of which there is not a conviction or the charge is not proceeded with and, in the case of the juvenile liaison officers scheme, the charge is not even initiated because it is dealt with in another way?  I am not against that at all, but I want to call a spade a spade.  Does the Minister see the two points to which I am referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: I said the expression <Col N="981" />&ldquo;offences detected&rdquo; relates to indictable offences only and covers, in addition to offences in respect of which charges are preferred, a small number of offences of which the perpetrators are known but in respect of which charges are not preferred because, for example, those concerned are dealt with under the juvenile liaison scheme or are mentally incapacitated or have died.  That is the differentiation in the use of the word &ldquo;detection&rdquo; and the instance I have given should answer the Deputy's question adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister agree that the common understanding of the word &ldquo;detection&rdquo; is the pursuing or the apprehension of somebody who has committed a crime and the presentation of convincing evidence that the person is guilty?  Can the Minister confirm that parts of the statistics of detection include cases which are presumably surmised about people who are alleged to be guilty and where a charge is not preferred but is dealt with under the juvenile liaison scheme?  That is not a bad idea.  Does the Minister not accept that he is leaving the door open to assumptions of guilt and to presenting an artificially rosy picture of crime prevention and detection which all of us want to be at the highest level?  That will not be achieved by stretching the concept of detection to include a case where a Garda may very well have a belief about a possible defendant but there may be no evidence of any crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that in the case of appeals from the High Court delays of many months occur in obtaining the transcripts of the High Court cases and that this impedes and delays court procedure; <Col N="982" /> and the steps he proposes to take to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not so aware.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the majority of High Court cases in which appeals are lodged and in which transcripts are required are common law actions arising out of claims for damages for personal injuries.  In those cases the parties concerned employ freelance shorthand writers, who are not responsible to my Department, to record the proceedings and prepare transcripts, if required.</P>
      <P>In Chancery and Family Law cases in the High Court official stenographers, employed by my Department, record the proceedings and prepare transcripts when required for the purposes of bringing appeals.  No complaints have been received of delay in furnishing transcripts in any of those cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: The question related to periods of time.  The evidence I have is that very speedy effort has been put into certain cases which I have before me.  I will give the Deputy some examples.  In an income tax case concerning Murphy and another v. the Attorney General the transcript was ready in one month; in the case of McGrath and another and the Trustees of Maynooth College the transcript was ready in two months; in the case of the Chariot Inns v. Assicurazioni Generali and others, it took 16 days at hearing last year ending on 30 December 1979, reserved judgment was delivered on 24 January 1980 and an appeal was lodged.  Transcript was lodged about three and a half months after the date of notice of appeal.  These are a number of instances where there was very speedy action in relation to transcripts.</P>

      <P>: My question dealt with delays.  As the Minister clearly is unable to answer the question regarding the longest delays involved and as his brief is inadequate in this respect, I would ask him to investigate allegations by many people in the legal profession that there are delays of many months with regard to getting the transcripts.  I would ask him to look into this matter to ensure that people are not denied justice.  Secondly, does the Minister accept that the employment of freelance transcribers or shorthand notetakers is an adequate replacement for the responsibility of his Department and the courts to provide all of those elements that are necessary to a proper, efficient and speedy system of justice?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="984" /> for Justice if he will outline the Government's attitude in regard to facilitating access by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the general public to prisons; if he is satisfied with the present position regarding access; and if he has any plans to introduce changes in these respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Government are in favour of allowing public representatives, journalists and people who are professionally associated with prison work to have reasonable access to the prisons and other places of detention.</P>
      <P>Public representatives have visited prisons in the past.  In 1977 I invited the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to nominate members of their parliamentary parties who would receive an invitation from me to visit all of the country's prisons.  That invitation was not taken up.  I am at present considering applications from individual Deputies, including the Deputy himself, to visit some places.  I will be in touch with them shortly.</P>
      <P>When I took up office I invited the editors of the newspapers and representatives of RTE to tour the prisons and other places of detention.  The invitation was accepted and the visits were extensively reported.  Other journalists have made visits to particular places since then.  I have just authorised a tour by another journalist.</P>
      <P>People with a professional association with prison work have always been allowed reasonable access to the relevant institutions.  Free access by the general public, apart from normal visits to prisoners, would not be feasible because it would make the maintenance of good order and security impossible.  Moreover, it would be a serious invasion of the privacy of prisoners who are entitled to reasonable anonymity while serving their sentences.</P>
      <P>A visiting committee, composed of persons of standing in local communities, is appointed in respect of each prison and place of detention.  Essentially their function is to act as watchdogs on behalf of the general public to ensure that prisoners are treated properly.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated on 3 June 1980, in answer to a parliamentary question (Dáil Debates, Volume 321, col. 1379), this arrangement necessitates a measure of co-operation between the two immigration services which, incidentally, is formally recognised in the aliens orders.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Garda authorities state that the train carrying ammonia was stopped on 21 August last when, as a result of the malicious cutting of the electric signal cable, a red signal against it proceeding came on.  The Garda view is that the signal cable was cut so as to halt <Col N="995" /> a goods train with a view to stealing the contents and that, when the train carrying ammonia was stopped and no goods could be taken, the offender or offenders resorted to an act of vandalism by releasing the water being carried on the train. The water was for use for the quelling of ammonia fumes in the event of a leakage. Immediately the Garda were notified of the incident they went to the scene and carried out a search of the area but with negative results.  Garda investigations into the incident are continuing.</P>
      <P>The Garda will continue to make every effort to prevent unauthorised persons from entering on railway property.  Special attention is being paid to the area by regular uniformed foot and mobile patrols and also by members of the district detective unit.  The protection of CIE property by the provision of better fencing and more secure signalling equipment is, of course, a matter for CIE and discussions are in progress between the Garda authorities and CIE management with a view to devising plans to minimise interference with the railway system.</P>

    <Title>Arts Act, 1951 (Additional Function) (Amendment) Order, 1980: Motion .</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, pursuant to paragraph (c) of <Col N="1020" /> subsection (4) of section 3 of the Arts Act, 1951, Dáil Éireann confirms the</P>
    <P>Arts Act, 1951 (Additional Function) (Amendment) Order, 1980,</P>
    <P>made by the Government on the 3rd September, 1980.</P>
    <P>Under the Arts Act, 1951 (Additional Function) Order, 1966, the Arts Council were empowered to establish a fund from which they could give payments and annuities to creative artists who by reason of age or ill-health were enduring hardships beyond even the normal lot of their kind.  It was decided to call the fund Ciste Cholmcille, thereby making reference to one who was concerned with the status of the artist in his day and was both poet and man of charity.  The fund was to be made up of private subscriptions only and the 1966 order specifically prohibited the council from allocating any part of their own annual grant to it.</P>
    <P>The council have now asked that this prohibition be waived.  They feel that there is a need to augment the fund and so give a realistic level of assistance to those who are felt to be in need of it, people who deserve well of us all, but who because of the nature of their calling and its general uncertainties, have not been enabled to make much provision for misfortune or take much thought for the morrow; and who are frequently, of course, not covered by any sort of a pension scheme whatever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> The Government have accordingly, made the amending order to meet this situation; and the order now before the House would enable the Arts Council to utilise part of the grant paid to it annually out of the moneys provided by the Oireachtas for the purposes of Ciste Cholmcille&mdash;the amount so used in any particular year to be approved by me.</P>
    <P>The 1966 order also limited the investment of the fund to Irish Government securities.  This is now being broadened also, at the request of the council, to include securities authorised in respect of trust funds and such other securities as may be approved by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Arts Council, furthermore, the order will permit annuities or grants to be paid to widows and widowers or other dependants of creative artists where the artist concerned has not been able to provide for them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to confirm this amending order which has been sought by the Arts Council and the desirability of which will, I hope, be obvious to Deputies.  The amounts subscribed to and disbursed by Ciste Cholmcille in the past have not been, in the general scheme of things, by any means enormous.  I would like to use this occasion to remind people outside the House of the existence of Ciste Cholmcille and its worthwhile purposes and to commend it to as wide a circle of potential donors as possible.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Arts Council on this important step in the direction of enhancing the position of the individual creative artist and the necessity of making provision for those who bring honour to us all but are often neglected in their hour of need.  Their concern in this matter is, I may say, shared by the Government and, I am sure, by the Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have no difficulty in welcoming this proposal.  In the context in which we are discussing it, it is appropriate to look back to the genesis of the Arts Council.  It owes its origins to the imaginative vision of the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy John A. Costello, who in <Col N="1022" /> the debate at that time revealed something of his own long-standing interest and perhaps his sense of frustration when he said that he had been something like 21 years hoping to see this Bill come into the Irish Parliament.  He took the opportunity when he became Taoiseach to see that it did come into the Irish Parliament and in his speech he referred indeed to the lack of interest in the arts and the near obstruction of anything to do with the arts.  He said that it was indeed difficult to avoid coming to the conclusion that there was something in the nature of a deliberate policy to obstruct anybody who evinced any desire or inclination to do anything for the furtherance of art in Ireland or for the furtherance of the application of art industry in Ireland. One senses there the frustration of a man deeply concerned about these matters.</P>
      <P>It is also relevant, looking back, to see his determination that the Arts Council in their activities should have the freedom to act and should not be constrained by bureaucratic procedures.  He said that it was a body which should be entitled to work on its own, free from the trammels of civil service procedure.  He said it was envisaged in the Bill that it should be subject merely to Government and that it was not intended that it should be under the authority of any particular Minister except in the sense that it reports through the Taoiseach to the Government.  I think he showed great farsightedness in that at the time.</P>
      <P>It is also noteworthy that in the discussion on the Bill, it was the Opposition's Deputy de Valera who pressed for the taking out of the Bill both the limit in the original draft on the amount of money involved and the provision that the Minister in anything done in the way of providing funds should be in consultation with the Minister for Finance, asserting that the Taoiseach should be able to run these affairs himself without having to get the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Eventually the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Costello, accepted this suggestion from somebody who had long experience of being Taoiseach.  So much for the past in terms of the foundation of the Arts Council by way of background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> So far as this order is concerned, it amends an order of 1966 brought in when Deputy Seán Lemass was Taoiseach.  On the order providing for the establishment of a fund it was expressed as being one to help creative artists advanced in years or who by reason of ill health are able no longer to fend properly for themselves. But it did not at the time make any provision for the State assisting this fund. Indeed, the order provided that the council should not utilise for the purpose of the fund any part of the grant paid to the council annually out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The fund has been correspondingly limited.  The exact nature of its activities are somewhat obscure because although that order provided that the council should keep accounts of expenditure and made provision that the abstract of the accounts and the fund for each year be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, all that we actually get is an appendix to the Arts Council report with the figure of the sum brought forward; under &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; there is no clear indication of its source; under &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; there is no indication of how it is expended, what is left, and how the residue is invested.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has an accountant who will no doubt be able to assert that these five figures that are given do represent an abstract of the accounts but they are certainly a very minimal abstract.  We know very little about the operations of this fund though we do know that in the last year for which we have figures, out of £15,000 available only £1,400 was spent, which indicates either that there are very few creative artists who by virtue of their age or incapacity are in need, which seems inherently improbable, or a certain frugality in the way in which the fund is administered.  This order makes a number of changes.  One to which the Taoiseach did not refer and the significance of which is not quite clear to me, though I am not demurring at it, appears to be the deletion of the word &ldquo;creative&rdquo; from the phrase &ldquo;these annuities or grants be paid in recognition of outstanding creative services in one or more of these arts in Ireland.&rdquo;  I suppose there is some reason <Col N="1024" /> why it was thought desirable to delete this word, in some way the existence of this word impeded possible generosity &mdash; perhaps the Taoiseach would enlighten us as to the <i>rationale</i> of that deletion&mdash;I am not quarrelling with it but, obviously, there is some reason for it and one would be interested to know it.</P>
    <P>An important feature&mdash;perhaps the most important feature&mdash;is that it extends the fund to the dependants of artists, the creative workers in various arts, providing not merely that the fund can be used to help them, if they can no longer provide for themselves or for their dependants, but also providing for the fund to be used to help surviving relatives and dependants of a creative artist.  There is obviously a good reason for this.  Given the nature of their work and the way in which it is very unevenly remunerated, there must be many occasions when creative artists, or their dependants find themselves in considerable financial difficulty both before and after the death of the creative artist.  The loosening of the rather tight constrictions within which this fund operates is welcome, as we must welcome the fact that the ban on utilisation for the purposes of the fund of the Arts Council grant has been removed, subject only to the approval of the Taoiseach. As to the proportion of the Arts Council grant which can be used for this purpose, the public funds will now be available where hitherto they had not been and where Ciste Cholmcille has depended, as far as I can judge from the material in front of me, on private donations of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>We welcome the changes to the order, subject to clarification of the reason for the omission of the word &ldquo;creative&rdquo; in paragraph 1.  No doubt there is a good reason which the House is entitled to hear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not think anybody in the House can oppose this motion as it attempts to extend the fund and its functions. However, it is true to say at this stage that the Taoiseach missed a golden opportunity, when he was Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare, <Col N="1025" /> to extend among the categories of those who would benefit from the social welfare legislation cultural workers who were unemployed, including creative artists as distinct from actors and performers.  I hope that this welcome indication by the Taoiseach in relation to the ciste can be followed up by support for the inclusion within the context of the social welfare provisions of those categories of cultural workers who, as the statistical evidence has demonstrated, are in fact extremely badly paid.  At the weekend, Dermot Doolin, the Secretary General of Irish Actors' Equity, talked about the average actors' wage being approximately 50 per cent of the industrial wage and that actors and performers&mdash;cultural workers, to give them their EEC title&mdash;can anticipate up to five or six months unemployment in each year.  In this context, although the provisions are welcome, the fund and the flexibility of the Ciste Cholmcille will not really begin to address themselves to some of the creative problems that are encountered by young cultural workers who have not reached the doubtful position of surviving to their old age and I ask the Taoiseach, in his reply, to give some indication as to what action the Government propose to take in this regard.  I refer to a survey being undertaken, the preliminary results of which are available to the Arts Council, of the actual plight of cultural workers and to see if we can anticipate from this opening by the Taoiseach that there is a possibility that in the next budget the scope of the social welfare legislation might be extended to include such cultural workers.</P>

Section 1 has been amended and the only change I can see is that the word &ldquo;creative&rdquo; is omitted and it is now in recognition of outstanding services to one or all of these arts in Ireland.  Presumably <Col N="1026" /> there is some reason why we have gone to the trouble of amending this section to delete the word &ldquo;creative&rdquo; and I wonder what the reason is.</P>

      <P>The UNESCO study on the condition of artists has been receiving very active consideration and a proposal to improve this situation will not be delayed for very long.  Deputy Quinn knows that I have on a number of occasions spoken of the difficulty there is in helping the individual creator.  It is easy to subsidise the public performance but many people argue that that is not subsidising the arts; when you subsidise the theatre, an opera or a musical performance, it is the general public which is subsidised, not the creative artist. That problem has been exercising our minds and I hope before very long we will be able to bring forward something which will make a positive contribution in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The purpose of this Bill is to consolidate into a single measure the enactments governing the social welfare schemes administered by my Department.  The Bill embraces the live provisions of more than 60 Acts spanning over 70 years.  The provisions of subsidiary legislation&mdash;statutory instruments and statutory rules and orders&mdash;which amend or modify the statute law have been included where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Being solely a consolidation measure, the Bill cannot effect any change in the law as it stands at present and the Attorney General has issued a certificate to the effect that the Bill conforms with the Standing Orders of this House and does not promote any new law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A brief general explanatory memorandum has been issued with the Bill.  In addition, a memorandum prepared by the Attorney General has been prefixed to the Bill.  This memorandum, which is required by Standing Order No. 107, shows the Acts which it is proposed to repeal and the provisions of the Bill in which the provisions of those Acts are <Col N="1028" /> reproduced.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, consolidation permits the grouping together, in a logical and orderly fashion, of the live provisions of existing legislation dealing with each topic.  Consolidation also includes the rewording of old and archaic constructions and the repeal of those provisions which in the course of time have become obsolete and no longer have any validity.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced on 16 October reference was made to the rapidity with which the first Consolidation Bill introduced in 1976 was overtaken by subsequent legislation.  The measure now under consideration has been restyled so that variables such as rates of benefit and pensions, which are revised frequently, are now contained in Schedules.  Deputies will recall that in this year's Social Welfare Act the rates of assistance payments were provided in a new assistance schedule to parallel the existing insurance schedule.  In the Consolidation Bill the process has been completed and the rates of occupational injuries benefit payments as well as &ldquo;wet-time&rdquo; contribution and benefit rates are also provided in schedules.</P>
    <P>The task of removing the variables from the body of the Bill required extensive redrafting and involved detailed and lengthy examination of the adaptations made to ensure that no accidental changes in the law occurred.  As a consequence of these adaptations, it will be possible in future to provide for changes in rates of payment by amending the Schedules without making any changes in the body of the text.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains 313 sections and five Schedules containing substantive provisions. Its size alone illustrates the scope and the complexity of the developing social welfare system.  The Bill embraces the scheme of social insurance provided by the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and subsequent Acts.  It also covers schemes of social assistance provided by those Acts and the Old Age Pensions Acts, the Unemployment Assistance Acts, the <Col N="1029" /> Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts and the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Acts.  The Bill also contains the provisions relating to the children's allowance scheme, the intermittent unemployment or wet-time insurance scheme and the school meals and fuel schemes.  In addition, it deals with the administration of the various insurance and assistance schemes as well as the decisions and appeals procedures, financing, legal proceedings and so on.  It was proposed when the 1976 Bill was debated to issue the consolidated legislation in a loose-leaf form.  While the reliance now placed on schedules makes this requirement less compelling, I feel that the suggestion was worthwhile and it is something I will be considering in due course.  The task of consolidation was undertaken because of the continuing expansion of the social welfare system. The volume of legislation dealing with the various social welfare schemes is now so extensive and complex that it is extremely difficult, and time-consuming, to ascertain and collate the provisions relating to any particular scheme.  The Consolidation Bill will streamline all of this law and make for ease of access and greater clarity and, ultimately, for the most effective and efficient development of the total system.</P>
    <P>Not only will this Bill be of great benefit to the officials of my Department, but I know it will also be an invaluable aid to Deputies, social and community workers and other persons and organisations involved in advising and assisting the public on social welfare matters.</P>
    <P>Following its Second Reading here I will be seeking the permission of the House to have this Bill referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.  I hope that the Committee will find it possible to deal speedily with the Bill so that it may be enacted before any further amending legislation is introduced. I can assure the members of the Committee of my fullest co-operation and that of my Department in their work.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in commending this <Col N="1030" /> Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: As Deputy Boland remarked on our behalf when this matter was first raised in the House by way of motion there has been a good deal of delay since this Consolidation Bill was first prepared.  Some justification for this has now been given by the Minister in terms of the way in which current and variable material has been extracted and put into schedules which can then be amended more easily.  Certainly, as a form of presentation, it is much to be preferred to what would otherwise have been the case.</P>
      <P>What must concern anyone looking at this Consolidation Bill is simply its size and complexity.  We are dealing in this Bill with ways in which underprivileged people in our community are helped with their difficulties by the rest of the community through the intermediacy of the State and its agencies.  Basically this Bill is a recital of the rights of the underprivileged. That it should be, when consolidated, so huge in size and so complex in its verbiage that no underprivileged person could reasonably be expected to know his or her rights is a reflection on the way in which our social welfare system has grown up in a very higgledy-piggledy fashion.  For example, I cannot recall the number of different means tests we have.  I remember a figure, whether accurate or not, being mentioned at one stage by somebody.  This Bill simply consolidates what is here already.  It is clear from its size that our social welfare code needs to be reformed as well as consolidated. I accept that the first step to reform is consolidation.  At least it will be a lot easier to reform it now, all in one piece, after this effort than would have been the case up to now with the many complex provisions in different Acts that have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The onus rests on us in this House to do two things and to do them fairly speedily. Apart from passing this Consolidation Bill, examining it carefully in accordance with the custom of the House to ensure that it does what it says it does&mdash;consolidates the law and no <Col N="1031" /> more&mdash;we must attempt to reform the code so as to simplify it and to eliminate from it the many anomalies arising not merely in areas like means tests and elsewhere, which cumulatively add up to a considerable amount of what one could only describe as distributive injustice as between different groups.  No doubt, in respect of these different means tests, these different provisions, each had their <i>rationale</i> at the time they originated.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody looking at the sum total of our social welfare legislation could really feel that what we have got reflects a balanced assessment of the relative needs of different groups.  Therefore, there is a need for reform.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is a need for simplification. Because no amount of simplification would really make the rights of the underprivileged readily accessible to them individually, through their own knowledge, there is a need to provide far more assistance to them in securing their rights.  This is something we have never succeeded in doing.  It remains the case today that, despite the improvements that have taken place in the approach to social welfare among the officials who are involved in administering the various codes, nonetheless the code is administered in individual instances harshly and in a manner which would not be the case perhaps if the same officials were dealing with people in a different&mdash;to use an old-fashioned word&mdash;station in life.  It is necessary that we do much more than we have done to ensure that people get their rights.  There is no doubt that the State saves millions because people do not know their rights.  The burden placed on Members of this House and of the other House in seeking to ensure that people do get their rights&mdash;given the complexity of the legislation we are here consolidating&mdash;itself distracts us from what should be our primary task.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful as to whether we&mdash;almost all of us amateurs in this area&mdash;are the best qualified to offer assistance to people in getting their rights.  We need a situation in which the underprivileged can <Col N="1032" /> turn to someone whose duty it is to get for them what they are entitled to and whose duty is not to protect the Exchequer against legitimate demands of these groups.  I do not think that we have achieved that here.  We have much to do before we can be satisfied with the administration of the code as here consolidated. That feeling must be general in this House.  This, therefore, can be seen only as a first technical step in the process of reform, simplification and the provision of new means of access to their rights for the people whom the Acts listed here are intended to help and make provision for.</P>
    <P>In reading through the list of Acts which are consolidated we cannot but be impressed by the way in which over the years, before and after the foundation of the State, there has been a growing recognition by successive Governments, starting with the Lloyd George Government in 1908 and successive native Governments, of the need to make adequate provision for the various social needs. Yet, even today, one continually comes across individual cases which fall through the net and are not catered for by this very complex system which we have built up, a system which is not integrated with the income tax system but which, together with the income tax system, represents an attempt to redistribute wealth in an equitable way.  Because they are not integrated and they underlap, they do not, in fact, have this effect but leave many people at low level of income in a position where they can gain no benefit from income tax concessions, because their income is too low for income tax, nor can they obtain benefit from social welfare because they are in employment. In at least some cases, this leads to the anomaly where people who are unemployed may even be better off than people who are at work, an anomaly which we did our best to alleviate and remove when in Government on 21 June 1976 but which remains in various forms today and which is a blot on the system.</P>
    <P>Until such time as this consolidated Act can be itself brought together with and consolidated with income tax legislation into a single system for redistribution <Col N="1033" /> of wealth, without the gap in the middle and without the anomalies which mar it, we cannot rest content with our work.  That leaves on one side completely the issue, which is not relevant to this debate, of the adequacy of the provisions made, which I cannot go into because it is not my job to do it here.  So much remains to be done.  This can only be seen as a starting point, a basis from which we can proceed along this road.  I hope there does exist in the House and in the country a willingness to proceed along this road and to ensure that anomalies and injustices which persist and gaps which continue to mar our system of social welfare, will be eliminated, using this consolidated Act as the basis for this reforming activity.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one technical point. The Minister referred to a memorandum prepared by the Attorney General prefixed to the Bill.  May I take it that what he means is the list of earlier enactments set beside the prefix to this Bill in a kind of concordance ... I see nothing which could be described as a memorandum. What I see is a schedule, but I take it that this, in fact, is what he has referred to.  It is very useful, indeed, to have the various earlier Acts listed but there is no clear indication as to where they find themselves in this Bill or where they have been repealed or where they have become obsolete.  As there is no text other than the reference on the front page, to call it a memorandum may mislead people who might look for the Attorney General's memorandum without actually seeing it. However, I may be using the word &ldquo;memorandum&rdquo; in a different sense from the sense in which the Minister or his officials use it.</P>
    <P>We certainly shall co-operate in getting this consolidated measure through as quickly as possible.  Whether the time scale suggested by the Minister, which would require this to be done by Christmas, is feasible or not I do not know, because I lack experience on the consolidation of Bills.  The sheer immensity of the volume would intimidate me if I had to tackle it, but I am sure that with the skilled guidance of the officials of the Minister's Department it will be possible <Col N="1034" /> to proceed at a fair speed through this consolidated legislation.  We shall do our best to co-operate in getting it on the Statute Book as soon as possible in the hope that it will provide the basis for further serious reforms of the system and the basis for an attempt to ensure that those who have rights&mdash;and they are rights, they are not charity&mdash;under these Acts become aware of them and can be made aware of them easily and are encouraged to seek them when they are entitled to them and that the present system, which in a sense seems designed primarily to protect the public purse rather than assist those in need, will be reformed in the manner in which all of us in the carrying out of our duties as TDs with regard to our constituents would like to see happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>: This new Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill is to be welcomed in that it attempts to update our present patchwork of social welfare Acts into one more comprehensive piece of legislation. Our present system is a patchwork of 64 parliamentary Acts, which date back to British rule.  There is a staggeringly complex muddle, spanning over 200 pages of legislation.  The result of all this has been a confusing and bureaucratic system of benefits which are the least progressive and comprehensive of all the countries in the European Community.  Our thinking on social welfare benefits reflects the historical evolution of that system, which is a reluctant, half-hearted State taking over various services which were previously financed by charity and administered on a voluntary basis.  This reluctant, piecemeal approach to social welfare is best exemplified in the present administration of our social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare is a social right and social welfare recipients must be afforded the dignity and respect which they deserve.  They are also entitled to services which are smoothly and efficiently administered.  The main problem in this area is the complete lack of information available to social welfare recipients on all the benefits to which they are entitled. The result has been a total confusion among social welfare recipients concerning <Col N="1035" /> who is entitled to what.  This new Bill attempts to dispel this confusion but, again, it is essentially complex and confusing itself.  Those most in need are at a disadvantage in regard to being able to understand this legislation.  I find it very difficult to understand what social welfare recipients are entitled to in many cases, so one can imagine how much harder deprived people will find it.</P>
    <P>This new Bill will have little real impact unless social welfare recipients receive much more adequate information on their entitlements.  It is not enough for the Department to say that they provide full information on request.  The Department should be more actively involved in informing people of their entitlements through television, radio and the press and there should be a general simplified information leaflet available in the Department.  The Department handle over 40,000 inquiries each month and these are handled by 56 people employed there.  This is inadequate and more people should be employed.  This would be a positive approach towards informing people of their rights and such a policy is crucial to the whole concept of welfare as a social right.  The system is not operating in the interests of social welfare recipients. I do not blame the personnel in the Department for this.  Many errors occur where people are claiming benefits because the system is so complex and is not easily explained.  We should have a commitment to massive reform of the system and there should be a rights charter for social welfare recipients. Social welfare recipients should receive full information, prompt delivery of payments, have an appropriate appeals system, receive courteous treatment and have a basic standard of living.  These are the priority areas.  We should adopt a positive policy of discrimination in favour of these people.  Social welfare is a right and recipients should be afforded the dignity and respect they deserve.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in its attempt to update the system but it will be of little avail unless simplified information about its operation is provided to the public.  I perused the documents at present available <Col N="1036" /> to the public and I must admit that they are hard to understand.  The public do not understand about the variations in the social welfare benefit year nor about the number of contributions which would qualify them for benefit.  When they are told that they have insufficient contributions they get no explanation of what would entitle them to get benefit.  This information should be available in a simplified form by means of leaflets in the Department.  I have no idea how the means test for various benefits operates nor am I sure do other Members of the House.  I have tried to get this information from the Department to no avail. The information should be available directly to the public through information centres set up in the Department.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very nice in that it attempts to update and organise a patchwork complex of social welfare legislation.  The Minister said that it will be of great benefit and of invaluable aid to Deputies, social and community workers and other persons involved in advising the public on social welfare matters.  That is an overstatement of what this attempts to do.  It does not provide the information in a simple form that will entitle a person to know his entitlements.  It will be inadequate unless it is accompanied by more information.  This could be done at no great cost to the Department.  In fact it would ease the tremendous burden on this Department.  I understand their problem.  They are constantly being phoned and written to in relation to benefits. If the Department operated a more comprehensive information service the work in the Department would be greatly reduced and everyone would benefit.  I appeal to the Minister to give priority to this area as it would be in the interests of everybody.</P>

      <P>: It would be a pity to let the Bill pass without a welcome from us.  I compliment the Minister on this legislation.  The Minister said that when this Bill was introduced on 6 October reference was made to the rapidity with which the first consolidation Bill introduced in 1976 was overtaken by subsequent <Col N="1037" /> legislation.  That is a tribute to successive Governments who have given thought to social welfare problems and have introduced legislation to better the less well-off people.  While we often criticise the system it is fairly accurate.  It is not perfect, but by taking such actions now we can perfect it so that any person in need can receive benefits.  We should not consider that this is a benevolent State doling out help; we should show that the State is not unaware of the needs of the people.  Social welfare is a distribution of national wealth as a right to people in need.  The State acts wisely by ensuring that we have a good social welfare system.  The State should recognise the dignity of the person and maintain that dignity.  This attitude would encourage a better community than if social welfare was considered just as a State expense.  Most of the people who receive benefit have created the wealth.  We will have a far more humane social welfare system if we look at it in that light.</P>
      <P>In future legislation we will have to look at the need of long-staying patients in hospitals.  Because people now live longer we will have a greater aged population. Many of them will be in long-stay institutions or homes if we do not ensure that they can be maintained at home.  When the Minister is planning to improve the social welfare code I hope he will bear this in mind.  The young people also have their social welfare needs.  We must expand the system so that old people can be maintained at home&mdash;</P>

I admit that if we had a simplified booklet issued by the Department people would be able to learn of their entitlements rather than have to approach politicians. The system should be simple so that people can ascertain what they are entitled to.  I wish the Minister well and I should like to compliment him on introducing this necessary piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>: I welcome the comments of Deputies in relation to this consolidation Bill.  Deputy FitzGerald commented about the delay over the years in getting this measure through the House.  I am sure all Members are aware of the difficulty and complexity of this task of consolidation. An effort was made on two previous occasions to deal with the matter, the most recent of which was delayed by the introduction of the pay-related social insurance scheme which created a further series of amendments to be built into the consolidation measure.  There were some 250 amendments, and that is why we decided to introduce a new Bill rather than try to modify the one which was before the House previously.  As Deputy FitzGerald stated, the necessary legislation is complex and big.  It is not intended that an underprivileged person should have to deal in detail with such legislation.  Deputy O'Connell referred to this and suggested that more information on the schemes available was desirable.  I shall deal with that point later.  This measure brings all the existing legislation into one comprehensive document, and obviously that will prove of benefit to those anxious to study social welfare legislation and its application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that there is need for reform in the whole code of social welfare legislation.  I also agree that the conditions in relation to means tests should be simplified.  One of the best ways of doing so is not to have any.  In this respect the benefit schemes flow more smoothly.  With that in mind I have been working on a new national income-related pension scheme which will be a benefit scheme.  This will eliminate a big <Col N="1039" /> number of means tests.  That is one of the best ways of attacking means tests.  That measure, which has involved a great deal of work and consideration, should prove of great benefit to our people.  I hope to be in a position to introduce a White Paper on the subject shortly.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House will assist in identifying anomalies.  I agree with what Deputy FitzGerald said in relation to social welfare recipients having a right to whatever benefits or assistance which applies to them and I accept what he said about this Bill being an important starting point.  It is important because if we do not get this through now we will have to go back and start again next year and, because of further legislation, we may have more delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald raised a technical point about the memorandum.  He referred to the fact that the front page of the memorandum merely cited the enactments proposed to be repealed.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that it is called a memorandum because it is required by Standing Orders to be so called.  I accept that in the general sense of a memorandum it is not what one usually associates with one.  Standing Order No. 107 states:</P>
    <P>(3)  Every Consolidation Bill shall have prefixed to it a Memorandum prepared by the Attorney General in which shall be specified the enactments repealed by the Bill, the sections of the Bill in which the repealed enactments are reproduced, together with the remarks of the Attorney General on any textual amendments made.</P>
    <P>The title &ldquo;Memorandum&rdquo; is included because Standing Orders require that.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that that is a technical point.</P>

      <P>: I agree with Deputy O'Connell that as much information as possible should be made available.  During <Col N="1040" /> the year we took several steps to improve the information available on social welfare, assistance and benefit schemes.  The Deputy spoke of the need to make greater use of the media and I should like to tell him that extensive advertisements of any changes in our schemes are placed in newspapers.  There is a general difficulty in relation to information. No matter how simple the information is, unless there is somebody to help to get that information across it is impossible to do so.  It is in this regard that voluntary groups, social and community workers have a vital part to play. A great deal of information is got across through those channels.  With the planned reorganisation of the National Social Services Council, I hope to strengthen the back-up of such voluntary workers at community level to ensure that the job of giving information is done more effectively.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke about the different benefit years for men and women. I am happy to be able to tell the Deputy that they will be the same from January. That anomaly will go from 1 January and both will be working on the calendar year from that time.  In terms of bringing all the legislation together this measure will be invaluable and in terms of communicating the information to people it is a help, but that will have to be dealt with later.  The method of calculating means is set out comprehensively in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore welcomed the consolidation measure and referred to the question of the dignity of the individuals concerned. We all subscribe to that.  The Deputy felt it was desirable that people should not have to go to politicians to have benefits explained to them.  In regard to what I have said already I think it will always be necessary for some people to go to community workers, social <Col N="1041" /> welfare workers and perhaps even politicians to have some aspects of the provisions explained to them because the schemes are so vast and complex and because in some instances comprehension fades a little as time goes on.  Nevertheless the spirit of what the Deputy says is one I share.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I thank Deputies for their contributions and particularly for the welcome they have given to this consolidation Bill and for their promise to assist the Bill in going through as quickly as possible.  We all appreciate that if this cannot be done the Bill will go back into another cycle.  I very much appreciate the promised co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide a statutory basis for the payment of subsidy in respect of the interest on building society loans on a general basis. The Building Societies Act, 1976, consolidated and modernised the statute law in relation to building societies but does not contain any provision enabling the payment of subsidy on building society loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April last the Irish Building Societies <Col N="1042" /> Association informed the Minister for the Environment that due to increases in interest rates generally and the adverse effects of their relatively unattractive interest rates on the nett inflows of funds to societies it was necessary to recommend an increase in building society investment rates from 9 per cent to 10.75 per cent, standard rate tax paid.  This would have necessitated an increase from 14.15 per cent to 16.5 per cent in the interest rate charged on home loans.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the report of a working group established to examine the matter, the Government decided to make available, on a temporary basis, a direct subsidy to societies for the purpose of enabling them to increase their investment rates from 1 May 1980 to 10.75 per cent without increasing the interest rate charged on house loans. Reductions in interest rates generally since then have enabled societies as and from 1 October 1980 to bring their investment rates back to the level prevailing in April of this year and the need for this subsidy no longer exists.  Liability for subsidy amounting to an estimated £6.934 million will result.</P>
    <P>The reductions in interest rates recently announced by the Associated Banks would, one would have expected, left the way open to building societies to effect reductions in their investment and mortgage interest rates.  I recently had a meeting with representatives of the Irish Building Societies Association to discuss this matter and I stressed the Government's hope that there would be an immediate and positive response from the societies.  I regret to say that their reaction was entirely negative and that they were prepared to go no further than to undertake to keep the position under review.</P>
    <P>As regards the details of the Bill, section 1 is a definition section.  Section 2 provides the statutory basis for the payment of subsidy in relation to building society loans.  The section, which is drafted on a fairly flexible basis, would provide a broad power to pay subsidy in relation to building society loans, leaving the details as to the type of subsidy to be prescribed in regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> Section 12 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, enables a limited form of interest subsidy to be paid to building societies on certain loans which were issued by the societies and guaranteed by a housing authority.  Section 4 of the Bill proposes to repeal section 12 of the 1979 Act.  Any future subsidy payments in relation to the guaranteed loans would then be made under the provisions of section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to the subsidy provisions, advantage has been taken of the Bill to amend subsection (3) of section 23 of the Building Societies Act, 1976.  That subsection enables small amounts which are held in a building society in the name of a person who has died intestate, to be released by the society prior to the grant of administration of the deceased person's estate.  This provision has been helpful in avoiding hardship in certain cases and section 3 of the Bill proposes to extend the provisions so as to enable a similar procedure to apply in the case of testate deaths.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is a short and comparatively simple Bill.  There are really only three effective sections in it.  Section 2 enables the Government or the Minister to pay a subsidy to building societies to enable them to keep down their interest rates. Section 2 says that in determining the amount of the subsidy regard shall be had to the amount of interest payable by the borrowers on loans made to them by the societies and the amount of interest payable by the societies to shareholders in or depositors with the society.  The effect of section 2 is to enable the Minister to pay a subsidy to building societies.  It would appear from what the Minister has said that the real object of the Bill is to regularise payment of a subsidy already made to building societies this year when a total of £6.934 million was paid to enable the building societies to retain their lending rate at the all-time high of 14.15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 extends to building societies, as I see it, a practice that has already <Col N="1044" /> been enjoyed by the Post Office for many years.  If a depositor in the Post Office dies leaving a small estate the Post Office can pay out to that person's next of kin the amount standing to the deceased's credit without production of a grant of probate or letters of administration.  The Minister here proposes to make that provision apply in respect of deposits held by building societies for deceased persons. I agree with that; it is a sensible thing to do and will save trouble and expense.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill repeals section 12 of the 1979 Act.  I think that is being repealed because what is being provided for in that section is now covered by section 2 of the Bill.  So much for the Bill itself as it stands and the machinery it provides.  It enables the Minister to give subsidies in order to make mortgages more attractive.  We have not heard from the Minister that he proposes to do that.</P>
    <P>In my experience it has never been more necessary to provide housing finance: never have young married couples and others in search of houses been confronted with more difficulties in paying mortgage interest, in buying and paying for their houses.  Since 1977 the average price of a house in the private sector has doubled from £12,000 or £13,000 to £25,000.  This means that people seeking mortgages now have to pay huge sums, between £50 and £60 a week, completely beyond their capacity.</P>
    <P>The result is that there has been a considerable falling off in house building. That is demonstrated in the plainest possible terms by a drastic fall in cement sales, a fall of 34 per cent.  All of that fall in cement sales may not be due to the fall in house building.  Some of it is due to stagnation in agriculture and a consequent falling off in farmers' investment in farm building.  But there is still a serious falling off in house building.</P>
    <P>Another yardstick by which builders' providers can measure activity in house building is the sale of damp proof course materials, and I have been told by people in the trade that the sale of these materials virtually has come to a stand-still since June of this year.  That means that though there may be house completions this year, new starts are falling off drastically. <Col N="1045" /> The reason is that finance for bridging loans cannot be got.  I will have something to say on that later.</P>
    <P>People cannot afford repayments of mortgages at between £50 and £60 a week.  At a time when unemployment is increasing by leaps and bounds, young married women are being compelled to go out to work in order to pay for the servicing of the huge mortgage repayments I have mentioned.  I am satisfied that many of them would prefer to stay at home looking after their homes and young children.  Instead, they have to get somebody in to look after the children or deposit their children with relatives or in one of the new facilities now provided in which people will look after the children during the day.  That is undesirable in any case but it is doubly so in times of huge unemployment.</P>
    <P>All this situation is added to enormously by the falling off in local authority house building.  I have not got estimated figures for this year, but it is clear that the numbers of local authority houses will be down substantially, far below the record figures reached by Deputy Tully when he was Minister for Local Government. Furthermore, the numbers of local authority houses at the planning stage at the end of last year were 2,000 fewer than the previous year.</P>
    <P>I should have congratulated the Minister and wished him well on his appointment, but I do not envy him his job of trying to clean up the mess he has taken over.  I have given the huge increase in the price of private sector houses since 1977.  They are not my figures.  They were supplied to me by the Department in their quarterly bulletin.  In the same period the numbers of local authority houses have been going down and they will be well down when this year's figures are published.</P>
    <P>In that situation it is essential that the Minister for the Environment would tackle this problem and provide mortgages at a reasonable rate or, failing that, provide more local authority houses.  At a time when there has been such a drastic increase in private house prices local authorities should be building more, not fewer, houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> An ugly sign has been making its appearance all over the country.  New houses which have been standing unoccupied during the past 18 months are bearing &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; notices.  These signs are visible throughout the country.  There is not a town in Ireland in which houses are not to be seen bearing these signs, but they cannot be sold.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to come in here and say that interest rates must be reduced.  All of us would like to see that.  It is not good enough for the Minister to launch an attack on building societies and others and refer to them as reactionary institutions.  Every Deputy would like to see building societies reducing their lending rates but we do not want to see them or other lending institutions starved of money nor do we want to see a repetition of the chaos that was created in the Department of the Environment during the year when housing grants dried up and there was a shortage of money on an unprecedented scale with the result that services broke down all over the country.  I should like to warn the Minister against doing or saying anything that might result in that situation.</P>
    <P>When the 1975 Bill dealing with building societies was going through the House the then Fianna Fáil spokesman on the environment had some good things to say about it.  However, he feared that Ministers might interfere in the day-to-day working and running of building societies. He said that would be very bad because Ministers and Departments do not have the necessary expertise to take over the day-to-day running of building societies.  Perhaps the present Minister for the Environment did not read the debate of 9 November 1976 or he would have found that lecture given by the spokesman at that time, the present Ceann Comhairle: The Minister should read that speech as he would find it interesting.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not take offence at this but he should not run his Department on a political basis and simply request things to be done for political purposes.  When he spoke to the building societies the other day he was thinking <Col N="1047" /> more about the Donegal by-election than about people who have mortgages or who are looking for housing finance from the societies.  At present the building societies are operating on a very tight schedule. They have more applications for mortgages than they can handle.  By and large in the past they acted in a reasonable and balanced way.  For example, contrary to what many people thought they were able to hold the interest rates without any increase between July 1979 and April 1980.  It was generally thought at the time that interest rates would have been increased by about 2 per cent but they did not take that decision.  They waited and were able to hold on at the existing rates until April 1980 when they came to the Minister and informed him that it would be necessary for them to increase their deposit rates if they were to remain competitive.  The Minister gave them a subsidy which we are now regularising.</P>
    <P>As I said building societies have applications for more mortgages than they can handle.  The subsidy which the Minister gave them last April has been discontinued and even with that loss of subsidy they are not proposing to increase their mortgage rates.  They fear that if they were to reduce their mortgage rate by whatever the Minister wants them to they would have to reduce their deposit interest. In their expert opinion the result of that would be a falling off in investment and deposit income.  As a result of the reduction in lending rates there would be a further escalation of applications for loans which they could not possibly handle.</P>
    <P>If the Minister looks around his Department he will find that over the last ten years chaos was created there on a number of occasions by impromptu decisions which did not work.  The Minister should be thinking of new systems which would enable house builders and buyers to finance the purchase and building of houses.  Fine Gael introduced a document last week which was welcomed by a Deputy of the Minister's party, Deputy <Col N="1048" /> O'Donoghue, who said he understood it and that it was nothing new, that Fianna Fáil were thinking of introducing the system themselves and when they did he hoped they would not be accused of stealing Fine Gael clothes.  The system is a mortgage linked to the current income of the buyer.  It is a type of mortgage which enables the proposed State agency to lend up to four times the income of the borrower.  At any stage the borrower will not have to repay more than 20 per cent of his income whereas at present the building societies and other agencies are prepared to advance only two and a quarter or two and a half times the amount of the borrower's income and the unfortunate borrower is expected to pay up to 52 per cent of his current income in the early stages of the mortgage.  That does not make sense.  The question is then how is it to be financed?  and that has been spelled out in this House on two occasions already.  It is to be financed by 25-year bonds, of course guaranteed by the State, and they would be taken up by pension funds and life insurance money. There is floating around this country about £300 million per year of that sort of money.  I would direct the Minister's attention to that type of finance for financing the building of houses and I would recommend him strongly to follow what was stated here by Deputy O'Donoghue on the Adjournment Debate when, as I understood his contribution, he approved of the Fine Gael income-linked type of mortgage financed out of pension funds and life insurance funds on the basis of a return of inflation plus 2 per cent.  There is a big market for that type of money at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one other point on this Bill.  One of the great problems confronting house buyers and house builders is bridging loans, a matter which should be tackled seriously.  A person can go to a building society and get approval for a loan, but of course he does not get payment of the loan until the house is built or very nearly.  That man very often finds himself in the position that he cannot build the house until he gets some money and then he has to get a bridging loan and, for some reason, the lending <Col N="1049" /> institution who are prepared to give him the loan are not prepared to give him a bridging loan.  If the law needs to be changed then the law should be changed to enable building societies to do just that.  If the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, in the short time that will be at his disposal, would tackle that and get that law amended, then he would leave a monument to himself that would be more attractive than a plaque.  I cannot understand why a building society cannot make the bridging loan on the same terms as a bank will make it.  Surely the bank will not give a loan unless they have adequate security, and if the borrower can provide adequate and acceptable security to a bank for a bridging loan until such time as his title is put in order and the house is built, then that security should be acceptable to the building society or other lending agent.  I understand from making inquiries&mdash;I did not do any personal research&mdash;that the difficulty is that it is not acceptable for the building societies to do that.  I repeat that if it is not legal the law should be changed in order to make it legal.  I do not suggest for one moment that a building society should lend money on a security that is not a safe one, but the banks are not noted for lending out money to people without acceptable security, and if the security is acceptable to the bank it should be acceptable to the building society, and the rate of interest on repayment should be the same as on the final loan.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on this Bill.  I accept the Bill as it is introduced.  It is an enabling Bill in two regards and it has one amending section in it, but let me conclude by telling the Minister that he has a big problem to face.  He has the problem of the badly housed people of this country who are looking for houses mainly because we have a young population and because people want a house when they get married.  There was a time when people were prepared to live in attics and in unacceptable accommodation and many young women moved into that type of accommodation on the understanding that it was only temporary and that in a year or two years' time they <Col N="1050" /> would be provided with an adequate house, but they learned that they were let remain in this substandard accommodation for a very long time.  Their daughters are not going to fall into the same trap.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would advise the Minister for the Environment to get on with the building of local authority houses because until such time as the cost of private houses comes down he will want more local authority houses instead of fewer.  I tell him also that unless something is done in his Department the unemployment problem will increase and next year he will have a much worse unemployment situation in the building industry than he has this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: In my opinion he will do a lot better than his predecessor.  He is a practical man who knows about local authorities particularly and about housing finance in a big way and he will make an effort.  However, he will have a tremendous job on his hands because the Department of the Environment were allowed by the Government to deteriorate to such an extent that now it will be an uphill fight all the way to get out of the trouble into which they have got themselves.  It was not because they had not the right advice.  Again and again in this House I have made the comment that I consider that civil servants in every Department are experts in their field and that they give the right advice.  If the Minister responsible do not take it, that is their own fault, and if they are not allowed to take it, then it is the Government's fault.  I believe that the present position in the Department of the Environment is the fault of the Government rather than of the Minister and it is necessary for the present Minister to be told this.  He must be asked to be strong enough to ensure that what he and his <Col N="1051" /> officials consider to be the right thing to do is what is done, and not to heed somebody who is looking after another Department in a water-tight compartment and feels that it does not matter a damn what is happening in the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister might feel complimented because he has brought in this Bill within a month of his arrival in the Department. In fact I put in a Bill which was passed in 1976 and it was the first Bill dealing with building societies introduced in any Parliament in Britain or Ireland for 103 years.  It is good to see an interest being taken in bringing it up to date.  It was necessary to introduce section 2.  I am glad that the decision has been taken to make legal the question of the payment of subsidies, so that it will be flexible.  In future this can be done by order, without a Bill being brought into the House.</P>
      <P>We should be careful about section 4. I would like to have a further look at this section because its purpose is to repeal section 12 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, which allowed a limited form of interest subsidy to be paid to building societies on certain loans issued by the societies and guaranteed by a housing authority.  This goes back to the trouble in Dublin a few years ago, when a Fianna Fáil Government failed to do what they promised and left the local authorities carrying a very large can.  The National Coalition Government succeeded in straightening out the problem. The present Government&mdash;I am never quite sure if the &ldquo;present Government&rdquo; means the Government elected in 1977 or another Fianna Fáil Government because the Taoiseach has a habit of talking about &ldquo;the other Government&rdquo; and his Government&mdash;have also succeeded in straightening out the matter but I hope there is not a twist in this which will allow the Government to wangle out of paying the subsidy guaranteed by us and continued by them if things get worse, if that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section dealing with the repayment of small amounts in the name of a person who dies intestate is reasonable and I do not know why we did not include <Col N="1052" /> it.  I think it is an excellent idea.  The whole question of building society and housing finance is so important that it will have to be dealt with in a way that those involved will realise that this is really an emergency.  While there was no increase in the interest rates charged from July 1979 to April 1980, they were very high; they were too high.  The subsidy put on by the Government in April 1980, and since taken off, to keep down the rates was very necessary.  The Government were not establishing a precedent.  I did that several years ago and kept the interest rate much lower than the present rate.</P>
    <P>Try to envisage a situation where a couple have bought a house, borrowed money from a building society and are paying back that money with interest over 25 or 30 years and suddenly lose their jobs.  Sometimes the husband and wife work to find the necessary money. If they lose their jobs they are put in an impossible position.  I hoped some effort would be made in this Bill to deal with such cases.  Credit unions deal with cases of hardship, but there is no such thing as hardship in the building society legislation. Either one has the money or one has not.</P>
    <P>At present people will not invest unless they get a fair return.  Because the value of our money is dropping so quickly&mdash;there has been a fantastic drop in the value of the punt as against the pound sterling&mdash;people have stopped investing.  I was appalled to hear a group of people arranging to withdraw money invested in building societies to buy goods, not because they needed them but because they felt the value of the money invested would drop so much that they did not consider it worthwhile leaving it there.  They considered that if they bought something which they could hoard for some time, eventually they would get their money back.  That is not very much good to somebody who wants to borrow from a building society.  Therefore, it is very necessary that the building societies, in addition to charging a fair rate, should pay a fair rate of interest to investors.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear that the Minister, after a short talk with the association <Col N="1053" /> of building societies, decided to lecture them on what they should do.  The facts are there.  It is possible for the Department to find out exactly how much money was invested in building societies, what their expenses are and how much they can afford to pay out by way of loans.  If the Minister has that information and is satisfied that the building societies will make an exorbitant profit on their transactions, he is perfectly entitled to tell them that unless they take certain measures, the Government will have to do something about the interest rates by way of income tax, which is the only way the Minister can get at them.  If he does not have that information, he was not right to give them a lecture, which might possibly have been better addressed to his cabinet colleagues.  He might tell them that if the building societies are put in a position where they have to reduce the interest rates they are charging, they will have to reduce the interest rates they are paying and the amount of money being invested in the building societies will drop considerably.</P>
    <P>The subsidy needs to be looked at very closely because it is very important for people who want houses.  There is the other side of it.  Here I ask the Minister directly to intervene and ensure that the money invested in the building societies is being spent in the way it was supposed to be.  When I was Minister it was my job&mdash;I do not regret having to do it&mdash;to deal with certain building societies which were not spending the money as it was intended.  People investing in building societies do not intend that it should be loaned to purchase farms, pubs and so on.  There is a rumour&mdash;maybe it is wrong and I hope it is&mdash;that this tendency to lend to somebody in the know is growing. I ask the Minister to ensure that this is not allowed and if it is happening it should be stopped.</P>
    <P>Money invested in building societies is needed to run the society and to build private houses.  Since the same rates of interest apply in respect of all building societies, there is no need for the intensive campaigns engaged in by some of the societies nor is there any use in a building society paying out money in the form of <Col N="1054" /> the sponsorship of sporting events.  Such sponsorship may have the effect of glorifying the people who are running the societies but for those who need houses or for those who are paying exorbitant interest on loans for houses, it is not good enough that adjacent to them can be seen wealthy people who organise certain sporting functions and who in the process receive substantial sums of money from the building societies who are hounding home owners in order that these subsidies can be paid towards sporting events.  Such a situation should not be allowed to continue and I am asking the Minister to take steps to ensure that it does not continue.  The building societies are dealing with public money; they are dealing with people who are experiencing great difficulty in meeting their repayments.</P>
    <P>From the building societies angle, the whole question of the housing situation has been bedevilled in two respects since Fianna Fáil's return to power.  First, there has been the drastic cutting down in respect of money for the building of local authority houses.  On reading a local newspaper recently I was amused at the story of a Fianna Fáil councillor holding forth in relation to there not being a shortage of money either in respect of SDA loans or in respect of the building of local authority houses.  There is a shortage, not in pounds but in hundreds of thousands of pounds in each local authority area.  The local authority in the constituency I represent have been given only half the amount they required under this single heading of SDA loans and the building of local authority houses this year.</P>

      <P>: The reason for there being such a rush on building society loans at the moment is that there is no other means by which people can acquire the money for houses.  They cannot get either local authority houses or SDA loans.  The building societies have <i>carte blanche</i> in relation to the terms they set out in respect of borrowers.  For instance, the amount of money that one must have invested and the period of time during which that money has been invested are stipulated but the societies are in a position to change those terms at will.  When it suits them they increase both the amount and the period of time involved. During all of this time we have the banks telling us that they have plenty of money for which they cannot find borrowers.</P>
      <P>When I was Minister I insisted that the banks made available to local authorities and to all those people who needed loans for houses a total of £40 million in a two-year period.  I suggest that the Minister take similar steps now.  We know that money will be advanced by the banks to some people under the heading of bridging loans but I wonder how many people here are aware of the sort of situation in which, for instance, a young couple get a letter from a local authority advising them that a bridging loan of, say £12,000 has been approved for them.  The couple take the letter to the bank and on that basis are approved for a bridging loan. Then, having built their house they find there is no money available by way of SDA loan, that they will have to wait until such moneys become available.  This puts them in the situation of having to rely on the bank who, of course, like Shylock, are looking for their pound of flesh with the result that the unfortunate couple are put in the position of either having to sell the house or of allowing it to be taken over by the bank and sold so that the loan from the bank can be repaid. Having regard to the present situation many young couples are faced with a future of living with in-laws until such time as those in-laws die and the couples, if they are lucky enough, get the houses concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is small and it is necessary but <Col N="1056" /> it does not include many of the provisions that it might include.  It does not deal in any way with the chronic housing problem. Some years ago in order to help those who would employ extra people if they could pay them, we introduced the employment subsidy scheme but we omitted two categories of employment. The first category was hotels because of the seasonal nature of the employment content in that area and the other was the building industry, the reason in that case being that the application of the subsidy would distort competition.  This Government have brought hotels within the ambit of the scheme and I suggest that they bring in the building industry also. As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, sales of cement have fallen this year by about 34 per cent.  People who are employing staff to handle building materials tell me that they wish they could turn the clock back to the time when they could afford to pay these people.  The national understanding will not pose any problem for some of these employers because for them the only solution is to close down whole sections of their shops in an effort to continue in business at all.  There is very little building material being bought.  I trust that the Minister will endeavour to do something about this whole problem.  It will not be solved simply by bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>When the last Building Societies Act was going through, a number of people were very critical of the building situation at that time.  However, we were told that on Fianna Fáil's return to power an additional 5,000 people would be employed in the industry.  I do not know whether the former Taoiseach had in mind something in the nature of a gas chamber but he promised that there would not be any more people on the dole once Fianna Fáil were back in office.  However, according to the most recent figures available there are 5,000 fewer people employed in the building industry than there were when I was Minister for Local Government.  In these circumstances one wonders whether the party in office have any regard for the employment content of this industry or whether they have any <Col N="1057" /> regard for those who were seeking money to build houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am told by people in the building industry that the only houses selling are those that are very expensive.  Those who have the money are moving from the smaller type house while some of those who retire from jobs or from business and who have a good deal of money which they do not wish to invest in a bank because of the loss in value that they would suffer, buy big houses in the knowledge that such houses will continue to increase in value thereby safeguarding the investment.  When we realise that in the short space of little more than three years the price of a modest house has increased from about £13,000 to £27,000 we begin to realise the situation into which we have been led on the basis of false promises.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very new to office. Therefore, it may be unfair to pillory him for the sins of his predecessor but he is part of that same Government who were responsible for bringing us into the situation in which we now find ourselves.  I ask the Minister to have a good look at the building industry and at all the sources of money that are available for the building of houses so that he might come to some understanding of the situation and try to ensure that money will be made available for this purpose.  I should be delighted to see an effort being made to reduce interest rates to a level that could be described as reasonable so far as the ordinary people are concerned but I cannot see such a situation being reached in the near future.  A very great effort must be made by the Minister in this regard.  Otherwise, the situation will become worse daily.</P>
    <P>The provision of money by insurance companies for the building of houses would have the result of easing the drain on building society finance.  These insurance companies have no reluctance whatever about collecting money under every heading possible and then refusing to make it available to the same people from whom they are collecting it.  This is a matter which has to be looked at by the Department, and Department officials are people who know the book from page <Col N="1058" /> one to the end.  They have gone through it all before.  They know what has to be done and the Minister should listen to their advice because they know what the score is and, for God's sake, do not let us reach a stage where we are back to the days when Fianna Fáil, having been returned to office in the early fifties on a promise of housing for all and work for all finished with no houses being built, less than a thousand local authority houses built in one year and no work for thousands of people.</P>
    <P>The position is serious and the full co-operation of the Opposition will be given to any Government who will make an effort to solve this problem.  The present Government are not doing it and, so far, have shown no signs that they know what is happening.  They are living in cloud cuckoo land.  They have houses themselves; they should talk to those who are waiting for houses.  I thought I would never again see the day when people would tell me that, although they had a site for four-and-a-half years and hoped to build on it or get the local authority to build it, now with three or four children they are no nearer to getting that house than they were when I left office.  I appeal to the new Minister to make it his objective, as it was mine, to see that ordinary people are housed at reasonable rents.</P>

      <P>; I would like to express my gratitude to the Deputies opposite for the welcome they gave me.  I assure the spokesmen of the respective parties that I will work within the democratic system and co-operate as fully as possible.  Having said that, the two speeches we heard referred in a cursory way to the Bill and passed over it as if it was a non-event. They proceeded then to go on with the cliches of it never being more necessary to have loans available.  I totally agree.  It is important to have loans available at all times.  Deputy Tully referred to the SDA loans.  I would remind the Deputy that in his last year in office, the amount of payments in SDA loans was £17 million.  Last year under Fianna Fáil, we paid out £50 million and this year we will pay out nearly £70 million in SDA loans.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a bland casual statement, he has no figure to prove it of course, that there would be a falling off in the house building industry this year.  This year we will reach between 25,000 and 26,000 houses.  That is in no way a falling off in the building industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>: It will be reached.  On the question of local authority houses this year we will build around 6,000, not the thousand Deputy Tully was talking about, again just a figure from the top of his head, and we are totally committed to a policy of providing homes for those who are in no position, through circumstances, to secure a mortgage and to buy a home of their own.  We have always been committed to social housing and we will continue to be committed to it in the years ahead and, as long as I am in this job, it will be one of my main priorities. As I stated in my first speech to the House last Thursday as Minister for the Environment my principal commitment is to the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the question of mortgages being provided by the building societies.  This year we estimate that there will be 15,000 mortgages provided by the building societies.  I am not anxious in any statement or by any action to damage in any way the inflow of funds to the building societies.  I want to see this continue because they are making a magnificent contribution to the Government's housing programme. However, Deputy Fitzpatrick wants it both ways.  He tells me he is concerned <Col N="1060" /> with the burden of loan repayments on young couples and, at the same time, he criticises me for expressing disappointment at the failure of building societies to reduce their investment and mortgage interest rates.  What is needed is not a further subsidy from public funds but an acceptance by the societies of their responsibility to follow the downward trend of other interest rates on the financial market.  In connection with the Deputy's reference to trends in the inflow of funds to the societies, in the three months to the 30 September last a total of £57 million was invested with the societies, net of withdrawals as compared with £41 million in the corresponding three months of 1979.  Net inflows in October 1980 have remained at the same exceptionally high level.  I have no fears that a reasonable and immediate reduction in the societies' interest rates would have a detrimental reaction on the availability of mortgage funds.  That is the last thing I want.</P>
    <P>When the building society Bill was going through the House in 1976, our spokesman for the environment said it would be undesirable for a Minister with no expertise to involve himself in the day-to-day affairs of building societies.  I fully accept that it would be undesirable for Ministers or government to have control of the building society interest rates. However, with the figures I have given to the House, the Deputy will accept that, while not interfering in the day-to-day affairs, I have a responsibility, as Minister for the Environment, and the Government has responsibility also to bring such figures to the notice of the building societies association.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the fact that I spoke to the building societies last Friday and suggested that this was because of the Donegal by-election.  If I had not requested the building societies to come and talk to me it would be the very same Deputy who would be asking what I was doing and what action I was going to take and asking me if I was going to talk to the building societies.  Deputy Fitzpatrick continued to contradict himself.  He said at one stage that the building industry was never in a worse state.  However, <Col N="1061" /> there are applications for mortgages at the moment which is an indication of the number of new houses being built.</P>

      <P>: The Deputy referred to the Fine Gael policy on the national housing finance agency.  There were some interesting points in that policy, and it would be churlish of me not to admit that.  However, there were some serious deficiencies in it.  For example, the proposal to take over the SDA schemes must mean setting up a central mortgaging issuing organisation responsible for issuing loans and collecting repayments. Such an organisation would need a nationwide network of branches to function efficiently.  The advantages to be gained from such an organisation must be considered against the huge cost of the administrative organisation particularly when regard is had to the relatively inexpensive local authority operation which costs a half per cent or even less on the mortgage rate.</P>

      <P>: The proposal to link the mortgage rate to a percentage of the applicant's earnings for the life of the mortgage must remove much of the attractiveness of house purchase, which is based on the fact that repayments remain constant for the life of the loan and, therefore, with the effects of inflation, such payments constitute an ever-decreasing proportion of a mortgagee's financial outgoings.  These are just a couple <Col N="1062" /> of points which I look forward in the future to going into in greater detail.</P>

My Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, in July met representatives of the banking institutions and he succeeded in negotiating the removal of any minor difficulties.

    <P>Deputy Tully referred to section 4 of the Bill and to the area of the guarantees in the local authority loans.  He said that the problem was sorted out by the Coalition Government.  They made a stab at sorting it out.  Fianna Fáil made the commitment to the people which they honoured immediately after the election on 5 July of that year.  It was a particular <Col N="1063" /> problem in Donaghamede in North County Dublin in my constituency.  I am familiar with it.  We sorted it out.  There is no twist in section 4 of this Bill.

I did not bring in the societies to lecture them.  It was not actually a question of lecturing them but of having an exchange of views.  I have the information available with regard to inflow and outflow, their loan commitments and so forth.  It was on the basis of that information that the discussion took place last Friday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said that societies should be forced to spend their money on their primary purpose, housing.  I am sure that up to 99 per cent of the money available is now invested in housing I accept that when Deputy Tully was Minister he had a problem with the societies and succeeded in increasing the percentage in housing at that time.  I am assured that the figure is now at 99 per cent.  I will be keeping an eye on that also.</P>
      <P>With regard to their advertising and promotional campaigns, this is an old argument and an old accusation against the societies.  We have to accept that in order to encourage funds a certain amount of advertising has to be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully also mentioned the SDA loans.  His record on them, on the income limits and the limit of the loan available between 1973 and 1977 does not stand up.

    <P>It is a very interesting college.  It is now the national training college for physical education instructors and instructresses and provides courses in specialist disciplines, as the Minister said this morning. These developments are very welcome in teacher training.  The work done to establish the college during the past few years was somewhat difficult, but very successful. This is an area which needed attention, and it has now received recognition by this House.  We did not have a national training college for physical education teachers until Thomond College was established.  There were two colleges, Sion Hill and Ling colleges, for the training of women physical education teachers, but there were no facilities within the State for such training for men.  That problem has been resolved since Thomond <Col N="1066" /> College is a national college for the training of physical education teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister will acknowledge that it is very important that the standard of the graduates from the college must be accepted not only in Ireland but in England and throughout Europe.  It is vital when we are establishing a new national college for the training of physical education teachers that our standards are high.  I am pleased that the National Council for Educational Awards paid such close attention to the situation in the college, especially in the past two years when the NCEA were given the task by the Minister of validating the courses.  I will have more to say about this aspect in the context of the current dispute in the college.  I have a proposal to make.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Bill that the only award mentioned is a suitable degree level course.  A degree level course means a course of study leading to the award of a degree by the National Council for Educational Awards.  In this special case I am quite happy to see the NCEA fully involved in the validation of courses and the making of the awards.  I wonder why there is no provision in the Bill for courses leading to certificates or diplomas. This seems an unnecessary omission from the Bill especially in the areas not involving physical education.</P>
    <P>We are establishing a professional course for the education of physical education teachers leading to a degree at the end of a four-year period, a bachelor of arts degree bestowed by the NCEA. What will happen in the other specialist disciplines?  The Minister mentioned metal work and woodwork teachers and the other specialist disciplines.  How far will the college become involved in this area?  Is it intended to provide degrees for teachers of these subjects as well?  Up to now, metal work and woodwork teachers, for example, did not have access to a degree level award.  I wonder is it intended to include degree level awards for these teacher courses.  This is very interesting, and it is important for many young people who want to have teaching recognition in those areas.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that there is provision in the Bill for in-service courses.  This <Col N="1067" /> is highly important in all teacher qualifications. We have not been successful in achieving that down through the years in secondary and vocational schools, and so on.  We were not really serious about the availability of in-service courses.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that only seven of the members of the governing body will be nominated on the recommendation of the Minister whereas, in the NIHE Bills, the figure was nine.  I appreciate that this is a step forward and will lead to a better spread of representation on the governing body.  I note that one of the members so appointed shall be a member of the staff of a university in the State.  I do not know how that will be achieved. It would be far easier to say &ldquo;a member of the staff of University College Cork&rdquo;, the college to which Thomond College attached itself for a period.</P>
    <P>I am also interested to know by what means we will have the appointment of a member of the academic staff of the Colleges of Education for Primary Teachers.  What method of appointment or election will be used?  It is also provided that three of those members shall be so appointed with such bodies representative of the interests of second level education as the Minister considers appropriate.  That enables the Minister to do as he wishes, but I accept it as being an attempt by the Minister to provide a spread of representation on the governing body.</P>
    <P>By and large the structure of the Bill is similar to the structure of the NIHE Bills. Many of the arguments we made on those Bills would be repetitive on this Bill and I do not intend to pursue them.  The Minister is quite well aware of my feelings on a number of matters such as the power of directors, the method of appointment of directors, the presence of the Minister for Finance, and the other questions we discussed in depth on the NIHE Bills.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that there is a strike, if you like to call it that, or a closure, or a nonattendance by students in Thomond College.  I should like to discuss it briefly. Apparently the first proposal to introduce a final part one examination for <Col N="1068" /> physical education students was prepared by a sub-committee of the academic board of the college in November 1974. This proposal followed directly from a survey finding that the form of course work grading then in operation, that is, the continuous assessment method, was not acceptable to a high proportion of students and staff.  Similar proposals were made almost annually by the college and by panels of assessors set up by the NCEA and the NUI because initially the college was under the aegis of the NCEA and it then came under the aegis of the NUI until 1977.  For validation purposes, in 1978 it reverted to the NCEA.  A problem arose in that the final part one examination which should have been taken at the end of the second year was not taken although students who enrolled in 1978 were told they would have to sit this examination at the end of the second year.  They refused to sit the examination in 1980 and the college has been closed for a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>The requirement of a degree has been stated clearly by the NCEA as part of their validation procedure and the examination is accepted as necessary by the Thomond College authorities.  It is unfortunate that this <i>impasse</i> has occurred.  If the Minister would afford me the courtesy of listening to me, perhaps I could put this matter before him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am putting forward the suggestion that the students who finished the second year, who did not sit for the examination and who were not allowed to proceed to third year should be allowed to do the final part one examination in December and those who pass it should be allowed to go on to third year.  That class could then proceed to the final part two examination which could be taken one term later; in other words, instead of taking the examination in summer 1982 they would take it at Christmas 1982.  An agreement could be given by the students' union in Thomond College that in future they would sit the final <Col N="1069" /> examination part one at the end of the second year.  I am putting that forward as a suggestion and proposal to break the <i>impasse</i> in Thomond College.</P>
      <P>I accept the validation procedure laid down by the NCEA, namely, that there is need for the part one examination at the end of the second year.  Unfortunately the procedure was not adhered to for a number of years and there was also a question of a reduction in the course work content to take into account the extra work necessitated by an examination. I hope the Minister will use his good offices with the governing body of Thomond College with a view to ensuring resumption of attendance at classes and resumption of normal relations between the governing body of Thomond College and the students.</P>
      <P>There is one small matter I should like the Minister, in his capacity as a linguist, to sort out, namely, the Irish spelling of Thomond.  The official letter-heading of Thomond College is &ldquo;Coláiste Oideachas Thuamham&rdquo; while the spelling in the Bill is &ldquo;Thuamhumhan&rdquo;.  Which is the correct spelling?  I am sure the Minister with his great linguistic ability will resolve that for the benefit of the House and for the benefit of Thomond College.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to deal in detail with the composition of the Bill.  We did this on the Bill relating to NIHE, Limerick, and also to a certain extent on the NIHE, Dublin, Bill this morning.  It only remains for me to wish Thomond College and the staff every success in their endeavours.  It must go into the &ldquo;Guinness Book of Records&rdquo; in that the cost per student is the highest of all our colleges and schools. The college has been heavily endowed by the State.  I hope the standard of the graduates will be very high and in keeping with that prevailing in England and in Europe.  I am very interested in the specialist disciplines which are being introduced. This is an area that needs attention from the State.  I wish Thomond well in the future.</P>

      <P>: I should like to welcome the Bill setting up Thomond College education on a statutory basis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is probably fair to say that teacher education in these areas has been the Cinderella of the educational system since this State achieved a degree of independence in the early years of this century.  It is easier to say that than to put the blame anywhere for it or to suggest any reasons for it.  The fact remains that the overwhelmingly academic nature of our educational system generally, whether as a result of the need to establish a domestic civil service or to meet the recruitment patterns of the churches or for any other reason, has tended in the past to militate against many subjects and to give them a low social status.  This has been even more exaggerated by the extreme unwillingness to this day of the universities to regard many subjects as disciplines fit for third level education or disciplines in which second level qualifications have any relevance to the fitness of the person concerned to go on to third level education.  I am glad some small changes have been made in these areas, partly by the universities relaxing their somewhat antiquated ideas of what an adequate second level education consists of and partly also by the development of third level education in the technological area.  It was to be expected that the raising of the status of teacher education in some of these relevant disciplines should also come about and it is certainly not before time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is altogether appropriate that finance at a fairly substantial level should be devoted to the establishment of the Thomond College of Education because, whatever else people respect, they at <Col N="1071" /> least respect the sense of priorities conferred by the allocation of resources and it is to be hoped that the allocation of resources to Thomond College will not be seen as a waste of money but a gesture of confidence by the Government and by the Dáil in the essential work which this college is doing.  It can be said of physical education, as of motherhood, that we are all for it.  But, on the other hand, it is something which has very much languished in our educational system, partly because of the expense of providing facilities for physical education and partly because, especially in a time of increasing competitiveness for examination results, it did not and still does not carry points for university entrance.  It is difficult to imagine how it ever could do so, but that is by the way.</P>
    <P>The other areas of teacher education, the so-called &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; areas, are certainly not as widely known as they ought to be, and yet over the years they have contributed to our educational system in general and to our vocational education system in particular some of its major strengths.  I was glad that the Minister spoke about the arrangements made to welcome in particular mature students to Thomond College of Education in these areas.  He is aware, I am sure, of the very intense need for more teachers of these disciplines if people are to acquire a greater range of skills than merely pushing a pen.  I would commend to him an examination of schemes which exist in other countries whereby craftsmen, very often in the prime of life but sometimes older people, can also be recruited to the teaching profession.  It is very frequently the case that craftsmen who have their craft at their finger tips also have an ability to transmit that craft to other people, young people in particular.  If we are serious about utilising the resources of all members of the community this is an area in which the Minister should be looking for potential entrants to the college and perhaps making appropriate arrangements.</P>
    <P>One area to which more attention should be paid is horticulture.  I am not old enough to remember what many people <Col N="1072" /> still remember with affection as the old rural science course in national schools, but I have heard enough people talking about it to know that when it was extant it evoked a great deal of affection because it was a very concrete subject area and related to the needs and the environment of the young pupils who took it.  I am aware that it has now been subsumed into the curriculum, but I would ask the Minister and the board of Thomond College of Education to give special consideration to the widest possible spread of this kind of knowledge to our schools.  We are in the odd situation of being a country which is theoretically and practically capable of supporting itself in food production and one which is at present importing increased quantities of food.  We are even, God help us, importing potatoes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I could not answer that because I do not buy the imported ones; maybe the Minister has the advantage of me.  Even in the city areas some recreation of an allotment scheme such as the British Government introduced in their country during the last war might help to create in all our school children, not just those who in this respect are favoured by living in rural areas, a consciousness of the productivity of every inch of our land, which has enormous economic as well as social implications in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main debate on this Bill will take place on Committee Stage and probably on sections 4 and 5.  I do not propose to go into detail at this point except to say that, given the particular background and linkage between the vocational education sector and the specialist teaching we are talking about here, the Minister might do well to consider writing into one of these sections the specific possibility of giving representation to nominees of the Irish Vocational Education Association.  I am aware that he does not rule this out because one of the subsections of section 5 indicates that he may take the people representative of interests in second level education.  The work of the vocational sector in this area has been so substantial <Col N="1073" /> that I believe it might merit special attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to make an appeal to the Minister to see, even at this stage, if he can intervene to resolve the difficulties which have arisen in relation to examinations at Thomond College.  I will not rehearse the details of the problem as I am sure the Minister is perfectly well aware of them.  It is not an industrial dispute so I feel safe enough in calling on him to intervene.  As far as I am aware, there is certainly on the student side more than a willingness to agree to any reasonable compromise that will get the college back on an even keel.  It is very sad that we should be setting up here on a statutory basis the Thomond College of Education while tomorrow the students are going on a mass march to protest against the actions of their board.  There seems at the very least to have been a misunderstanding or breakdown of communications between the National Council for Educational Awards and the college board in relation to requirements with which students were asked to comply. Even if only to clarify this area I would urge the Minister to intervene and, if possible, find a compromise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions, which were of the high standard I have come to expect in the many pieces of legislation with which we have dealt.  I look forward to the same quality of contribution throughout the rest of the third level legislative programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first substantive point made by Deputy Collins was about the omission of any reference to certificates or diplomas in the award section.  This is, as the Deputy stated, a teacher training college. There has been general agreement that it is desirable that all teachers at all levels should be the holders of degrees and for that reason the only qualification available in Thomond is that of a degree validated by the National Council for Educational Awards.  Deputy Collins also woundered how the selection would be made from the universities and from second level institutions providing the students <Col N="1074" /> for the college.  All I can do is assure him and the House that, in selecting someone to represent the university and in selecting someone to represent the second level of education on the governing body, the Minister will take congnisance of the competence of individuals and their interest in this particular domain of physical education and of the specialist teacher education.</P>
    <P>The question was raised and indulged by the Chair about the dispute in Thomond College.  First of all, I would like to put it on record that there is no dispute with me as Minister for Education or with the Department of Education.  The dispute is between the students on the one hand and Thomond College itself and the National Council for Educational Awards.  Any action which I might take will certainly not be directed to subverting the authority of the administration of the college or challenging the competence of the National Council for Educational Awards in doing the job which we have given it by Statute of the Houses of the Oireachtas and Uachtarán na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>I had an informal meeting with some students and with another student representative recently and I was very pleased that they indicated to me that they were willing to take the examination, and I think both Deputy Collins and Deputy Horgan indicated that that was their understanding also.  Within the guidelines of not subverting the administration or challenging the competence of the National Council for Educational Awards and the acceptance by the students of the necessity to do the examination, I think some arrangement can be made.  I would be very pleased if we could achieve that and we will make an effort in that regard.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the House would have to agree with Deputy Horgan that this area was somewhat of a cinderella although, as I have said in my introductory speech, great work was done in the training of specialist teachers in the three areas covered now by Thomond College.  It is true that physical education as such did have a very minor part in the education of our pupils at all levels.  It is also true that <Col N="1075" /> organised games figured very prominently in most of the schools.  It is not quite the same thing, but nobody can underestimate the amount of work that was done by dedicated people in providing organised games in our schools throughout the country over the years.  It is better now to have fully qualified and competent physical education teachers, with qualifications that will stand up anywhere in the world, to deal with the physical education aspect.  I agree on that.  I agree with Deputy Horgan that the Government have committed very substantial resources indeed to this college and I expect that we will derive educationally tremendous benefit from this allocation of resources.  As Deputy Horgan said, the amount of these resources is a measure of the appreciation of the society in which we live of the work expected in this area.</P>
    <P>The point that it is an expensive area was well made, and this naturally has to be taken into consideration in our consideration of the at least partial neglect in the past.  It is true still that points are not available for university entrance from physical education.  I am glad to say that points are available, of course, in the other areas covered by the specialist teachers.  The contribution made over the years in those areas has been great and many people who are involved in certain trades.  Particularly house construction, have paid their tribute over the years to the people who have improved the percentage of skilled workers and skilled craftsmen who owe the beginning of their training to the vocational schools.  Many contractors would say that, for example, when emigration was great from this country it was noticeable as the vocational schools grew in strength that the percentage, say in Great Britain, of skilled to unskilled workers was rising all the time due to the good work that was being done in the vocational schools.  We hope that the courses we are providing in Thomond for these teachers will not only be continued and the numbers of skilled people increased in our society accordingly but that the quality of training will move into other more sophisticated skills <Col N="1076" /> as time goes on.  We do recruit craftsmen, as Deputy Horgan has said, and I have outlined the scheme through which that is done.  Speaking off the top of my head, I do not think we have an age ban.  One of the problems, of course, is the very high incomes of some craftsmen in the middle years pursuing their craft outside the educational system, which makes it very difficult at a later stage to recruit them.</P>
    <P>The opportunity for development of rural science at the moment is great.  The grounds available are extensive, as I indicated in my opening speech, and I am totally in agreement with what Deputy Horgan said, that there was a sense of loss over the discontinuance of the rural science studies in the primary schools. This has been remedied in the provision made in the new curriculum.  I would like to see more attention paid to the possibility of providing textbooks and educational material on a local or regional basis for the study of local botany and the local flora and fauna so that the pupils learning can relate to their immediate surroundings and not have to depend on the books dealing with the flora and fauna of other countries, as very often happens.  Such books as those about the wild birds of Great Britain and the fauna of Durham and Northumberland are not necessarily relevant in Greystones or in Ballyjamesduff.</P>

      <P>Deputy Horgan referred also to the Thomond problem.  I have already said what I have to say about it.  It is a matter of regret that there is a problem there.  I think it is capable of solution and I hope it will be solved.  I look forward to the Deputy's contribution on sections 4 and 5 when he said that he would have some specifics on those sections.</P>

I want to assure the Deputy that the spelling, as incorporated in the Bill, is the official spelling of that word.  As the Deputy knows, it is made up of two words&mdash;&ldquo;thua&rdquo; which means north, and &ldquo;Mumha&rdquo;, which means north Munster the same as Deasmhumhan, or Desmond which is a barbaric transliteration of the word for south Munster.  If the Deputy looks at the word as it is in the Bill he will see that the &ldquo;thua&rdquo; part&mdash;indicating that it is from north Munster&mdash;is included in the composite word and that the broad vowel, &ldquo;a&rdquo; corresponds to the broad vowel in the middle of that word, second syllable; in general that the construction of the word meets with the general rules for the spelling of Irish words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill, is a simple one: it is to permit An Foras Talúntais to sell or lease certain portions of the Johnstown Castle estate in Wexford and generally to lease to the State parts of the estate from time to time if required.  This is not possible at present because of the existing legal position.</P>
      <P>The estate, comprising about 1,000 acres, was donated to the nation as a free gift in 1944 and acceptance was ratified by the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act, 1945.</P>
      <P>When An Foras Talúntais were set up in 1958, the estate, with the consent of the donors, was transferred to that body under the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act, 1959.  The Act precludes An Foras Talúntais from selling or leasing the estate or any portion of it but in practice this has proved to be unduly restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of requests from various <Col N="1079" /> interests for portions of the estate, an amendment of the existing Acts was contemplated as long ago as 1974.  However, because of various complications, such as the amounts of land to be ceded and doubts about the necessity to obtain the donor's consent, amending legislation could not be introduced until now.</P>
    <P>The specific areas which An Foras are to be allowed to dispose of have been finally determined and marked on the map referred to in section 1 of the Bill and this map has been deposited in the Ordnance Survey Office since 22 September last.</P>
    <P>The areas concerned may be summarised as follows: 13.75 acres to Wexford County Council for housing and road-widening; 4.75 acres to the Meteorological Office; eight acres to St. Martin's Hurling Club and 11.5 acres for possible future disposal; these being mainly cottages and gardens on the estate, which tenants may wish to buy, and some small sites which will be cut off from the estate by the new roadway.</P>
    <P>On the question of the donor's consent, the Attorney General's advice was that this was necessary only in the case of the sale of lands to the county council as the housing development might involve some restriction of the reserved sporting rights.  In all other cases, including the general power to lease to the State mentioned in section 2 of the Bill, the consent of the donor was not required subject to the preservation of the sporting rights and the rights of way.</P>
    <P>An Foras have obtained the consent of the donor in connection with the proposed sale of lands to the county council, thus leaving the way clear for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>By way of explanation, the inclusion in section 2 of the general power in future to make leases to the State&mdash;for example in the case of a request for a site like that from the Meteorological Office referred to earlier&mdash;is to avoid the need for similar legislation at a later date.  At the same time the power is sufficiently narrow to ensure that there is no danger of the wholesale erosion of the estate as a single entity.  Such a development would, of <Col N="1080" /> course, be at variance with the spirit of the donation and acceptance of the lands as a free gift to the nation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputies will agree that this measure is a non-controversial one which should enjoy the support of all sides.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is a Bill to amend the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment Act) 1959, to permit the sale, as the Minister of State has said, of part of the estate to Wexford County Council for building houses, for road widening and to other bodies.  Approximately 36 acres of land are involved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill on behalf of our spokesman, Deputy D'Arcy.  We believe it is long overdue.  The Minister has said that its introduction has been thought about since 1974 but, for different reasons, it was not found possible to do so until now.  I believe houses are urgently needed in that area.  I hope that the necessary transfer of land to Wexford County Council will not be delayed by other bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nation will always be grateful for the generous gift of Dorothy Violet Jefferies and Maurice Victor Lakin.  Certainly it was a practical and useful gift which I believe was used very well and put to good purposes by the nation since that time.  Indeed credit is due to all political parties for that.  I think it can be said that in 1945 we in Ireland were certainly lacking in educational facilities for the agricultural community.  Great progress has been made since then through the work of dedicated people in Johnstown Castle.  It can truly be said that Johnstown Castle is an extremely valuable asset.  I believe the State should have the right to make adjustments as it sees fit, regarding the overall use of the property and, in that regard, I agree entirely with the Minister and his proposals.  The gift of this beautiful castle and its surroundings was subject to certain conditions laid down in a Bill passed in Dáil Éireann in July 1945, 35 long years ago. Those related to provisions for existing employees on the estate, preservation of the general ornamental nature of the <Col N="1081" /> grounds, the maintenance of certain rights of way and the preservation of the fishing and sporting rights to Mr. Lakin.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that there is a large number of residents on the estate, living in about 40 houses and that these houses, the upkeep of which is very expensive, are of no use to the estate. The Minister, as a Wexford man, will know more about this than I do but I have been asked if these houses could be sold to the tenants, with legislation being introduced to that effect.</P>
    <P>The fishing and shooting rights originally reserved to the owner are very valuable and could be assets to the nation.  What exactly is the present position regarding those rights?  In 1945, the gate lodge was reserved to the district jubilee nurse, free of rent and rates. What is the up to date position as regards this gate lodge?  We all know that An Foras Talúntais are now in possession of the 1,000 acre farm, which is used solely for research.  We must agree that a wealth of necessary knowledge has been, and indeed is being accumulated with long-term benefits to the development of our agricultural industry.  This is of the utmost importance to every one of us here.  However, greater use could be made of this huge acreage of land in the agricultural educational field.</P>
    <P>Agricultural development is basic to the needs of the nation and agricultural education is basic to that development. We all know that the Department of Agriculture have found, and are still finding, great difficulty in securing suitable accommodation for young people who are seeking education in our agricultural colleges at present.  It is great to see that so many are seeking this education but, unfortunately, the places are not there for them.  During the debate on the ACOT Bill, Fine Gael speakers Deputy Bruton and Deputy D'Arcy pointed out that research and development should go hand in hand.  It is very important, we all agree, that research information should be available and Johnstown Castle has played its part since 1945.  It is also very important that our farmers should have the best possible education if they are to hold their own with the farmers of the <Col N="1082" /> EEC countries whose facilities and prices are much better than ours.  In the technological age in which we live-especially as far as farmers are concerned, with ever-increasing overheads and static prices&mdash;it is imperative that all our young farmers are prepared for the competitive period that lies ahead.  We need more agricultural colleges to meet the needs of the ever-increasing numbers who are applying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not having an agricultural debate on it.  Could the Minister inform me, as regards section 3, what exactly is meant by lay agricultural colleges?  How do these differ from other colleges as regards rights for shooting and fishing?  I could speak on agriculture for days but I hope that the State continues to utilise the facilities available at Johnstown Castle and improve on them in the interests of our greatest industry.  Wexford, <Col N="1083" /> from where the Minister comes, and the whole country should consider itself lucky to have had so generous a citizen in that county in the past.</P>
      <P>Thirty five years ago, Johnstown Castle was a new point of departure for a wide and courageous programme of research and development and today it stands as a monument more enduring than bronze, as a point from which really successful agriculture started.  We would all have to agree with that and again thank the donors and everyone concerned.  We are certainly in favour of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the unavoidable absence of our spokesman for Agriculture, Deputy Bermingham, I am to say that we in the Labour Party welcome this Bill.  Deputy Bermingham has asked me to say that he also welcomes it.  It is a short Bill, an enabling Bill and nothing that the Minister has said in introducing it would give rise to any concern in these benches.  However, there are a few brief queries which I should like mentioned when the Minister is replying, the first of which is in relation to shooting and fishing rights, as already mentioned by Deputy L'Estrange.  The Minister might clarify whether it was the intention of the donor that the reserving of these rights, which of course we know and understand, should continue to his heirs and assigns or whether, at a certain stage, they revert to the State or become part of the State's entitlement.  I certainly hope that this latter would be the case.</P>
      <P>My second query is in relation to the consent of the donor.  I notice from the Minister's speech that An Foras Talúntais have obtained the consent of the donor in connection with the proposed sale of land to the county council, thus making the way clear for the introduction of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether the problem of obtaining consent is one which will continue to exist after the life time of the present donor or whether again it is a problem of comparatively limited duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My third question is in relation to the choice that may be made between sale or lease of any part of the property.  Do I <Col N="1084" /> understand correctly that the decision as to whether it is sale or lease is effectively a matter for An Foras Talúntais, rather than for the Government?  Could I impress on the Minister that where land in trust is concerned, with the possible exception of cottages, it is our view that where there is a choice between the sale of land and the leasing of such land for the public interest, the decision should in all cases be made in favour of leasing rather than in terms of sale.  I urge the Minister to consider this point when he replies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>: In relation to shooting and fishing rights, these have been retained by the donors.  Section 5 of the Bill clarifies the position in relation to shooting rights and the right of way to a graveyard, which is also retained by the donors for their own use.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan raised the question of leasing.  It would not be appropriate to lease land to a county council for the building of council houses.  They would not take it on a leasing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is not on anyway.  In relation to the donor's consent to further sales, consent will not be required after the death of the donor.  I will get the Attorney General's opinion on that but I feel that each case will have to be taken on its merits where there is a question of leasing or sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange mentioned the question of a lay agricultural college.  The college was used for horticultural courses up to the time the institute took it over <Col N="1085" /> for research into soil and science.  The Johnstown Castle Agricultural Colleges Act, 1959, is somewhat misleading.  One would think it dealt with an agricultural college when in fact it only dealt with the handing over of the building to the Agricultural Institute for science and research.  The 1945 Act does not define a lay agricultural college as such but we assume it means an institution like the present agricultural and horticultural colleges.</P>

    <P>It is now 43 years since Dáil Éireann, with very little debate and not a great deal of interest by the vast majority of Deputies, similar to what we have in the House this evening, approved of Article 41 of the Constitution.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, certain restrictive provisions of this section of the Constitution have caused us concern over the years.  Two years ago the reference in the Constitution to the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of parents, which mitigated against the adoption of legitimate children however these children might have been abandoned, abused or neglected or in need of the security of a home was challenged.  The court interpreted that a &ldquo;family&rdquo; under Article 41 means only a family based on marriage and did not include a family of unmarried parents or the children of unmarried mothers.  This discriminates against the children of unmarried parents.  These two considerations brought us two years ago, in the interests of these two categories of children, to table an amendment to the Constitution.  Unfortunately, it was defeated on a division.</P>

      <P>: The Labour Party made attempts to amend Article 41 of the Constitution in the interests of two categories of children, the children of legitimate parents who cannot be adopted and illegitimate children who are discriminated against under that Article.  I have referred to the attempts to assist such children and the lack of success of those efforts.  Since then no action has been taken on those issues.  The motion before the House brings in another area where, because of the restrictive nature of a provision in the Constitution, considerable hardship is inflicted on a section of our population.  I am referring to those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  We submit that any comprehensive <Col N="1089" /> package of legislation to resolve their problems is, because of the Constitutional provision, rendered impossible.  It is out of compassion for the plight of those people and out of consideration for the need to relieve the tensions and problems under which they live that we tabled this motion.  We realise that this is a sensitive, controversial and emotive matter on which strong views are held inside and outside the House.  Nevertheless, we feel that this issue must be faced up to by legislators.  We must not shy away from it because it affects many people directly. Our submission is that Article 41.3 of the Constitution affects adversely the welfare of a growing minority of our citizens.</P>
      <P>Our motion recognises the need to review the Constitution in the light of the hardships suffered by such people and the anomalies it gives rise to.  Our motion recognises the sensitive and personal nature of the issue involved which should transcend party politics.  We propose the establishment of an all-party committee to consider and report on an appropriate amendment.  That report should be presented to this House as a first step towards the eventual enaction of a comprehensive law on marriage here.  The form of the amendment will be a matter for the committee to agree on in the first instance but the final decision must rest with the people.  All we are asking in our motion is that the people be given the opportunity to decide in the near future on this issue.  We are aware that Article 41 was considered by an all-party informal committee, which reported to the House in 1967, in the context of the presence in the State of minority religions and in the context of the relations which existed between the north and south of this island since the Northern population had divorce rights under the law applicable in that area.  That committee proposed the deletion of Article 41.3.2 which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage. That all-party committee proposed for consideration its substitution by the inclusion of a phrase to the effect that in the case of a person who was <Col N="1090" /> married in accordance with the rites of a religion no law should be enacted providing for a grant of a dissolution of that marriage on grounds other than those acceptable to that religion.  The committee further recommended the deletion of Article 41.3.3 entirely. That subsection prohibited those persons whose marriages had been dissolved under the laws of any other state from contracting a valid marriage within the State during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, those recommendations were never acted upon.  They never formed the basis of legislation presented to this House.  In the case of the latter recommendation the difficulty seems to have been resolved for a number of people, particularly for deserting husbands who fulfil domiciliary requirements abroad and whose wives under the antiquated law on &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; which we have here are still presumed to be resident where a husband is resident.  We have a situation now where that difficulty has been resolved for a number of people. In so far as the prohibition of dissolution on grounds other than those acceptable to the religion in accordance with which the person was married is concerned the case has been made, with justification, that freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and such freedom, if it is to mean anything, must mean freedom either to choose or to reject a particular religion.  The case has been made that it is not the function of the State to enforce the rules of a particular Church on their members, or to legislate for particular religious beliefs or discriminate between different sets of married couples on the grounds of religion. That is not to deny the rights of individual Churches to lay down rules concerning the dissolution of marriage or to appeal to the conscience of its own members.  The question seems to be that the State, this House, should not legislate for particular religious views.</P>
    <P>There are people of different religions, and some without any religious belief, in the State and it is not the function of the State to buttress or discriminate between various religious beliefs.  In the course of <Col N="1091" /> a book, <i>The Case for Divorce in the Irish Republic</i>, by William Duncan, an indication of the attitude of the Church towards the position of the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Church in relation to matters of this nature is given.  The Hierarchy were giving their stance on artificial contraception and they stated:</P>
    <P>It does not follow from this that the State is bound to prohibit the distribution and sale of contraceptives. There were many things which the Catholic Church held to be morally wrong but which it has never suggested should be prohibited by the State.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is an area where the same norm or same set of rules should apply.  We argue that it is now 13 years since the all-party committee reported and that the amendments suggested would cause more problems than they would resolve, or certainly as many.  In any case the time has come to look afresh at the matter and perhaps come up with a more appropriate amendment of the Constitution, one which might meet to a greater extent the actual needs of people today.  The position our party holds, I submit, is shared by many people outside the party but my mandate is to speak for our party.  Our position is that urgent review is needed in this area.  It is no longer realistic to insist on a total and uncompromising ban and that it remain in theory while the facts are that there is an ever-increasing rate of marriage breakdown.  We do not have actual numbers and I do not think it would be possible ever to secure them but the inclusion in the married status of the term &ldquo;separated&rdquo; on the census of population form would have helped in this regard and perhaps given some guide as to the number of separated people.  No such category was provided for although the matter was brought to the attention of the House pretty forcefully at the time.  The only estimate we seem to have is that given by the Divorce Action Group.  I assume they are people who have a very serious interest and real concern in the matter.  They estimate that something in the region of 25,000 couples are involved, 50,000 people.  It is by no means an insignificant <Col N="1092" /> minority and it is a growing minority of people who require some action from us in this area.</P>
    <P>We have a more authoritative source in respect of a reply to a parliamentary question on 29 April last when the Minister told the House that there were 11,150 applications for deserted wives' allowances at that time.  These are only applications; we know that very many other people are deserted or separated who do not apply for these allowances, some of whom may qualify and some who may not.  We can assume beyond doubt that the figure is far greater than the 11,150.  There is considerable public sympathy for the victims of marriage breakdown and of desertion particularly.  To compound their misery they are relegated by the State to a standard of living which is far below the standard acceptable to other sections of the community. There is a great deal of goodwill towards them and concern for their plight.</P>
    <P>I think it is also the experience of every public representative that some marriages are in a hopeless condition.  Those who are deserted are not the worst off; desertion in some cases can be a merciful end to years of punishment and misery. As a woman representative perhaps I have more access to the confidence of other women and the problems that exist for them in the area of marriage.</P>
    <P>From the gruesome details I have been given at clinics and by constituents and by people outside my constituency I can picture the marriage experience of some women.  I have been shown the bruises old and new, fading and recently inflicted, broken fingers, black eyes, burn marks, all the marks of a terrorised marriage, a violent marriage.  I have met children who go to bed in terror each night afraid to sleep awaiting the return of a violent, perhaps drunken father.  I know of marriages where the partners have not spoken to each other for years.  These things are realities in our society.  I know of barring orders taken out in trepidation, repeatedly violated with no proper protection from the forces of law for those who are victims of violence in this regard.  I cannot in conscience accept that we should without question accept that <Col N="1093" /> such marriages remain in all cases legally binding for life and that we should refuse to give the Irish public an opportunity at this time to pronounce afresh on the whole matter.</P>
    <P>It is also my experience that most of the people in the categories I have mentioned are in the lower income bracket&mdash;at least most of those who have given me their confidence are in that bracket.  Often the husband is unemployed and very often they live in grossly overcrowded accommodation, perhaps in a small room in the home of the parents of one or other of the parties to the marriage.  Very often they are victims of an educational system that has passed them by and for them there is no resourse to the more expensive legal remedies that exist in our State, inadequate though they may be.</P>
    <P>It has been contended that in the case of the people I have mentioned it is separation not a permanent dissolution they need and that that would be the answer to their problems.  Kathleen O'Higgins in her study of marital desertion in Dublin found, very much to the surprise of some people, that particualrly among the younger deserted wives many of them wanted to re-marry.  Generally, of the people in this category many wives would be first to agree that while a permanent solution should be available, and there are cases where dissolution should be available, many of them would not see it as a solution to their own problems.  I can understand that they would not see it as an immediate solution to their problems. Many of them would have objection on religious grounds.  The immediate priority for such people is to be rid of what we may term the brute who has terrorised their lives and the lives of their children. A period of separation, or relief from such tension might heal those wounds.  I ask the House is it fair that the State, even where people's own consciences permit it, should unrelentingly and in all cases and for all time deny them and their children the comfort and happiness of a complete family life which might be theirs if a second marriage were available?</P>
    <P>I have been talking about women but I am not suggesting that the victims of <Col N="1094" /> broken marriages are always women.  Of course there are men also.  I think it serves no purpose to apportion blame particularly where there is a prospect of reconciliation&mdash;we do not rule that out.</P>
    <P>Our motion takes that into account, because as a party we consider that to be the primary aim.  It may be that professional help, a decent home, medical help, may be needed to effect reconciliation, and we accept that.  We believe counselling before marriage to be a very important consideration.  It might prevent much of the misery about which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>It is a very sad reflection on the attitude at present prevailing in Government circles towards marriage, and it is evidence of the lip service only to the State's constitutional pledge to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded, that in 1979 the Department of Health provided only £25,000 throughout the State for marriage counselling services.  If my memory serves me right, more than that was provided in the same year to buy hurleys for young people.  Hurling is a most commendable pastime for young boys, and young girls too, but surely the priority in regard to children should be that those into whose care they are entrusted should have guidance to enable them to form a satisfactory relationship with the children and with each other.</P>
    <P>We were the first to emphasise the need to make efforts to equip people properly for marriage and that every effort at reconciliation should be made in the case of marriage breakdown.  We have said before, and we repeat it in this motion, that family courts must be structured and equipped with back-up services to make this possible.  There must not be a question of confrontation or of courts or tribunals treating the parties as adversaries.</P>
    <P>We agree that some marriages are and will be beyond redemption.  We must admit also that many of the parties concerned have already set up extra-marital, stable relationships, which the law cannot prevent.  We must face this squarely.  I contend that this must bring the law into disrepute because growing numbers of <Col N="1095" /> people are avoiding the law as being irrelevant to their needs.  This puts the children of such unions outside many of the protections of the law with its shameful clinging, even in 1980, to the concept of illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>The argument that many people advance against consideration of any form of marriage dissolution is that it will result in ever-increasing marriage breakdowns, but surely that is to stand the whole thing on its head.  We are talking now about marriage breakdown in the context of support services to prevent such breakdowns.  Surely irretrievable marriage breakdown has to come first, and as we have seen from the evidence we have had in Ireland, a ban of any kind will not prevent that.  We have a ban on the dissolution of marriage, but marriages are being dissolved.</P>
    <P>I am sure the evidence abroad will be cited.  It will be said that there is a growing rate of divorce and marriage breakdowns abroad.  That applies here as well where there is not provision for the dissolution of marriage.  The fact is that after the initial build-up of pressures for reliefs, the matter settles down, and there is evidence for this in Italy where there was a big demand for marriage dissolution when it was first allowed but the figures have now tapered off.  It all depends on the type of legislation that might follow the removal of the constitutional ban on dissolution.  It shows little confidence in the people who legislate to put up this kind of argument.  It would be up to the framers of the constitutional amendment and of any ensuing legislation to ensure that the whole matter would be under control.</P>
    <P>Legal separation is acceptable as a solution to broken marriages in this State.  Legal separation is not only acceptable but is compelled by law in some cases, and rightly so, but to stop at that without providing machinery first of all for reconciliation, and, failing reconciliation, to insist that a marriage exists for a lifetime, whether the parties involved have conscientious objections to a dissolution or not, is lacking in compassion and in my view cannot be argued as being <Col N="1096" /> in the best interests of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>The substitute for marriage dissolution in the law of this State is nullity and a reform of that law is necessary.  Reform of the law of nullity would appear to be widely acceptable even among those who would oppose vehemently any lifting of the ban on divorce in this State.  Of course reform of the civil law of nullity is long overdue.  The attitude of the Catholic Church to the law of nullity is far more humane, more liberal and advanced than that of the State and this leads to a ridiculous situation in which many people whose marriages the church has never considered to be valid are free to remarry but are prohibited from doing so by the civil law which would regard such marriage as bigamous.  We have that anamolous situation.</P>
    <P>As nullity stands at present, there have not been and there cannot be provisions to make settlements with regard to maintenance, to property and child custody. There are no provisions in regard to succession rights when children are rendered illegitimate.</P>
    <P>The motion proposes to liberalise that law, to liberalise the grounds for nullity and to give the courts power to act in regard to the matters of maintenance, custody, illegitimate status and so on. Such provisions are contained in the Attorney General's document published four years ago and in regard to which, incredibly, action has not been taken to date.  Legislation to reform this law is needed in any case and is long overdue. In the case of the law of nullity there cannot be any reconciliation procedures. Indeed reconciliation cannot be possible because the whole purpose of a petition for nullity is to prove that a marriage never existed, so it does not lend itself to any framework of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The main issue is that the law of nullity will not resolve the problems of people whose marriages have broken down irretrievably because the basic contention is that the marriage never was from the beginning.  Proof must be advanced in nullity petitions that there is mental incapacity, a psychological condition in one of the parties, or whatever.  Such incompetence <Col N="1097" /> must have existed at the time the marriage was contracted.  It needs to be stated that such proof would be impossible to supply in many cases.  It is very difficult to establish the onset of mental disorder, particularly in the case of a person who was not undergoing medical care or supervision at the time of the marriage.  It might be possible for some people to fit their cases into this category and perhaps people better intellectually and financially equipped would have the edge on others in relation to all remedies in regard to marriage, but I do not think nullity is the solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Anyway, a situation will arise in which two marriages in precisely the same state of irretrievable breakdown will be treated unequally: in one case it will be possible to advance proof that the defect was present at the time of the marriage and in another that it occurred after the marriage, due to pressures within the marriage, due to strains or various social pressures that might have arisen after marriage.  The first marriage was null and void and the other never existed.  This situation would create feelings of frustration and a sense of unfair discrimination. Both sets of parties see their marriages as being in the same position; however, one has a solution but a solution does not exist in the other case.  To those who advance as their argument the effects of this solution on children, I say it is very difficult to isolate one solution from the other.  Our main concern in moving this motion is the same concern and compassion for children and people adversely affected by our laws which motivated us to move other amendments to the Constitution in the past.</P>
    <P>A decree of nullity would have the same effect on children as the dissolution of marriage through the recognition that marriage can break down due to circumstances which arise in the course of marriage. Separation would have the same effect on children; but my contention is that the conflict, violence and instability of an unhappy home would have a greater effect and detrimental influence on the lives of these children.</P>
    <P>With regard to nullity, I should like to <Col N="1098" /> quote from page 82 of Alan Shatter's book <i>Family Law</i>:</P>
    <P>F.  The use of the law of nullity in the marital breakdown situation rather than a law of separation or divorce based on irretrievable breakdown, will only exacerbate the bitterness of the parties and increase their distress. Rather than encouraging them to settle their differences in a dignified and humane manner, it will encourage the assignment of blame and require a finding of fault by the court, thus lessening the possibility of co-operation between the parties in the future.  Such co-operation may be essential if the welfare of any children born to the parties is to be secured.</P>
    <P>That is a summing up of the situation as far as children are concerned.</P>
    <P>Our contention with regard to nullity not being the total solution in a marriage breakdown is shared by people outside the Labour Party.  It was included in a submission made by the Women's Representative Committee, a Government Committee comprised of employer representatives, union representatives and representatives of women's organisations, which reported to the Attorney General on the nullity document which issued to him in 1976.  Their report in January 1977 had this to say:</P>
    <P>There is a risk therefore that people in the same actual situation, that of matrimonial breakdown, will be divided into those for whom the law does and does not provide relief on <i>entirely artificial grounds</i>.  If a 10 year old marriage has irretrievably collapsed, it is of little importance to the parties whether the seeds of the collapse can be shown to predate the marriage or whether they arise subsequently. Under the nullity proposals this is of crucial legal importance because unless it can be traced back to the time of the marriage, there is no relief by way of nullity.</P>
    <P>This distinction is of comparatively little importance in jurisdictions where dissolution is also available.  In Ireland however, there will be many cases where. <Col N="1099" /> relief will come in the form of nullity or not at all.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic not to take account of the fact that this discussion takes place in the context of Article 41 of the Constitution.  While this total limitation on the development of other options remains in force, then not only will there be an unjust distinction on technical grounds between cases of similar merit but the law of nullity itself may well fall into disrepute by reason of efforts to force into its sphere cases which clearly involve breakdown rather than invalidity, for the purposes of obtaining relief.</P>
    <P>The Committee believes that the constitutional implications for family law reform cannot be overlooked.</P>
    <P>The committee further state that they:</P>
    <P>... consider that Article 41.3.2º is likewise inappropriate to present conditions.</P>
    <P>That is the provision which places a total ban on any dissolution of marriage.  It contains a notorious uncertainty, only recently, and perhaps not finally, reexamined by the courts.</P>
    <P>The committee say that both of these:</P>
    <P>... are huge obstacles which precondition every proposal, governmental and otherwise, on family law.  They express with disproportionate emphasis a view of 40 years ago and are an obstacle to mature debate which takes account of rapid and perhaps subtle changes in society.</P>
    <P>This is a view which has prompted the Labour Party to table the motion before the House.  Recognising the exigency of the issue involved and that it is absolutely imperative in a matter as personal and fundamental to human welfare as this that it should transcend party politics, we advance the solution of an all-party committee. I trust the House will accept our proposal and that the mature debate which the representative committee called for and thought desirable in 1977 can commence from today.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; where it first occurs and substitute &ldquo;an all-Party Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas be established to consider problems of supporting marriage and the family under modern conditions, and of family breakdown.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment would have the effect of deleting all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; where it first occurs and substituting the words &ldquo;an all-Party committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas be established to consider problems of supporting marriage and the family under modern conditions and of family breakdown&rdquo;.  The discussion we are having is timely and will afford us a useful opportunity of examining the problems associated with marriage today and trying to cope with the increasing evidence that is available to us that Irish marriage is, in many cases, experiencing difficulties for which new responses may be necessary and which may need a response that up to now we either have not felt obliged to give or else have put too low on our list of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion requests us to engage in talks about an issue and therefore the spirit is surely commendable to everyone. However, I feel, as does my party, that it would be more useful and healthy and the atmosphere created more likely to generate a successful outcome if we were to spell out clearly what we want to do by the institution of such an all party committee.  There is a risk that a discussion on the single issue of Article 41 would give the lie to the real issues underlying the problems of marriage today and could well afford us the opportunity of tackling in a blinkered manner an area which, upon investigation, might be found to merit other types of response. <Col N="1101" /> It would be likely that the committee then set up&mdash;assuming the goodwill of the Government in this&mdash;would find that such discussions were outside their brief. Therefore, I ask the movers of the motion to consider the possibility of broadening the terms of reference, not in any way to make the issue more diffuse or to create a nebulous atmosphere in which we could lose the kernel of the concern of the Labour Party or anybody else, but to have terms which would be likely to produce the best yield.</P>
    <P>Article 41 is one facet of a very major problem but there are many other issues and a much broader array of factors affecting marriage in today's environment which need examination and analysis and perhaps a legislative or at least a parliamentary response of some kind. It seems a shame if the first time in the history of recent Dáil years, this type of discussion is embarked upon, it might result in a discussion too narrow and confined by a committee which we might set up.  We cannot reasonably be accused of asking for too wide a brief in relation to our amendments.  There are ample precedents for setting up all-party committees on even wider areas including that of proposed changes in the Constitution to which Deputy Desmond has already referred.  Accordingly, I ask the movers of this motion to reconsider the degree to which their proposal, if approved, would facilitate no longer the comprehensive approach of everybody in this House to the real problems of marriage.</P>
    <P>The motion, in the simple way it is presented, tackles one issue but may very well give a wrong impression.  The impression that we in this House who are concerned about the question of marriage truly wish to convey and one of the primary purposes and, it is to be hoped, results of this debate will be (1) to show a real and true concern and understanding about the genuine problems of marriage today and to face up to these and (2) to resist the temptation to be ostrich-like in our attitude to issues as they arise possibly through fear or through the belief that there will be acrimony, division or unease in some quarters about this problem.  All we are asking is that we <Col N="1102" /> would talk about the problem and, having talked, and having coolly, calmly, and rationally and dispassionately analysed the roots of the problem, propose action to the sovereign Government, the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>The motion as it is before us does not allow for that comprehensive approach and, therefore, falls far short of the kind of much more helpful and sympathetic approach which our party believe would be appropriate in these circumstances. For political, pragmatic purposes it is also much less likely to get off the ground. Accordingly, I make a special appeal that our amendment would be considered by the movers of the motion and might be found to be acceptable as a basis for discussion which would not pre-empt any of the decisions, which would leave the agenda reasonably open-ended and which might also include, in case there might be undue procrastination, some kind of time limit as to when they might report.  No more than anybody else here do I want this issue and associated and related issues put off indefinitely.  That is not the purpose of this motion.</P>
    <P>Any simple approach to this whole area of the need for family law reform and discussion of areas relating to marriage and the family which may not need a legislative response but which may need other approaches and initiatives possibly does a disservice to the kind of good work with which we all in our floundering way in this House surely are concerned.  The role of legislation or parliamentary initiative to help marriages in difficulties under modern conditions should be examined in itself.  There are certain limitations to such action but it seems that there are areas of family law reform and supported initiatives in the area of marital law which are long overdue.  A committee who had the opportunity of examining and possibly drafting such proposals and also considering, as that committee undoubtedly would feel they would have to, the question of Article 41, the question of annulments and all issues which they would choose to discuss relating to difficulties of marriage today, would produce a better result than we would be likely to have from the motion tabled <Col N="1103" /> originally.  Our priority and our primary concern must be to protect, to facilitate, to support and to enhance the prospect of success of marriage.  Up to now we have failed even to talk about it and we have had some well-intentioned and some unintentioned hypocrisy relating to the sanctity of marriage.  Marriage above all is a relationship in constant growth and evolution and, accordingly, is subject to change, development, new demands and new pressures as the years go by. There is nothing unacceptable about the idea of this Dáil and the Government at regular intervals facing up to their responsibilities implicit in our system of Government.  We all know the trauma, the pain, the violence and the brutality of many marriages today.  We know also, thank Heaven, of the majority of marriages which are stable, happy and fruitful in every sense of the words, which nobody would wish to put at risk or to cause any kind of unease among the partners.</P>
    <P>It is a delicate and difficult issue, but perhaps not as delicate or difficult as some people might wish to imply.  The kind of possible elements which I believe are essential and would be at least well worthy of consideration by the all-party committee which this side of the House are asking for would include some of the suggestions to which some of us have referred now.  For example, they would include the possibility of us looking again at the marriage age which at present in relation to teenage marriages some would feel is unnecessarily or unhelpfully low.  I do not know whether it is.  I would like to talk and think about it and get expert advice on it.  It is incomprehensible to me that we talk about the indissolubility of marriage and yet we allow young couples daily to drift into marriage without any attempt at adequate counselling.  As Deputy Desmond has said, we see figures like £25,000 a year being spent on counselling services most of which are of a voluntary nature&mdash;for which we should give thanks. However, compared to the alleged concern that is expressed regularly and undoubtedly will be expressed before this <Col N="1104" /> debate is finished, they pale, not into insignificance but into a question of whether the integrity of any of those truly concerned about stable marriages must arise.  Therefore, proper counselling and the recognition of adequate financial State support particularly for the woman and the child in the home is long overdue. Relevant areas of marital reform are the updating and in many cases indeed the introduction of adequate education for marriage.  I have known of teenage marriages which have broken down within two or three days.  It is a hostile world indeed that would condemn these immature teenagers to a lifetime of alleged marriage when they had already long separated and knew no longer even of each other's whereabouts when the initial misguided encouragement that they got to get married was a memory only and when the marriage they had was never a marriage at all.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues about which we could talk.  There could be the possibility of some kind of initial period during which people applying for a separation, an annulment or a divorce would be obliged to wait in order to ensure that they got intensive counselling and help. There are many issues.  Many of us who have had the opportunity of trying to look at the legislation and approaches in other countries&mdash;and I allow for the fact that they may not necessarily be applicable here&mdash;have seen that there are areas of positive, supportive assistance which undoubtedly would help many Irish marriages in difficulty at present. These elements are entitled to be considered by an all-party committee as proposed by us.  The approach we are adopting is the right and responsible one.  That was my approach at our party's Ard Fheis this year and it was well enshrined in the thinking at previous Ard-Fheiseanna of our parties.</P>
    <P>The whole area of helping women in the home and supporting marriage seems to be omitted from the possibility of being considered by the terms of the original motion.  We have a responsibility in this House to face up not only to this issue but to all the issues.  I am disappointed at the degree to which we wait to be pressurised <Col N="1105" /> or pushed into action or inaction by forces outside of this House.  This is a democratic assembly.  We know there are problems and difficulties.  We are treating this as if it were an issue nobody wants to recognise.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to accept the spirit of what both Opposition parties are proposing this evening and to go forward and discuss these issues as helpfully and constructively as possible.  I have long believed that there is no need for party political polarisation on many of the issues of concern and needing reform. This is one such issue.  There is no party political ideology at stake, but men and women elected to this House sensing the desperation of many married people and trying gingerly to take steps towards each other and make some progress together, while not putting at risk or endangering the happiness, fulfilment and stability of the majority of Irish marriages.  If that were to be considered an unworthy aim I would be amazed.</P>
    <P>We are open to any suggestions about a new form of wording for the amendment and, depending on the Labour Party, the motion.  I would be amazed if both of these requests were to be denied flatly by the Government.  That could be interpreted only as an absolute refusal to accept that there is a problem and a negation of the responsibility of the Government to face up to the problem and introduce the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>We live in a society which is and should be increasingly tolerant.  That tolerance and that growth towards tolerance must allow for those who are not bound by the same moral, religious or other dictates as the major groups in our society.  There is no reason why it should not be possible for religious groupings who do not feel morally bound by the code which binds the majority of us on this island to have available to them legislation which would be helpful in this respect.  The all-party committee which reported on the Constitution in 1967, on which incidentally four members of the Government party served, attempted to discuss the issues. In somewhat crab-like way they tried to deal with the issues 13 years ago, and they showed us that even at that time <Col N="1106" /> there was a willingness to innovate and introduce new measures.  The proposal in that report on the Constitution, and in the one referred to in another amendment on the Order Paper, does not contain the right solution because it goes against the fundamental principle of ensuring that all are treated equally under the law and also has sectarian overtones. We should not create more barriers and more differences in our society. We should have legislation which would facilitate the evolution and development of happy and peaceful marriages in a happy and stable family atmosphere. Therefore there is room for discussion on the issues.</P>
    <P>The evidence of instability and unhappiness is all around us.  Deputy Desmond referred to some instances.  In some cases they are quantifiable and in other cases not so.  I should like to refer briefly to such indications.  In William Duncan's book `<i>The Case for Divorce in the Irish Republic</i>' he refers <i>inter alia</i> to some of the statistics relating, for example, to Roman Catholic church anullment proceedings. In 1978, 60 per cent of such proceedings were deemed to be subject to favourable judgements.  Generally the numbers show an increasing trend in applications for annulments.</P>
    <P>Obviously this is related to the increasing trend towards interpreting a wider range of factors as being appropriate for nullity proceedings or annulment proceedings. It is also perhaps an indication of frustration on the part of some people and their inability to have their marriage terminated.  In Duncan's book the figures relating to family cases in the High Court, deserted wives' allowances and marital cases in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, show a trend which has an inescapable conclusion, that is, that there is an increasing problem.  We believe we should now try to find some honest way which is likely to bring about progress on some of the issues.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to some research by Marianne Herron in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10 May 1978.  She gives as supportive statistics in relation to marriage breakdowns a long litany of factors which indicate clearly <Col N="1107" /> that there is an increasing problem.  In the High Court actions for divorce <i>a mense et thoro</i> from 1970 to 1976 the number of cases listed is 237.  The District Court barring orders in the same years numbered 257.  The FLAC cases involving breakdowns from 1969 to 1977 based on 60 per cent of family law cases showed a figure of 4,800.  This research is backed up by the information given today by the Minister in reply to questions about the work of the new civil legal aid centre. The predominent problem with which they are confronted is marriage difficulty.</P>
    <P>We can either condemn people in that situation to continue to live and languish in a limbo of hurt and pain, or we can say honestly that something must be done. All we are asking this evening, without pre-empting any decision, without excluding the possibility that such a committee might very well find that divorce is not the answer, is for discussions.  I appeal to the Government to accept that responsibility in some shape or form, and show a willingness to co-operate.</P>
    <P>The statistics on marital breakdown and marital difficulty are one facet of the problem.  There are many anomalies, if that is the right word, which arise out of the trend in this regard.  Sometimes there are fears that initiatives in this area would open the floodgates to basic assaults on marriage relationships.  It is my admittedly very limited experience that it is not law that holds marriages together but probably love and an opportunity for marriages to prosper and to succeed where the environment is permeated by all the elements which are fundamental to a good marriage.  Many of these are not a mystery.  I would ask those who would oppose this view, who would seek to turn it on its head, to talk about the sanctity of marriage in the little houses and in the little rooms in some parts of this city or in the little tigeens that have neither water nor electricity that some of us have seen on the hillsides of Donegal in the past couple of weeks.  We can do better than we have done for the people who live in these conditions.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to do justice to this very complex area in the time available to us <Col N="1108" /> for this debate but we all know of the problems arising as a result of the conflict that exists in the area of church annulments <i>vis-á-vis</i> the civil law. We know of the increasing number of church annulments and of the difficulty that arises in respect of the subsequent marriage of a person whose first marriage has been annulled.  That subsequent marriage is considered to be bigamous in the eyes of the law.  It is extraordinary that there should be a situation in which priests who assist at such marriages are liable to be charged with being accessories to the bigamy and are subject to a maximum fine of £10.  Let us allow for the possibility of the State law in this respect being brought into line with the thinking of the Roman Catholic Church, at least in the sense of showing a compassion which up to now the State has not manifested.</P>
    <P>There are the questions also of remarriage following civil annulment, of valid foreign divorces and of invalid foreign divorces.  There are also the problems of separated couples and of deserted wives. Can we consider helping deserted women who, despite having been deserted for ten, 15 or 20 years are still obliged to languish in their present circumstances, circumstances in which they are usually relatively impoverished and without any hope of being able to form another relationship that would give them back some of the joys in life to which all of us are entitled.  There are other obvious reasons for a change in the law.  For example there is the problem arising from pyschiatric disorders on the part of one or other partners in a marriage.  All of these problems indicate the need for new thinking in this area.</P>
    <P>On the question of the conflict that exists between Church and State law in this area, it is interesting to note that the Roman Catholic Church reserves the right to dissolve marriage.  The Church says that the only marriages that are not open to dissolution are consummated marriages between christians.  In the eyes of the Church all other marriages are open to dissolution.  For example, if both parties agree, prior to a marriage, not to have children, the marriage though valid <Col N="1109" /> may be dissolved.  Therefore, there is in existence already some process for what we might call divorce so far as the Catholic church is concerned.  These areas, in addition to the other areas of extraordinary anomalies that exist in respect for instance, of legitimacy, of the legitimisation of children and of the rendering illegitimate of children subsequent to an annulment cry out for attention.  Therefore, I urge that very sympathetic consideration be given to the proposals being put forward this evening with a view to permitting the introduction of the legal changes necessary to facilitate the progress which the Catholic Church and the other churches also have been able to introduce.  Discussion of all these issues is long overdue.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for believing that such discussion would take place in an atmosphere of acrimony.  Rather, in this way we would be giving a lead to the people.  There are people in all parties who are not enamoured of talking about this subject and the larger the party, the greater is the difficulty in this respect. Consequently, I do not wish to imply that there is a rigidity about our attitude or that there is a monolithic approach by any party to the subject.  Let us be open and honest with one another.  There are problems in this area and these problems should be faced.  As mature men and women we should be able to sit down together and to thrash out the whole question for the betterment and improvement of the lives of all our people.  That is not asking too much and I appeal to the Government to accept the proposals in the spirit in which they are being put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Government are opposing the motion submitted by the Labour Party and the amendments tabled by Fine Gael and by Deputy Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's position on this issue has been clearly stated on a number of occasions.  The Taoiseach told the Dáil in April that the Government had no plans at present to promote legislation to amend the Constitution to remove the <Col N="1110" /> prohibition on the grant of a dissolution of marriage, and this view was reiterated by the Minister for Justice when Deputy Browne's Private Members' Bill was defeated here on 3 June last.</P>
    <P>The motion and the amendments before the Dáil reveal very clearly the lack of consensus among the Opposition parties as to what should be done about divorce.  When Deputy Browne sought leave to introduce his Private Members' Bill he got no support from the Labour benches.  Yet the motion now submitted by the Labour Party would lead to an amendment of the Constitution to permit divorce.  The Fine Gael amendment reveals an even more confused situation in that party.  They are not even prepared to allow the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; to appear anywhere in the motion, and their suggestion to establish an all-party committee to consider problems of supporting marriage and the family under modern conditions, and of family breakdown, must be recognised as an attempt to avoid having to face the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice emphasised when speaking in the Dáil last June that the Government recognise and are deeply concerned about the hardship and suffering that arises for people whose marriages have broken down: that in such a situation there can be very great suffering and emotional distress is readily acknowledged, but it is not accepted that to legalise divorce would not bring much greater and more widespread suffering and social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate the Government's concern here tonight and, indeed, I have done so personally when meeting with various representative bodies to discuss questions of family law reform.  The Government recognise the importance of family life as the basis of our community and as enshrined in Article 41 of the Constitution.  We are not, however, convinced that marriage stability can in any way be enhanced by divorce or by the establishment of an all-party committee of this House as a first step in that process. We believe also that to be in any way ambiguous about the possibility of divorce legislation would be misleading to those who might wish to avail themselves <Col N="1111" /> of divorce facilities in that it would hold out prospects that are not likely to materialise.</P>
    <P>It would also be disquieting to the majority of people who support the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  I think that, in particular, anything less than a rejection of the motion&mdash;either as put down by the Labour Party or as proposed to be amended&mdash;would be to permit a certain ambiguity to arise about the possibility of divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to point out that the Labour Party motion would not be conducive to an analysis of what a civil divorce law would entail because it might be taken by most people to prejudge certain vital aspects of the very question that the proposed committee would be asked to examine and that would also fall to be examined in the context of any legislation that might follow a removal of the constitutional prohibition.  For one thing, the motion seeks the establishment of a committee to report on an appropriate form of amendment of Article 41 of the Constitution&mdash;not whether Article 41 should be amended.  Further, it may be seen as prejudging one of the most fundamental questions which would arise in the context of any such legislation, that is, the grounds on which civil divorce would be granted.  It specifically refers to marriages which have irretrievably broken down and many people would see this as being intended to influence, if not to determine, the issue.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in detail with the Fine Gael amendment or with Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment.  The Fine Gael proposal can hardly be taken seriously, and Deputy Browne's amendment is at odds with the approach he took in his own Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Government's opposition to the motion is based on the conviction that, in present circumstances, the establishment of an all-party committee <Col N="1112" /> to deal with the question would be both deceptive and ambiguous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: At least that rejection of the proposals has an element of honesty which, while it may be welcomed, is deeply depressing and saddening.  It is unfortunate for people who were looking forward to this debate in the hope that serious consideration would be given to the question of divorce in Ireland.  It is quite obviously another instalment of the Taoiseach's solution to an Irish problem. It is also a very interesting commentary on the reply he gave to Mrs. Thatcher when she asked what we would do in the event of the prospect of a united Ireland and he said we would be over generous in our response.  This certainly must leave no doubt whatsoever in the minds of Northern Ireland Protestant Unionists that to have anything to do with us would mean an end for them of the relatively liberal social attitudes they have in the North of Ireland on matters of private conscience in relation to contraception and divorce.</P>
      <P>The insistence on the retention of Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution that no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage means essentially that the Catholic sectarian nature of the 1937 Constitution is retained unchanged.  For those who believe they are republicans it is a complete negation of the secularism which is implicit in true republicanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Eileen Desmond gave in great detail the case for the introduction of divorce of some kind and the right to remarriage.  This was supported to a considerable extent by Deputy Keating on behalf of Fine Gael.  We are now told there is no hope, because of the blank refusal by the Government to consider the matter at all.  It is quite obvious we are moving backwards in our society. This has already been shown by the very extraordinary assault this morning on the Family Planning Act in which quite clearly the Catholic hierarchy are setting out to completely sabotage that Act and also give some kind of shot across our bows that if the Government were to take any steps out of line tonight presumably <Col N="1113" /> they would get the same treatment later on.  It makes it very difficult to take our debates here seriously because they are clearly influenced so much by forces outside our control.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State quite rightly pointed out that my amendment appears to be a departure from the Bill which I introduced, but it was the best I could do.  I said in the Bill what I really believe, that we should delete Article 41 of the Constitution.  When I was faced with some sort of concession by the Labour Party I felt the best I could do was to put forward this amendment.  I am as surprised as the Minister of State by the content of the motion by the Labour Party and the amendment by Fine Gael. Neither the very long motion nor my amendment contains any reference to divorce.  The word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; is not used in either.  Why is that?  There is a certain amount of brutal honesty in the Government's flat rejection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Dissolution of marriage can be separation of various kinds, permanent and temporary separation, separation by agreement, separation by church annulment.  There are various forms of dissolution.  The Labour Party, following their weekend conference, must know that their members are asking very clearly for a law permitting divorce in this State.  If there is some misunderstanding there I am glad the Leader of the Labour Party has chosen to clarify it. Their members are looking for the introduction <Col N="1114" /> of some type of divorce legislation following the removal of the offending Article of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eileen Desmond put forward a very compelling case for the dissolution of marriage.  She itemised the various things which she knew well from her experience&mdash;black eyes, brutality, the drunken husband coming home at night frightening little children and many other facts which we know of marriages which quite obviously never can be reconstructed. This all adds up to a sense of urgency about the problem which is completely negatived by the motion of the Labour Party which considers that tomorrow, the day after, next year, two years time or even later will do.  Perhaps another Coalition Government might find a reason for putting it off because it cannot be agreed in the pre-marital arrangements for the next Coalition.</P>
      <P>If this is an urgent matter where is the urgency in the Labour Party's motion?  I did not expect it in the Fine Gael motion but I could ask the same question.  Is there any limit to the time this committee can sit&mdash;six months, six years, 60 years? Make it 120 years.  Do the Labour Party mind?  There is no sign of it in this motion. I think it was in 1974, that we had a sweethearts' arrangement between the Labour and the Fine Gael parties, in order to create the general impression that they were moving to the left, that they were a radical party, that Fine Gael was more liberal than it had been and it was all the parliamentary prelude to the later formation of a coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Labour Party put down some limit?  I understand they were told in their conference that, if there was no action taken within six months, they would introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution. Do they intend to do that?  We are not standing still, we are not going slowly, we are going backwards.  I quote from the 1967 All Party Committee, from most distinguished members of the Fianna Fáil Party, including the late Deputy Seán Lemass, Deputy David Andrews, Deputy Bobby Molloy, the then Senator O'Kennedy and from this side, Senator Dooge, Deputy Seán Dunne and others.  In their consideration <Col N="1115" /> of the Constitution&mdash;it was in relation to other matters&mdash;they said they need not be bound by these recommendations that they made but they said on page 2 of the document:</P>
    <P>As a general proposition, therefore, it might be said that our inclination was to adhere to the Constitutional provisions which have worked well in practice, and to consider changes only in case of those provisions which, from experience, might be regarded as not adequately fulfilling their purpose.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, the provision about divorce and they recommended that that be changed.  Having considered it in this general light, is it valuable, is it some kind of impediment within our society? They decided it was an impediment.  I will read paragraph 123, page 43, in describing Article 41.3.2, which provides that no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>This universal prohibition has been criticised mainly on the ground that it takes no heed of the wishes of a certain minority of the population who would wish to have divorce facilities and who are not prevented from securing divorce by the tenets of the religious denominations to which they belong. It also argued that the Constitution was intended for the whole of Ireland and that the percentage of the population of the entire island made up of persons who are Roman Catholics though large is not overwhelming.  The prohibition is a source of embarrassment to those seeking to bring about better relations between North and South since the majority of the Northern population have divorce rights under the law applicable to that area.  It has also been pointed out that there are other predominantly Catholic countries which do not, in their Constitutions, absolutely prohibit the enactment of laws relating to the dissolution of marriage. Finally, attention is sometimes drawn in discussing this subject to the more liberal attitude now prevailing in Catholic circles in regard to the rites and <Col N="1116" /> practices of other religious denominations, particularly since the second Vatican Council.</P>
    <P>Thirteen years ago an all-party committee of the highest repute made those comments and on page 44 paragraph 126 it said:</P>
    <P>It can be argued, therefore, that the existing Constitutional provision is coercive in relation to all persons, Catholic and non-Catholic, whose religious rules do not absolutely prohibit divorce in all circumstances.  It is unnecessarily harsh and rigid and could, in our view, be regarded as being at variance with the accepted principles of religious liberty as declared at the Vatican Council and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As always we are more Catholic than the Pope.</P>
    <P>It would seem, therefore, that there could be no objection from any quarter to an amendment of the Constitution on the lines which we have indicated in paragraph 124 and we unanimously recommend that such an amendment be made.</P>
    <P>I think I should read out the people involved: Deputy Colley, Deputy Andrews, Senator Dooge, the late Deputy Seán Dunne, the late Deputy Lemass, Deputy Molloy, Senator O'Kennedy, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, Supreme Court Judge, Senator Eoin Ryan, the late Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Tully, not a way-out radical Noel Browne advocating outrageous revolutionary changes in our society but a most respected and respectable body of Deputies and Senators.  Why, therefore, set up another committee?  The Labour Party knows this as well as I do, they have read this document, they know its contents, its conclusions and its recommendations. I know the committee in making their report agreed that there were defects in their suggestions but, as Deputy Keating said, we have advanced further now and we could simply agree on the case of known facts that we recognise the ending of marriage in the temporary and permanent barring orders, in private and <Col N="1117" /> judicial separations, the ending of marriage in the High Court <i>mensa et thora</i>. We recognise that marriages can end, but no law can keep people together if the marriage has broken down.  It is a tragedy and we all have the greatest sympathy for the relatively small number of people involved but, at the same time, an important minority, not only in respect of the adults but in respect of their children, who also suffer.  There is no law which can stop people forming new relationships; there is no law, where a marriage has broken down and people are living in isolation, that will prevent them from forming new relationships and cohabiting outside marriage.  This has gone on in every country and it is going on here.  We are no better and no worse, we are just the same as the rest of them, to use the biblical phrase and it is about time we accepted the need to recognise that marriages break down and that the only way in which we can help people is to accept the recommendation of our own all-party committee.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say this because even though I could be said to have a grievance, I have not&mdash;I am delighted that this discussion is taking place; we have made some progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Today at Question Time I asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism if he will ask the IDA to proceed forthwith to erect a 27,000 sq. ft. advance factory at their site in Cappoquin, County Waterford in view of the closure of the Cappoquin bacon factory with the loss of 160 jobs; and if he will also make every possible effort to see that an alternative meat-processing plant is located in the area.  In his reply the Minister gave a personal assurance that he would take an interest in the matter and endeavour to do as the question asked, that is to provide a major advance <Col N="1118" /> factory and see if an alternative meat processing industry could be found for the area.</P>
      <P>This eveing I would like to reinforce that call and ask the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, if he would also lend his weight to this appeal to find alternative industry.  Whether it be a meat processing plant or a completely new venture is not very relevant so long as we get a replacement industry in terms of jobs.</P>
      <P>If the cities of Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Limerick lost 160 jobs there would be some comment but it would not be the end of the world because other sources of employment would be available. However, when a sparsely populated rural area loses 160 jobs obviously there is reason for concern.  In this specific case there is great concern because there are no alternatives available.  Over the years west Waterford has been a deprived area where industry is concerned. Cappoquin bacon factory, which closed early in August, was by far the largest industry in the region.</P>
      <P>The people in the area have been very patient.  They voiced their disapproval of the closure of the factory but accepted that it was inevitable and hoped the State agencies, in particular the IDA, would come to their rescue.  After two-and-a-half months they are getting a little impatient and would like to see some action by the IDA and the Department.</P>
      <P>This factory was in existence for 75 years and, as I said, was the largest and most stable industry in that part of the country.  While 160 jobs may not seem so many to some people, there was also a considerable amount of employment created in service and support industries and the factory created employment for the people who supplied the pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This closure has been a severe setback. We appreciate that matters cannot be rectified overnight but we would like a start to be made.  The erection of an advance factory would be a step in the right direction.  It is not very likely that a replacement meat factory will be found because this is a specialised industry, but we appreciate that any type of factory in these days when employment is in jeopardy, is difficult to come by.  We would <Col N="1119" /> be happy if we could see some light at the end of the tunnel.  In our view that light would be in the form of an advance factory which could be shown to industrialists who have certain industries in mind. There is obviously a labour pool&mdash;a very fine group of skilled individuals &mdash;available in this area.</P>
    <P>The factory had a history of very good labour relations.  As far as I know there was never a strike nor was there any industrial trouble.  We appreciate that the IDA were put in a very difficult position by the way the closure was announced. The management reassured them time and again that they were not going to close the factory.  While the method of operation in the factory was going to change, the management told them there was no possibility the factory would close.  It came as a great surprise to everybody concerned&mdash;the employees and the general public&mdash;when the closure was announced.  This meant that the IDA did not have any warning and were not in a position to provide alternative employment. As I said, we appreciate the difficulties which confronted the IDA and we are not blaming them for the debacle which occurred.</P>
    <P>The IDA have been quite generous and dedicated in their efforts to get industry going in the west Waterford region in the past five or six years.  They appreciate there is a problem there but, by one stroke, all their good work has been undone and the 160 jobs lost far outstrip the number of new jobs provided.  The factory at Cappoquin was the hub of an area which consists of three small towns, Cappoquinn, Lismore and Tallow.  Cappoquin and Lismore were the main towns to benefit from employment in this industry.</P>
    <P>In the last few years, in particular in the last two years, the IDA have made efforts to set up smaller industries on industrial estates in each of those three towns.  In Cappoquin we had a small firm, Cyplas International Limited, which manufactures windshields and have been in production for the past year.  They employ about 20 people and eventually hope to employ 30, 40 or maybe more. <Col N="1120" /> In Lismore a furniture factory is being set up which it is hoped will employ 30 to 40 people, but it has not yet commenced production.  There is a smaller factory in Tallow which it is hoped will employ a mere six people, and another factory which it is hoped will eventually employ more than 100 people.  As yet, the numbers do not come anywhere near that total.</P>
    <P>The IDA have done a good job.  Very often factories do not come up to expectations where numbers employed are concerned.  We are apprehensive that this may be the case here.  Even if these factories come up to their expected labour content, they still would not satisfy the employment demand in the region.  Taking that into account and the loss of 160 jobs, one can see there is a considerable problem.  The alternatives are emigration or staying on the unemployment register. One has to travel considerable distances to find employment.  The areas where alternative employment was available heretofore do not have the opportunities which once existed.  I refer particularly to Youghal which provided employment for the west Waterford region for the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>Youghal is one of the towns most affected in the whole of Ireland in recent times by the industrial recession.  There has been a series of lay-offs and closures in the town.  They have no outlets for employment for people from other areas. Dungarvan has its own problems and several industries there are experiencing difficulties, primarily because of the recession in agriculture.  Because of cutbacks in the output of the agricultural sector there will be a reduction in the number of jobs available in the co-operative societies with little hope of new opportunities for jobs.</P>
    <P>The people of west Waterford are being told they will have to paddle their own canoe so far as work is concerned. The only way they will have any success is with the co-operation of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the IDA.  The will is there on the part of the IDA.  We acknowledge that their representatives are first class but we know that matters in this country need a <Col N="1121" /> push from the Departments and politicians, and in particular from people of ministerial rank.  In this connection, I should like to congratulate Deputy Gallagher on his appointment as Minister of State which was acclaimed on all sides of the House.  We hope he will do valuable work in the Department and I hope he can be of help in the specific case I am raising here tonight.</P>
    <P>I stated that 160 jobs were lost when the Cappoquin bacon factory closed.  It may be said that 35 of the people were offered alternative employment in Cork city but I should like to point out that Cork city is at least 35 miles away and that the factory where the alternative employment was offered is on the far side of Cork city, out towards the airport.  It is at least one hour's drive from Cappoquin and it is not a viable proposition for a worker to travel such a distance each day.  Probably it means getting up at 5.30 a.m. and returning home at 7.30 p.m. Those of us who know Cork city and its traffic problems will appreciate that the journey could take much longer.  Cork is the worst city in the country, and I am including Dublin, so far as traffic chaos is concerned, particularly if the weather is bad or if there is an accident somewhere in the city.  That offer of alternative employment was never on.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to be wise after the event and to say we should have foreseen five years ago that this factory was going to close.  The principals of the firm at Cappoquin purchased another bacon factory in Cork city but because of the assurances that were given constantly the IDA could not move in and look for a major industry of the type we are seeking now. They were led astray&mdash;and this is generally appreciated in the area&mdash;as were the public representatives and the people generally.  However, that is water under the bridge and we must start afresh now.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised as to whether west Waterford should be designated as an underdeveloped area.  This is not without precedent; it has been done in many areas where there have been heavy job losses.  It is a common feature in the west of Ireland where the rate of grant is especially high in order to attract <Col N="1122" /> foreign and native industrialists.  However, it has been done also at Ballingarry and Fethard in County Tipperary where the coal mines closed not too many years ago.  The percentage grant was a sufficient enticement to get industrialists to come to the area.  Despite what the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, said here today, that suggestion should be given consideration. I do not think any other region would object if we were designated as underdeveloped.  As was pointed out, there is considerable competition for factories and we know the task will not be easy.  At the end of the day it is up to the industrialist himself to decide where to locate his factory.  A major inducement would be to increase the percentage grant that might be available.</P>
    <P>Some new industries were set up but we must also take into account the number of existing industries that closed. What happened in the case of west Waterford is that the new industries that were set up through the efforts of the IDA merely balanced out the existing industries that have closed.  The efforts of the IDA have been stymied because of the collapse of other industries and their efforts to find new jobs have just managed to redress the balance.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made initially that the factory that was closed could be reopened by another industrialist but that is not a practical proposition because the building does not come up to EEC standards for the slaughtering of pigs and I do not think it could be adapted to suit other purposes.  The Waterford County Council and the county development team have passed unanimous resolutions along the lines of the question that I put to the Minister today.  Not alone have we the backing of the people in the Cappoquin area but we also have the backing of the entire county in our efforts to find an alternative along the lines suggested in the question.</P>
    <P>We are very worried that we may fall between two stools in requesting that an alternative meat processing factory be set up while, on the other hand, advocating a new advance factory.  We consider both objectives should be pursued.  We cannot afford to wait in the hope of getting a <Col N="1123" /> meat processing industry, although that is where the skilled labour could use their trades best of all.  We cannot wait for that because it could be many years before such a factory materialised.  However, we consider that we cover all the options by suggesting an advance factory and that is why we advocated that the Minister should direct the IDA to do that.  It is our view that it would be that much easier to attract industrialists to the area.  I am sure the Minister has had to deal with similar problems in such deprived areas as Achill and the Erris Peninsula and obviously he has experience about how problems have been overcome.  I am asking him to give us the benefit of his expertise and, above all, his political muscle in ensuring that the employment situation is redressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I share the concern expressed by Deputy Deasy and Deputy Collins about the employment situation in Cappoquin arising from the closure of the bacon factory.  The unexpected closure of this factory was undoubtedly a serious blow to the town and to west Waterford generally, particularly be cause of the large-scale employment which it afforded and its strong links with the agricultural sector.  Indeed, one can readily understand the anxiety of the people in the area to find alternative employment opportunities as quickly as possible and to ensure that the existing skills and labour force are again fully utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all too familiar with past experiences of many small provincial towns which in years gone by had little industry or employment opportunity.  However, I am glad to say that in recent years with the intensification of our industrial development programme considerable progress has been made on attracting suitable industry to small towns and Cappoquin has also benefited from such new industry. The Deputy, I am glad to say, has acknowledged the efforts of the IDA in respect of this area and their achievements. However, we acknowledge the changed employment situation which now exists in Cappoquin and I must say <Col N="1124" /> that the failure of the bacon company to give reasonable advance notice of closure was regrettable in so far as timely warning would have facilitated efforts to find a much-needed replacement project for the town.  The Deputy realises the difficulty facing the IDA in not having advance notice of this closure.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the urgent situation of trying to alleviate the employment situation by attracting new industry to the town.  In this context, as the Deputy is already aware, the IDA are intensifying their efforts to find a replacement industry and are prepared to give every possible support by way of grants and other assistance to industrialists who may consider locating there.  Any reasonable proposal for a new industry or expansion of existing industry will receive every sympathetic consideration for assistance from the IDA.  Considerable efforts and resources are already being employed by the IDA with a view to finding a replacement industry.  The IDA already have a 20-acre site at Cappoquin and are satisfied that the availability of this facility will be a valuable asset in securing new industry for the area.</P>
    <P>As a further indication of the Government's commitment to help the town, the provision of a sizeable advance factory for the town is being considered in the context of the IDA's next programme for advance factories which is at present being drawn up.  The IDA recognise that the ready availability of industrial sites and advance factories acts as a valuable incentive in attracting industrialists.</P>
    <P>As regards a meat processing project, the IDA recognise the inherent advantages of this area for such an industry and are currently seeking a project for the town.  I might mention that meat processing plants are usually purpose built and the availability of an advance factory is not likely to be a factor of significance in securing such a project, I am glad the Deputy recognises this fact and that the erection of an advance factory would not necessarily mean that it would be possible to have a project on the lines he suggested.</P>
    <P>A question was raised in the House earlier today about the possibility of the <Col N="1125" /> Cappoquin area being designated for higher grants and Deputy Deasy referred to this in his contribution.  However, in this context I should mention that most projects, particularly capital intensive ones, in the designated and other areas do not in practice receive the maximum percentage grants allowable since the cost per job in grant terms is the deciding factor.  The grant is only one element in the range of incentives available for industrial projects.  Other facilities such as the availability of sites, infrastructural services and manpower resources can be more important in securing a project for a particular area.  Accordingly, I do not see designation of an area for higher grants as providing a solution to its employment problems.</P>
    <P>Other areas in west Waterford are also being actively promoted for new industry by the IDA.  In recent years considerable <Col N="1126" /> progress has been made in attracting new industry and encouraging the expansion of existing industry in west Waterford and throughout the county generally. While there have been some setbacks and disappointments such as that in Cappoquin. I am hopeful that the increased efforts and resources which are being devoted by the IDA to Cappoquin will have the desired results.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy Deasy for his balanced and rational approach to this subject.  He realises the problems.  I assure him that we will do our utmost to ensure that some suitable industry is located as quickly as possible in Cappoquin to alleviate the problem of unemployment there.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 October 1980.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the serious effects of rising costs on the bloodstock industry and racing industry and that this year there has been a decline in on-course betting with bookmakers and a drop in the attendance at race meetings; if so, if he will remit the stamp duty of 1½ per cent on on-course betting with bookmakers imposed in the 1980 budget; if he will also indicate the result of the review of the on-course betting levy which he announced in his budget speech; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I assume that the reference in the Deputy's question to the racing industry is a reference to the horse racing industry.  I am not aware that rising costs are affecting the bloodstock or horse racing industries to a greater extent than other industries.  In the period 1 January 1980 to 18 October 1980 the betting turnover of on-course bookmakers has totalled £44.7m, an increase of £1.1m on the same period last year.  Reliable attendance figures for 1980 are not yet available but the indications are that attendance for the first six months of 1980 was the same as in the same period of 1979.  The 1½ per cent stamp duty on on-course betting will, like all other taxes and duties, be reviewed in the context of the 1981 Budget, but I would not be hopeful of being able to abolish it at that stage as suggested by the Deputy.  The review of the on-course betting levy <Col N="997" /> referred to in my 1980 Budget Statement has not yet been completed.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) asked the Minister for the Environment if he will state in respect of each housing authority the date on which they applied for an allocation for housing loans which have not yet been allocated; the amount applied for; and when he proposes to make the allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Housing authorities do not normally make application for specific allocations in respect of housing loans.</P>
      <P>An initial allocation was made to each authority on March 11 last in respect of the payment of house purchase, low rise mortgage and improvement loans and supplementary housing grants in the six-month period ending on 30 June last. This allocation was based on the estimated requirements of authorities for these schemes as supplied to the Department in October 1979 and on trends in payments experienced by authorities during 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a substantial increase in the demand for loans under the local authority purchase and improvement loan schemes in all local authority areas. This has resulted in considerable pressure on the available funds, even though an <Col N="999" /> unprecedentedly high allocation has been made in the Public Capital Programme for this purpose.  The matter is being kept under review and furthermore, to ensure fair allocation of all available resources to the local authorities, the requirements of each local authority in respect of the second half of the year are being assessed monthly and allocations made on that basis to the 41 local authorities operating the scheme.  It will be seen that the circumstances of all local authorities are therefore taken fully into account.  In this way funds have been made available sufficient to enable most local authorities to be reasonably up to date with demands <Col N="1000" /> made upon them for payment on the foot of approved loans.</P>

      <P>: I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 291 on 22 May 1979, in which details were supplied of the capital allocations made to housing authorities for their local authority house building programmes for the years 1972-1979 inclusive.  Details of the capital allocations made in 1980 are set out in the following table, which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>(i)  The cost of servicing Government borrowing outstanding at 30 September 1980 is estimated on an annual basis at £835 million, of which £735 million represents interest.</P>
      <P>(ii)  1980 budgetary provisions plus further supplementary estimates passed to date for Government services amount to £2,762 million (non-capital) and £1,154 million (capital), of which latter figure £447 million is expected to be found from non-Exchequer resources.  What the corresponding figures for 1981 may be will depend in the main on the assumptions made about price movements between this year and next.</P>
      <P>(iii)  The cost to the Exchequer in 1981 of the pay commitments in clause 3.1 of the Agreement on Pay Policy in the draft national understanding is estimated at £194 million.  It would be premature to provide an estimate of the cost of the non-pay commitments in the draft national understanding since not all of the details of the measures which the Government might take to meet these commitments are yet decided upon.</P>

    <P>The total income of a married couple is exempt from income tax if it does not exceed £3,400.  Accordingly, such couples cannot benefit from income-splitting. An estimated average income of £4,000 is therefore inserted in column (2) for the lowest income range.</P>
    <P>The figures in column (3) effectively represent the estimated saving to the taxpayer resulting from the doubling of the rate bands.  The married allowance of £2,230 which was taken into account in computing the figures in column (3) does not result in any additional saving to the taxpayer because this allowance remained unchanged for 1980-81 as compared with 1979-80 and is double the single allowance for each of those years.</P>
    <P>(3)  It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to single-income married couples and has in mind a reduction in the married allowance (£2,230) to the level of the single allowance (£1,115) combined with the application to these couples of the tax bands for 1980-81 appropriate to single persons.  It is estimated that this would result in a saving to the Exchequer of the order of £130 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is not possible to give a precise estimate of this cost.  It is tentatively estimated, however, that the total annual cost could be in excess of £400 million.</P>
    <P>(5)  An estimated 13,000 single-income couples liable to income tax whose taxable income does not exceed £1,000 do not benefit from the doubling of the rate bands since they are already liable to tax only at the lowest rate of 25 per cent.</P>

The resource centre, which has the approval of my Department and the Eastern Health Board, will be functioning in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The resource centre will provide day care, overnight accommodation, work training, youth activities and counselling. It is hoped that by providing the children with a comprehensive programme of activities many of them may be weaned away from this dangerous habit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>: The development of Letterkenny General Hospital is being carried out in two general <Col N="1013" /> stages.  The new main multi-storey block is due to be commissioned in June 1981 to provide patient accommodation while the existing hospital buildings are being renovated.  This renovation, which is the final stage of the current scheme, is expected to be completed early in 1983.</P>
      <P>In regard to the establishment of a nurse training school at Letterkenny, this matter is at present under examination in my Department in the light of recommendations regarding nurse training contained in a recent report submitted to me by a working party on general nursing.  I will shortly be consulting with An Bord Altranais and the health board in the matter in order to make the necessary arrangements for nurse training at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The provision of services in psychiatric hospitals is primarily a matter for the authorities of those hospitals, the health boards in the case of district mental hospitals and the proprietors in the case of private hospitals. I am not, therefore, in a position to give in specific detail the improvements which have been brought about in the conditions in which patients receive treatment nor indeed to isolate and identify improvements in a time scale as short as a year.  In this respect it is relevant to record that approximately £11 million was expended on capital projects by my Department in mental hospitals in the ten years ended on the 31 December 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improvements in the environment in which psychiatric patients undergo treatment and in the services which they receive is a continuous process.  For example, this year I have made available £250,000 in revenue moneys to enable the new facilities, which had been completed, to commence activities.  These include hostels, crisis intervention centres and day centres; and I have also <Col N="1014" /> made available a sum of £300,000 for schemes to refurbish existing facilities in a number of mental hospitals.  In addition £1,067,134 has been provided to meet expenditure on capital projects for such hospitals up to 30 September of this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to capital projects which improve the environment in the hospitals for patients, I am aware that health boards have expended revenue resources, which it is impossible to quantify, on improving the quality of the patient life&mdash;for example, on diet, clothing and social activities.</P>
    <P>The continuous emphasis upon the development of successful community services will lead to a continuing reduction in the numbers going into hospitals and so enable the staffs of hospitals to devote more time and attention to the patients who are in hospital.</P>
    <P>The Health (Mental Services) Bill 1980, which has just commenced its Second Reading, with its emphasis upon reducing to the greatest extent possible the restrictions inherent in existing legislation, will continue the process of normalising the treatment of mental illness and will undoubtedly facilitate the earlier and successful rehabilitation of those who need to receive treatment for psychiatric illness.</P>
