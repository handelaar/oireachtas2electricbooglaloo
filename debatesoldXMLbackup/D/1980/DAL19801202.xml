      <NameTxt>Minister of State of the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that I have no function regarding control of the transport by rail of dangerous chemicals.  I am, however, aware that full information on the transport by rail of acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate between Dublin and Killala, County Mayo and anhydrous ammonia between Marino Point, Cork and Arklow, County Wicklow, was given to the local authorities concerned well in advance of commencement of the traffic. This information included details of the volume of the traffic, marking of containers, the train routes, the dates of commencement of the traffic and the timetables. I understand that these chemicals <Col N="7" /> are the principal chemicals of a dangerous nature which are at present transported in large quantities by rail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that concern has been expressed in relation to the transportation of dangerous chemicals both by rail and by road? This concern relates to the lack of control on the part of this House in relation to the types of chemicals to be transported and the way in which they are transported.  In these circumstances is there any intention on the part of the Department to introduce legislation for the purpose of tidying up the regulations in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is not contemplated in this area at present.  The situation is that local authorities are made aware well in advance both of the nature of the chemicals to be transported and of the day on which they are to be transported. This enables them to make arrangements to deal with any emergency that may arise in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that in one case referred to by the Minister, the responsibility for laying down the ground rules in relation to the way in which these chemicals can be transported has been left to CIE and that there is no input from the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have pointed out, the question of what may or may not be transported by rail is a matter for CIE and for the Department of Transport but it is a matter for my Department to ensure that the local authorities are in a position to deal with any accident that may occur en route.  One of the ways in which they can be in a position to deal with such an emergency is by their being notified in advance of the type of chemicals being carried and of the time at which they are being carried.  That is the entire responsibility of my Department in the matter.</P>

There are no funds at my disposal from which further grants can be made available this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the road authority, Carrick-on-Suir Urban District Council, are actively engaged in seeking a solution to the problem mentioned by the Deputy.  In the absence of a proposal from the council, I am not in a position to give any indication whether special financial assistance might be made available to the council.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of aid from the EEC Regional Fund, the Minister for Finance can only submit proposals for grant assistance from the fund for schemes which are already in receipt of national aid.  The Deputy will note that grants from the fund are not paid directly to the road authority undertaking the schemes, but instead, are paid into the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The urban district council together with the parents and teachers have expressed grave concern regarding the safety of the school children.  With all the goodwill possible to do something to alleviate the position, the money is not available to the council to take action. The same applies so far as the county council are concerned.  In these circumstances will the Minister give an undertaking that the finance will come from the national coffers?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of regular employees normally engaged on road works who have been (a) laid-off and (b) placed on short time by (i) Cavan and (ii) Donegal County Councils; if he is aware that lay-offs of regular employees have not taken place in these local authorities since the war years; and if he will indicate the measures proposed to be notified to these local authorities to enable normal working to be resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions on the employment of road workers are made by individual local authorities having regard to all relevant circumstances and it is not the general practice for them to forward information of the type requested to my Department.  Supplementary road grants totalling £120,000 and £550,000 have been allocated to Cavan and Donegal County Councils respectively in pursuance of the Government's undertaking in <Col N="10" /> the national understanding to maintain and stimulate employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that in both Cavan and Donegal roadworkers have been laid off and that in Cavan in particular quite a number are on short time?  Does he not agree that since these people are in the main pensionable servants it is most unfair that they should be singled out for treatment like this?  It is ridiculous for the Minister of State to say that information is not available in view of the fact that the only funds available to employ these people come from his Department.  Further, is he aware that the amount of money available is not sufficient to re-employ the people who were laid off, even though a very sizeable slice went to Donegal recently?  Will he see to it that further steps are taken to make money available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, it is a matter for each local authority to decide on their own priorities and schemes.  We have asked them to ensure that employment is continuous and to avoid fluctuations in employment.  We are doing everything possible to achieve this end.  The deputy raised the point about the amount of money available. For his information I should like to point out that in 1976 the total amount available to Cavan County Council for the road grant was £436,000 while in 1980 it was £1,115,00.  It cannot be said that we are doing anything to create unemployment in Cavan.  Since Donegal was mentioned, I should like to point out that in 1976 the total grant was £1,061,000 while in 1980 it was £2,898,000.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State not understand that if we relate those figures to the inflation that has occurred in that period it is easy to see why the amount of money is not sufficient?  Further, is he aware that in the past year the cost of materials alone for roadworks has increased by more than 34 per cent?  In view of that, how does he expect the local authorities to keep people in employment when the money has not been given by the Department?</P>

      <P>No.  Lurganboy will be served by stage 1, phase 1, of the Donegal main drainage scheme.  This is an advance section which is nearing completion. Effluent will be discharged through a settling tank to the estuary.  I am advised that such effluent is not toxic, that the volume of water available in the estuary is adequate to dilute the effluent to acceptable levels and that, on the basis of information currently available, the provision of a treatment plant is not necessary. Donegal County Council will make suitable arrangements for disposal of the solids from their settling tank.

      <P>The Minister came down to our constituency during my absence in Donegal and made a great impression. The most important thing is to follow up that impression.  What steps did the Minister take on his return from County Cork?  Did he do anything about the disaster, of which there was evidence before his two eyes?  He knows himself that asking Cork County Council to do the restoration and repairs needed is not at all adequate.  The county council have not enough money, as the Minister knows. No county council have enough to keep going for this year.  As regards the question of EEC aid, I understand from his Department that they have applied for EEC aid.  We wish to know the up-to-date position as regards this application. Do we now find that the Minister has not applied at all?</P>

      <P>As I said in the beginning, I have no funds available to me to relieve in any way the hardship suffered by private individuals in their homes or business premises.  I made that quite clear in any discussions I had with the people in Mallow.  As regards making an application to the EEC, that is not my responsibility. There is a certain amount of work involved in putting an application together on a proper basis.  Otherwise, it has not a chance of success.  At present that is being considered.</P>

Is he aware that he informed those representatives that he would make the application to Brussels for aid from the disaster fund?  Is he aware that his Department informed some of the representatives down there that no application was made and that they should have made one in writing?  He assured them that everything was grand and he would do it.  Is he aware that 30 days after the flooding, when the evidence is receding every day apart from the high water marks on the walls of the houses, it is ridiculous for him to talk about processing an application for aid from the disaster fund?  Cork County Council are not aware of the damage done to private property and homes, but they are aware of the damage done to roads and bridges which are their concern. Has he taken any steps other than visiting the area for publicity purposes to assess the damage caused to the property of people in Kanturk, Mallow and Fermoy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>A public local inquiry was held in October 1979 to consider objections against confirmation of the Mallow Street Bridge Compulsory Purchase Order, 1979.  This inquiry was held concurrent with the inquiry into the application of Limerick Corporation for a bridge order for the construction of a new bridge at Mallow Street.  At the inquiry it transpired that all the lands required <Col N="24" /> for the project were not included in the compulsory purchase order.  A further compulsory purchase order for the purpose of acquiring additional lands has recently been received from Limerick Corporation, who have been asked for some additional information.  As soon as this information is supplied, arrangements will me made to hold the necessary inquiry.

When the public sworn inquiry was taking place he should have anticipated that that problem would arise.

      <P>Premises used for public dancing are licensed by the District Courts in accordance with the provisions of the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935.  The Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1890 makes provision for the licensing, also by the District Courts, of premises used for public singing, music, or similar public entertainment.  The Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in relation to such licensing.  I am aware, however, that it is the practice of local authorities to inspect premises for which licences are sought and to recommend any fire safety or other appropriate <Col N="27" /> requirements to the courts.  It is, of course, a matter for the courts to determine the conditions of licences.  In addition, local authorities have substantial powers enabling them to exercise controls in relation to fire danger in premises of the type mentioned by the Deputy. The main statutory provisions are contained in the Fire Brigades Act, 1940. This Act empowers sanitary authorities to inspect buildings which are believed to be, or suspected to be, potentially dangerous from a fire point of view and, if necessary, to take steps to have the use of a building discontinued until specified changes are made in the interests of fire and safety.</P>
      <P>While it is a matter for the regulating authority concerned to determine safety standards in particular cases, my Department have issued, for guidance of local authorities, recommended fire fighting standards covering structural fire protection, fire fighting equipment, means of escape, fire drills and evacuation procedures.</P>

      <P>I understand that the <Col N="28" /> development in question is unauthorised and that permission in respect of the site was refused on three separate occasions on appeal by the Minister for Local Government in 1970, 1972 and 1976.  I also understand that permission was refused on appeal for an extension of the development by An Bord Pleanála on 31 January 1979 and that, following High Court proceedings instituted by the planning authority and a subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court, that court in June 1980 upheld the decision of the High Court which required, <i>inter alia</i>, the discontinuance of unauthorised use of the site and the removal of unauthorised structures. The Supreme Court asked that the High Court order be not served until January 1981 to allow the defendants time to clear the site or make alternative arrangements. Decisions on planning applications are matters for the planning authority concerned and for An Bord Pleanála on appeal and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the matter.</P>

      <P>There are some shortcomings in the sewerage system of the Borough and an active re-examination of drainage proposals for the Dún Laoghaire/Blackrock area is in progress.  In the Killiney area a major sewage improvement scheme at Shanganagh has been approved.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the large volume of applications for house construction, house purchase and house improvement loans in the city and county of Waterford and of the insufficient funds made available to meet the demand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission, of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take <Col N="39" /> Questions Nos. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware that there was a huge increase in the demand for loans under the local authority house purchase and improvement loans schemes not only in Waterford city and county but in all local authority areas.  Factors contributing to this increase in demand included the Government's decision to substantially increase the loan and income limits last February and also the quick response of local authorities to the request from my Department that they pay loans in instalments to overcome problems for applicants connected with bridging loan facilities.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in considerable pressure on the available funds, although an unprecedently high allocation had been made available in the Public Capital Programme for this purpose.  The matter is being kept under review and, furthermore, to ensure fair allocation of all available resources the requirements of each authority have since the end of June been assessed monthly and allocations made on that basis to the 41 local authorities operating the schemes.</P>
      <P>An initial capital allocation of £700,000 was made to Waterford County Council in respect of the six month period ended on 30 June last.  This allocation was based on the estimated requirement of the council as supplied to the Department in October 1979 and on trends in payments by the council during 1979.  Since July 1 a total of £519,000 has issued to the council from the Local Loans Fund.  A further instalment of £100,000 will issue from the fund on November 28 1980 and an additional instalment of £44,000 will be made available in December to bring to £1,173,000 the amount available from the fund for 1980.  In addition, the council had available from its own internal capital resources a sum of £200,000 for expenditure on the loan schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as Waterford Corporation are concerned, the position is that an initial capital allocation of £300,000 was made in respect of the six month period ended on 30 June last.  At 21 November, a total of £516,000 had issued to the corporation <Col N="40" /> from the Local Loans Fund.  In addition, the corporation had available at 31 October from their own internal capital resources a sum of £270,000 for expenditure on the loan schemes.  An additional instalment will issue to the corporation from the Local Loans Fund at the beginning of December.</P>

It was going to be a fair trick.  Now can the Minister explain what his reply has to do with the price of butter and Question No. 35?  It is not that he was not warned.</P>

It is true that it was put to our Whip this morning but there has not been an opportunity for discussion.  I have not undertaken that a time would be given for such a discussion but neither have I said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It depends on what programme of work can be achieved between now and the recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend section 23 of the Gas Act, 1976 by raising the limit on aggregate borrowings by Bord Gáis Éireann for capital purposes from £25 million to £30 million.  In tandem with the increase of aggregate borrowings of £30 million the Bill also proposes to amend section 25 of the Act by raising from £25 million to £30 million the aggregate of such borrowings which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to enable the board to borrow in order to continue with their gas distribution projects in the Cork area.  To date the total borrowings of the board amount to about £24½ million.  This leaves an insufficient leeway for borrowings for capital projects for the remainder of the year and leaves no scope for borrowing in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies know, following the natural gas find off Kinsale Head, Bord Gáis Éireann were established under the Gas Act, 1976 to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas.  The board are to be congratulated for the diligence with which they have carried out their duties in the intervening years <Col N="116" /> since their formation.  A transmission system from the offtake point at Inch to the ESB generating station at Marina was completed in 1977 ahead of time and within budget.  A spurline to supply Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta at Marino Point was also completed in 1977.  Spur pipelines were constructed to the ESB generating station at Aghada in 1979 and to the IDA industrial estates at Little Island and the Mahon Peninsula.</P>
    <P>Construction work on the natural gas pipeline to the Cork Gas Company works in Cork city was started by the board at the end of 1979 and completed in mid-1980. On 14 November last initial supplies of Kinsale gas were delivered to the company.  Initially the company will supply town gas reformed from natural gas.</P>
    <P>Conversion of all consumer appliances to use natural gas directly is being planned and will be undertaken over the next four years.  The Cork Gas Company plan that by 31 December this year all gas supply to their 27,000 customers will have natural gas as the feedstock.  A further extension of the natural gas pipeline to Ringaskiddy was recently completed. This will supply Irish Steel, and the IDA industrial estate at Ringaskiddy.  These are the hard core of projects for which capital borrowings of £24½ million were made by the board.</P>
    <P>As a result of the availability of Kinsale gas in the Cork area about 600 extra jobs have already been created.  About 652 jobs will become available arising out of industrial projects for which an allocation of natural gas has been already approved and there is the prospect of further jobs in connection with future natural gas based industries.</P>
    <P>The gas from Kinsale Head field is almost pure methane.  It is virtually sulphur free and has a high calorific value. It is thus a highly efficient and valuable fuel source, and should not be allocated in a haphazard way.  The Town Gas Industry Review Committee concluded that, pending the implementation of a reform programme within Dublin Gas and a decision on the question of a Cork/Dublin gas grid, a restrictive policy should be adopted in regard to new allocations of Kinsale gas.  I agree with that <Col N="117" /> conclusion.  I have decided that pending a decision on the Cork/Dublin pipeline allocations to industry by BGE should be confined to new industrial undertakings where the use of natural gas would be a premium use and where its availability would be a major consideration in the decision to set up the industry here.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate to emphasise at this stage that this Bill relates specifically to the raising of the board's borrowing powers to finance projects in the Cork area.  This extension of BGE's borrowing powers is independent from and is not intended to pre-empt a decision on the feasibility of building a Cork/Dublin pipeline.</P>
    <P>The Cork/Dublin gas pipeline project is composed of three elements.  First, Bord Gáis Éireann have been asked to undertake a detailed feasibility study in line with best commercial practice encompassing the design, routing and costing of such a pipeline.  The second element is the implementation by Dublin Gas Company of a development plan for the company.  Consumers Gas, Toronto, were commissioned by Dublin Gas to examine the company's operation and recommend a strategy for the company which would make it a suitable vehicle for the efficient distribution of natural gas.  Dublin Gas progress in achieving the performance targets set by the consultants is being monitored by my Department. A works agreement is currently being negotiated between Dublin Gas management and unions as an essential step in the reform programme.  The third element is the preparation of a financial package to enable the project to go ahead.  No decision will be taken on the supply of natural gas to Dublin Gas Company in advance of the satisfactory conclusion of BGE's feasibility study and the demonstration by Dublin Gas Company, through the successful implementation of the reform programme, of their capability to distribute natural gas efficiently, cost-effectively and safely.  If at that stage a Government decision is taken to go ahead, the necessary legislation will be introduced.</P>
    <P>In the light of this I feel sure that the House will agree that it would be premature <Col N="118" /> to debate this aspect at the present time.  Bearing in mind the achievements of Bord Gáis Éireann to date in meeting the purposes for which it was established.  I am confident that the House will support this Bill which is designed solely to enable the board to borrow for projects in the Cork area over the next few years.  I therefore recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put before the House, and not for the first time, a few axioms about this natural gas resource.  I feel I am speaking to a sympathetic audience, in the Minister at least.  He seems to have been making the right noises right across the energy board over the last year, but he does not seem to have gone very far beyond noise to date.  I am optimistic that if he is still in charge of this Department in a few years' time &mdash; naturally I hope he will not be for political reasons &mdash; we will see better results than might have been expected under his predecessor.</P>
      <P>While I think I am speaking to somebody who is sympathetic in a general way to the sort of consideration which seems important to me, the Minister's speech today shows him insufficiently sensitive to the reality of what a natural gas resource is.  The first thing to notice about an important resource of this kind is that you cannot put a value on it.  It is priceless &mdash; I do not mean that in a glib or unconsidered sense but in an exact sense &mdash; in as much as any value put on it is likely to be rendered out of date tomorrow or next year, depending on what happens to oil prices, something we do not control, but which clearly represents a standard for measuring the value of energy as universal as the habit the world had of measuring money value in dollars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a resource on which we cannot put a final price.  It is no use saying &mdash; I know the Minister has not fallen into such a primitive mistake &mdash; that this resource is worth so much.  It is on an assumption which is almost certain to be disproved, namely, that the price of oil will remain constant in the foreseeable future.  On the experience of the seventies the contrary seems more likely. <Col N="119" /> Where we have a resource of an indeterminate value &mdash; which is physically finite because we know there is a limit to how much there is under the seabed &mdash; the obvious course in the national interest is to economise and devote it to uses which will waste it least and will effect the most saving in the oil fuel which has to be imported at such a ghastly cost to our trade balance.</P>
    <P>That seems to suggest that, independent of what the Minister or his predecessor may think of the Dublin Gas Company, independent of what the Toronto Gas Company may make of them, independent of whether they are being fairly criticised, and independent of whether they succeed in improving their practices, the Government should take a decision in practice to build this pipeline and supply gas to the Dublin consumers, who already outnumber many times the gas consumers in Cork city.  I am speaking now of domestic consumers, and not the potential industrial consumers, who will grow even more in number as this resource becomes available and if it is competitive with electricity generated very largely from oil.</P>
    <P>Dublin is not the end of it.  The gas pipeline, having gone 160 miles, could well travel another 60 miles to reach Drogheda and Dundalk heavily industrialised towns by Irish standards, and then reach the Border.  Let me claim, I hope not in a raucous spirit of party self-congratulation, that we were many months in advance even of the Minister, in advocating in print in our policy document earlier this year that we should be aiming ultimately at a pipeline connection which would enable us to sell gas to the North of Ireland.  We should be thinking not only in terms of possibly selling gas to Belfast but in terms of the pipeline being an infrastructural bonus which will not be exhausted when the Kinsale field has been exhausted, because the same pipeline can be used to transport gas in the other direction.</P>
    <P>An expansion of gas consumption in the North would likely induce the extension to the North of the gas network which already exists in Scotland, and the <Col N="120" /> making available to the North of Ireland of North Sea gas.  When that moment comes, if we have that pipeline, we in the Republic will be in a position to benefit equally and to buy, if the self-elected gentlemen who believe in saying things with bombs will permit us, gas from fields which are enormously larger than ours.</P>
    <P>Under all these heads it appears that the case for a pipeline is unanswerable. The resource is finite and is of incalculable and obviously increasing value. Therefore the argument for economising and using it in a way that the conversion and transition losses are least becomes stronger every day.  The argument becomes stronger every day for using it for home heating and cooking in large towns.  This will lead to economies in the use of electricity which has to be generated from imported oil.  I am informed by expert friends that the same pipeline can be used for transporting hydrogen as well as natural gas when the technology arrives which will make it economical to use this energy source instead of natural gas.</P>
    <P>The provision of a pipeline from Cork to Dublin and beyond will provide a great deal of employment.  I realise that is not the only component in the cost &mdash; I have not left the ground and forgotten the cost of this product which is very likely to over-run any projections we might now make &mdash; but the employment content would be enormous and would be widely spread through seven or eight counties. I am not saying that the difference to the State of paying social welfare benefits to people who do not have jobs and paying them for productive work is nothing, but when one takes into account that the State will have a certain tax take from the wages of the large numbers employed on such work, it seems to be a highly attractive proposition in the likely unemployment climate of the Republic in the eighties.</P>
    <P>In addition to constructing the pipeline, there will be a great deal of employment in Dublin city laying the extra pipes necessary to provide an extended supply to a larger number of consumers.  This, in turn, suggests that one of the gas company's  <Col N="121" /> problems may be solved through such a project, because that company, who have substantially cut down on the numbers by which they were overstaffed, still have a large number of employees one could call &ldquo;gas engineers&rdquo;.  If these are let go, or, if on retirement, are not replaced, where are we going to get them again, where are we going to find and train them again?  The gas company have a skilled resource in their employees here &mdash; I do not pretend to know enough about it to dictate to them how many they should keep, how many they should replace, and how many they should not replace but it seems that the project of extending the Dublin City Gas network will provide guaranteed secure employment for a large number of gas engineers and remove from the gas company the stigma of being featherbedded or overstaffed.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to the Bill, it is a Bill of a very ordinary kind.  Virtually every semi-State body which has an industrial dimension, and even many who have not, have their borrowing powers and the State's guaranteed powers increased by the Bill.  We have no fault to find with it and the Minister's explanation for the reason is perfectly adequate. The relevance of what we are talking about here to the oil prospects further off the cost is actually quite strong. Already voices have been raised&mdash;I do not mean just my voice or the voices of people on this side of the House or people in politics&mdash;I mean voices outside, warning us that the most insane course that the State and the people could take would be to regard an oil find as something which relieved them of the necessity to run an efficient economy any longer, that the royalties on the State's share of the take would be sufficient to provide everything we need to pay the public service costs which run away with such an enormous proportion of the budget and to give us all a highly increased standard of living, lower taxes and so on.  That is a crazy way of looking at it and I hope that even Deputy Haughey's Government will not lend itself to any such encouragement of the people to illusions, illusions of the kind which the British Government <Col N="122" /> harboured, and look at the condition they are in today.  The Government, any Government, should take a firm decision in regard to windfalls which may take place from oil finds in Irish waters around the Irish shelf, namely that every last halfpenny deriving from royalties or from the State's share of the take in whatever form it accrues, should go into a special infrastructural fund.  Not one halfpenny of that fund should be devoted to the relief of current taxation, merely in order to make it easy to pay current wages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree, I appreciate that. Naturally one cannot dictate the time scale of the pipeline&mdash;God knows when oil will be found in commercial quantities, brought ashore and processed or when the State will get its hands on any money, but the gas pipeline project seems to be pre-eminently a project of an infrastructural kind, along with many others I could mention, to which the income from an oil find could be appropriately devoted and for which it should be earmarked.  I can think of very many others which have got a certain relevance to energy conservation.  One of my own favourites&mdash;the Tánaiste will not be surprised to hear&mdash;is the building of an underground or partly underground railway system in Dublin.  We must be the last city in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am saying is, there is no shortage of large scale, colossally expensive infrastructural projects which this country desperately needs and to <Col N="123" /> which oil revenue should be devoted.  The pipeline, which will be a very expensive undertaking from Cork to Dublin, and beyond I hope, is certainly one of these. There are others which are of relevance to energy conservation.  Anything which will relieve the ghastly traffic shambles in and around Dublin, in particular on the routes between Dublin port and the trunk roads which themselves are very bad, must necessarily contribute to energy conservation as well as to many other things which make life easier and more efficient.</P>
      <P>I urge the Tánaiste&mdash;I am sure he is sympathetic in a general way to this&mdash;to press and throw his weight behind the argument that there must be no question of absorbing any such thing as an energy windfall by way of meeting current expenditure.  The pipeline is pre-eminently a project which might be financed&mdash;I do not think it can be financed immediately, but retrospectively perhaps.  At every available opportunity that message should be hammered home in relation to the Cork-Dublin pipeline which will cost, take a flying guess at the figure, some figures are as low as £70 million, some figures are as high as £200 million, take a medium figure, £120 million, which is a lot of money. It is not a lot of money when trying to win an election; one can throw away that much revenue with the stroke of a pen. That is no problem to Senator Eoin Ryan but it is a problem to most of us, to lay our hands on that kind of money.  I urge the Tánaiste that it should become an article of faith with his Government, as I hope it will with ours, that revenues of this kind should be earmarked only for major, badly needed infrastructural development and for nothing else.  The Cork-Dublin pipeline is certainly my number one candidate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Tánaiste on the exceptional diligence with which he has handled the energy question. I hope, in relation to the operation of An Bord Gáis, that he will be forthcoming on the general strategy which he proposes to operate in this area.  There <Col N="124" /> are a number of entirely unsatisfactory problems facing members of the Houses of the Oireachtas in dealing with this question.  I do not know, and I am not able to comment on the precise agreement between An Bord Gáis, the State and Marathon.  Unless one has, in relation to the Kinsale Gas field, the precise basis of the agreement, it is quite impossible for any Deputy to talk about raising the moneys and supporting the raising of the moneys contained in the proposal for the amendment of the Gas Act, 1976.  We do know that there is a substantial field. It has been stated that the Cork gas field produces 125 million cubic feet per day. We do not know how much will be taken each day.  Can the Minister say what exactly is being taken out of this field each day?  What exactly is being paid per 1,000 cubic feet?  At what rate of extraction is this production agreed?  Whether it be the United Kingdom, France or any of the other countries with an interest in this area I would submit that members of their national Legislatures have all this information fully available in public. It is absolutely in the public interest that all the information be placed before this House.</P>
      <P>I want to ask some critical and necessary questions in regard to the situation. So far we have a transmission system from the off-take point at Inch to the ESB generating station at Marina.  I should like to know what exactly the ESB are paying as of now for their product. Perhaps the information is public knowledge&mdash;perhaps the ESB are willing to make it public knowledge&mdash;but we are entitled to know.  Otherwise it is quite impossible for Members of this House to make an economic assessment of the effective utillisation of this gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that a spurline to supply Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta at Marino Point was also completed in 1977.  I put the question directly to the Minister: What ate NET paying per 1,000 cubic feet as of now to An Bord Gáis Éireann for the gas feedstock which they are using at present?  Unless the answer to that simple question is public knowledge I would submit it is not possible at all for <Col N="125" /> Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to assess the overall viability and role of Bord Gáis Éireann <i>vis-à-vis</i> NET or Marathon. Unless that information is publicly available it is out of the question for anybody to comment coherently on this problem.</P>
    <P>In an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, 26 June, 1980 it was stated by Colm Rapple:</P>
    <P>NET is getting its supplies of natural gas this year at little more than 64p per 1,000 cubic feet.  That is the price being paid by Bord Gáis to Marathon and it is about eight times below the energy related price of natural gas.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>In other words, to buy oil of an equivalent amount would cost eight times as much.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister: is Colm Rapple right or wrong?  The public and these Houses are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>The Minister further said in the course of his remarks:</P>
    <P>Spur pipelines were constructed to the ESB generating station at Aghada in 1979 and to the IDA industrial estates at Little Island and the Mahon Peninsula.</P>
    <P>What is being paid by the ESB in relation to their production facility at Aghada? What is being paid for the gas from this spur pipeline?  From public statements made by the board we know what they pay for oil; they do not particularly hide the cost per ton of oil into their conventional oil-fired generating stations.  There is no way in which I would give an unqualified endorsement of the Bill before the House without having that information. The Minister said also that a further extension of the natural gas pipeline to Ringaskiddy was recently completed.  He said that this will supply Irish Steel and the IDA industrial estate at Ringaskiddy. What is the precise agreement between Irish Steel Limited and An Bord Gáis?  It is impossible &mdash; and will be impossible in the years ahead &mdash; for Members of the <Col N="126" /> Houses of the Oireachtas to talk about NET, about the ESB, about Irish Steel Limited, to deal with them even in the context of the public capital programme, unless we have the basic information on their present energy inputs.  Indeed, the feedstock inputs in relation to NET are of such magnitude and of such critical importance that, without that information, this House simply is not in a position to comment effectively.  Naturally the extensions of the natural gas pipeline are going into the IDA industrial estate at Ringaskiddy and into their industrial estates at Little Island and the Mahon Peninsula.  The House is entitled to know what An Bord Gáis, the Department of Energy, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the IDA are offering prospective industrialists at any of those industrial estates.  What price is it being suggested those industrialists will be obliged to pay for the use of natural gas?  These questions are of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with such a finite resource that I might draw one scenario at present in relation to one of its major users, NET.  It is conceivable that natural gas is extracted under agreement with An Bord Gáis who, in turn, have an agreement with Marathon.  It is conceivable that at present Irish people are using natural gas, from a finite natural resource, to make fertiliser at a massive loss, portion of which apparently is being exported to some European and Asian markets at a loss.  Therefore, it is conceivable that the people in those countries are benefiting from that finite resource because, by all accounts, NET are getting a very cheap feedstock. Therefore, although NET are making a substantial loss those countries are benefiting. Therefore, it could even be argued that from natural gas off the Irish coast at Kinsale some farmers in Europe are spreading natural gas fertiliser on their fields with the help of a massive subsidy from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I fear that there will be serious argument when there becomes available the full information about what is happening in respect of this complex matter.  I know that the Minister has a great interest in <Col N="127" /> this area and that he has no preconceptions in regard to it.  I know also that he is a politician who is totally willing to clear the air on issues of such seriousness. Because of this I wish to put before him the following evidence which was taken before the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on 2 July last.  I quote from page 32 of the Minutes of Evidence:</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney.&mdash; Yours is a 20year contract.  What are the provisions in it for renewal?</P>
    <P>Mr. Crumlish.&mdash;It is related to the life of the field and at the time of signing or drawing up the contract the life of the field was determined as 20 years from the start of production.  Our contract runs for 20 years from commencement of production, from 1979.</P>
    <P>As reported at page 31, there was the following exchange:</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery.&mdash;What is the duration of the contract for the natural gas?</P>
    <P>Mr. McSweeney.&mdash;Twenty years.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery.&mdash;But it is escalating?</P>
    <P>Professor O'Donnell.&mdash;There is an escalation clause, I think I said 12 years earlier.  The escalation clause is based on the average of the bulk price for 12 months and not 12 years.</P>
    <P>Various other questions arose during that session because it had been suggested by a number of Deputies, including the Chairman of the Committee, that there was an element of subsidy.  This is the kind of issue that must be cleared rapidly in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that as a result of the availability of Kinsale gas in the Cork area about 600 extra jobs have been created to date, but I should like to know what these jobs are.  I presume that about 430 of them are NET jobs and that the remainder are at the Aghada power station and within the field itself.  However, the question arises of whether we are <Col N="128" /> producing jobs which have any rationality behind them or whether we are producing jobs based on a finite resource, the exploitation and determination of which could well result in a situation in which the jobs are produced at a high cost to the nation while the question of the strategy on the use of natural gas nationally has not been clarified.  I am extremely concerned about the development and the progress in this matter in recent years.</P>
    <P>I would make a point also in regard to the natural gas being used for routine or conventional town gas consumption.  I do not regard this as being the predominant issue, though the Minister might be inclined to make major play of it.  I presume that the total national town gas capacity is in the region of 12 million to 13 million cubic feet per day.  It was suggested in 1976 that the figure was 11 million cubic feet.  I should like to have a figure of confirmation from the Minister on that.  The total national town gas capacity must be judged in the context of the Cork field which, at normal production, has a capacity of apparently ten times the figure I have mentioned.  That would be about 125 million cubic feet per day.  I should be pleased if the Minister would correct me in the event of any of my assumptions being wrong but, having regard to the lack of information concerning this matter, it is almost impossible to comment coherently on the situation. Perhaps Deputies have not been diligent enough in tabling questions in this regard.  However, am I correct in assuming that, if all the national town gas requirements were to be catered for fully tomorrow morning, assuming that all the necessary pipelines had been installed, we would still be using only about 10 per cent of the Cork field?  I ask this question because it is vital that we put the Kinsale field and its exploitation in a proper economic perspective.  That is what I have been trying to do since I was appointed as spokesman for my party on energy matters.  Deputy Pattison has now taken over that role.</P>
    <P>One must ask also the question of what would be the economic price that might be charged to town gas consumers for the <Col N="129" /> availability of this gas.  I do not think that the Minister has a clear mind on this matter.  Would it be the price which An Bord Gáis would negotiate with Marathon, for instance?</P>
    <P>By way of final comment, I might add that my membership of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies during the past two or three years has been a fascinating exercise in that we have had the opportunity of meeting representatives from the various bodies and discussing with them the various issues raised.  One of the points that we have made consistently, whether we were talking about Bord na Móna supplying turf to the ESB or about anything else, was that an economic price should be paid by the consumers of finite natural resources and that we should be very careful in exploiting those resources, whether they be natural turf deposits or gas deposits off Kinsale Head or any other deposits. It is in that general context that I put these questions to the Minister.  I regret that I shall not have the opportunity of remaining to hear his reply.  I must attend a meeting of the committee to which I have been referring but I look forward to reading later in the Official Report what the Minister has to say.  I wish the Minister well in what one might call vital economic strategy decisions in this area in the months ahead.  These are decisions that should be taken rapidly.  They should be put to the people without delay.  Our prospects in terms of the economic situation, of the energy situation and of our future industrial development are such that firm decisions, irrespective of their electoral popularity or otherwise, should be taken and made known widely.  I am confident that the Minister is capable of accomplishing the necessary strategy in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words with regard to the Dublin Gas Company and their customers.  It is time there was a little realism about the fate of that company.  I am afraid I must accuse the Minister for Energy of sending the fool further in so far as the consumers of the Dublin Gas Company are concerned.  He is being unfair to them.  The Dublin Gas <Col N="130" /> Company have serious financial problems that will not be solved by promising them natural gas in two or three years' time.  The problems of the Dublin Gas Company need to be tackled within the next few months, not within the next four or five years, and to allow the consumers and the company to think that natural gas from the Kinsale Head field would solve their problems is not correct.</P>
      <P>The first point that must be settled is the price they will pay for the gas.  My understanding is that the Cork Gas Company &mdash; at the moment they are in the process of getting natural gas from An Bord Gáis &mdash; are paying an energy-related price.  Unless the Dublin Gas Company are to be given an advantage over the Cork company &mdash; I presume this is not the intention &mdash; they will not get energy cheaper than they are getting it now from imported naphtha, although I accept that they may have a greater stability of price over a longer period, and this was one of the assurances given to the Cork company.  When I was in charge of the Department they were concerned with having to pay an oil equivalent price. At the time the instructions were that where possible An Bord Gáis were to get an economic price so that investment could be made if it were necessary to build a pipeline and to undertake the other projects the board might have.</P>
      <P>If the Dublin Gas Company are not to get gas at a subsidised price, what will be their financial position when and if a pipeline is built?  It will not be any different. Before the Dublin Gas Company withers and dies and before all the appliances people are investing in become completely useless, the Minister should focus his attention on the company and provide them with the financial structure necessary. No matter how politically unpopular it may be, it is the duty of the Minister to tackle the problem now, not to hold out the carrot of natural gas when and if a pipeline is built.  If the Dublin Gas Company are to get natural gas at a subsidised price &mdash; perhaps at the price An Bord Gáis are paying to Marathon &mdash; the Minister and the Government will have to defend that decision in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of such a decision, in fairness, <Col N="131" /> the Government will have to see to it that the Cork Gas Company get the gas at the same price.  However, that will not relieve them of the necessity to allow Dublin Gas Company to borrow capital. I understand that the cost to the Cork Gas Company of supplying 27,000 households with natural gas and of changing the appliances was £4 million.  If there are seven times as many appliances in Dublin, presumably the cost of changing them would be in the region of £30 million. The Dublin Gas Company should be told whether that capital will be made available to them now.</P>
    <P>I do not think sufficient account has been taken of the size of the field of natural gas at Kinsale &mdash; it is 125 million cubic feet per day and 40 per cent goes to Nítrigin Éireann at Marino Point.  Presumably it will not be the Government's intention to take that 40 per cent from NET?  A quantity goes to the Cork Gas Company.  About 60 per cent was earmarked for the ESB station at Aghada and now a supply from that 60 per cent goes to Irish Steel.  Spur pipelines are being laid with the intention of supplying natural gas to three industrial estates &mdash; one at Little Island, one at Ringaskiddy and one at Mahon in Cork city.  Of course there is always the possibility that the field will be bigger than was thought originally. At the moment it is assessed at 125 million cubic feet per day for 20 years.  I am told that in other parts of the world fields have been proved to have a longer life than the exploiters thought originally.  It may be that in another 17 years we will discover there is another ten years in the Kinsale field but, even if that is so, it does not alter the amount that can be allocated at the moment.  It merely lengthens the time in which we can take a supply of 125 million cubic feet per day.</P>
    <P>Obviously a guarantee has been given to An Bord Gáis to go ahead and build the spurs to the three industrial estates while at the same time supplying Irish Steel and the Cork gas consumer.  Otherwise they would not have undertaken the capital expenditure of laying the spurs.  In the context of the total length <Col N="132" /> of pipeline between Inch Strand and Cork city this may be quite small but I do not think they would have undertaken the expenditure unless they had been given an assurance that they could pump gas to their customers in those areas. Therefore, we may be talking of piping to Dublin as little as 40 per cent of the field, that is something in the region of 50 million cubic feet per day.</P>
    <P>In the annual report of An Bord Gáis data is given on the cost of the pipeline and the time it took to build it from Inch to Cork.  It cost £18 million for 30 miles in 1977 money terms.  I should imagine that in the three years since that time costs have increased by at least 50 per cent.  Thus, in current prices the cost of building that pipeline would be between £25 million and £30 million.  The distance from Cork to Dublin is five times the distance from Inch to Cork.  Using a multiple of five one gets an expenditure of well over £100 million to build the pipeline between Cork and Dublin and over much more difficult terrain than that experienced between Inch and Cork.  For eight or ten miles that pipeline went through open country and it was merely a question of laying the pipe along the ground.  There was only one small town, Carrigtwohill, through which the pipe had to be laid.  At Mahon Peninsula there was a disused railway line available to take the gas from the Mahon estuary, through Mahon Peninsula, through the disused railway line that had been closed for 40 years and right into the heart of Cork city to the Marina power station. On three or five miles of the route nothing had to be done and the question of way leaves was fixed.</P>
    <P>We are talking there, about negotiation and way leave purchase on a major scale of a different kind for somewhere in the region of 15 or 18 miles.  The Government are now talking about doing the same thing for a distance of over 160 miles and, at the end of the day, evidently there will be only one user of gas &mdash; the Dublin Gas Company.  There may be industries which would come here if gas were available in Dublin.  The IDA have been more than enthusiastic in seeking out, for the Cork region, industries which <Col N="133" /> will use natural gas.  At Ringaskiddy there is an industrial estate with everything which heavy industry would require.  The estate has 1,000 acres of land purchased and owned by the IDA. It has deep water which can take ships up to 50,000 tons, a flow of water sufficient for even the largest industry to come there and natural gas.  They have not yet succeeded in enticing suitable heavy industries to that most desirable location.</P>
    <P>Let me say, in case anyone thinks I disagree with this pipeline project, that I agree with Deputy Kelly that we badly need investment in infrastructure at present. This project will be of great value from the point of view of employment when it is being built.  I am sure that the Minister and the Department have read the energy report produced by the Fine Gael Party early this year.  I cannot remember the exact date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In April of this year.  It may not be written into the Act, but it was certainly part of the instructions given to the first Bord Gáis that their first task was to undertake a feasibility study on the cost and likely problems to be encountered in building this gas pipeline. If this pipeline from Cork to Dublin is built at a cost of £100 million, the servicing of that capital, at the very cheapest interest rate at present, would be £14 million or £15 million.  If at the end of the day the only customers will be the Dublin Gas consumers, will that represent a further subsidy to that company of perhaps £14 million a year, because that is what it would amount to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The length of time taken to build the gas pipeline from Inch strand to Cork city was from its commencement on April 1 to 19 December 1977, the day of the formal pipeline completion ceremony.  It took about nine months to build 30 miles, a lot of which distance was over uncluttered, open, virgin territory.  It will take somewhere in the region of three years, minimum, to construct the pipeline between Cork and Dublin.  This will go through many more towns and have many more river and canal crossings.  The <Col N="134" /> Irish Farmers' Association, even though they got extremely good terms in the negotiations between them and An Bord Gáis in east Cork for way leave to cross their land, are now deciding that they were dissatisfied with those terms.  I am not sure if they are speaking of re-negotiations in regard to the existing pipeline but they have certainly given notice that they would not accept the same terms if a gas pipeline were to be constructed between Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister, in negotiations with the gas company has given an undertaking to subsidise the price of gas at the same price that Bord Gáis are paying Marathon, or what price has been struck at all in this regard.  If in three years' time they are going to pay an energy related price for gas in Dublin and still be faced with the prospect of spending £30 million in converting appliances in and around Dublin city to the use of natural gas, that is not financially feasible as far as the Dublin gas consumers are concerned.  That company will certainly be bankrupt between now and then.  I understand that in the last year before an election the Minister may not like taking unpopular decisions but one must remember that the ordinary gas consumers in the city of Dublin are, in a large proportion, the less well-off section of the community.  They cannot be allowed to fall between the two stools of financial insolvency or the financial difficulties of the gas company and the political expediency of the Minister in the next two years.  The problems of the Dublin Gas Company must be tackled.  They should have been tackled 12 months ago and to send for people from Canada to tell us what we already know about that company is not of any service, either to the company itself or to the people depending on it for their heating and cooking facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>It is three years since Deputy O'Malley first started talking about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If you have only 40 per cent of the field, 50 million cubic feet a day to transport from Cork to Dublin, <Col N="135" /> will a gas pipeline be built for that?  This is the smallest proportion of a relatively small field in a place which is not close to a major centre of population.  Does it make sound sense to do that?  Suppose you are half way up the country and there is a gas find off the Kish Basin, what will be done then?  If there is a grand plan &mdash; and I cannot see any sign of it, but perhaps it is not suitable for the Minister to announce anything in this regard at the moment &mdash; we must remember that we already have here an energy grid.  The Electricity Supply Board are not everybody's favourite people and they would certainly not win any popularity chart test, but they have provided an energy grid throughout this country.  Indeed, they are providing energy to about 99.5 per cent of our houses &mdash; the highest proportion of anywhere in Europe.</P>
      <P>To establish a series of industries based on natural gas would be a very good thing, but not if done in a haphazard way for political reasons.  To establish the grid to extend up to Belfast and across to Derry would be a very good job.  If we can have gas interflow between Scotland or the UK and Ireland so that we can feed, as far as possible, our own grid and buy in gas from the UK or from other available sources, that would be of benefit to this country and certainly it would have many political as well as economic advantages.  We should not pretend we will do it when it appears &mdash; and maybe there is much more to it than I can see in the papers, but I do not think there is &mdash; that it is just political window dressing to satisfy Dublin gas consumers that we are doing something to solve their problem. Even if the Minister promises to subsidise their gas and promises to give them the money to change over their appliances, this would be of no benefit to them for three years.  What will happen to the Dublin Gas Company in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is nothing more to meetings with people from Northern Ireland in relation to natural gas &mdash; maybe there is; if there is I hope the Minister will say so &mdash; than political window dressing, the Minister should do more with his time <Col N="136" /> than engage in them.  I hope I am wrong about that and I am open to correction.</P>
    <P>If a decision is made to build a pipeline &mdash; and I can see sense in that, but not with the quantity of gas available &mdash; that decision should be made urgently.  We should not have the IDA in Cork, the Gas Board headquarters in Cork and the ESB in Aghada wondering whether they can undertake capital investment because the gas may be taken from them in two years' time.  From where I sit there is no economic reason for building a pipeline. There may be political reasons for doing so.  If the Minister intends to build it for political reasons he should announce this urgently so that people can make alternative arrangements.  If it is not justified on economic grounds, and I believe it is not, the Minister should say so, so that people can go on planning to entice industry to the Cork area where the gas is already, industries which can be of benefit to the whole economy if they are enticed in quickly and without any doubts about future energy supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I live in an area where natural gas was first brought ashore practically a few farms away from me.  It was quite a revolution, and we all looked in awe and wonder at the achievement of putting a pipe into the seabed, across a most beautiful beach and onto good farmland without creating any hassle. The Gas Board are to be complimented on doing a very efficient job.  Obviously they had the expertise.  I do not share some of the pessimism expressed.  I hope we will have more and more gas finds off Kinsale Head.  I do not know why it is called Kinsale Head because it is not Kinsale.  It is Ballycotton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I have heard from various experts &mdash; and they talk quite freely when you meet them in the pub &mdash; this is a massive gas field.  We are right to make the optimum use of it.  I would defend against all comers the decision to use natural gas for nitrogenous fertilisers. For far too long we had the same dependency for our fertiliser imports as we had for oil.  Prices are high and exports are large.  All this was explained when the <Col N="137" /> company appeared before the Special Committee.  I will not go into that now.</P>
    <P>I feel very happy that we have this factory, apart altogether from its job content, which is substantial.  There were massive problems in the course of construction, but now it is running well. There were quite a number of environmental problems which cost a great deal of money.  It was right to have the necessary environmental safeguards provided to ensure that everyone would be happy and that the neighbours would feel safe about emissions of ammonia.  All that cost a great deal of money.  The plant is now in existence.  It is working well and delivering on target.  Taking one year with another, I am convinced that we will have no difficulty in exporting our surplus of nitrogenous fertilisers.  The figures prove that Holland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany and France are almost doubling their output of nitrogenous fertilisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the ESB power station at Whitegate.  Here we have a source of power, natural gas, on stream, to create electricity.  The job has been done.  It is practically built and it will be efficient.  We should expand and develop this gas to the limit, expecially during this period of recession.  This gas should be used to create more jobs, and I do not mean piping it all over the country. I mean that jobs should be created along the lines indicated by the Minister. We should do more and more in Little Island, in Irish Steel and possibly in Verolme dockyard if they require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are overlooking something in that area.  There are three substantial industrial towns there which require natural gas for their industries and their people. At very little cost to the State the town of Midleton and its industries could be supplied.  The gas line almost passes through that town.  Instead of taking it all the way to Dublin, which may or may not have some merit in it, first we should supply the home base, and the home base <Col N="138" /> is not entirely Cork city although it is part of it.</P>
    <P>There are also growing towns, which are almost cities, like Cobh, Midleton and Youghal.  Recently we spoke in the House about industrial problems in these areas and of new industries and old industries running into difficulties.  One logical way to keep them going is to give them a supply of natural gas at the right price. I hope the Minister will listen to the reasoned arguments of the chambers of commerce, particularly of the Midleton and East Cork Chamber, who have sent him a reasoned and lengthy document setting out why they feel there should be a spur for natural gas to Midleton forthwith. This would serve as an indicator of the efficiency of the project without having to spend too much.  All the industrialists in the town, such as East Cork Foods, Irish Distillers and so on, are crying out for natural gas, and with it they would be able to assess its value <i>vis-à-vis</i> heavy oil. The big factor is that in the likely event of an oil shortage we would have enough natural gas to keep these industries going, especially the important food processing industries.</P>
    <P>We should look at other areas where natural gas could be used so that things could go ahead in the event of an oil shortage.  For instance, farm tractors could be converted to run on gas.  When I was chairman of the Sugar Beet Growers' Association I visited Northern Texas where practically every tractor was being run efficiently on natural gas.  We should set up a special section in the Minister's Department to look at the possibility of conversion kits for cars, lorries and so on.  I am convinced that this is a very big field and that we should use it to the full. We should not waste gas but there is no need for conservation so long as we have good use for it, and we have.  We should use it as I have suggested in providing energy to heat homes in the towns in the area where the gas is brought in.  It is not logical to pipe this gas up and down the country when it can be used so well where it has been found especially when there may be other gas finds, possibly in Dublin Bay, and there is certainly a likelihood of <Col N="139" /> gas finds in the west.  Seeing that we were lucky enough to find gas in Inch Bay and seeing that it is a highly industrialised area, it is logical to use it as much as possible in that area.  A lot has been done with the ESB, Nítrigin Éireann and the Cork city supply, but we could go further. We could work our way up along the country via Youghal, for instance, into Waterford and take it in stages so that we could monitor how we were getting on instead of shooting up through the midlands with a pipeline without thinking of the people along the way.</P>
    <P>This is a most important ministry and we are just dealing with one aspect here. Will the Minister assure us in the House that there will always be adequate supplies of natural gas for the fertiliser plant at Marino Point and that there will not be a change of thinking with regard to that plant because of a sudden change in world markets?  A few years ago, in regard to urea and this type of nitrogenous fertiliser, we had periods of dumping and also very expensive periods.  There is a danger that if we have a couple of years of dumping of urea on the world market the Government might have second thoughts.  This is all the more reason why you should have a commitment now that Nítrigin Éireann, with their large number of employees, their infrastructure and all their efforts in the market, will not be interfered with and will get a guarantee of a full supply.  The same would apply to our power station in Whitegate.</P>
    <P>The Minister, for obvious reasons, should look at the possibility of using natural gas for farm tractors.  This would not entail expensive pipelines.  On the assumption that farm tractors can be converted to natural gas, all it would mean would be special tankers on the farm and special road tankers.  It would not involve a pipeline or any massive expense.  This would not even be something new: in 1967 I saw it in America where the whole of Northern Texas was being well cultivated with tractors run on natural gas.  The price of diesel oil will go through the roof and people involved in agriculture will find this a major cost at a time when their produce is making very bad prices.  It <Col N="140" /> looks as if the prices are levelling off and the Government and the Minister have a responsibility to the farming sector to ensure that every help possible is given to them.</P>
    <P>I do not share the pessimism of Deputy Desmond who had doubts about Nítrigin Éireann.  I have no doubts.  It is probably the most efficient plant run on natural gas in the world.  It is certainly the most modern. It has built into it all the safeguards necessary for such a plant.  We now have nitrogenious fertilisers in large quantities for the first time, and while in some years we may have problems with exports there will be many more years during which we will have something very valuable for sale on the world market.  In future Estimates I would like to see provision for the carrying out of further exploratory work.  I know we are leaving this perhaps in the hands of multinationals, but I often wonder if we are getting the full facts from these people.  It is an area where the Minister should have a lot of control and, if we can afford it, we should have people involved who are closely tied up with multinationals.  It has been known in the past that these people could close the tap on a find of gas or oil until the time is right.  It is vital that if there is a lot of gas or oil we should be told.  Hardly anywhere in the world has there been such a find of natural gas without a find of oil.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the context of the UK the small find of natural gas would not be worth buttons but in our economy it means a lot and particularly in Cork where we have serious unemployment. The gas line has given, and still is giving, massive employment when unemployment is at an all time high.  An Bord Gáis are doing an excellent job and their decisions are usually taken very wisely.  They have had some difficult negotiations on way leaves with the farming community. However, I do not know of any case where there was not a satisfactory outcome and that gives me great heart.  I hope the gas will not be going straight to Dublin but via every industrial town along the way.</P>
    <P>I do not know how practical this suggestion would be but there is a lot of land in public ownership along the railway line <Col N="141" /> and if we could run the gas line side by side with the railway line we would be doing two things: we would save the town of Youghal industrially and the railway line which is in the doldrums.</P>
    <P>I would give the Minister full support for using natural gas in a practical way. I am satisfied that in a few years time we will have a lot of oil and gas as a result of more explorations and new techniques. The problems we have at present with regard to getting oil from under deep waters will be overcome with new technology. When that time comes we could think about having long distance pipelines but, for the present, we have a field situated in an industrial area and we should serve that area before Dublin or Belfast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and fully support the sentiment embodied in it &mdash; to provide industry with a source of fuel from native resources.  We must be honest about the Kinsale gas field.  I should like some straight answers to questions which have been &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; me and which I raised at the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies when we were examining the activities of NET.  I should like the Minister to spell out clearly the answers to questions which remained unanswered as a result of that investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister stated, the gas from the Kinsale field is a valuable source of fuel.  It is a highly efficient one and should not be allocated in a haphazard way.  It is very important to get the maximum benefit from the gas.  It has not been answered to my satisfaction that that is the case at present.  The country is entitled to answers to the questions: is it being used to the best advantage and, if not, why not?  In what way could it be used?  I have no doubt that the reason for the Bill is to use it to the best advantage whether it is to the Cork gas company, the steel industry at Haulbowline or the new industrial estate at Ringaskiddy.  I am glad that the Minister asked Bord Gáis Éireann to do a feasibility study to see whether it would be better to pipe it to Dublin and use it directly as source of oil rather than in some other manner.  I <Col N="142" /> appreciate that the cost of a pipeline will be very high.  A figure of £120 million has been mentioned and that may be a conservative one.  If it is the most efficient way to use it and the cost is not unduly high that is the thing to do.</P>
    <P>Figures of 50p and 55p per them have been quoted as the cost of producing heat and energy from the present Dublin gas system.  It is reported that gas from the Kinsale gas field is being sold to industrialised concerns for as little as 7p or 10p &mdash; these are figures I have seen quoted in the national papers &mdash; and there must be a case for spreading it around the country. We have a duty and should not be making decisions on a political basis only. We should not be parochial but should get the maximum benefit for the country as a whole.  I strongly advocate that the Minister be courageous in that regard and I know he will be.</P>
    <P>We asked what the gas was being sold for at present.  I understand that An Bord Gáis are the intermediary and the Marathon gas company are selling the gas to the board who, in turn, are selling it to industrialised concerns.  I would like the Minister in his reply to clarify that position. It is a bit clouded at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what gas is being sold and what Marathon are receiving per therm for the gas.  What are An Bord Gáis selling it for to the various industrial concerns such as NET, the ESB and other companies listed here?  I would like a figure.  The public should not be denied this information.  We have a right to know what it is being sold for.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee were told in answer to that inquiry that they could not be given a figure because it was confidential and might give an unfair advantage to trade competitors, to people competing with the present users of gas.  That is not a sufficient answer.  The circumstances should be spelled out.  I would like to know what the value of the gas is and what the people are paying for it.</P>
    <P>I have a suspicion that there is a second gas field in this country which is not being utilised at the moment because the going rate is not being paid for the gas coming out of the Kinsale field.  I would like the Minister in his reply to let us know if <Col N="143" /> there is a second gas field off the County Waterford coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Deputy that.  I thought that there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister if there is a second commercial gas field off the Waterford coast near Ardmore Head.  It has been reported to me that there may be a gas field there but it is not being developed because the gas company feel that the price which they are being paid at present is not sufficient to justify that development.  That information may be false but it has been put to me on a number of occasions and I would like clarification on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price at which the gas is being sold is obviously a very important factor and it is in the national interest that we&mdash; when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean our agency, An Bord Gáis&mdash;should get it at the lowest possible price, but if it is being sold for as little as 7p per therm it should be used to the maximum benefit.  It should be spread around the country and used directly as a fuel because that surely is the way we get the maximum benefit. One question that I cannot get an answer to from technical people, and I would like to ask it of the Minister, is what is the efficiency of the manner in which the gas is being used at the moment?  For instance, what is the wastage in having it converted to urea and ammonia as in the NET plant at Marino Point in Cork? What is the wastage in having it used for the generation of electricity such as is happening at the Marina Plant in Cork and at the Aghada plant?  I believe that particularly in the generation of electricity the gas is not used to its maximum potential and it may be that it could be used for some other purpose.  It is not that I advocate that, in particular, NET should not be allocated this gas, because they have importance where our balance of payments is concerned.  We need fertilisers with a high nitrogen content and it is obvious that we should have this plant within this country.  If we were dependent on imports we could be <Col N="144" /> squeezed badly in times of shortage or price hiking by foreign industrialists.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a native source of supply.  But notwithstanding that, I would like to know the levels of efficiency in the production of various commodities which are made from this gas.  Above all, we must ask ourselves if mistakes have been made in the allocation of this gas in the past.  If so, let us not be afraid to admit it.  I would like the Minister to tell us if he is quite satisfied that the gas is being put to the best possible use at present.  I am satisfied that the uses outlined in the Bill are the proper ways in which to use it and, if it can be hiked around the country and used to fuel the Dublin Gas Company's requirements and other industrial requirements on the way, then that should be done.  I would like a clear explanation of the best way in which it can be used in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Before I spoke on the Second Stage of this Bill I had a strong feeling that what has happened would happen.  It was almost inevitable.  However, I would like to draw the attention of the House to something I said in my Second Stage speech.  I said:</P>
      <P>I think it is appropriate to emphasise at this stage that this Bill relates specifically to the raising of the board's borrowing powers to finance projects in the Cork area.  This extension of BGE's borrowing powers is independent from and is not intended to pre-empt a decision on the feasibility of building a Cork-Dublin pipeline.</P>
      <P>That is a factual statement.  I had to make certain references to the Cork-Dublin pipeline project in the hope of excluding it from the debate.  As you have heard, Sir, it was not excluded from the debate. I understand why it was not although, strictly speaking, this Bill does not deal with it and does not provide any capital for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained the irrelevance of that matter in my introduction.  However, I merely want to put it on the record. We had a very interesting discussion, so interesting that if I were to follow up all the points raised we would be here for a very long time.  I am not going to follow up all of the points, but I want to deal with a number of the major basic ones. Perhaps the first one I should deal with is one which has been raised by a number of Deputies, but with most persistence and perhaps with a certain amount of feeling by two Deputies, Deputy Deasy just now and Deputy B. Desmond earlier, each of whom is a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  There is some significance in that.  One would have thought that, being members of that Committee, they would have better knowledge of and more access to the kind of information we are talking about than any other Deputy in the House, and yet they come in seeking information which apparently they were unable to obtain at the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever complaints they may have about that Committee and the non-production to the Committee of information which they sought, I do not think it can be remedied here in the House.  I do think that it is reasonable &mdash; or let me put it the other way &mdash; it is not unreasonable for NET to argue that the question of the price that they pay to BGE is a commercial one.  This is not my business, but I think there is provision in that Committee for the disclosure of information of that kind on a confidential basis.  As for its public disclosure, it is not unreasonable to object to that being done.  It could give advantage to commercial rivals and it would be unreasonable of us to insist on that.  In general in regard to the prices paid to BGE by different customers these are energy-related and they also reflect BGE's capital cost in building a pipeline <Col N="146" /> infrastructure.  It has been the consistent position of successive Ministers dealing with this matter that they would not and did not feel at liberty to disclose a price being paid by An Bord Gáis on behalf of the State to Marathon.  That is paid on foot of a contract which was negotiated some years ago and certainly a disclosure by one party to that commercial contract of terms of that kind would be regarded as a very considerable breach of confidentiality. It has not been done up to now and I do not propose to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some people who keep leading with their chins.  The Deputy must not tempt me too much.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis negotiate prices with various people and in general the basis of payment is as I have outlined.  In case there is any doubt on the matter statutorily, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the provisions of section 11 (4) of the Gas Act, 1976, which states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to a price to be charged by the Board in a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the statutory position and, even if it were not so, it would be necessary for me to adopt the stance I have taken in regard to price.  However, that does not mean that we are not entitled to examine and comment on the performance of Bord Gáis or the use of natural gas, nor does it mean we cannot discuss the points raised by Deputy Deasy in regard to the most effective and efficient use of natural gas and whether its use for the generation of electricity is efficient. <Col N="148" /> These are the kinds of questions we are entitled to ask.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are conflicting views among experts on these matters, but the great bulk of the advice I have received and which I accept is that the use of natural gas for the generation of electricity is not the most efficient use available to us.</P>
    <P>There are also difficulties about the use of natural gas by NET.  The situation is perhaps compounded by the fact that roughly 50 per cent of NET's production in that plant is exported.  In one sense this is a good thing, but on the other hand we are exporting a product which is based on a natural resource of which we have great need.  To put this into perspective, I would point out that natural gas is one of our few indigenous sources of energy at present.  In broad terms, if we were to utilise natural gas in major urban areas and if LPG were used for domestic purposes in most rural areas, we would very substantially alter the demand for electricity and therefore our rate of importation of oil, on which electricity is very largely dependent.  Obviously I do not wish to pursue this matter in great detail on this Bill.  I am merely trying to illustrate the fact that natural gas potentially forms a major part of our overall energy strategy.  Part of that strategy is, of course, switching from dependence on imported oil.  Therefore it is quite right to question the use to which natural gas is being put or may be put in the future. There is not full agreement even on the technical question raised by Deputy Deasy and certainly not on the economic arguments that arise, but it is quite clear that there is a large volume of opinion which is not satisfied with the use at present being made of natural gas.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I am not anxious to score political points and I am not trying to do so in mentioning that historically the decision to utilise natural gas for generating electricity and for the NET plant was made by the parties opposite when in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Deputy will not be dissatisfied when I have finished on this point.  My party were then in opposition and we opposed that decision, mainly for the reasons I have been outlining. I appreciate that those faced with responsibility for that decision were in the position that, unless they could guarantee a substantial offtake of gas, then the gas might be better left where it was at the bottom of the sea.  It would not have been worthwhile constructing the platforms and pipelines to take the gas ashore.  I am not suggesting that the decision was simple and that the wrong decision was taken.  It was necessary to ensure a guranteed offtake of a substantial quantity of gas in order to get the operation going.  We can now re-examine the whole situation to see if we can find a better use for this major natural resource.</P>
      <P>I am a little confused about some of the arguments I heard from the Fine Gael benches.  At first I thought they related to geographical location because there was a major difference between the lines taken by Deputy Kelly and Deputy P. Barry.  I thought that was simply due to the fact that Deputy P. Barry was a Corkman. Then Deputy Hegarty seemed to be taking Deputy Kelly's line.  I am confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe that was it.  Deputy P. Barry, for the second time in my hearing, has taken a line on this which mystifies me.  I think he is wrong, and I hope he is wrong, because if he is not we are doing all the wrong things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that Deputy P. Barry was basically saying that this was a small field and we should not be thinking in terms of running it all over the country and wasting it that way.  He set out to prove that if we piped it to Dublin <Col N="150" /> it could only be used in Dublin at a substantial loss and heavily subsidised by the taxpayers.  I believe him to be totally wrong.  Deputy Kelly seemed to be saying we should go ahead and pipe it to Dublin and, indeed, to the border, and contemplated, as I am contemplating, piping it to Belfast.</P>
      <P>We do not know the precise size of the field but the original estimate, is acknowledged to be conservative.  It is necessary to have an offtake from the field for a considerable time before one can have any accurate estimate.  That reassessment is going on at the moment and I hope to have the result of that reassessment within a few months.  Obviously I have to await that but all the indications are that it will show that the capacity of this field is considerably bigger than was originally estimated.  In a few months we hope to know for definite.</P>
      <P>The question of availability was raised. I think some of Deputy P. Barry's calculations were being made on the basis that the allocation made originally for electricity generation on the one hand and NET on the other were rigid and inflexible and that anything over and above that was all that was available for use otherwise.  If that were so Deputy P. Barry would be right in saying that the amount available would not be worth piping to Dublin, but that is not so.  For instance, the ESB station concerned can run other than on natural gas.  Whether it should be is another question.  In other words, it is possible to reallocate gas from one source to another.  I believe we have substantial quantities of gas and we should go ahead on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the future.  One aspect of that was raised by Deputy Kelly and another aspect by another Deputy: supposing we should have a pipeline as far as Belfast, then a pipeline connecting Ireland with Britain and a pipeline connecting Britain with the continent.  That is ultimately what we are going to have within the context of the EEC.  Deputy Kelly correctly said that the gas can flow either way in such pipes.  Some people would argue&mdash;and some people have argued to me&mdash;that <Col N="151" /> ideally we ought to have a pipeline to Northern Ireland and Scotland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>And south as far as Dublin and no further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and between Wexford and Wales, and that it ought to be possible to have it flow either way.</P>
      <P>Our exploration efforts are being stepped up considerably.  Nobody can be sure what is going to happen but I believe there is a very good chance we will, in due course, discover more natural gas. The question of the price was raised. Deputy Deasy said it had been reported to him that there was another field off Waterford but that it was not worth exploiting because we were paying too small a price.  I am not aware of the field off Waterford.  I am not saying that it is not there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said this publicly, and privately to some of the companies concerned, and I want to say it again here so that there will not be any misunderstanding about it: in the event of the discovery of further deposits of natural gas, while we could not at this stage anticipate all the factors which would enter into the contract we would sign, it would nevertheless be my intention to aim at a contract which would result in a price comparable to and related to the going rate for natural gas discovered offshore in Northern Europe at that time.  I do not think I can be fairer than that.  Clearly that kind of formula indicates that any company which locates natural gas in our offshore can depend on the fact that we will try to negotiate with them a price which will be related to the going rate for Northern Europe offshore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question of the possible piping of natural gas to Northern Ireland.  That depends, obviously, on a number of factors.  It is not entirely within our control.  I will be having discussions shortly which may throw further light on this matter but, in general, I want to make it clear that I favour that proposition.</P>
      <P>In relation to Dublin gas, I was being urged on one hand to get on with the job and on the other, Deputy Barry seemed to be suggesting it was a waste of time and money and fooling the people of Dublin to start piping natural gas to them.  No time is being wasted at present because the necessary feasibility study and the preliminary work are going on and which would have to go on any way, regardless of the other conditions.  No time is being lost on that score.  It is very necessary, having regard to the enormous amounts of money that are involved, that this be properly planned and worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to make it clear that because of the enormous importance and value to our economy, nationally, of natural gas, the ultimate decision is not going to depend on whether the management and unions in the Dublin Gas Company are prepared to be sensible &mdash; at least in my view to be sensible.  What depends on that is whether the Dublin Gas Company are going to participate or not, or, indeed, whether they are going to survive. There is no doubt that, without access to natural gas, the Dublin Gas Company will not survive.  Preliminary work is going on and an alternative approach to supplying natural gas to the Dublin Gas Company is being examined by my Department.  We must have an alternative.  We cannot be totally dependent on the management and unions in Dublin Gas Company reaching an understanding. I have an alternative.  If, therefore, when the other conditions, the preliminary conditions in the feasibility study and so on are all right, but we are not in a position to have had demonstrated to us the ability and willingness of the Dublin Gas Company to meet the <Col N="154" /> necessary criteria, that does not mean that we are going to say &ldquo;no pipeline&rdquo;. On the contrary, if everything else is right, there will be a pipeline and we are going to go ahead with it.  It means that Dublin Gas Company are not going to get their hands on it and we will have another way of doing it.  It will be difficult, but not impossible.  I hope that will not happen.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous opportunity for the Dublin Gas Company, their management and workers, to have a good, steady, secure future in a worthwhile and expanding industry, if they can overcome the difficulties.  The plan is laid out for them to do that.  I am anxious to assist them, as far as I can, in achieving that. That would be the best solution for everybody concerned but I am not prepared to let them have a veto over whether the whole national economy is to benefit fully from natural gas.  There is an alternative and, if we have to follow it, we will.  There is no delay taking place in the decision, because all the necessary work is going ahead.</P>
    <P>None of this is covered in the Bill.  It simply deals with providing a small amount of additional capital for the purpose of work in the Cork area which Bord Gáis have undertaken.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1980. - Vote 41:Labour.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31 day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> The items in this Supplementary Estimate are an additional £150,000 for resettlement allowances and an additional £1.75 million for An Comhairle Oiliúna, comprising £750,000 for general expenses and £1 million for capital expenditure. There is also an additional £300,000 for the work experience programme.  Since it will be possible to meet these additional provisions from savings elsewhere in the Vote and extra receipts under appropriations-in-aid the Supplementary Estimate is for a nominal £10.</P>
    <P>The original estimate of £220,000 in the subhead for resettlement allowances has proved insufficient.  The resettlement scheme provides for financial assistance to eligible workers who have to change residence to take up jobs offered through the National Manpower Service.</P>
    <P>In June 1979 a recruitment campaign was mounted in the United Kingdom for the express purpose of attracting here workers with specified &ldquo;key&rdquo; skills which had been identified as being in particularly short supply and which have the potential to create additional employment. As an inducement to these workers to take up employment here the levels of resettlement assistance payable were increased.  In addition a new grant of up to £2,000 was made available to any of these &ldquo;key&rdquo; workers who bought a residence here.</P>
    <P>So far 150 such workers have settled here, of whom 65 have to date received assistance under the scheme, 60 of them in this year up to 28 November.</P>
    <P>In addition to the workers with the specified &ldquo;key&rdquo; skills there has been a large increase this year in the numbers of other eligible claimants, mainly Irish persons returning from Britain, to take up jobs for which suitable local applicants were not available.</P>
    <P>It is expected that expenditure this year under the Resettlement Assistance Scheme will amount to £370,000.  It is, therefore, necessary to ask the House to make available an additional sum of £150,000 to meet commitments.  I might mention that a substantial part of this <Col N="156" /> expenditure will qualify for European Social Fund assistance, which will go into Appropriations in Aid, though the actual moneys will probably not come to hand in this financial year.  The original estimates for AnCO this year were £16.8 million for non-capital and £5 million for capital which were 25 per cent up on the 1979 provisions.</P>
    <P>In the Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development the Government are committed to increase the State contribution to the financing of training so as to ensure an adequate supply of workers with appropriate skills and to provide for training and retraining of unemployed persons. This supplementary financing provision for AnCO is a first step in fulfilling this commitment.</P>
    <P>A high priority of the Government is to cater for apprentices whose apprenticeships have been temporarily interrupted in the present difficult economic situation.  AnCO have been directly involved in assisting such apprentices through taking them into their training centres and offering suitable courses pending their re-employment.  The direct intervention of AnCO in this area will continue and every effort will be made to ensure that apprentices are not disadvantaged because of difficulties which their employers may be experiencing.  AnCO are also expanding their programmes to cater more extensively for the particular needs of those who have recently been declared redundant and the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The additional capital allocation of £1 million will enable AnCO to make further progress on their training centre building programme under which it is planned to increase the number of training places available from the existing level of slightly in excess of 4,000 to a total of 7,000 over the next few years. The selection of new training centre locations has been heavily influenced by the identified needs for vocational training facilities, the employment outlets, both existing and planned, and the skill needs of local industry.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the AnCO programmes for which these moneys are <Col N="157" /> voted qualify for European Social Fund assistance.  Indeed, roughly half of AnCO's non-capital budget is financed from the fund and there is also a substantial contribution to capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>To supplement the £1.8 million originally allocated towards the Work Experience Programme a further £300,000 is sought this year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Work Experience Programme, which was introduced in September 1978, enables young persons &mdash; particularly those in the 18 to 20 age group &mdash; to gain a practical knowledge of working life which is valuable to them in seeking employment.  Under the programme the young persons are placed with employers both in the private and public sectors for up to 26 weeks and an allowance of £20 per week is payable.  A yardstick of the success of the scheme is that over 80 per cent of participants have succeeded in getting regular jobs before or at the end of their 26 weeks periods.</P>
    <P>The number of young persons who have participated in the scheme this year up to 31 October is 6,477 and it is expected that, with the increased allocation, the number will be around 7,000 for the whole of 1980.  This programme is particularly popular with young people and employers and has been very successful. We believe it is important to continue it by making extra funds available.</P>
    <P>I should add that since this scheme also qualifies for European Social Fund assistance the net extra cost to the Exchequer comes to 45 per cent of the voted expenditure, the ESF assistance coming in under Appropriations in Aid, though probably not in this financial year.</P>
    <P>As the Supplementary Estimate indicates, the bulk of the additional funds sought can be met from additional Appropriations in Aid under the heading of receipts from the European Social Fund.  In fact, I can say that of the £2.2 million necessary to cover the items to which I have referred almost £1,850,000 comes from Appropriations in Aid, through that channel, leaving only slightly over £350,000 to be met from savings.  My Department's Vote benefits from such aid &mdash; that is, aid from the Social Fund &mdash; in relation to part of the <Col N="158" /> Employment Incentive Scheme, the Work Experience Programme and certain operations of the National Manpower Service, including the Resettlement Assistance Scheme.  While the amounts received from the fund relate to actual expenditure on those services, the timing of receipt of moneys from Brussels has been difficult to predict.  The figures now shown in the Supplementary Estimate covers amounts actually received to date in 1980</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment AnCO whom I believe do not get nearly as much credit as they deserve, they being one of the most excellent of our State agencies and much admired elsewhere in the EEC. It is important to place that on record because, as the House is aware, none of us is slow to criticise.  Of course that is not to say there is no room for improvement and expansion &mdash; there is &mdash; and it is for that reason this Supplementary Estimate is particularly welcome.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity also to talk about employment, to which the Minister referred briefly in the course of his remarks.  Unemployment is the most pressing problem facing this country at present.  It is at present our most serious economic problem and, what is more, will continue to be the most serious economic problem confronting us for many years to come.</P>
      <P>The challenge is very exciting but it is a challenge that we have the capacity to meet.  However, a major national effort is required if we are to overcome the problem of unemployment.  This issue is of such importance as to transcend by far any division there might be either between political parties or within political parties.  For that reason we should be very slow to tolerate anything unreasonable in our society, anything that would inhibit the economic growth necessary to create the thousands of productive jobs which we need now and which we will continue to need each year for the remainder of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not new for me to say in that context that our industrial relations situation <Col N="159" /> is totally unreasonable, having regard to the jobs challenge.  I am confident that both within this House and outside it there is a consensus regarding the necessity to bring about the enduring industrial peace which is essential if we are to have the optimum atmosphere for job creation.  But the task involved in bringing about the right atmosphere is not easy.  The problem is complex but it is one that we should not allow to continue to be put on the long finger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Sir, I will obey your ruling.  However in a debate on a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Labour, I would consider it appropriate to deal, even in passing, with matters that are very relevant to the items being voted on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if I were to allow him to cover the whole labour spectrum we would be very much out of order.  Therefore, I will ask him to refer only to what is contained in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that in the context of employment creation, which, as I have been saying, is the central economic challenge facing us, the necessary skilled work force is available. I am glad to note that the Minister is seeking more money under the heading of the resettlement allowance.  That is a good sign.  It indicates that there has been some success in attracting back to Ireland the type of key skilled personnel we need to provide for industrial expansion.  This success may be due in some measure to the effects of the recession in the UK and elsewhere.  Recent indicators show that at this moment we are not experiencing any great shortage of these skilled personnel though there was such a shortage some months ago.  However, it is reasonable to expect that a shortage will manifest <Col N="160" /> itself once again when the recession begins to peter out.  Therefore, the resettlement allowance programme should not be deterred in any way by the temporary problems presented by the recession. It is only right that we should continue to attract back key skilled personnel.</P>
      <P>In connection with this scheme there arises the question of the availability of local authority housing for those skilled people who may wish to return to work in Ireland.  This may not be a matter directly for the Minister for Labour but it is very much relevant to the scheme.  I am aware that the Minister has taken this question up with the Minister for the Environment but I should like to hear whether arrangements have been made with local authorities to give to the people I am talking of priority in so far as local authority housing is concerned.  Any such arrangement could be expected to contribute significantly to the success of the programme.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to comment also on the related area of mis-matching. There are some areas in which there are plenty of skilled personnel but no jobs for them.  Is there any extra effort being made to retain people with skills that are now obsolete or, alternatively, to find areas of employment for those skills?</P>
      <P>Another area to which the Minister referred, and which is a source of great concern not only to me but to all of us here and to many people outside, is the question of the temporary unemployment of apprentices.  I am glad that the Minister referred to this problem in his statement.  I am not in any way happy with the situation in this regard.  There is insecurity for these apprentices in many areas of employment.  There are some employers who more than play their part in training apprentices.  Some industries are much better than others in so far as this area is concerned but there are some also who are reluctant to train the people they will need for the future and who tend to push that responsibility on to other people.  That is one problem which we should make every effort to overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other problem in this context is <Col N="161" /> that in some areas apprentices are very often the first to be laid off when there occurs a recession such as the one we are experiencing now.  In some cases this is unavoidable but in other cases it could very well be avoided.  Very often an apprentice whose employment is terminated in this way is discouraged and demoralised and finishes up without any skill.  That is why we should make every effort to provide continuity of apprenticeship. Here I should like to pay tribute to the role both of AnCO and of the Minister in recognising the problem.  I hope that even further efforts will be made to provide the continuity which is so important in terms of the morale and confidence of apprentices.  The Minister said in his speech, and I quote:</P>
    <P>A high priority of the Government is to cater for apprentices whose apprenticeships have been temporarily interrupted in the present difficult economic situation.  AnCO have been directly involved in assisting such apprentices through taking them into their training centres and offering suitable courses pending their re-employment. The direct intervention of AnCO in this area will continue and every effort will be made to ensure that apprentices are not disadvantaged because of difficulties which their employers may be experiencing.</P>
    <P>That is an important statement by the Minister for Labour and I support it fully. I can only hope it reassures the many apprentices involved.</P>
    <P>One of the other areas covered by this Supplementary Estimate is the work experience programme.  It is a programme about which I am still a little sceptical.  In his speech on this Supplementary Estimate and in other speeches the Minister said that 80 per cent of participants in the scheme have succeeded in getting regular jobs.  On the face of it that is very successful and if it were the whole story I would be quite happy.  However, I think it can be looked at in another way, that many employers who would otherwise have to employ people have taken advantage of the scheme and have put a charge on the State.  In these days of large <Col N="162" /> budgetary deficits that is an unfair encumbrance on the State.  I do not think that can be overcome and to some extent I have never been completely happy with the programme; but, while I have slight reservations about it, I accept that it is not totally without value.  It is really an offshoot of the employment incentive scheme which was introduced by Deputy Michael O'Leary during the term of office of the National Coalition Government. That was by far the most successful job creation programme introduced by any Government and that was evident in the figures given by the Minister.</P>
    <P>One of the good things about this Supplementary Estimate is the fact that a considerable amount of money has come from the European Social Fund.  As a country we have done well out of this fund and the Department of Labour and AnCO deserve praise for taking advantage of it for exploiting it to the full. Probably we could have more schemes that would attract more money into the country and I have every confidence that the Department of Labour and AnCO will use the scheme to the full.</P>
    <P>All the matters referred to in the Supplementary Estimate &mdash; the resettlement allowances, the work experience programme and extra training by AnCO &mdash; are connected with the subject I dealt with when I started my speech.  It is one about which we should be confident and determined, namely, employment for all our people.  It is the central economic challenge facing us.  Together we must do everything we can to create the optimum conditions to provide the necessary skills in our people so that we may confront and face up to the exciting challenge posed by our young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I wish the Minister every success.  Unfortunately, I have no say in the matter of his future prospects. At the moment I should like to deal specifically with his role in the Department of Labour.  The Supplementary Estimate deals with AnCO and the retraining and resettlement programmes but I should like to refer to the three major areas, namely, the National Manpower Service, AnCO and the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months there has been a substantial increase in unemployment. Unfortunately the greater impact has been felt in the traditional industries that were established in the past 30 or 40 years and, as a result, there are many redundancies in the older age group.  In this connection AnCO have a considerable task before them.  A young boy or girl can be trained at the age of 18 or 19 years. At that age their perceptibility and keenness to learn makes it much easier for the programme manager to ensure that at the end of their training period they are attuned to the needs of the job in which they may be interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the previous speaker stated, industrial peace is vital if our employment and economic development objectives are to be attained.  At the moment we have a deteriorating employment situation, especially in the traditional industries. There are many men and women who have given up to 30 years' service to the industries in which they were employed but because of the recession many of them are now without a job and without experience in any other aspect of work. This is where AnCO must play an important role and it is essential that there be a substantial expansion of their programme. I should like to compliment them on the work they are doing.  They have a vital role to play in training young people but in the past 12 months their work has increased considerably because of the serious impact on the older members of the work force.  There is an urgent need for resettlement programmes to ensure that these men and women are retrained and re-employed as soon as possible.  The last thing we need as we approach 1981 is an uneasy work force. <Col N="164" /> We cannot afford that.  If we are to achieve our economic growth objectives we must have a contented work force and that brings me back again to the vital need for industrial peace.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his emphasis that in the second national understanding his Government are committed to increasing the State contribution to the retraining of unemployed people. This is vital and I welcome it.  I also welcome the statement that the AnCO programme is being expanded.  There is a grave urgency for greater emphasis on the older generation of our work force who, through the recession, find themselves unemployed and unable to meet the challenge of new employment without the help of AnCO.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service throughout rural Ireland have given substantial service also.  Their power, which is very relevant to the workings of AnCO, should be somewhat strengthened.  They are performing to the best of their ability in placing people in employment, but are not being allowed to reach their fuller and greater objectives.  I have repeatedly asked the Minister &mdash; and this may be my last opportunity to appeal to him as Minister for Labour&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

Rural Ireland and its work force should be entitled to the benefits of the Labour Court which is situated and centralised in the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>If we are to have industrial peace, with a registered figure of 115,000 unemployed and the danger of that number increasing, the Minister's Department will have to play a very vital role in ensuring that those out of work and needing work are trained and retrained in the years ahead.  Decentralisation has already taken place in one public sector, the Revenue Commissioners.  To many people in rural Ireland they are not perhaps as welcome as they appear to be but perhaps the Minister would reconsider the question of decentralisation for the ordinary workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of saying a few words on this Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Labour and, in particular, on the AnCO training scheme.  As we all know, the track record of AnCO is one of which we can all be justly proud.  However, the economic forces which bring pressure on different sections are such that the distribution of opportunities within the training service, despite the best efforts of successive Governments, is not what it might be.  For that reason, the demands made on the labour force by industry and, in particular, by new technology must be established and quantified.  I know that this work is going on, but we can all give examples, due to lack of experience or foresight, of instances where the personnel required for a particular type of industry were not available and, indeed, the training of these people caused great difficulty in the past.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, is aware of this.  In our own area, some years ago, a large industry was set up and the local AnCO centre was not capable of providing the services which that industry needed in the form of trained personnel and they were trained elsewhere.  This is just one case of the inadequacies of a system which in itself <Col N="166" /> has great potential and is absolutely essential to our economic future.</P>
      <P>The Minister of Labour has repeatedly emphasised the need for a high degree of training in new technology.  I fully endorse this sentiment, but I wonder if cognisance is taken of the real problems which arise in relation to new technology, both in manufacturing and in the services industries.  I am aware that a survey is now being done to establish the impact of micro-technology on industry in general and the kind of training necessary to meet this challenge.</P>
      <P>The solution of our unemployment problems is of major concern at the moment.  The solution lies mainly in a few specific areas, the main one being the provision of small industrial units.  Looking back over the past 18 months, it is brought home very starkly to us that small has again become beautiful.  The training necessary for people engaged in production in small units differs totally from that necessary in larger units.  The IDA, the county development teams and other agencies, like SFADCo, are endeavouring to concentrate on the provision of small units but I do not know if the training programme of AnCO is orientated to take account of this new emphasis or concentration on the small production unit.  The major impact training schemes have had in the past cannot be overestimated.  They have been of crucial importance.  There are areas which have not been getting the kind of attention which would seem to be required in the training of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may become parochial for a moment, Mayo is badly in need of an expansion of its training facilities.  For some years past we have had what is regarded as a temporary training centre which is totally unsuitable for the purpose for which it is being used.  Alternative accommodation has been offered in the past and has been turned down because of a reluctance on the part of the Department of Labour to give permanent status to a training centre in this area.  When one looks at the industrial expansion and the need for further expansion, on cannot but cast a jaundiced eye on the reluctance to provide this crucial facility in an <Col N="167" /> area where there is already a need for this kind of training.</P>
    <P>The IDA have embarked on a programme of providing advance factories in many areas, including my own, and that is something for which we are very thankful. We must have an adequate labour force available.  It is no longer regarded as adequate to have a labour force which is untrained in the sense that people have no experience in the industrial scene.  For the average investor that approach is not regarded as adequate.  The training of young people in industry through the AnCO training centres is of crucial importance.  To show a commitment to that the Department must be prepared to set up permanent centres to be used by the local people and by local industry and to be used also as an inducement for potential investors to come into the area. If we have permanent training centres providing a wide range of facilities for training young people in all the technicalities of industry, these are major incentives and inducements to potential investors.  I would ask the Minister to review the situation in relation to my area, because such a centre is badly needed with the provision of extra advance factories as an extra lever to coax potential investors into the area.</P>
    <P>The recent past has not been happy in relation to the industrial relations scene. There are many instances of labour unrest, in many cases caused by a lack of understanding on the part of the labour force and management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring in passing to industrial unrest.  Any debate on a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Labour must relate to this facet of our industrial life.  I am proud to be in the company of my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, who has produced what my party regard as a blueprint for industrial peace.  An opportunity should be given for the implementation of the provisions in that policy document.  We have in <Col N="168" /> excess of 115,000 people unemployed. With seasonal adjustments that is a high figure.  Loss of employment is becoming a very unwelcome and serious trend.  The Department of Labour have a very important role to play here.  Anything they can do and we can do to ensure the retention of existing employment ought to be welcomed.  I wonder whether enough attention is being paid to the areas of responsibility which come within the ambit of the Minister for Labour. Together with the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism that Department have a major role to play on the industrial scene.</P>
      <P>Looking back on the recent past, which has been troubled in the labour scene, one is struck by the lack of specific measures introduced to try to cool the labour situation which has become over-heated and to ensure the retention of jobs because that is what we are talking about. My reason for speaking was to impress on the Minister the importance of establishing a permanent training centre in the area I represent with the Minister of State.  It is something which is badly needed, something to which attention is now being drawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Mitchell and Ryan for their support on the Estimate and for their complimentary remarks about AnCO.  I am sorry that the last speaker was not here to listen to some of their comments about AnCO as it might have helped him to overcome some of his problems about understanding the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have shown in this Supplementary Estimate their commitment to AnCO and to the need for training at apprentice level, at redundancy level and at long-term unemployment level.  Deputy Ryan specifically referred to the redundant older worker who is a person for whom concern must be shown because of the added difficulty of getting back into the work force.  An indication of the Government's commitment is reflected in the allocation to AnCO which already this year was 25 per cent higher than in 1979.  The additional £1.75 million <Col N="169" /> provided now shows a further substantial increase in the funds for the provision of extra places on the capital side and for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>I share the views put forward about apprentices as they are very important. It is important that industry should ensure as far as possible that apprentices are kept on and are trained during periods of recession.  During the last recession the Government of the day did not show a commitment to keeping apprentices trained, nor did industry, and the result was that we had a very serious shortage of skilled and key people in recent times.  For Deputy Mitchell's information, while the position is not as acute as it was, shortages still exist and the indications are that they will continue to exist in key areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole has left the House but he referred specifically to the Ballina centre.  The position there is something that I as Minister inherited.  It did not happen during my time.  The Deputy should be aware that it is not a decision of the Department of Labour.  AnCO are a statutory body with a council that handle their affairs in those directions.  They make their own decisions regarding the best location for centres taking into consideration the spread of the whole country and the need for training people.  Deputy O'Toole spoke about the need for training for small units and big units.  It does not make any difference whether it is in a small unit or in a big unit if the skill is the same.  AnCO are fully aware of the needs of industry.  They work in close co-operation with the manpower service and with the IDA in the training of people and in helping to maximise opportunities for people to get jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the resettlement allowance, Deputy Mitchell referred to local authority housing.  Under this scheme for bringing key workers home from abroad we have a £2,000 housing allowance.  This was a successful scheme, indicated by the fact that we have to provide more money for it.</P>
    <P>In relation to apprentices, the experience so far is that employers generally are retaining apprentices except where <Col N="170" /> there are mass redundancies or where there are closedowns.  I would encourage employers to continue that because it is extremely important to have trained people available.  However, when apprentices become redundant AnCO will try to place them elsewhere or will take them back into training until they can be restored to employment.  This is one of the reasons why we are providing extra money for them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the work experience programme, I was surprised by Deputy Mitchell's comment suggesting that it is related to the employment incentive scheme.  I was surprised that as labour spokesman the Deputy did not realise the difference between the two.  The work experience programme, introduced in September 1978, is extremely important for the young person.  This scheme helps people without experience going before an interview board.  Because of their lack of experience they were often passed to the end of the list.  The placement rate from that scehme is 80 per cent, which is an indication of its success.</P>
    <P>The fact that much of this money is coming from appropriations-in-aid was mentioned.  This is a tribute to my officials, my Minister of State and to myself for good housekeeping arrangements.  I do not agree with Deputy Mitchell when he says that the social fund has been exploited.  I compliment the officials concerned for the successful way in which they have arranged the availability of funds through the European Social Fund to assist in training and the other related areas covered by the fund.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan appealed to me on the question of the Labour Court.  I have a lot of sympathy with the Deputy's request but this is not final.  The best information available to me is that rather than solving problems it could create some.  I will bear what the Deputy has said in mind because I have some sympathy with the situation but there are some difficulties in doing what the Deputy has asked me to do on a number of occasions.  I thank Deputies for their support in getting the Supplementary Estimate through this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes the continuing failure of the Government to take decisive action in the area of the control of prices, notes the continuing attempts by the Government to evade its responsibilities in this area and further notes that the rate of inflation is still almost 19 per cent, and calls on the Government to implement its undertaking in page 10 in the Fianna Fáil Manifesto to discourage increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control or influence so that the impact of inflation on the community, and in particular, on the less protected sections of the community, will be abated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of this motion is a quote from the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  One of the important commitments entered into by the Government prior to the last election was to take effective action to reduce price increases.  In this as in all other areas of public policy they have failed lamentably. According to the manifesto, price rises this year would be of the order of 5 per cent.  The White Paper, <i>National Development 1970-1980,</i> published in January 1978, restated this commitment when it stated that the Government's target was a reduction to 5 per cent in the rate of <Col N="172" /> inflation in 1980.  That target was restated in a Green Paper, <i>Development for Full Employment,</i> published in June 1979 two years after the Government took office.</P>
    <P>What is the reality this year?  Prices in 1980 will increase by around 19 per cent, almost four times the Government's target. The pound in the consumer's pocket at the end of this year will be worth one-fifth less than it was at the beginning of the year.  Not only therefore have the Government failed to meet their pre-election commitment on prices, but they have landed the country with a rate of inflation which is one of the highest in Europe and is effectively destabilising the whole economy.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling the position when the Government took office.  Inflation in 1977 had been brought under control.  In the years to mid-November 1978 it had dropped to 7.9 per cent as a result of the policies of the previous Government. From then on, however, prices once again began to rise rapidly.  By mid-November 1979 the annual rate of inflation had more than doubled to 16 per cent and this year it will increase further to 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>The question arises why the position has deteriorated so rapidly since the Government took office.  What has caused prices to rise by 50 per cent since the last general election?  Oil price increases have certainly contributed.  Nobody denies that, but it would be wrong and dishonest to pretend that oil prices are largely to blame, as the Government say they are. The greater part of the blame rests on their mis-management of the economy. This is the case for a number of reasons. In the first instance the financial handouts which followed the election and which were supposed to increase demand for domestic products had two completely different effects.  One was to boost inflation and the other to increase imports.  In other words the financial handouts the Government promised in order to win the last election were responsible for directing inflation from a downward to an upward trend.  The Government decision to reduce food subsidies in the 1979 Budget contributed directly to inflation. That decision added over 3 per cent to <Col N="173" /> our food prices and contributed directly to the upward trend in inflation which began in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to increase indirect taxation in the 1978, 1979 and 1980 Budgets pushed prices up in each of those three years.  These were specific causes of the high inflation rate.  Above and beyond all these, however, the Government must face the fact that as a result of their policy, particularly on taxation, the country has entered into an incomes and prices spiral which is dangerously high.  Incomes are now chasing prices in a vicious circle which appears to be out of control.  The result is not only falling living standards for most of our people but rising unemployment and loss of production.</P>
    <P>High inflation is not just an economic problem, it is also a social issue.  Price increases this year are cutting savagely into the living standards of the poor.  Pensioners and low income families are worse off this year than when the Government took office.  There is no doubt about that.  Escalating house prices have put a home of their own outside the reach of an increasing number of young couples. At the same time the local authority housing bill has been savagely cut back. High interest rates combined with high inflation are leading to company closures and redundancies.  This year alone almost 30,000 workers will lose their jobs because of the crisis in our economy.</P>
    <P>Most of the trouble in our economy has been caused directly by Government action and inaction and by the rising rate of inflation.  It is no harm to give the background to the debate.  In regard to the promises and vicious election campaign that Fianna Fáil began in 1977, when they claimed the country was destroyed by the prices that existed at that time, they gave an undertaking that they would do something about it and reduce the rate of inflation in no uncertain terms.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, went on a grand tour of the country and came to my constituency.  He went into a supermarket in Newbridge. A woman held up a pound of butter to him and asked: &ldquo;What do you think of the price of that&rdquo;?  He said: &ldquo;Put us in <Col N="174" /> and we will do something about it&rdquo;.  They were put in and he did something about it.  He took the subsidies off food and increased the price of a pound of butter by 20p.  That is the kind of thing Fianna Fáil talked about at the last election. They said they would do something about the terrible prices that were in existence at the time.  Now at the end of three years we know what they did about prices.  We know that the rate of inflation is 19 per cent.  We know that one of their first actions was to remove the subsidies on food.</P>
    <P>There is collective responsibility in any Cabinet.  A Minister of this Government is quoted today in the newspaper as saying that food prices are too low.  That has not been denied.  The role seems to be changing, but there used to be collective responsibility in a Cabinet.  The Minister for Agriculture is reported as saying that food prices are too low.  There is not much recognition there for the unfortunate poor or old-age pensioner living on £21 a week.  That is what they are living on and nobody should think otherwise. People are living alone on £21 or £22 per week who are hungry, and there is no use in saying anything else.  They are hungry because of the direct action of this Government in doing away with the subsidies on our food.  The whole of those people's income is spent on food, and action of that kind hits these unfortunate poor far more heavily than it does anybody else. When I speak of the poor I am carried away because I know what it is to be poor.  I know what it is for an unfortunate widow to rear three or four children on the kind of pittance supplied by this State.  To gain paltry sums the Government did away with the food subsidies and these people suffered.  Fianna Fáil claimed during the period of the last Government that they advocated the introduction of food subsidies.  In their long history they have never been known to introduce food subsidies but they have been known on several occasions to take them away.  They might have advocated them when in Opposition.  If ever there was a time for a Government to do something about inflation it is now and they <Col N="175" /> should introduce food subsidies as the former Government did.</P>
    <P>I will give a few examples of the increases.  These are not my figures, they are figures given in answer to a question in this House.  For example, bread is part of the basic diet of the poorer sections of our community.  The increase in the price of bread since this Government took office is 71 per cent.  These are the Minister's own figures.  Milk, another basic in the diet of our poorer sections, has increased in price by 63 per cent, butter by 67 per cent and clothing by an average of 50 per cent over various items.  I will go on to the fuel which our unfortunate poor have to use in order to keep themselves warm.  Turf briquettes have increased in price by 65 per cent and bottled gas, which unfortunately all the poor in the rural areas have to use, has increased since this Government took office by 80.7 per cent.  I do not represent a Dublin constituency but I know that the increase in the price of piped gas in this city is the wonderful figure of 137 per cent.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement I mentioned people who have been struggling for years to buy a home of their own and who have been lucky enough to get a mortgage from a building society or some such body.  The increase in the interest rate on these people's mortgages is 66 per cent over the past three years.</P>
    <P>Every member of this Government promised in 1977 that not alone would they reduce the rate of inflation but they would reduce the prices of the commodities that were necessities of life, and this is the return that they have given us.  I could go on and on.  I could talk about petrol, the price of which this Government increased deliberately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; by 20p a gallon in the last budget.  That was the most irresponsible action ever taken by any Government in the history of this State. The increase in that tax on petrol went right through the economy and it set inflation roaring mad.  This Government <Col N="176" /> ought at this stage to say honestly and truly that they can do nothing about this inflation.</P>
      <P>I turn to the area for which I am spokesman for my party, that of agriculture. It is well known and admitted by Government Ministers that the farmers are in a desperate state.  Only this morning I was talking to the manager of a bank who asked me if I thought the Government would do anything about it.  I told him honestly that I did not think they would and he said, &ldquo;These people are coming in here to me and they owe money which they borrowed at the rate of 10 per cent when the last Government were in office but now they are paying 18 and 19 per cent&rdquo;.  That is impossible for them and it is due directly to the reckless policies of this Government who raised the rate of inflation in their period in office.</P>
      <P>Apparently a survey has indicated that Fianna Fáil were handling the economy well, but that must have been taken by a Fianna Fáil cumann who interviewed only Fianna Fáil people.  I think that about 1,000 people were supposed to be interviewed in it.  How anyone could think or say that our economy has been handled in any kind of manner that would bring honour to a Government is beyond me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to another item in which I have a special interest and on which my party put down a motion here a couple of years ago, and that is the rate of increase in motor insurance.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and some others were talking about the Minister for Prices in 1977.  We hear very little talk about that now and a number of organisations now suspect that they must support Fianna Fáil although they claimed to be independent at that time.  Another promise by Fianna Fáil in their manifesto was that they would have announcements on the media about any increase and how it was justified in the CPI.  They did start off by making announcements in the early days when inflation was dropping as a result of the previous Government's policy.  That has stopped and there is not a word now in the media about price increases.  Fianna Fáil promised in 1977 <Col N="177" /> that they would monitor prices in a serious way and that they would publish on radio and television and in the media generally the reasons, if any, for price increases.</P>
    <P>We now see that the insurance company who control more than half the motor insurance business have been granted a 35 per cent increase and no attempt has been made to justify it in the media.  The matter was discussed here one evening on the adjournment.  Prior to becoming a Member of this House I worked for a while as an insurance agent and I have some knowledge of this area. the company to which I am referring started off as a co-operative, owned and fully maintained by its members.  Then they formed themselves into an insurance company, separating from the co-operative for which they continue to collect a membership fee.  They have made huge profits from the members of their own co-operative and yet they have been granted an increase of 35 per cent.  Does the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism&mdash;or, as I would prefer to call him, the Minister for Prices&mdash;own this company?  In the light of the huge profits made by them, it is hard to believe that anyone could allow them to mulct their members in the provision of insurance.  It must be obvious to any ordinary person that these people are using money collected for motor insurance for the purchase of property and newspapers.  There is no doubt that the money for these enterprises has come from motor insurance premiums and membership fees paid by working people who must travel in some cases up to 40 miles to their jobs in order to earn enough money to pay these outlandish sums.  Young people are being asked to pay as much as £350 for third party cover.  The Government are not making any attempt to control this company.  They gave an undertaking to their membership that they would plough back profits to the relief of insurance premiums but instead they are expending huge sums on the purchase of property. Their promises to their membership were probably made before they realised that they would be dealing with such a soft Minister who would allow them to mulct <Col N="178" /> policyholders and young people looking for first insurance.  That is the policy of Fianna Fáil and responsibility to deal with this matter rests on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>It was bad enough that Fianna Fáil made so many foolish promises during the last election campaign, but it was entirely stupid to try to carry them out. A typical example was the removal of tax on motor cars without any provision for the replacement of that tax.  This created the illusion that money was there for anything and that the Government could take any action without ruining the economy. If they did not appreciate the consequences of such action they are not fit to be Ministers in any Government.  They fuelled inflation while promising full employment, and the two are incompatible. The rate of inflation is higher on food than the average 19 per cent and this also applies to materials and inputs for industry.  It was one of the factors in the closing down of so many industries and the redundancy of 30,000 people last year.  Through their lack of initiative the Government failed to control the rate of inflation and allowed this to happen.  The rate of inflation in Germany is about 5 or 6 per cent while here it is 19 per cent.  Yet the Government expect our industries to compete on the European market and they expect workers faced with huge price increases to accept pay increases lower than the rate of inflation.  This is the worst type of Government any country could have.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about the effect of inflation on local authorities who are, in rural areas, very important employers. The Minister for the Environment allowed local authorities to increase their own rates by 10 per cent.  They refused to allow them to increase the rates any further even though the rate of inflation was 19 per cent and the increase in the price of materials purchased by local authorities is far higher than 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>The price of road-making materials and sand has increased by about 40 per cent and tarmacadam and tar by 36 per cent.  The result of the difference between the 10 per cent increase in rates and the increases in the price of these commodities can be seen in our roads. <Col N="179" /> I do not have to tell anybody who travels in this country what has happened to our roads.  Not alone are they the worst in Europe but they must be the worst in the world, except perhaps in some undeveloped African country.  A Fianna Fáil member of this House told me he would prefer to pay £500 tax and be able to travel to other constituencies than travel on our roads as they are at present.  That is the truth.  There are people in my constituency who travel 30 and 40 miles to and from work every day.  There cars are being wrecked because the local authorities are unable to maintain the roads due to the limits being put on them by this Government.</P>
    <P>The Kildare county manager is boasting that he did not have to lay off any men this year.  There are 100 fewer people working in the Kildare County Council now, because of retirement and so on, than there were two years ago.  The council cannot recruit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the House that as a result of the Government's inactivity in this area this is happening at local authority level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with food but there are other areas where employment is affected.  The price of meat has increased by 35 per cent, although the rate of inflation is only 19 per cent.  There must be something wrong there.  It goes without saying that this affects beef production because beef cannot be sold.  This affects 1,000 workers in my constituency and I am sure there are people involved in the meat processing industry in other areas who are also affected.  What answer have <Col N="180" /> the Government?  I do not think they have any; they have not given any evidence that they have an answer.</P>
    <P>Anybody who applies for permission to increase his charges is granted that permission.  This is the type of complaint we heard in 1977 from the then Deputy O'Malley.  Telephone charges have increased beyond recognition but the quality of the service has not improved. That, too, was one of the complaints heard in 1977.  We all know that despite the brutal increases in charges there has been no evidence that the service has improved.  The Minister said there will be a phone in every house soon but the phones are not there now.  Where they do exist they are no good to anybody because a person cannot get in touch with anyone else by telephone.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to brass tacks.  This Government have not done anything to help the people.  They have carried out a deliberate policy which increased the cost of living and the rate of inflation.  The price spiral has gone mad.  I want to mention a few very important items.</P>
    <P>The price of sugar has increased substantially with the result that our sweets and confectionery are being priced out of the shops.  I challenge the Minister to go into the smallest huckster's shop or largest supermarket where he will find our confectionery, sweets and chocolates &mdash; some of the most famous commodities are manufactured in Ireland &mdash; being replaced on the shelves by cheaper British commodities.  This will lead to unemployment. It means we have a sugar surplus. The EEC say we are producing too much sugar but we could use our own sugar if inflation was not so high.  This will also lead to unemployment in this industry.</P>
    <P>The price of dried vegetables has increased by 44 per cent.  This is an area over which the Government have control because these commodities are produced by State bodies.  The Government say they cannot interfere with these companies but I say they can.  The Government have been too free to grant price increases for which there was little or no justification.  I have instanced several areas.  The Government have not taken <Col N="181" /> any action in this area, except that they met in Barrettstown Castle last year for four or five days to see what cutbacks could be made, what subsidies could be reduced or done away with and in which areas they could save money.</P>

    <P>I have listened to all the gobbledgook, with no positive proposals on how to handle the problems of today or how to run the country, and to the tirade of criticism, which does not measure up to facts.  I would like to compare the record of the past three years &mdash; I will not discuss election year, 1977&mdash;and the three years of Coalition Government.  I will not discuss election year 1973.  With regard to prices and inflation, I will go over the years 1974, 1975 and 1976.  That is fair to the Coalition Government.  I will go over the years 1978, 1979 and 1980.  The combined inflation of 1974, 1975 and 1976 was 55.9 per cent.  I would like the Opposition parties to realise that.  The combined <Col N="182" /> inflation of 1978, 1979 and 1980 was 39.1 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 20 February last, Minister O'Malley spoke in this House on a motion on prices from the Labour Party, most of which read word for word the same as the motion now before us.  On that occasion the Minister thanked the Labour Party for providing him with the &ldquo;opportunity of a regular six monthly appearance to speak in this ritual debate on this ritual motion&rdquo;.  He predicted that we would be back again in six months' <Col N="183" /> time for the next instalment.  I am glad to see that his prediction has come true, although slightly later than expected.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion before the House refers, once again, to the undertakings on prices given in the Government's 1977 Manifesto and asks the House &ldquo;to note the continuing failure of the Government to take decisive action in the area of the control of prices and its continuing attempts to evade its responsibilities in this area&rdquo;.  I will outline for the House the actions which have been taken by the Government in accordance with its undertakings in 1977.  I will show that the results of these actions are that we now have in operation in this country a system of price control which is more effective and more meaningful than when we took office.  The changes which we have introduced have resulted in a far more rigorous examination of price proposals than heretofore.  The Government's influence and control in the prices area has increased.  Procedures have been tightened up and every avenue has been explored to maximise the effect of our price control arrangements.</P>
    <P>We undertook in 1977 to review the structure and operations of the National Prices Commission.  This examination was embarked on by the Minister immediately he took office.  As a result of the examination and a number of meetings between the Minister and the National Prices Commission, changes were introduced in a number of areas.  These included such items as price contracts, notification of price increases, export exemption, transfer pricing, the whole question of currency fluctuations and new rules and guidelines for the processing of price increase applications.  The Minister also expanded the membership of the commission to include an economist.</P>
    <P>I must say at this stage that in my own short period as Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism I have been amazed at the volume and complexity of the work continually undertaken by the National Prices Commission.  I regret very much that there is a sustained campaign by the opposition to lower the standing of the <Col N="184" /> National Prices Commission.  It is unfair and unfounded.  They are, indeed, to be congratulated for the service which they have provided and continue to provide for this state.  I believe also that the way in which the Minister has undertaken his responsibilities in regard to price control has served as an encouragement to the commission in their difficult tasks.  Minister O'Malley has taken an active interest in price control matters.  Under the previous administration the then Minister simply acted as a rubber stamp in so far as National Prices Commission's recommendations were concerned.  Unlike his predecessor, Minister O'Malley subjects National Prices Commission recommendations to close scrutiny.  In cases where he felt that applicant firms could absorb certain cost increases without increasing their prices and without damaging their ability to remain in business he has refused or reduced the recommended price increases.</P>
    <P>In the pre-election manifesto Fianna Fáil undertook to investigate middlemen's margins in areas where there was an inordinate difference in the prices obtained by the producer and the price paid by the housewife for the same products. The Minister asked the National Prices Commission to undertake these investigations and directed their attention to such areas as the profit margins on meat, poultry, fruit, vegetables, fish, and so on.  In the case of poultry the commission discovered what they regarded to be an unjustifiably large increase in the gross margins on chickens. Acting on the recommendation of the commission the Minister made a maximum prices order on chickens which had the effect of reducing significantly the price of chickens at the time.</P>
    <P>As far as meat was concerned, th commission concluded in their December 1977 report that, despite increases in gross cash margins on beef and lamb in Dublin, there was no evidence of excess profits in the trade.  The commission have continued to monitor gross cash margins on meat throughout the country to ensure that margins do not increase unreasonably.</P>
    <P>A study of middlemen's margins on <Col N="185" /> fish revealed that there was no evidence of excessive profits on the part of wholesalers, processors or retailers.</P>
    <P>The study of middlemen's margins in relation to fruit and vegetables concluded that margins were not excessive except, possibly, in supermarkets.  Formal control of fruit and vegetable margins by maximum prices order would create serious administrative difficulties; it would be virtually impossible to relate a controlled price to a clearly defined quality of produce and this would render an order ineffective.</P>
    <P>The Commission continue to monitor prices being charged in these areas.  It has been found that, in a good many of them, the best way to reduce excessive margins is through improved efficiency and increased competition.  One of the best ways of increasing competition is by ensuring that the general public have as much information as is possible with regard to prices.  The fullest possible dissemination of information on prices was another one of the important undertakings given by the Government in the 1977 manifesto.  As a result of the implementation of this undertaking, my Department now provides an almost continuous flow of information to the national newspapers. In addition, a member of the National Prices Commission presents a weekly prices programme on RTE 2 Television. The Commission recently had a survey undertaken to ascertain the effectiveness of the prices information being published in the media.  I am glad to say that the survey concluded that a great many people find the information provided extremely useful.  The survey also revealed that the Tam ratings of the prices programme on television compare very favourably with other similar type programmes.</P>
    <P>The manifesto also committed the Government to control by legislation of monopolies and mergers.  This legislation was enacted and is being enforced rigorously. We committed ourselves also to abolishing the seven-day rule arising out of the UK outer zone in respect of petroleum product prices.  We abolished it and now applications for price increases on these products are examined strictly in <Col N="186" /> relation to cost increases already incurred.</P>
    <P>We undertook also to investigate fully differences in prices for similar products as between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  This undertaking has been met fully and the matter continues to be an on-going part of the commission's work. Deputies will be aware that the most recent National Prices Commission Report published &mdash; the report for August/September last &mdash; contains the results of a survey of prices of spare parts of passenger motor vehicles.  The survey concluded that, in some instances the price of spare parts in Ireland is very much out of line when compared with Northern Ireland/UK prices and the commission are pursuing the matter further.</P>
    <P>The final item in the manifesto with regard to prices related to the accounting procedures of the ESB.  These have been examined by a high-level inter-Departmental working party whose report is now under examination in the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>Electricity prices have risen sharply over the past 2 years.  They are a clear example of the effects on prices of external pressures which are outside the control of any Irish Government.  The ESB are dependent for 80 per cent of electricity generation in this country on imported oil.  Deputies do not need me to tell them what has happened to the price of oil in recent years.  The figures are well known. I will just remind the House that, in the last decade, the price of a barrel of light Arabian crude has increased by nearly 2,000 per cent.  The effect of cost increases of this magnitude on the price of electricity is easy to understand. Opposition spokesmen may indulge themselves protesting to the newspapers about each and every price increase but when they are faced with the harsh realities of economic facts their protestations are seen for what they are, that is, simplistic.</P>
    <P>There are no easy solutions to rising prices in times when costs are rising. There is no magic wand which will make rising costs go away.  Given the open nature of the Irish economy, we cannot insulate ourselves completely from the <Col N="187" /> adverse forces or influences operating in markets abroad.  We cannot simply award ourselves large wage increases in order to compensate for price increase caused by the increase in the cost of the imported raw materials which we need to keep industry going.  Increased wages and salaries not matched by real increased productivity must simply be passed on in increased prices on the home market and, therefore, in the final analysis are of no real benefit to the people who obtain them.</P>
    <P>In 1977, the Government committed themselves to improving the price control systems to ensure that the operation of price control is effective and is geared to meet changing economic circumstances. I believe we have achieved this.  As the manifesto put it &ldquo;Government policy must be directed towards discouraging increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control or influence&rdquo;.  This is the policy which the Government have actively pursued since taking office.  It is safe to say that the system we have now in Ireland is one of the strictest systems operating in any country of the EEC. Our system ensures that in most cases only vouched increased costs which have been incurred and which cannot be absorbed by firms can be passed on to the consumer in higher prices.</P>
    <P>A strict price control system cannot, however, of itself, provide all the answers.  It must be clearly understood that the cost pressures which nurture our inflation have both external and domestic origins.  The big rise in import prices, including oil-based products, reflects the international and political nature of the current inflation and is indicative of the widespread character of the problem. The urgent need is to win acceptance of the fact that people cannot be compensated for high oil prices.  These make the country as a whole poorer and if we want oil we must be willing to pay the higher prices to the OPEC countries.  Trying to resist this by claiming higher pay packets for all only makes matters worse, because more paper money cannot raise living standards, it can only raise prices and as prices go up, it means more Irish jobs are <Col N="188" /> lost to competition from other countries. If we overcome the problems in the areas of cost increases which are within our control and, indeed, industrial relations, we can confidently expect that our performance can at least match that of many other European countries.  There is still a strong momentum of new industrial investment, as a result of the efforts of the IDA to attract more firms into Ireland. And since this is modern industry with the most up-to-date technology, it is well placed to come through the present recession in relatively good shape and to benefit from whatever opportunities become available in the international market place.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion before the House refers to the impact of rising prices particularly on the less-protected sections of the Community.  I can assure the House, and the country, that there is no lack of awareness on the Government's part of the effects that price increases have on ordinary people.  Opposition spokesmen in their statements try to give the impression that the Government are in some way oblivious to the feelings of the people.  I am glad to say that the people themselves are not fooled by these statements.  I say that specially to Members of the Labour Party who were not involved in the recent by-election, who surely must have heard of its result and the way the people reacted to Government policies.  The Government's degree of awareness and concern for the plight of the less-advantaged sections of the Community has been amply demonstrated in successive budgets since the Government took office.  Major improvements in the income of the less well-off have always been the central element of the Budgets since 1977.  I would like to quote some figures to emphasise this point.  In quoting these figures I should say that the last speaker maintained that prices had risen 50 per cent since 1977. Actually that is not correct; it is somewhat above that figure.  Be that as it may I should say that since 1977 unemployment benefits &mdash; even with the admission by the last speaker of an inflation rate of 50 per cent &mdash; have been increased by 64 per cent &mdash; surely demonstrating a plus-14 <Col N="189" /> per cent situation.  Since 1977 also widows pensions have been increased by 78 per cent, contributory old pensions by 76 per cent, non-contributory old age pensions by 79 per cent and children's allowances by 90 per cent.  Surely that is a firm answer especially to the last speaker who wanted to give the impression that increases granted the less-welloff members of society had not kept pace with the rate of inflation.  Certainly they have done.  Indeed he quoted specific cases, one being of old people living alone.  We are all aware of this situation and the fact that probably these people will never have sufficient income because it is very difficult to live alone.  But the last speaker forgot to mention &mdash; and it is only correct to put this on the record &mdash; that it was this Government who initiated all those little additions those people got, which they cherish.  For example many of these people qualify for the free electricity allowance, the living alone allowance, the free fuel scheme and &mdash; something berated by the last speaker &mdash; the fact that there are now no rates payable on their private dwelling places. Indeed the Deputy referred to that matter a number of times almost giving the impression that he wanted rates re-introduced on private dwellings.  It was difficult to know what the Deputy was advocating. The fact that these people do not now have to pay rates on their dwellings is of great benefit to them.  Before that change was brought about a person living alone often paid £100 per annum in rates. Thanks to Government policy initiated in 1977 they no longer have to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <P>There are a great number of people living in caravans at present who cannot get houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised the last speaker referred to rates in a manner appearing to advocate their reintroduction. There were many people living in caravans in 1977, when the former Government had not even the money to hold a census.  Deputy Enright is talking about housing but, when he remembers that the Coalition Government could not even hold a census, then he must ask himself <Col N="190" /> how in the name of goodness they were going to undertake other things.</P>
      <P>It is clear from these figures that the Government have always had, and continue to have, a firm commitment to improve, in so far as is possible, the position of those most vulnerable in our society.</P>
      <P>In 1977, the Government committed itself to developing an effective price control system.  In the operation of an effective price control system, it is necessary to hold a balance between the competing needs and demands and pressures of the consumer and those of industry.  An effective price control system must cater for these needs in a consistent and practical way.  The powers which the Government possess in regard to price control have been used and can be seen to have been used, over the past three years, in this way.  The system is strict, fair and equitable and is applied strictly, fairly and equitably.  The present economic recession which is being experienced throughout the world creates many problems for us.  There continues to be however, in my opinion, considerable opportunities for our economy which can be obtained through our own initiative and if we exercise prudent management of our affairs.  I believe that the way in which prices are controlled on the home market is of paramount importance in this recessionary period in that it can help to set a sound economic base from which to grasp the opportunities for progress which will arise in the future.  By implementing the commitments on prices made in the 1977 manifesto, the Government have ensured that this will be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to some other points raised by the last speaker in regard to which, by the end of his contribution, he was contradictory.  He dwelt at length on the increased cost of the necessities of life, for example, stating firmly that the cost of meat had increased by 35 per cent. He also said there was a substantial increase in the price of sugar, vegetables and milk.  Earlier he had said that farmers were never worse off.  He says on the one hand they are not making enough and on the other hand that they are making too <Col N="191" /> much.  He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  He must face the position as it is.  It is hard to understand his argument. He says that meat is up 35 per cent and that this is affecting jobs in his constituency. Earlier he said it was because the farming community were not making enough that there would not be enough produce from the land.  One of these statements contradicts the other and that is the way the Labour Party works at present.</P>

      <P>Both Deputy Bermingham and Deputy Lipper were very sore when I outlined to them this Government's policy over three years.  We do not take the election year into consideration because that is a divided year, so to speak.  Taking 1974, 1975 and 1976, the rate of inflation over those three years was 55.9 per cent.  In 1978, 1979 and 1980 it was 39.1 per cent.  That is sufficient answer to the Opposition speakers. When the House considers the facts that I have put before it I am sure it will readily accept the amendment to the motion.</P>

      <P>I shall not argue on that but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to an important development over the weekend which I belive should be investigated by his Department.  I should like his Department to examine the position in regard to oil and diesel fuel that have been freezing over the weekend.  The cost of oil and diesel is excessive, but, as the Minister of State is <Col N="195" /> aware, last year because of the intense cold some of it turned to jelly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The oil companies gave an assurance that the oil would be treated in such a way so as to prevent it being affected by the cold.  I have received complaints recently that that assurance has not been honoured.  The result is that many families, farmers and those who use oil in trucks are inconvenienced and have a heavy price to pay.  The cost of installing central heating is very great and it is wrong that those who have oil burning central heating must face this hazard annually.  The Minister should give urgent consideration to this matter and seek an assurance from the oil companies that this will not occur again.  This matter is of urgent public importance.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that the issues raised last week would be left to the historians but he cannot say the same in relation to the subject matter of this motion.  The Irish people, and the Irish economy, are subjected to a Government the incompetence of which has never been experienced before.  I challenge the Government and the Taoiseach to refute that.  We have witnessed a frightening record of failure by the Government.  It is just one year since Deputy Haughey was made Taoiseach and in that short space of time we have been subjected to one of the worst Governments that has ever controlled the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to quote some sorry facts for the Minister of State.  The terrible situation that exists here has been caused by rampant inflation and the failure of the Government in last February's budget to tackle that problem.  The result <Col N="196" /> is that unemployment is rising by about 4,000 per month.  We have never seen such massive unemployment.  It is part of the Government's record of dismal failure. Irrespective of the result of the Donegal by-election or of the opinion poll carried out by the RTE programme &ldquo;Today, Tonight&rdquo; it is my view that when the Taoiseach decides to call a general election he will be rejected by the people for his failures.  since December 1979 to the end of October 1980 29,700 people have been added to the list of unemployed. In December 1979 there were 85,200 people out of work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the end of October of this year there was 115,000 people out of work, the highest increase experienced here in such a short space of time.  It is a frightening figure.  What is more alarming is the fact that apparently there is no positive action being taken or effort being made to try to solve this frightening problem. The Government should direct their attention immediately in this direction.</P>
      <P>The report of the National Prices Commission issued in October states that a total of £38 million in price rises was allowed.  A total of 85 applications were made to the commission, 32 were allowed in full, 42 allowed in part, nine noted and two refused.  Sizeable increases were allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has asked us to suggest positive efforts that could be made to reduce inflation and which, as well as reducing inflation, would help employment prospects.  I will recommend a few. It is my view that food subsidies should <Col N="197" /> be restored totally and even increased beyond what they were under the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>The Government should have the courage to admit that they made a mistake when they withdrew a large protion of the food subsidies.  However, having made that mistake they have decided to stand over it.  At the end of December 1978 we saw the commencement of the inflation spiral.  At the end of 1978 it stood at 7.9 per cent.  By the end of 1979 it had reached 16 per cent and at the moment it is 18.8 per cent and rising. Now inflation is out of control and the Government have not got a remedy.</P>
    <P>I do not know who advised Deputy Colley, when he was Minister for Finance, and the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the then Taoiseach, or was it those three wise men themselves who made decisions without advice from anybody at the end of 1978? At any rate, inflation stood at the 7.9 per cent and now it is running at nearly 19 per cent.  The removal of the food subsidies, as can be seen from those figures, was the greatest of the many blunders made by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I will suggest to the Minister some further positive efforts the Government could be making.  The Government must have considerable influence in the area of the State-Sponsored bodies and the various Departments and they should have used that influence to stop price increases.  In the last budget the Minister for Finance announced increases in postal and telephone charges and I warned him of the consequences of going ahead with such increases.  I told him that many small firms throughout the country would be devastated.  I issued a public statement on it and I am sure some members of the Government saw it.  Nevertheless they decided to go ahead with those increases, despite my warning that they would lead to job losses.</P>
    <P>They allowed massive increases in ESB charges.  The last such increase, in October, brought the aggregate increase in the price of electricity to a massive 89.6 per cent in 12 months, a savage increase. Somebody has got to try to shake the <Col N="198" /> Government out of their slumberland, because those electricity price increases have sounded the death knell for a number of small industries throughout Ireland, many of which had been built up by the sweat, the hard work, the investment and even the lives of many people, 30,000 of whom have lost employment in the last ten months.  Small indigenous industries throughout the country, like textiles, depend heavily on electricity.  If they failed to meet their electricity bills they were cut off.  They paid up and looked happy although they were far from happy.  The position is that high electricity charges have devastated these small industries.</P>
    <P>Two other blunders that seriously affected the entire country were increased CIE charges and the increased petrol taxes in the last budget.  The accumulation of all these increases has devastated industries throughout the country. That is why I ask Fianna Fáil backbenchers to look at the situation realistically and to act accordingly.  I do not expect them to cross the floor of the House and vote with us tomorrow night, but at least let them stay away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for having given me permission on the Adjournment to bring to the attention of the House and the Minister the fact that about 7,500 families are on the housing waiting lists of the Dublin local authorities.  If we assume that the average size of such families is three people the number actually concerned is <Col N="199" /> 20,000 people.  They have completed housing application forms, have been visited by health inspector, have submitted data related to their income levels, have been visited by housing officers and are deemed to be in need of housing.  They are living in overcrowded conditions, in private accommodation where they pay very high rents or in accommodation which is on the verge of being classified as unfit for human use.</P>
      <P>There are many married couples, quite a large number of single parent families and a large number of single and elderly people in the Dublin area, who are unable to purchase out of their own resources private accommodation or unable to live with human dignity in rented accommodation.  In the south Dublin area, in Dun Laoghaire and Ballybrack, there are now 600 such people on the housing list.  If any young married couple, an elderly person or a one-parent family want to rent one room 12 feet by 10 feet in that area the average rent is £20 to £25 a week.  In many instances those people have to share toilet facilities, bathroom and shower facilities, if they are provided, and a clothes line.  It is a disgraceful commentary on our social attitudes that the vast majority of people, including politicians in this House, who have houses, are not concerned about those who have no homes to live in.  That has to be shouted from the rooftops of Leinster House every day.  The situation is getting critical.</P>
      <P>I made an allegation in my question that in some local authority areas &mdash; I refer to Dun Laoghaire Corporation in particular &mdash; if a person's annual income exceeds £5,500, if a couple are earning more than £106 a week, they are refused registration and approval as housing applicants.  The Minister says that Dun Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council say they have not refused to consider applicants for local authority housing purely on the grounds that their income exceeds £5,500 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not referring to Dublin County Council.  I am chairman of that council and we do not operate any income limit. I know of 13 cases in Dun Laoghaire <Col N="200" /> borough where that local authority have said to people in the last year: &ldquo;You are earning more than £106 a week.  We accept that you are living in unfit housing conditions.  If your wages are £110 or £120 a week you will not be registered as a housing applicant.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to again contact Dun Laoghaire Corporation and inquire if the information he has received is correct because the information I have, including correspondence from that local authority to housing applicants, does not bear out what the Minister says.  The matter should be clarified. I am satisfied with the good intentions of the Minister that no local authority in the country should fix a general arbitrary figure of £5,500, which is the loan limit for housing, and say that people above that figure must provide their own houses.</P>
    <P>There are no new houses available in the area I represent for less than £30,000 to £35,000.  If the Minister can show me a new house in the Dun Laoghaire borough at around £20,000 to £25,000 I can produce him a first-time buyer.  The same applies in the county council area, where the cost of housing is very high.  It is even higher than Galway city.  The statistics do not give the breakdown; they only give it generally for county Dublin.  The cost of private purchase accommodation and of rented accommodation is exceptionally high in south county Dublin.  The situation has changed very considerably.  We do not have to go any further in relation to the points made in my question than the recent report issued by the National Economic and Social Council, which was presumably available to the Minister's Department towards the end of September. It was printed in September and was not presented to the House until a fortnight ago.  In other words, the Government sat on the report.  There are a number of salient points in this report which I should like to emphasise.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5.25 on page 50 supplies the following information:</P>
    <P>There are at present about 33,000 families on the waiting list for local authority housing around the country. This is made up of 26,000 approved <Col N="201" /> and 7,000 unapproved.  The approved alone represent more than four families waiting for each local authority house completed in 1979.</P>
    <P>That is an indictment of our economic and social system.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>The numbers of applicants have been relatively static in recent years (Table 32).  Meanwhile the total number of local authority house completions has been declining (see Table 32) and the difficulties of private house purchases have been increasing.  There is little evidence of a decline in the housing needs of families who live in unfit or in overcrowded dwellings and of categories such as the aged and the disabled.  The Council, therefore, considers that the need for local authority dwellings will not decline in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Is that not a clear indictment of the collapse, for all practical purposes, of any policy on the part of the Government to provide money for local authority housing? Again, paragraph 5.20 on page 48 of the report reads:</P>
    <P>The 1980 capital allocation of £183 million to housing will, if fully taken up, represent an increase of 8.3% in money terms over 1979.  The major part of this increase is to provide for grants and loans for house purchase and for house improvements.  The allocation for new local authority housing (excluding the allocation for the low-rise mortgage scheme) is £92.5 million and represents an increase in money terms of 3.2% over 1979.  Given the expected rate of inflation in costs the 1980 allocation represents a reduction in resources for local authority house building.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any further resources this will probably be reflected in a reduction in the rate of completions over the forthcoming six to twelve months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I only make the point that even if a couple are able to get a loan of £12,000 and if they get also the £1,000 grant for first-time purchasers and if they had saved £3,000, they would still need £10,000 to purchase a £26,000 house. Another point is that under the national understanding the £5,500 income limit is obsolete.  A saving of £3,000 would probably represent half the total income of a couple for the year.  Therefore, it has become impossible for many people to acquire homes of their own.  In this situation a close watch should be kept on local authorities in order to ensure that where families are in need of housing there is no pussy-footing, nor any question of using ministerial guidelines which can be pulled out now and again and used against housing applicants.  The financing of local authority housing programmes should be assisted.</P>
      <P>It is time that the Government tried to clear the role of the supportive agencies in this area.  So far the Government have failed totally to face up to the problems presented by the obvious independent and obdurate action on the part of the building societies, by the lack of contribution from insurance companies and from the associated banks and by the obvious collapse of the Public Capital Programme in relation to money being provided in particular for house purchase and home improvement loans.  In relation to the references I have made to Dún Laoghaire and to South County Dublin, I urge the Minister to make moneys available, particularly to Dublin County Council for house purchase loans.  At our offices in Parnell Square there are 350 approved applications which are worth about £4 million in terms of local authority housing applicants for the £12,000 loans.  The families concerned have been waiting from six to eight months but there is no money coming from the Department of the Environment to Dublin County Council and, consequently, these people are not being enabled to take up their house purchase loans.  Everything has been approved.  The cheques are there but they cannot be signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very many of the families concerned are paying exorbitant interest rates on <Col N="203" /> the bridging finance that they have had to obtain.  I wish to say to them that their frustration and their electoral reaction should not be directed in any way against Dublin County Council but should be directed at the Government in so far as their contribution to the council, particularly in respect of house purchase loans, has collapsed.  Despite the assurances given in the lead up to the national understanding that there would be a review of the situation under the Public Capital Programme, no such review has taken place.</P>
    <P>As chairman of Dublin County Council, I have no intention of bearing the burden of the incompetence of the Government in this matter.  That is why I am impressing on the Minister the necessity for making available without any further delay the moneys that have been approved.  I am asking the Minister to double-check the situation in relation to Dún Laoghaire Corporation in so far as the income limit is concerned in order to ensure that there is no messing around in the future.  I urge him to ensure also that Dublin County Council be given the money they need for house purchase loans.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for his tolerance.  I appreciate that I went somewhat outside the ambit of the debate but there was some confusion today with the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly.  I might add that that confusion was as much on our part as on his.  The Minister answered a number of questions together though some of them had been put down for written reply.  I hope that I have clarified now what I intended to ask by way of supplementary question today and I thank the Minister of State for coming in this evening.</P>

I have no wish to enter into such a debate at this stage as there will be plenty of opportunities to do so <Col N="204" /> later.  I am not criticising Deputy Desmond for what he has said.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I should like to quote the question and the reply given to the Deputy.  There was confusion about Question No. 36.  In fairness to my colleague, Deputy Connolly, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, I should like to point out that Question No. 36 was withdrawn at approximately 2.30 p.m. and I understand the reply was given to the Deputy by the General Office.  As a result of the question being withdrawn some confusion arose.  There was a lot of crossfire about this matter but I wish to restate that although it was put down originally for oral answer it was subsequently withdrawn for written answer at 2.30 p.m. Question No. 36 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that grave and serious hardship is being imposed on many young couples, single parent families and single and elderly persons in the Dún Laoghaire and south county Dublin area who are completely unable to provide either private purchase accommodation or private rented accommodation from their own financial resources because of the extremely high cost of new houses and rented accommodation in this area; and if he will accordingly instruct the local authorities that their refusal to accept housing applications from applicants in these areas where their income exceeds £5,500 per annum should be rescinded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> The reply to the question was as follows:</P>
    <P>In accordance with section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966, all local authority dwellings must be let in accordance with statutory schemes of letting priorities adopted by the local authority concerned and approved by me.  The approved letting priorities schemes of Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council do not contain any clauses which would exclude from consideration applicants of any particular level of income.  No income limit has been specified by my Department for eligibility for rehousing by a local authority.</P>
    <P>I understand from queries which I have had made of Dún Laoghaire Corporation and of Dublin County Council that they have not refused to consider applications for local authority housing from applicants purely on the grounds that the applicant's income exceeds £5,500 per annum.  Accordingly the question of my issuing an instruction to these two housing authorities on the lines suggested by the Deputy does not arise.</P>
    <P>I should like to expand on that a little and to stress again that there is no statutory income limit because the primary consideration is comparative urgency of need.  In preparing their building programme under section 55 of the Housing Act, 1966, a housing authority is required by sub-section 3 (c) of that section to have regard to the objective of providing adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons, including elderly or disabled persons, who in the opinion of the authority are in need of and are unable to provide such accommodation from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing Act, 1966, each housing authority formulates its own scheme of letting priorities for its area, subject to the following primary objectives set out in section 60 of that Act: (a) the repair, closure or demolition of unfit houses; (b) the elimination of overcrowding; (c) the provision of adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons, <Col N="206" /> including elderly or disabled persons, who in the opinion of the housing authority are in need of and unable to provide such accommodation from their own resources.  The Minister's approval is required for each scheme of letting priorities or for an amendment of a scheme.  This is necessary to ensure uniformity in compliance with the primary objectives referred to while leaving room for local discretion.  The making or amendment of a letting priority scheme is a reserved function.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in which I would be very slow to intervene.  Nevertheless, we are always anxious to ensure that the letting priorities of the local authorities are fair and reasonably applied.  With regard to the situation in Dun Laoghaire, the corporation have stated that their scheme of letting priorities does not include any clause that would exclude persons of a particular income level.  Following the issue of circular H37/78 of 31 August 1978 which exhorted local authorities to consider critically applications for houses from persons whose circumstances, including those of earning members of the household are such that they might reasonably be expected to house themselves with the aid of the new grants and loan limits in cases where an applicant's income was in excess of the maximum for an SDA loan &mdash; £5,500 &mdash; it was indicated to such applicants that they should be in a position to provide accommodation from their own resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if such an applicant satisfied the corporation that it was not possible to provide his own housing his case was processed in the normal way. In the past three years the number of cases where the corporation indicated that applicants appeared to be in a position to provide accommodation from their own resources was only 13 and four of these were subsequently processed while some of the remaining nine are still under review.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to <Col N="208" /> certain areas.  Perhaps the sites were more expensive or difficult to obtain.  The local authority will take all of this into account.  There is flexibility in such a situation. This is why we are not laying down hard and fast guidelines with regard to income.  We do not expect local authorities to debar anybody who is otherwise qualified for inclusion on the list.  We are conscious of the need to rehouse people and we continually exhort the local authorities to be as lenient as possible in the processing of applications. The criterion is the need of the applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Levels of sulphur dioxide and smoke in the atmosphere are monitored by the local authorities in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Dundalk and Drogheda.  Air pollution monitoring is also carried out by the Electricity Supply Board and by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in the Dublin and Cork city areas.  The long-term trends demonstrated by the measurements taken by Dublin Corporation show that since 1971 the mean annual levels of sulphur dioxide pollution have continued to fall, apart from a small increase between 1977-78 and 1978-79 which was followed in 1979-80 by a continuation of the long-term downward trend.  Smoke levels, except in 1976-77, decreased up to 1978-79 but showed a 15 per cent increase in 1979-80.  The reversal in the downward trend in smoke pollution levels is attributable to the increasing use of solid fuel for domestic space heating.  This trend is being kept under observation and any arrangements necessary to deal with continued disimprovement will be considered in the review of the statutory provisions for pollution control which is currently in hand in my Department.  At present, air quality standards in urban centres are in compliance with EEC health protection limit values and there is no evidence that urban air pollution is reaching crisis levels.  Three Dublin city monitoring stations are included in the EEC exchange of information programme relating to atmospheric pollution caused by sulphur dioxide and smoke.  This country is also participating in the ECE programme for the reduction of long-range transboundary air pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question on 28 November 1979 the Dublin figures for smoke for the winter periods, October to March, were given for the years 1973-74 to 1978-79. These are in terms of micrograms per cubic metre and I will repeat them for the <Col N="46" /> convenience of Deputy O'Leary: 53, 46, 38, 49, 43 and 34.  The figure for 1979-80 was 46 which is well below the EEC standard of 130.  The figure for the present winter period will not be available before April next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966, all local authority dwellings must be let in accordance with statutory schemes of letting priorities adopted by the local authority concerned and approved by me.  The approved letting priorities schemes of Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council do not contain any clauses which would exclude from consideration applicants of any particular level of income.  No income limit has been specified by my Department for eligibility for rehousing by a local authority.</P>
      <P>I understand from queries which I have had made of Dún Laoghaire Corporation and of Dublin County Council that they have not refused to consider applications for local authority housing from applicants purely on the grounds that the applicant's income exceeds £5,500 per annum.  Accordingly the question of my issuing an instruction to these two housing authorities on the lines suggested by the Deputy does not arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the annual revision of rent for local authority dwellings an amended scheme was introduced to take effect from 1 May last.</P>
      <P>Under previous schemes certain anomalies existed in so far as the assessment for rent purposes of the income of social welfare recipients was concerned.  Some incomes from social welfare payments were assessed at 50 per cent while others were assessed at 100 per cent.  To obviate these anomalies all social welfare payments are now being assessed at the full rate.</P>
      <P>To offset the effects of any rent increases which this procedure might entail and to assist those in the lower income groups&mdash;particularly social welfare pensioners and lower paid workers&mdash;substantial increases were made in the amounts of assessable incomes to which the various rent fractions apply and also in the graded scale of allowances for principal earners while at the same time the rent fraction at the lowest band of the graded scale was reduced from one-twelfth to one-twentieth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no change in the current scheme as regards the income to be taken into account for rent purposes in the case of employed tenants.  As in all <Col N="48" /> schemes since 1973 the rent of an employed tenant is calculated on basic income, which is, in general, the normal weekly rate of remuneration exclusive of overtime, shift-allowances and bonus payments.</P>
    <P>In the case of all tenants, children's allowances, supplementary welfare allowances, redundancy payments, disabled persons allowances, lump sum compensation payments, etc. are disregarded as income for the purpose of the calculation of rents.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the scheme as revised is fair and equitable to both local authorities and tenants and is designed to ensure that no tenant is required to pay a rent that he cannot reasonably afford.</P>
    <P>The scheme is reviewed annually and any amendments of the terms of the scheme considered necessary are made.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that in cases of genuine hardship it is open to local authorities to accept from a tenant for a specified period a lesser sum for rent than that required under the scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department do not distinguish between north Dublin city and the rest of Dublin in an overall planning context.  There are two major infrastructural developments under consideration which would either be sited in, or would provide infrastructural improvement for, north Dublin city.</P>
      <P>It is at present the intention of the ESB to erect two combustion turbines for electricity generation at their North Wall premises.  The first combustion turbine is due for commissioning in 1982-1983 and the second in 1983-1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the natural gas distribution system now in place in Cork is extended by means of a pipeline to Dublin, then north Dublin city will be served ultimately by a natural gas supply.  At the moment feasibility <Col N="58" /> studies are in progress in regard to the provision of a Cork-Dublin pipeline and also engineering studies of the work required to upgrade the distribution system in Dublin are under discussion.  If the pipeline project is found to be viable then the necessary upgrading work would start possibly in 1981 and extend through to 1983.</P>
    <P>As these projects are in the planning stage it is not possible at this time to say what expenditures would be involved.  As regards the natural gas project, I would emphasise that the studies and consultations currently in hands are for the purpose of assessing the technical and economic implications of the project and that no decision has been taken on whether or not to proceed with it.</P>

      <P>Dublin Port and Docks Board plan to spend a total of £5 million in 1981 of which £3.025 million will be in respect of infrastructure on the north side of the Liffey.  The major work involved will be the construction, south of the B&amp;I car ferry terminal, of a 200 metre long deepwater berth capable of taking the largest roll-on/roll-off vessels likely to come into use in the cross-channel trade.  Other works will include the development of sites for cargo handling purposes (Alexandra Basin east) and the construction of roads and services.</P>

      <P>The formulation and implementation of proposals for infrastructural improvements or investments is, in so far as the services for which I am responsible, essentially a matter for the appropriate local authority which in this case is Dublin Corporation.  The necessary resources for the financing of future works for the various services such as housing, roads, sanitary services, miscellaneous environmental services, fire and emergency services and so on, will be determined within the context of Government decisions in relation to the budget and I am not in a position to anticipate such decisions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be under some misapprehension as to my functions in this area.  I have no direct function at all.  An Bord Uchtála were established by the Adoption Act, 1952 and their powers and functions are set out in that and subsequent Adoption Acts.  They are an independent body and my Department are not involved in any way in their day-to-day operations or otherwise in relation to adoption.</P>
      <P>The board's basic function is to consider individually applications for adoption orders and, where satisfied that it is proper to do so having regard to the relevant statutory provisions, to make an order.  They have also certain specified functions in relation to adoption societies. They do not themselves place children for adoption nor have they any welfare or child-care function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">

      <P>The relevant statistics are contained in the annual crime reports of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The first full year of operation of the breathanalyser procedure was 1971.  The most recent crime report relates to the year 1978 and it is expected that the 1979 report will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The variations from year to year up to 1978 in the statistics relating to drinking and driving offences reflect the fact that the operation of breath and blood/urine testing was suspended on a number of occasions following successful court challenges. I am informed that the relevant statistics for 1979 will show a substantial increase on the figures for 1978, reflecting the operation over the whole of 1979 of improvements in the law, brought into force on 20 July 1978, which made the enforcement of provisions designed to deal with drunken driving more effective.</P>

      <P>Information is not available on which to <Col N="70" /> base a good estimate of the cost to the State if all ground rents were to be bought out at public expense.  This was recognised as a fact by the Ground Rents Commission who in their &ldquo;Report on Ground Rents&rdquo; (Pr. 7783) indicated that they were unable to estimate either the number of ground rents in the State or the total amount of money involved.  The best &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; that can be made on the basis of the available facts is that the cost of the purchase of the ground rents on dwellings would be likely to be in the range of £30 million to £60 million.  I emphasise that this relates only to dwellings and it is not possible to estimate what the further cost would be of buying out the ground rents on properties other than dwellings.</P>

Between that date and 30 November 1980, inclusive, 7,237 vesting certificates were issued through the Land Registry under that scheme.  In an additional 1,447 cases the purchase money had been paid to the ground landlord but the relevant vesting certificate had yet to issue giving a total of 8,684 ground rents which had by the end of November been bought out under the Act.</P>

      <P>The only statistics at present available of the nature required by the Deputy are in relation to the year 1978.  Given that the terms &ldquo;foundlings&rdquo;, &ldquo;waifs&rdquo; or &ldquo;urchins&rdquo; refer to abandoned, homeless or deserted children the number of such children assigned to the care of the health boards during that year was 90.  It is not possible, however, to readily confirm whether the legitimacy or otherwise of the births of such children was unclear or unknown.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in the case of a child who is abandoned and whose parents cannot be identified it is the practice to regard the child as eligible for adoption.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions numbered 342, 344 and 345 which relate to the fostercare services together.  The information requested by the Deputy is not available at present.  I am arranging to have such information as may be available collected from the health boards and will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards difficulties being experienced in the placement of children in foster care the position is that, in some areas, there is an inadequate number of foster parents available.  There is in particular some difficulty in finding suitable foster parents for children who are seriously handicapped or who have behavioural difficulties.  Towards alleviating this situation health boards have been exhorted by my Department to intensify their efforts in the recruitment of suitable foster parents and to strengthen their social work personnel in this area as far as resources permit.  I have further improvements in this service under review in the light of the recommendations that I have just received from the Task Force on Child Care Services.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question refers to the number of children for whom the health boards are responsible and who are in residential care.  As at 31 March 1980 (the latest date for which figures are available) there were 980 such children in residential care.  I would remind the Deputy that there are other children in care for whom the Department of Education are responsible.</P>
      <P>The homes have been financed through the payment of capitation grants at the approved rate.</P>
      <P>As regards the names and other details relating to the homes, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a parliamentary question on 17 June, 1980 columns 776-780, volume 322 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As regards the other details requested by the Deputy, I expect that most of the relevant information on these will be available in the Report of the Task Force on Child Care which is at present with the printers.  Should the report, when it becomes available, not entirely satisfy the Deputy's needs, perhaps he might address a further question to me.</P>

      <P>As the death in question was not registered within a year of its occurrence, it was necessary to get the written authority of <Col N="88" /> An tArd-Chláraitheoir to enable this to be done.  Application for this authority was made by the Registrar on 14 May 1980.  It was then necessary to obtain a statutory declaration of death by a qualified informant and this was submitted to the General Register Office on 25 June 1980.  In accordance with normal procedure, a thorough search was then undertaken of the records of the General Register Office to check the possibility of the death having been already registered. The completion of this search was delayed by a serious back-log of work in the General Register Office due to an unusually heavy demand for birth, death and marriage certificates in the first half of 1980.</P>
      <P>Authority to register the death issued to the Registrar on 21 November 1980.  I understand that the death has now been registered.  Death certificates may be obtained from the Registrar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, provides that a person who had reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year shall be entitled to pay-related benefit in respect of any day which is a day of incapacity for work which forms part of a period of interruption of employment and in respect of which the person is entitled to disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1952, provides that any three days of incapacity for work or unemployment, whether consecutive or not, within a period of six consecutive days shall be treated as a period of interruption of employment and any two such periods not separated by a period of more than thirteen weeks shall be treated as one period of interruption of employment (i.e. linked claims).</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Regulations, 1979, provide that the relevant income tax year for the purposes of calculating pay-related benefit in respect of any day of incapacity for work which forms part of a period of interruption of employment shall be the last complete income tax year before the beginning of the pay-related benefit year (which commences on the first Monday in January of each year) in which the first day of incapacity for work in the period of interruption of employment occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> The person concerned who is 37 years of age had been mainly engaged in selfemployment up to May 1978 when he took up employment with CIE.  He claimed disability benefit in May 1979 but was not entitled to payment as he had less than 26 contributions in the governing contribution year (1977).  As he was not entitled to payment of disability benefit on his claim he did not qualify for pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>He again claimed disability benefit in August 1979 and for five subsequent periods up to November 1980.  He received payment of disability benefit in respect of these periods of incapacity.  He also calimed pay-related benefit with each of these claims but he was not entitled to payment on the ground that he had no reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year (1977/78).  In this connection as all the claims subsequent to the first claim were separated from each other by less than 13 weeks they are regarded as linked claims.  Accordingly, the relevant income tax year for pay-related benefit purposes for all claims was the 1977-78 year which was the relevant income tax year appropriate to the benefit <Col N="92" /> claim in August 1979 on which he first became entitled to payment of disability benefit.  In the circumstances it is not possible to pay him pay-related benefit in addition to disability benefit on the claims in question.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to unemployment benefit is that, if he had been unemployed for periods from August 1979 for which he was paid disability benefit, he would have been paid unemployment benefit in respect of those periods but he would not have been entitled to pay-related benefit in addition to unemployment benefit.</P>

    <P>Dublin Corporation are acting as agent <Col N="105" /> for the Inner City Group in the matter. The grants will be paid to the corporation when the works to which the grants relate have been carried out.</P>
    <P>A number of other proposals for recreational and amenity facilities in the North Dublin City area have been received and are being considered by the Inner City Group.  These include a boat club, canoeing facilities; other play areas and a sports hall in Sean McDermott Street.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provision of amenity facilities a sum of £20,000 has been allocated to the Dublin Corporation for a special scheme of tree planting in the inner city.  Part at least of this scheme will be carried out in the north inner city area.</P>
    <P>It is understood that Dublin Corporation have provided a number of recreational facilities and amenities in the North City area in the past few years with the assistance of subsidy and grants from my Department.  In addition they intend to provide, subject to the availability of the necessary funds, a new public park which will be in excess of four acres.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the proposals he has for ensuring that the Royal Canal, the Tolka River and the River Liffey are pollution-free in view of their present polluted state; and if he will outline any arrangements made or being made by his Department with a view to improving the quality of these waterways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary control and regulatory functions under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, are vested in local authorities and my role is mainly a supervisory one related to the implementation of national environmental policy on water pollution control.  The preservation or improvement of the quality of particular waters is a matter for the local authorities within whose functional areas the waters are located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems which exist in the waters referred to by the Deputy are largely confined to the Dublin city section.  I can <Col N="106" /> say that improvements in the River Liffey can be expected to result from the completion of the greater Dublin drainage scheme and the implementation of licensing control of discharges of trade effluent under the 1977 Act.  The imposition of licensing controls can also be expected to bring about improvements in the quality of the lower reaches of the Tolka.  As to the Royal Canal the main problem is one of dumping rather than pollution.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are obliged in accordance with regulations made under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, to ensure that houses let by them are maintained in good tenantable condition and repair.  For this purpose, the authorities may retain all rental income and a proportion &mdash; 45 per cent in 1980 &mdash; of all proceeds of sales of houses to tenants to meet the maintenance and management costs of their rented estates.  The Exchequer meets in full the loan charges incurred in the provision of local authority houses for renting which this year amounted to over £62 million.</P>
      <P>In the light of the foregoing, the condition of houses in Wolfe Tone Villas, Wexford, or indeed in any other local authority housing estate, has not been investigated by my Department.  There are at present no capital moneys available to me to meet expenditure on the improvement of existing rented local authority dwellings due to the necessity to conserve all available capital resources for the provision of new local authirity houses.  However, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, I am examining the general question of financing necessary improvement works to local authority houses.</P>
      <P>I understand that an on-going programme of maintenance works financed from their own resources is being carried out by Wexford Corporation on all their rented dwellings including the houses in Wolfe Tone Villas.</P>
