      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 19, after &ldquo;more&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and has been shown on the basis of his accounts to have a taxable income in excess of £7,000 in 1980-81&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make some effort to bring about a bit of equity in regard to those who have to pay resource tax.  We have argued here on Second Stage and Committee Stage and last night on Report Stage that that blunt instrument of tax affects all those in the farming community with valuations over £70 whether they can afford to pay it or not.  Deputy Bruton deduced last night that the maximum enunciated by the Minister for Finance in the person of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, that nobody should have to pay tax unless he can afford it.  That did not appear to weigh very heavily with the said Minister of State when the vote came on this issue later in the evening because he marched through the lobby in support of placing a tax on everybody with a valuation of over £70 whether or not such person could afford to pay this tax.  It is the injustice inherent in that that we are seeking now to change by amending the Finance Bill for this year by proposing in page 32, line 19, after &ldquo;more&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and has been shown on the basis of his accounts to have a taxable income in excess of £7,000 in 1980-81&rdquo;.  This is not ideal but it is some way of ensuring that those who will be <Col N="389" /> asked to pay this will have at least a taxable income.  It is doing no more than that.  I hope the amendment will be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment refers to the taxable income.  As defined in the Income Tax Act, 1967, taxable income is the income on which a person is charged tax.  In other words, it is total income less the various reductions and reliefs given privately such as the ones we have been discussing here over the last few days on which I have made major concessions in relation to capital allowances and personal allowances. What we have to look at is what a taxable income will represent in terms of total income.  A taxable income of £7,000, as has been suggested here, will in many cases represent a total income of £9,000, £10,000 or even £15,000 or more.  It may well be that the Deputies opposite intended to specify total income instead of taxable income, but the fact is that as presented here it would mean that total incomes in excess of the figures I have mentioned&mdash;obviously it varies from case to case&mdash;would be exempt. Taking a middle figure, say £10,000, if the resource tax were to be limited to cases where farmers returned incomes of £10,000 or more very few farmers would be paying resource tax.  On a taxable income of £7,000 a single farmer would be liable to income tax in the sum of, say, £2,550 and a married farmer with the same taxable income would be liable to income tax of £2,250.  It is not known how many farmers would be in this category in this year but it may be helpful if I indicate that a simple survey for 1978-79&mdash;the one for 1979-80 is not yet available&mdash;showed that only 11 per cent of farmers with rateable valuations of £60 or over paid more than £1,000 in income tax that year.  Even if one were to assume that half of those&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>1978-79.  Even if we were to assume that half of those paid over £2,000 in income tax, it would be <Col N="390" /> clear from that that very few farmers of those who are at present covered within this proposal would be liable to resource tax under the amendment.  The yield would be negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone through this on that basis.  I have indicated more than once during the course of this debate some of the anomalies that arise.  I have given some examples of them.  I could give further examples not just in relation to this but to the whole range of anomalies in the area of farmers' taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We should stick to the amendment.  We cannot debate the whole field of the resource tax again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give all the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I gave some examples yesterday Deputies opposite appreciated, as they said themselves, that they did not have that information. Apparently they changed their views on what they were proposing.  I do not want to give information which might convey a wrong impression and which might give rise to some of the tensions we saw last year and before that.  This whole question is under review and our hope is that we will not have to continue this next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite should realise that if as a consequence of what they are proposing&mdash;and they have tried in almost every way possible to abolish this provision which is being introduced&mdash;the yield from the resource tax was very small, there would be another consequence.  The total yield from farm taxation this year would not be in line with expectations.  It would be very much less than what was proposed last year when this package was first announced. Since my budget statement and throughout this Bill I have made every possible effort to encourage productivity <Col N="391" /> and incentives for increasing herds by giving stock relief.  I have given significant concessions at some cost to encourage productivity and recognition of the role which agriculture plays.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the farming organisations that you cannot review something before it starts.  It would be contrary to what I have stated publicly in discussions.  When we review the situation at the end of the year, I hope we will be able to take steps to terminate this tax.  I do not propose to accept an amendment which, on the face of it, is intended to say, &ldquo;It applies only to people with certain taxable incomes, not total incomes&rdquo;.  It has been overlooked here, but not by the farmers, that if there is one element in our community which benefits more than another from the provision of income splitting, it is the farming community.  I welcome that.  It was part of my intention in introducing it.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy knows much about rural Ireland he must know that, in contrast with urban Ireland, in the vast majority of cases the wife has not an earned income, whereas in many cases in the towns and cities she has.  As the Deputy must know, the proportion is very much higher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Report Stage and when I sit down I will have said my piece.  In relation to a whole range of things including stock relief and the exemptions which have been made, I have been asked to treat farmers in the same way as everybody else.  I have treated <Col N="392" /> them in a different way, but in a way which recognises how important they are in our community.  I am determined to recognise that and to act on it.  I cannot be forced into a position in which I undermine the whole package we are putting together from the start.  That is what this proposal would succeed in doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment which we have proposed is to ensure that resource tax will be payable by a farmer only if his or her taxable income exceeds £7,000.  We are seeking to have inserted into the resource tax a provision that you pay it only if you are able to and if you have an income out of which you can pay it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the amendment, in common with other amendments we put forward, indicated that we tried in every way to seek to abolish the effect of the resource tax.  That is perfectly correct, and we make no excuse for that. We do not believe it is a fair tax.  It is a discriminatory tax and the Minister, in describing our approach as seeking in every way possible to abolish it, was speaking the truth.  The Minister, in the course of his reply, made a very interesting statement.  It was that very few farmers who will be affected by the resource tax will have incomes in excess of £10,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxable income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister said income. Taxable incomes of £7,000 would indicate, in the Minister's own words, incomes of £10,000.  This is what the Minister chose as the average, gross income of £10,000.  The Minister said very few farmers who will be liable for this tax will have gross incomes in excess of £10,000 and, therefore, there will be no yield from the resource tax.  Coming from the Minister, who has access to information that we do not have, that is very interesting, because it contradicts the impression that may have been created, that this resource tax would be paid by large numbers of rich farmers <Col N="393" /> earning £20,000 a year and more.  The Minister indicated that the vast majority of farmers who will be paying resource tax will have incomes of less than £10,000 a year.  He said few of them would have bigger incomes.</P>
      <P>There is no question of the resource tax being applicable, in the Minister's own words, and on the basis of the Minister's own statistics, to people with substantial incomes.  These are people with modest incomes.  They are in the higher middle income group.  They are not earning very large sums of money each year.  The impression other advocates of the resource tax sought to give, was that it is being applied to very well-off people.  That impression has been contradicted specifically by the Minister who introduced the tax.  What mystifies me is that the Minister is a member of a Government which came in here and, in the interests of economic development, abolished wealth tax which applied to people with incomes of £100,000 a year and, within two years of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not arise.  As I have already said, we are going to stick strictly to this amendment because we had hours on the resource tax and we cannot bring in other taxes at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just pointing up the anomaly in the Minister's position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an anomaly in the Deputy's own position with regard to the reintroduction of wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak for myself. The position is that the Minister's party abolished a tax which was applicable to people with incomes of £100,000 or more and are now introducing a tax which, in the Minister's own words, is applicable to people whose income is less than £10,000 a year.  It is a similar tax levied regardless of income on a productive <Col N="394" /> asset, the only difference being that the resource tax is discriminatory and applies only to farmers whereas the other tax applied to all holders of property.  Certainly it seems that there is a serious anomaly in the Minister's position when he can apply this method of taxation to the farming community only and ignore the other sectors.  We have not introduced the resource tax.  It is the Minister who has done so, so I do not have to explain any inconsistency in my position.  The provision we propose would ensure that only those who had an income of a significant character would pay the resource tax and therefore it is a reasonable amendment and I would have hoped that the Minister would be able to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add any more to this debate.  As the Chair has said, we have been debating this resource tax for a number of hours.  The best compliment that can be paid to us on this side of the House is the Minister's remark that we have done everything in our power to see that the resource tax did not become law.  That is an indication of how strongly we, on this side of the House, feel about this tax and the damage it will do to agriculture.  I suppose it would be possible to argue that if agriculture was going through a boom period and the incomes of farmers were rising by 15 or 20 per cent every year this would be a handy way of collecting money from them even though it would still be unfair.  But to impose on people whose income looks like being cut for the second year running a tax which they have no way of getting out of paying and are obliged to pay whether they have earned the income or not seems grossly unfair.  This amendment seeks to limit the payment of this tax to those who have a taxable income.  I am disappointed by the Minister's reaction and by what can only seem to be an anti-rural bias at the wrong time from that side of the House.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 32, between lines 42 and 43 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;33.&mdash;Resource tax shall not be payable if the Revenue Commissioners certify that, in the case of a person to whom section 30 applies, he did not have an income in the year of assessment which exceeded the personal tax free allowances to which he was entitled in that year.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that resource tax shall not be payable in the case of a person who does not have an income. Regardless of what the Minister may say about provision regarding the payment of resource tax by people who are below a certain income level, surely those without any income should be exempt from this tax.  This is the simple and in my opinion incontrovertible principle that this amendment seeks to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision would be that if the Revenue Commissioners certified that a <Col N="397" /> person to whom the resource tax applied on the basis of valuation did not have income in the year in respect of which assessment was being made which exceeded the tax-free allowances to which he was entitled, he would not have to pay resource tax.  This, then, is an eminently practical amendment because all of those farmers who are to be liable for resource tax will now have to keep accounts on which their tax liability will be assessed.  Those accounts will have to be lodged with the Revenue Commissioners who will be in a position to make a declaration that a farmer did not have any income in a particular year, should that be the case and, consequently, they will be in a position to decide to waive resource tax for that farmer in that year.  There is no case that the Minister might make to the effect that the amendment would result in farmers who would be liable for resource tax escaping the net because if a farmer does not have an income in any year there should not be any question of liability so far as this tax is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any reasonable member of any party would oppose the amendment and I trust that there will not be any attempt to tell me that I am being fanciful in suggesting that there are farmers who in a particular year might not have any income but to whom this section might apply.  We all know that, for instance, there are many farmers in the cattle business.  If cattle prices fall in a particular year, from one end of the year to the other, there will be many cases of farmers who in that year will have no income whatsoever.  It is clearly inequitable that those farmers should have to pay resource tax in a year in which they have no income.  This type of farmer already has many problems, especially the farmer in the cattle business who is liable to have no income.  We have evidence that our land is understocked and that these farmers are not producing enough cattle to keep our meat processing factories busy.  It is very reasonable that these farmers should not have to pay a resource tax if they do not make an income.  That would merely be piling difficulty on their existing difficulties. <Col N="398" /> There is enough risk already in the cattle business&mdash;and that risk is the reason why our cattle business is under-invested&mdash;not to justify adding a resource tax to be payable in a year when the farmer does not make an income, on top of the losses which may be incurred in the cattle business.  This present year is one in which this may be so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he has a lot of secret information about farmers and their tax position which he pretended he was reluctant to reveal to us here in this House which, if revealed, would suddenly make everything clear and that we would all see how justified his proposals are.  I challenge him now, if he has any information about particular farmers which would justify a rejection of this amendment, to produce that information here and now.  If the Minister has information to show that there are farmers who do not have an income and who, because of his secret information, could justifiably be asked to pay the resource tax, even though they do not have an income, let the Minister produce that information to this House here and now.  We do not want legislation put through on threats, nods and winks of &ldquo;If you press me too hard, I shall reveal information, which you will not like to hear, about farmers in this country and I do not want to do this because of all the damage it will do&rdquo;.</P>

      <Col N="399" /> Our amendment is eminently reasonable and I certainly hope that the Minister will be able to accept it.  In conclusion, would the Minister indicate the revenue loss, if any, that he would expect from the adoption of this amendment. This information would be very useful.  It would indicate just how many farmers who do not have an income, or are anticipated not to have an income this year, who still will be asked to pay a resource tax.  If the Minister has not got that information he should have it.  He should not be imposing a tax in the dark on farmers who do not have an income, without even knowing how many are in that position.  I hope that the Minister, on the basis of existing statistics, will be able to tell us how many farmers there are who do not have an income and who still will be asked to pay resource tax and, as a complement of that, his estimate of the cost, if any, of adopting this amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton has said that one should not make assessments or assumptions in the dark.  In this whole area, the assessments which have been made up to the moment have, by definition, been less than satisfactory. Unless Deputy Bruton has not been aware of the whole question&mdash;as farmers themselves are now very much aware&mdash;of not only paying the tax but being seen to pay their fair share of tax, he cannot begin to understand how delicate and important, in the interests of the farming community and of tax equity generally, this whole provision is. Deputy Bruton speaks always in terms of income, as if the taxable income in this case were as immediately definable as that in the case of, say, the PAYE tax-payer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I am saying is that there has been concern expressed, even by many farmers themselves, about the way the system has been used.  I have given examples of the operation of the notional system and indications in relation to claims for depreciation on farm plant and machinery reducing and taxable income.  Obviously, it is not in anybody's interest, farmers or otherwise, to continue a situation where there will be either real or perceived anomalies which give rise to reactions of the kind which, unless the Deputies opposite have not been listening, have been very evident. My constant main preoccupation in this area is to ensure that this division between town and country, as expressed&mdash;let me say clearly&mdash;by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to this and other areas, will stop.  I do not wish to get representations each year as Minister for Finance from one section about the other.  I can assure the Opposition Deputies that if all they were attempting to do were achieved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect to get much help from the Opposition in trying to achieve that. That is not what their function is, as they see it.  Deputy Bruton says, &ldquo;Trot out all the facts.  Give us all the facts&rdquo;.  I have <Col N="401" /> given some of the facts and shall give some other examples which may be indicative of the problem here, which is one which we are well on the way to overcoming. I take the example of the farmer with £100 valuation who would pay £350 resource tax&mdash;that that is of such crippling dimensions, such a huge burden, such a major onus in that year.  I do not accept that at all.  This is the issue which the Opposition, Fine Gael, are conveniently forgetting each time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a crippling burden if he has no income.  That is what the amendment is about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we come to what we are moving towards achieving.  I shall have to remind Deputies again of all the concessions&mdash;indeed I regard them as incentives&mdash;I have given in this area.  They keep concentrating on one aspect only.  My hope would be that the more productivity we see, the more real income and returns we see then the more we will be able to ensure that farmers will be treated the same as anybody else, allowing for the fact that they do have expenses over and above, that they do have to cope with losses, and I have dealt with that in relation to stock relief. They do have to face hazards others do not.  I have taken account of all of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the general picture.  I might revert now to what is being proposed in this amendment.  The effect of this is that a person who did not have any liability to income tax would not be liable to resource tax.  That is simply what this amendment proposes.  The amendment would drastically reduce the number of farmers who would be called upon to pay resource tax.  Deputy Bruton can argue what he likes from that but what he is saying is that men with over £70 valuation have no income. Obviously this would have a significant effect on the amount to be collected.  But apart from that, and this is important in relation to what he is after&mdash;which shows that when one tries to achieve something very often one winds up achieving the very opposite even of what <Col N="402" /> one intended to achieve oneself&mdash;it would mean that in the case of farmers, say, with the same rateable valuation and the same income, in-so-far as it can be ascertained and defined, those with the higher personal allowances, for instance the married farmers, would escape the charge to resource tax while those with lower personal allowances, for instance single and widowed person, would be called upon to pay the tax under this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that as reasonable.</P>

      <P>It will not.  I am talking about the situation taking account of those, including those.  Deputy Bruton asked me to give some further examples of the situation about farm tax generally and what is being paid in relation to it. Deputies opposite talk about the crushing burden of taxation on farmers. I do not want to be interpreted here as saying that farmers have no sense of responsibility.  I want to make it quite clear that what I am endeavouring to do all the time is achieve equity.  If Fine Gael are going to try to make a presentation on the one side, concentrating on one aspect only, then it is as well that I state some of the facts as they are in the round without any implications, just stating the facts.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, at various stages, and Deputy Bruton now talked about the crushing burden this would impose on farmers.  I have given some examples of the figures involved.</P>
      <P>I have here sample surveys taken over a considerable period.  For instance, for the year 1978-79 47 per cent of farmers in the tax net on the accounts basis&mdash;that is farmers who at that time had a rateable valuation of £60 or over&mdash;paid no tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of those who did pay income tax, that is the remaining 53 per cent, 18 per cent paid less than £300. A further 23 per cent paid between £300 and £1,000.  Only 12 per cent&mdash;and that is 12 per cent not of total farmers but of farmers with a rateable valuation of over £60&mdash;paid over £1,000 in income tax.  It is important to note that these percentages <Col N="405" /> relate to the number of farmers in the tax net which, at that time, was 26,000 of a total of approximately 150,000.  The percentages I have given relate to the top level of farmers, 26,000 of them out of 150,000.  I shall summarise it by saying that of the 26,000 farmers in the tax net for 1978-79&mdash;which was not a bad year, as Deputies will appreciate&mdash;12,000 paid no income tax and over 4,500 paid less than £300 in income tax.</P>
      <P>The resource tax of £7 million will be paid by 15,000 farmers, giving an average payment throughout the lot, from the very top&mdash;where, to say the least of it, there have been some anomalies because of the operation of a notional tax system and I gave some examples of that only yesterday&mdash;of something of the order of £437.</P>
      <P>Against this kind of background it is very difficult to see how there can be emotional complaints about the crushing burden of taxation on farmers.  One can argue at some length about the principle, maintaining that one should not work to principle on the basis that the only exceptions in this year will be paying a tax which is not related to income, that there are other major distinctions that have been made in this and other legislation in favour of them because they are a special case.  I have given precise examples of how this amendment will operate inequitably and would not even achieve what the Deputy wants to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope that in what will be a temporary measure overall, we will bring about a balance in equity.  As far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, this is like the old bone.  The dog can keep on chewing it and barking for as long as he likes.  Deputy Barry beat his breast and said it is unfortunate we have not got time to debate all the measures in this Bill.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan gave us a &ldquo;sermon on the mount&rdquo; on one issue, and of course the major issues in the Finance Bill, either because they are too positive or too complex, do not merit any consideration from the Opposition. They are not convincing anybody.  I am <Col N="406" /> making a genuine move towards equity for all farmers, and the farmers welcome this.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The resource tax being imposed by section 25 is manifestly unjust because it does not have regard to the capacity of those concerned to pay it. The section imposing it does not provide for methods of ascertaining whether a man has an income or not.  It is a repetition of last year's levy which split the rural and urban population apart with disastrous consequences.  That levy did not have any regard to the farmers' capacity to pay.  It was so unjust and indefensible that the Fianna Fáil Party were pushed away from it, 50 per cent, at the Ard Fheis not long after it had been imposed, and finally it was withdrawn completely by the then Minister for Finance within a couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>What was the result?  That levy was abandoned because it could not be justified, and this 2 per cent resource tax being applied to the two-cow man as well as to the 200-cow man has been devised on a similar basis.  Fianna Fáil were pushed away from the levy last year because they could not defend it and the result was that urban workers were encouraged to go on the streets in hundreds of thousands to protest at the taxes imposed on them.

Fianna Fáil promised the farmers that they would give them a present of £10 million but they are taking back £7 million here, having already taken £17 million through relief of rates tax.  Is the Minister not ashamed of himself?  How will he face the electorate at the next election? The story goes that he will not have to face them.</P>

      <P>The Minister trotted out a number of cases of farmers who were not liable for income tax, but he did not tell us why they were not liable.  I gave him a case yesterday and the day before of a farmer with a valuation of approximately £80 getting a disabled person's allowance, who will have to pay this tax.  If this amendment were accepted he would not have to pay it.  There could not be anything more relevant than that.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants all the hard luck stories on one side but he is not prepared to extend this relief to the other.  The only reasonable yardstick is income, but the Minister will not consider it.  I do not believe all the people on the list he read out should by paying income tax but are not.  He gave valuations and said these people were not paying tax.  If the Minister got into Ulster he would probably have on his list a man with an £81 valuation who is not paying income tax.  He would not have told the House that that man's case had been investigated by the North-Eastern Health Board and it was found he was so much in need that he got a disabled person's allowance.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The valuation I gave is double the threshold, which is £40.  That is a big valuation in my constituency, although it may not be very big in the Minister's constituency.  This amendment is manifestly just and will introduce some element of equity and justice into this absurd tax if the Minister must go on with it.  We are told it is a temporary tax but we know that the Minister and his troops, depleted as they are for this Bill, voted down a proposal to write into this legislation that it would be for only this year.  There are many precedents for that in the rates relief legislation.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to think again about this between now and when the Bill is discussed in the Seanad and to accept this amendment.  The substance of the Minister's argument is that the income tax personal allowances for single people, widows and married people are not fair.  There is no other meaning to his argument.  If they are not fair he is the man with the power to make them fair and he can amend this legislation accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 32, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;34.&mdash;In any case in which a person to whom section 30 applies has shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the combined total of the amount of resource tax paid and the amount paid in respect of his income tax liability exceeds 80 per cent. of his total income for that year, the Commissioners shall repay to that individual, his nominee or personal representative the amount by which <Col N="412" /> the combined total exceeds that percentage, provided that, however, the amount of tax repaid shall not exceed 50 per cent. of the amount of tax which, but for the provision of this section, would be payable by the person in that year.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This provision says that in the event of a farmer paying resource tax the combination of his resource tax and his income tax liability in no year shall exceed 80 per cent of his total income.  This provision existed in the wealth tax legislation&mdash;wealth tax combined with income tax in no case should exceed 80 per cent of total income.  As the resource tax is effectively a wealth tax on one section of the community, namely, the farming community, I believe this saving provision should exist here too.</P>
    <P>On the figures given by the Minister in reply to a previous amendment, 47 per cent of farmers with valuations in excess of £60 had no taxable income in the year in question, 1978-79, yet these are the farmers to whom the Minister is applying this resource tax.  The Minister may argue that this is because their accounts do not reveal the true position.  If this is so the situation should be remedied.  I do not believe it to be the case.  The accounts kept by farmers, which in many cases have to be vouched for by accountants, show what they actually earn.  The figures given by the Minister show that almost half of those who pay this resource tax did not have an income in 1979 which exceeded their tax-free allowances.  It is reasonable to say that income tax and resource tax should not exceed more than 80 per cent of their total income.</P>
    <P>If the Minister feels there is something wrong with the income tax code as applied to farmers, which either makes their income declarations inaccurate or enables them to get away with something which is unreasonable, his proper attitude should be to amend farmers' income tax and not to introduce a novel resource tax.  The Minister might say that we have not enough experience of the tax situation of the farming community to enable us to do this.  However, <Col N="413" /> I would point out that farmers have been paying income tax since 1974 and, if there is something wrong with that code which enables farmers to have an income without paying tax, it should have been discovered by now.  I believe that the farming community pay their fair share of tax on their income and that a resource tax is not justified.  This amendment in mitigation of the resource tax is justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For once perhaps it can be noted that there is a measure of agreement between myself and Deputy Bruton because I am endeavouring to have a system of farm accounting for tax purposes which will achieve the result desired by the Deputy.  He has confirmed many of the suggestions I have made during the course of this debate. While farmers have been paying income tax since 1974, it must be pointed out that during most of that period the notional basis was in operation.  This system has now been abolished because it gave rise to a considerable number of anomalies.  We must apply the knowledge we have gained to make the system more fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the Deputy would be entirely enamoured of the consequences of this amendment.  It would not have any practical effect where a farmer pays a significant amount of tax.  In the event of a farmer being subject to income tax at the top rate of 60 per cent he would have a total income of over £10,000 in the case of a single man and over £20,000 in the case of a married man.  A single farmer with an income of £11,000 would be liable to income tax at £4,181, without taking account of credit for rates paid.  Eighty per cent of his income would amount to £8,800 and unless he had a farm having a rateable valuation of £1,320, which would produce a resource tax of £4,620, there would be no question of a refund.  If the credit for rates were taken into account the income tax liability would be wiped out completely and in that event the resource tax would be less than 80 per cent of his income.  That is the anomaly <Col N="414" /> which emerges at the top end of the scale.  The figures I have given relate to a single man and the corresponding figures for a married man would be even more extreme.</P>
    <P>A single farmer with the very low income of £1,735 would pay about £21 in income tax.  Eighty per cent of his income would amount to £1,388 and the proposed amendment would not come into operation unless the resource tax exceeded £1,367, which would be the charge on a farm with a rateable valuation of £390.  Taking account of the credit for rates there would be no income tax liability and the resource tax would not exceed 80 per cent of his income unless the rateable valuation were in excess of £396.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate what the amendment is intended to achieve, its implementation would not achieve the desired result.  A married man would not be liable for income tax unless his income exceeded £3,400.  On an income of £3,500 the income tax liability would be £60 and 80 per cent of that income would be £2,800.  The amendment would not come into operation unless the rateable valuation of the farm exceeded £783.  I have given during this debate some examples of valuations and we have not come anywhere near this super league of rateable valuations of £1,320 or £783.  Not even in Tipperary as I aware of such valuations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> The purpose of this amendment is to postpone the date of payment of the resource tax until 31 December.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, there will be a bunching of liability and many farmers will have to pay most of their tax in one month.  We are proposing the postponement of resource tax payment in order to avoid that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is concerned that what he would describe as the &ldquo;crushing burden&rdquo; of taxation comes on the same date.  I would point out that I have already put back payment by one month and professional and self-employed people will have to pay a month earlier.  Payment on 1 October relates only to half the liability for the year in the normal income tax accounts and the second half is payable on 1 January.  The burden is not as crushing as has been represented because I have already made adjustments in favour of farmers.  It must be remembered that we are talking only in respect of this year and I have already stated my hope and intention.  If the effect of the amendment would be to ensure that tax would not be payable this year having regard to the two months' grace, my hope in the light of the review of the entire package would not be realised.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) For the purposes of this section a trade shall include fish farming, mushroom cultivating, ship repairing and books and printing cards not printed by publishers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a long discussion on Committee Stage about the 10 per cent corporation tax that will come into operation from 1 January 1981.  At that time the Minister indicated that ship repairing, fish farming, mushroom cultivation and books and printing cards not printed by the publishers were trades and industries that were able to avail of freedom of tax on exports under the old regulation but were not included in this Finance Bill. The Minister indicated that he would introduce an amendment to next year's Finance Bill to include fish farming, mushroom cultivating and ship repairing among those categories that could avail of the 10 per cent rate.  However, I gather there is some technical problem regarding books and printing cards not printed by the publishers.  I do not think the Minister explained why he could not amend existing legislation to include these categories.  I would be willing to withdraw my amendment if the Minister gives a satisfactory answer about the three categories and also about that dealing with publishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, it is my intention to introduce amendments on the lines suggested by the Deputy in the Finance Bill for next year.  The Government are <Col N="417" /> favourably disposed towards their inclusion. As I have said already, we are in discussion with the EEC on this matter and obviously I am anxious to ensure before including a provision in the Finance Bill that it will not be shot down.  If we can make provision for this matter next year, it will operate retrospectively from 1 January 1981. That statement of the intention on my part and on the part of the Government should be a significant confirmation of the position.</P>
      <P>In making those comments I am talking about the production of fish on a fish farm, the cultivation of mushrooms and the repair of ships.  I am not talking about publishing.  The extension of the new relief to the publication of books and greeting cards not printed by the publishers, which is a non-manufacturing service, would make it difficult to avoid extending it to the other non-manufacturing services, including professional services.  Besides being costly and difficult to justify on general grounds, it is fair to say from the discussions we have had and from what we know of the attitude of the EEC Commission that it would give rise to immediate objections from the Commission on the grounds that it would dilute the character of the new relief which was presented as being confined to manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publishing of books and greeting cards not printed by the publishers was included in the export sales relief scheme to enable that relief to be claimed in respect of the export of greeting cards and books.  This was because the printing company, the actual manufacturer, could not claim that relief because their product was not exported by them but by the publisher.  That is the reason it was included in the export sales relief scheme.  Under the new scheme the export of goods will no longer be a condition for relief.  Accordingly, the printing of greeting cards and books will qualify as a manufacturing activity but I do not think there could be any justification for treating publishing as manufacturing for the purpose of the relief.  The new relief is confined to manufacturing and to extend <Col N="418" /> it to a non-manufacturing service industry such as publishing would cause difficulties in justifying the scheme as a whole to the EEC.  In addition, it would give rise to demands that could not be resisted logically for the extension of the new scheme to service industries generally.  For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment in the form set out. Nonetheless, we are agreed on extension to other major areas.  I hope I have explained satisfactorily the reasons I am not in a position to extend this provision to publishing.</P>

      <P>Although I do not fully accept the Minister's contention that there is a danger this provision could be shot down by the Commission of the EEC if it were extended as I suggested in my amendment, I am not willing to run the risk of damaging the chances of including the categories next year.  I do not agree with the Minister when he said we could not extend this to the service industries. There is a very good case to be made for the services industries getting the benefit of this new corporation tax. Some of them already get the benefit of the export tax relief.</P>

      <P>This section excludes from the benefit of the corporation tax sales into intervention. The Minister made the point that sales into intervention do not qualify under the existing rules because they are not sales for export.

There were good fiscal and policy <Col N="419" /> reasons for this and they still hold good. The main reason for the exclusion of the intervention sales from the new relief is that the long-term interests of agriculture would not be served if a tax relief were to encourage sales of processed products into intervention.

      <P>The resort to intervention tends to discourage independent commercial marketing by removing an incentive to develop and maintain permanent export markets on which the long-term prosperity of our agricultural exports depends.  It makes diversification into non-intervention products rather unattractive.  Official policy over the years has been to encourage the sale of agricultural produce on the open market and to discourage the resort into intervention. Intervention gives rise also to a significant cost to the Exchequer in interest, transport and storage charges that are not recouped from the EEC Commission.  The estimated net cost to the Exchequer in 1980 is £6.7 million. These are all cogent reasons why the distinction has been maintained in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intervention is primarily designed to protect producers from the effect of over-supplies of certain goods and it would be less than justifiable to grant a tax incentive which would indirectly stimulate further increases in oversupply. I act here as an agent of overall Government policy which must be seen to be consistent in every direction.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, at the end of last month appealed to the beef industry to improve their marketing of beef and to be less reliant on permanent intervention.  The Minister is also proposing to take definite steps to ensure that the marketing arrangements generally in agriculture will be enhanced and developed.  The Minister for Agriculture is particularly conscious of the need to have a more sophisticated marketing programme for agriculture.  I am confident that the direction in which the Minister is moving will be in the interests of the agricultural industry generally.  The Minister's appeal followed the announcement from the EEC Commission of a study of changes in the beef support system and the decision of <Col N="421" /> the Council of Ministers not to proceed with the threatened suspension of beef intervention during the summer.  The Minister for Agriculture succeeded in having that suspension lifted.  The Minister argued persuasively with his colleagues in the Council of Ministers of Agriculture that that would have a very damaging effect on Irish agriculture.  The force of the Minister's argument would be very much undermined if we were to extend this provision to sales into intervention when it is evident that we are trying to encourage the opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No side of the House would encourage sales into intervention. That is not what we are talking about here.  We are talking about the manufacturing of goods.  It is quite clear under existing regulations that goods sold into intervention are not exported and would not qualify for freedom from tax on profits.  We are talking about people manufacturing goods which are put into intervention.  If a company manufactures cheese it could end up in intervention even though that would not be the desire of the manufacturer who might have wished to sell it on the open market.  If it ends up in intervention it is because the manufacturer has been unable to sell it, in theory at least, on the open market. Therefore the manufacturer should be allowed to benefit from the new rate of 10 per cent tax.</P>

In other words, a company must be manufac turing on 1 January next year if they are to enjoy completely tax-free profits on exports except where a company indicates to the Minister for Finance that, even though they are not in production now, at some future time during 1981 they will be.

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will be around after some of us have left as well.  In practice, the assurances in question will be given by the IDA as the sole authorised agent of the Minister for Finance.  As regards the political figures and the role we play, these assurances impose a contractual obligation on the Government which would mature if circumstances arose, such as action at European level, which would preclude the giving of export sales relief.  It is appropriate that any action imposing on the Government a conractual obligation which might involve direct financial commitment should be taken by the Minister for Finance as <Col N="423" /> principal with the IDA acting solely as agents.  So much for the IDA.  I hope Deputy Barry will see my point.</P>
      <P>While I or other Ministers for Finance may not have the survival rate of the IDA one thing hopefully will be so, and that is, that the Minister for Finance as such will be there as long as the others. Significantly he is the only member of the Government, apart from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, who is mentioned in the Constitution.  Unless there is a change in the Constitution there will be a Minister for Finance who will have to act on these contractual obligations, which is what I am proposing in this case.</P>
      <P>The amendment also touches on the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners are concerned with the care and management of the taxes and duties entrusted to them.  It would be inappropriate that they should be concerned with the giving of guarantees in relation to the continuance of a particular tax regime or whatever other remedy in contract a person who had received a Government guarantee might have in the event that the guarantee had to be implemented because circumstances arose which precluded the giving of export sales relief to that person.  I know what Deputy Barry intended and I am sure he knows that it is not a question of rejecting his amendment but rather of explaining why I cannot accept it.  We are both aiming at the same thing and want to ensure that the contract commitment will be honoured by the person with prime responsibility to honour it, and that is the Minister for Finance at the time and not the IDA or the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to restore stock relief to the level of 100 per cent that operated up to last year.  It was an <i>ad hoc</i> measure introduced on a temporary basis in 1975 because of the high rate of inflation at that time and the damage being done to industry by their having to pay tax on profits which were not real profits but which had only come about by the inflation of their stocks and so on.  It operated every year at 100 per cent until the Finance Act last year brought it down to 75 per cent because, as the Minister for Finance at the time said, inflation was falling and the same necessity was not there for it.  Since then inflation has risen at an extremely fast rate.  If the rumours about the figures to be published at the end of this week are correct, it appears that the inflation rate for the 12 months ending mid-May will be over 20 per cent.  If this is so, and there was justification in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978 to give 100 per cent stock relief because of an inflation rate whch was lower than it is at present, in justice the Minister should restore the 100 per cent rate that his predecessor cut back last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we consider this issue it is important to bear in mind the whole structure of tax concessions that industry enjoys at present.  Apart from enumerating them I shall state the consequences of them and indicate how narrow the base of taxation is here and the contribution industry is making, taking account of the 10 per cent I have made provision for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is relief under the export sales relief and Shannon relief.  There are capital allowances for plant, machinery and buildings and, as Deputy Barry knows, there is a generous 25 per cent corporation tax rate for manufacturing firms that meet certain employment criteria.  If we put these reliefs together and stock relief on the basis which it is at present, they represent a concession to industry of the order of £150 million <Col N="425" /> which is a sizeable sum.  The introduction next year of the 10 per cent corporation tax rate for manufacturing companies will represent a further concession estimated to be of the order of £15 million.  I am sure this is one of the areas that the commission on taxation will look at because I referred to the narrow base of taxation and mentioned in my budget statement that they might be concerned to look at the rate of corporation profits tax generally.  I understand they are doing that.</P>
    <P>The total intake last year in corporation tax was £130 million of which manufacturing industry contributed about £17 million.  That cannot be said to be a burden when one looks at the whole range.  In the current year the total intake from corporation tax will be of the order of £150 million and manufacturing industry will account for about £22 million or about 15 per cent of the total corporation tax.  It is fair to say that the overall picture is most favourable for manufacturing industry.  That is not to say for one moment that manufacturing industry here as elsewhere is not going through a difficult period.  That is a reality that the western world is facing. What I am saying is that the tax climate here for manufacturing industry is recognised throughout the world as being very favourable, to the extent that the IDA advertise it widely in well-known international magazines as being a tax haven for industry.  The tax climate is very attractive and the contribution made through direct taxation is modest. The concessions are very attractive. Against this background, despite the various difficulties which I recognise face industry and every sector of the economy, an improvement would not be warranted.  We are always being asked why we do not treat farmers the same as everybody else and everybody else the same as farmers, as if we were all the same which, of course, we are not.  We are different in many ways.  I did lift this in respect of farmers but there was a special reason for that, as Deputies opposite who supported this at the time are aware.  The purpose of doing that was to create an incentive in that area to increase <Col N="426" /> the national herd.  Obviously, the same does not arise in industry.  There is not the same question of the incentive there.  When this stock relief was introduced the annual increase in the consumer price index was 23.81 per cent.  I will restrain myself and not make reference to when or how that occurred.</P>

      <P>That is not the relevant comparison at this stage.  I do not have the figures the Deputy referred to. We are almost 8½ per cent behind the situation that existed when this relief was introduced.  Having regard to the reasons I have given it would not be reasonable to make a further concession which would mean a further reduction on the relatively small direct tax contribution paid by manufacturing industry. Frankly, I would not be justified in accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>The incentives available to industry all existed last year and the Minister has added to them the new 10 per cent rate of tax but that will not be available to any company until next year because it will not operate until 1 January 1981.  The problem is that this year we will have the highest inflation rate in Europe because of the behaviour of the Government.  We also have very tight credit restrictions which affect many business concerns.  Because of the credit restrictions there will be a 14 per cent increase in the growth of credit this year and the fact that inflation is likely to be 20 per cent effectively means a cutback in the amount of credit that will be available.  Profits made by industries will <Col N="427" /> be paper profits because of the high rate of inflation.  The Minister should make a gesture to industry by increasing the stock relief from its existing 75 per cent&mdash;that has only been in operation for one year in exceptional circumstances&mdash;to 100 per cent.</P>

      <P>In page 62, to delete lines 29 to 53 and in page 63, to delete lines 1 to 50.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove the duty imposed on table waters in the budget.  That duty expires after four months and if my amendment is accepted it will not be continued after 27 June.  The Minister told us yesterday that he was not a killjoy&mdash;and I accept that because I know him personally&mdash; but people looking at what he has done in the budget to the price of an ordinary bottle of lemonade must feel that that description fits him.  As a result of the budget provisions a pint of lemonade is dearer than a pint of stout or beer&mdash;an extraordinary situation.  I do not know of any other place in the world where a child's bottle of lemonade is dearer than a father's bottle of stout.  That shows a tremendous lack of sensitivity on the part of the Minister.  The Department of Health are engaged in an extensive advertising campaign asking people to be careful about the amount of alcohol they consume and drawing attention to the association between drinking and driving, but the Minister for Finance is not helping people to give up drink when he puts the price of mineral waters to such a high level.  The price of a pint of lemonade is almost £1 and that is not the act of a Minister who is interested in children or in home industry.  This is probably one of the few industries that is 100 per cent Irish.  Almost 100 per cent of the minerals consumed here are manufactured here.  Why has the Minister chosen that industry to impose this increase?  One hesitates to use the words &ldquo;savage&rdquo; and &ldquo;penal&rdquo; to describe that increase but in this case they are justified.  The Minister should withdraw that duty before he does damage to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1956, when the flat rate duty of 5p per gallon excise duty was introduced, there have been <Col N="429" /> two increases in the duty on table waters.  The first was in 1966, ten years later, when the rate was increased to 7.43p and in 1975 there was a further increase of 10p.  In 1960 a scheme was introduced whereby manufacturers of table waters received a rebate of duty graded according to production levels. Obviously, this is of particular benefit to the smaller producers Deputy Barry has referred to.  The rates of rebate have remained at that level until the present. There are approximately 41 home manufacturers of table waters of whom 12 produce less than 100,000 gallons of table waters annually,</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of introducing this duty, as in the case of many others, was frankly, of fiscal necessity.  The Government had to raise additional revenue from taxation and they had many difficult choices to make in doing so.  Obviously, the budget strategy had to take into account the diverse demands of different sectors in striking a balance between expenditure and revenue and, in the end, the emphasis was placed on indirect taxation of discretionary expenditure in order to minimise the impact on the necessities of life.  I think that the indirect tax package generally was considered to be the most equitable and preferable to the alternative forms of taxation or not proceeding with the allowances on direct taxation particularly in the income splitting area.  One has to look at this or any other duty in the context of the extra spending power afforded through the very substantial income tax reliefs which are of particular benefit to families.  In addition it is probably fair to say that table waters are subject to a lower VAT rate not withstanding that they are a highly discretionary item of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the industry generally and the employment given by it and for that reason I have been examining what I can do to go some way towards meeting representations made. We decided to extend the deferment period for payment of duty by 15 days, to the end of the month following that in which the duty is charged.  If any other <Col N="430" /> relief were to be given over and above that significant relief it would open the doors for all other sectors to expect similar treatment as a result of other budget increases.  If one were to do that the revenue loss would have to be made good by other sectors of the community and in present circumstances that would not be feasible.  Also, it could possibly curtail fiscal policy in the future.</P>
    <P>This is the general background. Deputy Barry was saying that this must be the only country where the child's lemonade is dearer than the husband's beer, as if we were the only one with duties on table waters of this kind.  This kind of duty is also charged in Belgium, Germany, Denmark, France and the Netherlands and in all but one of those cases table waters attract a higher rate of VAT than in Ireland.  They also impose an excise duty on sugar, which in some cases is not rebated when used in the manufacture of dutiable table waters.  In France, Belgium and the Netherlands I think there is no rebate on sugar when used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to acknowledge that in this particular year this might be seen to be a very significant increase&mdash;and it is&mdash;but, when you take account of the fact that this area has not been touched for several years and what applies elsewhere, it is not very significant and the commodity is discretionary.  Incidentally, by comparison with the pint of beer, I am advised that the litre of lemonade in consequence of this provision costs 41.2p while the pint of beer, 20 ounces, is 58p.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that he would accede to representations so that payment of the duty could be deferred by 15 days.  This is of no benefit to the person buying a bottle of lemonade.  It is of benefit to the manufacturers because net amount of extra capital that was required to finance the execution of this provision was quite considerable.  I think the Minister was right in making this concession but it is not of any benefit to the consumer.  He will still have to pay the Minister's duty and all profits will be paid on the Minister's duty right up to the point of sale.  The most demanding thing the Minister said against himself was that the real reason for this measure, which we all know, is that he had no money.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 63, to delete lines 51 and 52, in page 64, to delete lines 1 to 55, and in page 65, to delete lines 1 to 42.</P>
      <P>This is what is called &ldquo;duty on other oils&rdquo;.  This is the duty that is doing most damage to the economy.  On a number of occasions since it was introduced I have pointed out to the Minister the amount of damage caused to the industry by it. When one talks of industry in that way people are inclined to think of fat cats driving around in cars, with cigars, but I mean the actual companies employing people.</P>
      <P>We are talking about jobs for actual people, the number of people who will be employed and whether any item in the Finance Bill will be an encouragement to industry to expand and take on people or whether it will be a discouragement and whether because of items in the Finance Bill they will have to lay off people.  That, I believe, will be the effect of this Bill going through without my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few figures will indicate what I mean.  I have already pointed this out to the Minister.  About one month ago the chairman of one of the top companies in the country, when introducing his company's <Col N="433" /> annual report, said that as a result of this provision, which takes up about four lines in the Bill, the amount of money which one of the subsidiary companies of this group would have to give to the Government would be equal to their total wage bill for 1980.  The implications of that are that the manager of one of those companies could double the number of people he has employed if he did not have to pay this money.  I realise that is not what will happen but it will certainly make it more difficult for that company to employ more people.</P>
    <P>This money will be collected from industry but in actual fact it will be a charge on every manufacturer, retailer, distributor and householder in the country. Every person will have to contribute his or her share of this money.  The amount of money which the Minister will collect from the ESB alone in relation to this measure is over £11 million in a full year.  That will be reflected in higher charges for electricity.  There is a double charge on some industries.  If they use hydrocarbon oils in their manufacturing process or for heating and they also use the ESB they will have to pay a double charge.  That will certainly be reflected in the cost of their goods.</P>
    <P>We frequently speak here about the necessity to export and there is an exhortation at least once a week in the papers from some Minister that we either export or die, that we cannot absorb the amount of goods we are capable of producing.  We must export if we are to reverse the unhealthy trend in our balance of payments for the last few years.  We must create jobs here and the only market we can find for the goods produced by those people is outside the country.  If we are to break into new markets we have to do so with goods which are attractive and competitive not just in relation to the goods manufactured in the country we export to but with the goods of other countries anxious to export to this country also. We are in competition with the whole world and it is an extremely competitive world as far as manufactured goods are <Col N="434" /> concerned.  Our goods must be attractive in price and quality or we will not sell.</P>
    <P>Some of the costs of industry are outside the control of industrialists and the implication of those four lines is one instance of that.  The Minister may argue that the amount this will add to any single item in the market place is relatively small.  That is probably correct but every single industry is under pressure at the moment because of costs. This tax will have to be paid by very small industrialists as well as by extremely large ones.  Very small industries have a number of other pressures on them.  They are finding it almost impossible to survive because of the pressures on them.  I referred to one pressure already on another amendment, the pressure they are experiencing in relation to credit.  The credit growth this year will be allowed to be only 14 per cent and with inflation running at possibly over 20 per cent this is obviously a cut back in credit.  At the same time, because inflation is running so high, the cost to small industries of raw materials is greater no matter where they buy them from.  If they have to import their raw materials from Britain, because of the differential between the punt and sterling, this means an extra cost.  Many small businesses now feel they would be better off to sell up and invest somewhere else.  The Minister is now putting a further charge on those industrialists which is further damaging our competitive position.</P>
    <P>The first thought in the Government's mind should be how they can maintain and increase employment.  Everything should be looked at in the light of what it does to improve or damage our employment prospects.  I would have thought, when the Minister considers the figures produced this week showing the increase in unemployment last month, that he would have recognised that industry needs every encouragement it can get to hold people in employment and he would have then indicated his acceptance of my amendment.  I am not the only person concerned about this matter and it is not only in this House the Minister has heard about the effect of this tax on <Col N="435" /> hydrocarbon oils.  I am sure he has had representations from the different associations of business interests, the Confederation of Irish Industry and many other associations as well.  He must also have had representations from individuals who are very hard pressed at the moment and who possibly felt they should go to him to tell him the damage that will be done to industry if this charge is put on.</P>
    <P>The Minister will get £11 million from the ESB from this tax.  He indicated in relation to a previous amendment how necessary it is that the Government should give rewards in this regard.  We have had a lot of amendments to this Finance Bill, many of which we put down in order to change particular sections. I do not expect Deputy Bruton to agree with me but I would be prepared to scrap all my other amendments and accept the Minister's point of view in relation to them if he would accept my point of view in relation to this amendment. This is the most damaging part of this Finance Bill.  It will have immediate short-term effects on industry from which many small industries will never recover. From the point of view of competitiveness in the future and of the confidence of business and employment prospects the long-term effects of this tax on hydrocarbon oils will be extremely damaging.</P>

I have said all I want to say about it.  I feel very strongly about this extreme position in industry and I have quoted already the chairman of the company who said that the cost of this tax alone would be equal to the total wage bill for 1980.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. The Minister and others may have <Col N="436" /> heard a radio programme last Sunday on which people from different parts of the country were being interviewed about the fall off in jobs in industry in the various regions and the pattern was almost uniformly bleak.  Following this assessment, the spokesman for the Confederation of Irish Industry was asked to identify the reasons for the situation and he identified three reasons. One was the high rate of inflation here, one the problem in determining wage levels <i>vis-à-vis</i> wages levels elsewhere and the third reason, the major reason given by the spokesman for the Confederation of Irish Industry for the fall-off in competitiveness and the gloomy prospects generally for the creation of jobs in industry, was this proposal that Deputy Barry is seeking to annul, to increase substantially the tax on fuel oils imposed on industry.  That is an independent assessment by spokesmen of industry themselves as to the seriousness of this proposal.  They are not a body who are given to exaggeration. The Minister should pay attention to what has been said by them and by Deputy Barry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry and Deputy Bruton have referred to the climate generally for industry here and the picture generally in employment.  That is something of which I am conscious, but it is important in the first instance that one would see this in its proper context.  I may be in a special position in that last week I attended a meeting of the Finance Ministers at the ECOFIN Council.  One thing that has been absent from any comments that have been made by Deputy Barry and Deputy Bruton&mdash;they spoke briefly in any event&mdash;was any reference to the overall climate which exists right throughout the western world at this time.  Even as we are talking, the likelihood of further increases from OPEC decisions in relation to oil prices is very real and these will have a major impact on all western economies and, in real terms, they are higher than anything we have experienced before this.  Yet one can say <Col N="437" /> that in terms of the basis of 1973 the proportion then was higher but the actual increases that we have experienced over the last 12 months and are facing still are inordinately high and are having very serious and damaging effects on employment generally in all of the Community countries and in the western world.  The level of unemployment is unprecedentedly high for each of our partners in the EEC.  That is the first thing that has to be recognised as demonstrating, the effect of the increase in oil prices and the OPEC surpluses that are building up.  It is quite significant that, this very afternoon, the European Council will be devoting their attention particularly to the major issue of recycling the surpluses generated in the OPEC countries, to the considerable detriment of all the consumer nations. That is particularly true in our case, because of our level of dependency on imported oil, which is so high at 80 per cent, and also our level of dependency on exports which is higher than in any other country in the EEC.  On the one hand it is a good thing that we are exporting to that extent&mdash;50 per cent of the total of our GNP depends on exports&mdash;which is considerably higher than that of any of our partners.</P>
      <P>When the international economy is in recession, as it is at the moment, the impact on exporting countries such as ours&mdash;we are an open economy at both ends; we have to import raw materials and export the products of our industry&mdash;is particularly severe.  It is well that this should be stated as an unwelcome fact.  There is no short-term solution for any Government, particularly for a Government in a small economy such as ours.  There are measures that can be taken to ensure maximum productivity from industry.  As I mentioned this morning, in terms of tax relief for industry, last year the manufacturing industry contributed £17 million of the total of £130 million in corporation tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not something to complain about.  It is a measure of the Government's commitment to the importance of <Col N="438" /> this area.  It cannot be presented as a measure of our blindness to the problems that exist for them or for any other element in our economy.  I want to stress that particularly.  At a time when we are under severe constraints, because of our balance of payments, we are still maintaining reliefs.  Next year we will be introducing additional relief on the 10 per cent which will be a further concession&mdash;£15 million is the estimate for next year.</P>
    <P>There is no point in picking out one aspect of a total package and saying it is a crushing burden when the whole picture is one of Government commitment to and concern for continuing employment through our industrial programmes. That has to be stated as a fact. The 10 per cent relief will be particularly important in that it is not now being confined to exports but to manufacturing industry, irrespective of whether or not it is exporting.  That means that small industries who would not have been exporting to a considerable extent will now, for the first time, benefit from this major relief under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>This amendment cannot be taken in isolation.  It is not possible to say: &ldquo;You have gone further than anybody else in every other direction, but we want you to go further than anybody else in this direction too.&rdquo;  There is a limit to what one can be asked to do.  To achieve all this, you must raise revenue elsewhere, you must borrow it and put a further burden on taxation, thereby upsetting the whole balance of the economic management programme.  One is not prepared to do that at a difficult time in the economy.</P>
    <P>The projected levels of employment in the EEC at the moment are higher than those projected for a considerable length of time.  These are the realities I heard from my colleagues in the European Community when I attended a meeting last week.  We have to do all we can to come through successfully, as we can and must and will do.  We cannot do it by asking the taxpayers generally, in a difficult time, to pay more and more to give reliefs in areas where certain new <Col N="439" /> duties are being applied.  It is important that we should see that.</P>
    <P>There are ways in which we can take action.  One of these ways in which all of us as a community can take action is to support the products of our own industries. I regret that that message has not yet got across to so many of our people who seem to be under the impression that it does not matter in terms of their welfare, never mind the national welfare, how our balance of payments is affected.  I regret particularly that some of the major distributing outlets in Dublin do not seem to be aware of this or concerned about it.  Their customers in the higher bracket do not seem to be aware of it either.</P>
    <P>There are actions we can all take to get over this problem, action which have been taken by other countries with a sense of commitment and a sense of what one might call bluntly patriotism. One of the most prosperous economies where they have been able to overcome the impact of their dependence on imported energy is Japan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to industry.  Other elements have to be mentioned.  Even the level of social security contribution made by employers here is less than it is in any of the other countries we are talking about. In almost every area of tax concessions, for a small economy we are making every effort to demonstrate how important we recognise the industrial arm to be.  At a time of extreme problems for our balance of payments, due to increased oil consumption, when one introduces a duty of this nature, perhaps understandably, the Opposition will focus on that in isolation and say that this is a crippling burden and that this is the thing that can drive people to the wall.  I am not saying that it does not add to the costs but the impact of this in terms of the increased cost for manufacturing industry generally is less than 1 per cent.  But even at less than 1 per cent one cannot look at it in isolation.  If one does that one is not facing the problem as any responsible Government should do in drawing up their budget programme. If one ignores all the other concessions, aids and reliefs and focuses and this one, one is ignoring the realities. This tax is the only one of the indirect taxes in the recent budget which is not discretionary.  All of the others related to discretionary spending.  This tax represents <Col N="441" /> an essential cost increase of less than 1 per cent.  There may be some few who, because of the processes in which they are involved, would have a higher rate of consumption of these oils than others.  But we are talking about the whole range of all of them.  The Government are determined to get across to industry and the workers in industry these general facts of life.</P>
      <P>Our competitiveness can be maintained only if the level of income is kept somewhere in line with what is applied in the countries to which we export. Those who insist on ignoring the realities and say that because they got a certain percentage last year they are therefore entitled to receive at least that much this year will block employment opportunities for the young people, and 50 per cent of our population are under 25 years of age.  The next highest percentage in Europe is about 38 per cent under 25.  The average in Europe for the demographic breakdown is about 37 per cent under 25.  We are in a situation where 50 per cent of our population are under 25 and we must find jobs for them.  It is a real problem and we are going to be constrained in finding jobs for those people if those currently in employment ignore the impact of their actions on those who are coming into employment.</P>
      <P>These are some of the realities one has to look at when one gets a proposal of this nature and is asked to respond to it in isolation as if this were the only element in our attitude towards industry generally.  I am conscious of the fact that industry would prefer if that did not arise.  But if one looks at the whole favourable package&mdash;and the IDA advertise widely throughout the world because it is so favourable to industry&mdash;surely it is not reasonable to take one element and concentrate on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of conservation. This is not entirely a matter of discretion for industry but there are measures that can be taken even in industry. <Col N="442" /> These must be looked at and this is something which the Tánaiste is particularly involved in at present.  This problem is not going to be solved overnight. People at every level have a role to play, the employers and employees, particularly the consumer and, of course, the Government.  I want to assure the House that while I cannot accept the amendment because there is a revenue implication involved here too, I have gone as far as one can go in relation to the incentives for industry.</P>

      <P>It is a substantial figure; I am not suggesting that it is not. But it is spread fairly widely.  I know that it is not particularly welcome from the point of view of industry.  But it should be put in context; it represents less than 1 per cent of the overall cost.  That is the kind of measure that one can and one must absorb, and other increases will represent much more than that.  Let me say that one of the disturbing features I remember when we were negotiating our entry into the EMS was that one of the reasons why the EMS subsidies were agreed was because it was then perceived that the £ sterling would decline against the EMS currencies and that would leave us at a competitive disadvantage in the British market and that would be particularly difficult for our industry. What has happened is that in the meantime the £ sterling has appreciated considerably against EMS currencies and, within the EMS currency, we are performing particularly well.  But we have no control over what happens to the £ outside of it.  It gives us a competitive advantage in the British market. That is a real advantage.  Surely that is something to be exploited even though, because of the recession which is biting in Britain as well as in other countries <Col N="443" /> and because of the policy being pursued there redundancy rates are increasing very considerably and consumption is being dampened.  But that would not be such as to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the general defence that his refusal to acknowledge the importance of this amendment must be seen in the context of the Government's overall approach to assistance to industry and their concern about employment.  Of course, the amendment takes particular effect when one looks at the number of lay-offs which have occurred in many old established industries in the early months of this year, particularly in the building industry, and there is no sign as yet to suggest that the rest of this year will not be marked by a similar scene in Irish industry. It is in that context that the amendment has great relevance.</P>
      <P>It is in that context that it is necessary that the Government should reconsider their views, their package of measures to assist industry.  I have no doubt that this year, supposedly the year of industrial peace, has become the year of lay-offs, the year of redundancies, the year of close-downs, the year of increasing unemployment. From all we can see for industry at this point, this winter will see an unemployment figure in excess of 100,000.  So it is in that context that one must deplore the failure of the Minister to meet an amendment of this kind with some undertaking of review, because the position is that we do not really know at this point what new policies are under consideration to deal with what is a very serious economic situation for industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one to express concern about a fall in company profits, but I am concerned <Col N="444" /> that the fall in company profits will be followed very quickly by increases in lay-offs.  That is the connection that concerns me.  While we have redundancy payments provisions, those people who find themselves redundant later this year will have great difficulty in finding alternative employment.  The Minister talked in his reply about the overall necessity for making ourselves cost-competitive.  He referred to the kind of competition we are facing and spoke of the need to buy Irish and so on, but he should appreciate that there is growing dismay among the people in that this changed administration are failing in their task of holding back inflation, that they are losing the battle against inflation. It can be predicted at this point that the May-to-May figure for the CPI which will be published next week will show a figure in excess of 20 per cent. This will not help Irish industry in keeping costs down.  Indeed, the general climate in which Irish industry must compete throughout this year and next year is one of increasing inflation.</P>

      <P>The strategy applied in the budget was to increase the indirect taxation area, the general defence for this being that the expenditure in this regard would be discretionary.  However, it is not very discretionary when one has regard to many of the items in respect of which the increased taxation applied. The prospect for the Minister is that very shortly he will be faced at the negotiating table by people whose agreement is essential and for moderate settlements if incomes are to be a component in holding down inflation.  The Minister will be meeting people who will be pointing out that the strategy of his budget was wrong if the Government were intent on keeping down inflation.  If the practice of Government consisted of a series of <i>Panorama</i> programmes, this would be the best Government and the one with the most intelligent Taoiseach that the country has ever known but the <Col N="445" /> practice of Government consisted of more serious matters.</P>

      <P>We are talking about the attitude of this Government to industry.  I would remind both the present holder of the ministry of Finance and the Taoiseach also that they are in office because of their assumed competence to turn the economy around. But they are failing in that task and the consequences of such failure can be very serious.  The Minister has only to look at the planed and whitened political bones of his predecessors in that office to realise how serious are the consequences of failure.</P>

      <P>By way of his general defence in not accepting this amendment, the Minister says that the Government are in favour of industry and wishes to meet squarely the job situation but he would realise that according to the latest figures available we are probably in the worst unemployment <Col N="446" /> situation since 1977.  Before December of this year I predict that the unemployment level will be in excess of 100,000 and that by late winter the figure will be approaching the 112,000 mark.  That is the kind of situation that the Minister for Finance is dealing with and I am saying simply that the basic reason for his holding his present position and the reason for the change in the Cabinet was the assumed competence of the new Ministers to turn the economy around. We have not received any information yet from this Government as to how they propose dealing with the worsening economic situation.  I would remind the Minister that the people are not measuring the competence of the Government in terms of well publicised departures to Venice or by meetings with Mrs. Thatcher.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke a few minutes ago with the zeal of a recent convert to fiscal responsibility.  I find that somewhat difficult to take.  His argument for not accepting the amendment might have some merit if we had an administration that was serious in dealing with the inflationary situation but in this, the second last summer of their existence, the Government are not showing any capacity for dealing with that situation.  It is in that context that it is very difficult to take the Minister's arguments in defence of his not accepting the amendment.  We are not in a situation of normal circumstances. Therefore, the Minister's argument falls. I do not see any reason at this point for altering what was my immediate reaction to the budget and when I predicted <Col N="447" /> that by the coming winter unemployment figures will be in excess of 100,000, that the inflation rate will be more than 20 per cent and that the price of petrol will be £2 per gallon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>I am not pushing the amendment to a vote though I would be anxious that the House would divide on the motion so that we might ascertain who would be prepared to vote for this tax on jobs.  However, in view of the short time left for discussion of the Bill, I have decided not to ask for a vote.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that outside influences are having a damaging effect on our economy.  That is true because outside influences must always be taken into account but what is the Government's response to these outside influences? Is it not true that they have magnified the damage by adding their own slice to the OPEC price increase instead of trying to do something within our own economy to minimise the damage being caused.  It is this adding of further taxes to the price increases being imposed by the oil producing countries that is causing the most damage to our economy.  We are talking now about the most serious element of the budget in terms of inflation and tax.  The tax being imposed as a result of the Minister's refusal to accept the amendment will work its way through the entire economy.  The Minister gave a figure of £46 million.  That is a huge sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  One quarter of that amount is being contributed by the ESB and that is something that affects every individual, every household, every industry and every institution in the community.  It will be added to the inflation figure.  This will further damage our competitiveness abroad, which the Minister says&mdash;and I accept&mdash;he is concerned about.  He proceeds to lecture our workers about how they should be moderate in their demands for wages in this year, otherwise <Col N="448" /> they will damage the prospects of expansion of our exports abroad and reduce our ability to fight against imports.  It is probably right, that immoderate wage demands do affect our competitiveness abroad, but the Minister himself is responsible for further damaging our competitiveness abroad.  The Minister is asking the workers to be moderate in their demands but is giving no good example by putting this imposition on industry. My last point&mdash;and I have insufficient time to develop this&mdash;concerns the Minister's plea to buy Irish.  I fully accept that plea and the plea to support our tourist industry, which is another form of &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;.  Again the damage being done to tourism is being done by the Government.</P>

Our tourist figures will be down precisely because the Government have added tax on all sections, and particularly for the people most remote from the points of entry into this country, Irish tourism is less attractive than it was last year.</P>
      <P>The damage which is being done to this country by the present price of drink, of tobacco, of pertol, and now the proposed increase on oil prices is in part coming from outside, but the Government have exaggerated and increased this damage by their internal actions. That is where the real damage is being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 73, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) Save that there shall be no increase in the rate of Value-Added Tax applied to furniture and furnishings.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with the very dramatic increase in the price of a large number of items being imposed in this budget as a result of the increase in the value-added tax rate from 20 to 25 per cent on approximately 70 items, all of them alleged by the Government, presumably, to be luxuries which can afford to be taxed at this very high rate. The amendments which we are proposing here are designed to remove ten of these items from the list covered by the increased value-added tax.  Each of these items can be demonstrated in the first place not to be luxuries and in the second place to be important for one reason or another to the improvement of the quality of life in this country.</P>
      <P>The first item concerns furniture and furnishings.  The furniture industry is very important in my constituency of Country Meath.  At the present time furniture manufacturers who employ large numbers of people and are mostly small manufacturers are facing a very depressed market and are running the risk of having to lay off workers because of a declining demand.  It is very unfortunate, therefore, that furniture and all the furnishings that go into a house are to have value-added tax increased from 25 to 25 per cent at a time of depression. In no sense can furniture be described as a luxury.  Everyone now must have a house to live in and, if they have a house, they must have furniture to put in it. There is no justification for increasing the level of value-added tax from 20 to 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, this increased tax will further aggravate the problems which the furniture manufacturers are now facing from imports.  In the case of value-added tax on furniture manufactured here, the tax is collected at the point of <Col N="450" /> production from the Irish manufacturers, whereas in the case of the imported product, value-added tax is not collected until the point of sale.  As very often these goods remain in stock for some time, this deferred payment in the case of imported goods gives imported furniture a competitive advantage over the Irish manufacture.  In increasing the value-added tax rate, this competitive advantage is being accentuated and this is something to which we very much object.</P>
    <P>The next items with which we are concerned are carpets and curtains.  Carpets are also a very important Irish manufacture and the industry is facing considerable difficuilty at the moment in maintaining employment.  Indeed, there are threats to many of the jobs in the carpet industry.  Obviously, demand for carpets on the home market is depressed at present and will be depressed still further by the proposed increased value-added tax to the luxury rate of 25 per cent.  Our proposal seeks to mitigate that situation and to help preserve the jobs in the carpet industry.</P>
    <P>We furthermore suggest that the proposed increase to 25 per cent rate on sports goods should not go ahead.  The Government are spending very substantial sums of money encouraging people to take up sport.  It is very regrettable that, when the people accept the advice of the Government and take up a sport, they find in purchasing equipment&mdash;and for practically every sport some form of equipment is necessary&mdash;that the Government have decided that that equipment should bear the luxury rate of 25 per cent.  If sport is as essential to a healthy life as the Government spokesmen say it is, it is not a luxury and sports equipment should not be taxed at a luxury rate.  This tax increase should not apply to many of the modern sports, where equipment is a quite expensive part of the total enterprise, particularly outdoor sports like canoeing where we are using our natural habitat to engage in sport.</P>
    <P>We are, further, proposing that in the case of radios the increase in value-added <Col N="451" /> tax should not take effect.  Some might say that radios are a luxury, but I do not believe that they are, particularly for old and blind people for whom the radio is the only means of communication with the outside world for large parts of the day.  We are all familiar with the advertisement on the radio put out by the National League for the Blind which says &ldquo;Radio is the eyes of the blind in this Country&rdquo;.  A radio should not be treated as a luxury, particularly for old people.  Perhaps an exception would be made to mitigate the situation as regards old and blind people and I would support that move.</P>
    <P>We are further suggesting that educational supplies, which are also to be treated as luxuries and the value-added tax increased to 25 per cent, should not bear this increase.  Everybody accepts that education is an essential part of life and modern education requires various forms of audio-visual aid to get the message across appropriately to children.  Educational supplies which are essential to that purpose should not be treated as luxury items.</P>
    <P>The Government at the moment are not granting sufficient money to provide people with houses.  Many people who are looking for houses from local authorities have no option but to live in a mobile home for perhaps three, four or five years until such time as the local authority get around to providing them with a house.  In my part of the country there are large numbers of people living in mobile homes and caravans on sites who cannot get a house from the local authority.  For this reason, we deplore the proposal in the budget to increase the value-added tax on mobile homes to 25 per cent.  This will increase by perhaps many hundreds of pounds the amount that young couples will have to pay to get a mobile home, as a direct result of this budget.  We propose that the 25 per cent rate be reduced in this case.</P>
    <P>There are two other items to which I might refer before I conclude.  We propose that the value-added tax rate on bicycles be not increased to 25 per cent, on the grounds that these are not a luxury. <Col N="452" /> Indeed, it is very odd that the Government, who are making a big song and dance about their energy conservation programme, about the increased taxes they are levying on motor cars and on motor vehicle fuels as a means of encouraging people to be more economical in the use of these vehicles and to conserve energy for the country, should in the same budget increase the rate of VAT payable on the only alternative mode of transport, excepting one's two feet, namely, the bicycle.  That seems to me to reveal the inherent anomaly and insincerity of the protestations of energy conservation being the motive behind the increases in tax on motor fuels and motor car sales.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government are giving out free tooth brushes to encourage young people to brush their teeth.  Yet, in the budget they decide that toothpaste is a luxury and that the value-added tax thereon should be increased from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.  Could there be any more apt commentary on the fatuity of the free tooth brush campaign than that the Government should in the very same budget&mdash;which is presumably paying for the free tooth brushes&mdash;increase the price of toothpaste by 5 per cent?  Unless the Minister has medical evidence that toothpaste is not good for one, but brushing one's teeth is, it seems rather odd that toothpaste should be subjected to the luxury rate of value-added tax in this budget.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the arguments for not increasing these items to 25 per cent. I would remind the House that a 25 per cent value-added tax rate is a very high one on any commodity.  It constitutes one-fourth of the entire purchase price of these commodities which is now being taken by the Government.  I believe it is a good deal higher than applies in most other European countries to these items. Therefore I would ask the Minister if he would at least consider accepting some of these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last point first, in relation to this being perhaps the highest rate that applies in any European <Col N="453" /> country, I should say that it is not.  In Belgium the rate is 25 per cent.  The highest rate in France is 33? per cent and the highest rate in Italy 35 per cent. That puts it in context in terms of this being the highest rate applicable here or elsewhere and also, as Deputy Bruton suggests, that it is a luxury rate, on what he presented as luxury items which in reality they are not.  It is important to disabuse the Deputy of the idea that the items chargeable at 20 per cent hitherto and now at 25 per cent are classified as luxury items.  In fact in many cases they are within the standard rate of value-added tax which covers a range of items all of which are not included in the Deputy's amendment.  I shall come to some of them in a moment.  Therefore the Deputy will see that to accept his amendment, and exclude others, if that be his purpose, would leave certain anomalies that, if anything, would be more obvious than what he points out to be anomalies at this point.</P>
      <P>One cannot take this proposal in isolation. In my budget statement I mentioned that I had considered the increase in VAT rates generally and, in so doing, came to the conclusion that an increase at this level would be more appropriate and would have less impact on consumer prices than any other increase.  Just to give an example, if the rate of 10 per cent had been increased to 15 per cent that would have yielded to the revenue approximately £150 million which is very much more than what this particular increase will bring in this year, of the order of £17,500,000.</P>
      <P>It is important to place on record the fact that I approached this on the basis of distinguishing between the various rates of charge, establishing priorities between them and, as far as one can when one is imposing any extra charge, be it an excise duty or a VAT rate, taking into account the increased cost arising therefrom.  This is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the Deputy looks at these in isolation.  He does not pay any attention&mdash;indeed I do not expect that he would or should from his point of view over there-to the other balance involved <Col N="454" /> in the whole of the Finance Bill proposals, particularly those in relation to income tax reliefs which, to a very considerable extent, go further than anything that applies anywhere else <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners.  Nobody wants to remember the effect or significance of those any longer, certainly not in this House.  Neither does anybody want to acknowledge their cost any more.  We just take all of that as being absolutely necessary.  The only reference to it during the course of the debate was the implication that this was forced on me by the Supreme Court even though I said I had made this announcement before the Supreme Court decision and, equally that the cost of the Supreme Court decision would be £30 million and that what we are doing would cost us this year somewhere in the order of £150 million, never mind next year when it will be something in the order of £230 million.  Whether Deputies consider that or not it is not something they are prepared to throw into the reckoning in making proposals of this type.  I still hold the view that if a spokesman on Finance from the other side introduces an amendment he should then, in each case&mdash;taking the accumulation of all of them&mdash;work out what they would cost and tell us from where the money will come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The other important thing to remember is the manner in which VAT is paid.  It is paid on the nineteenth day of the month following the two month leviable period in almost every case.  Therefore there is a seven weeks deferment as far as liability to pay is concerned.  It is important to recognise that it is a broadly based tax&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;at the three rates we have.  But if one were to do what Deputies Barry and Bruton now propose, we would have a fourth rate, a 20 per cent rate, because they are not suggesting that the 25 per cent rate be abolished entirely.  They are saying that there should be exempted from it some of the items they have picked out now, and have a fourth rate of value-added tax at 20 per cent.  Obviously then problems would arise in the administration of the system.  Certainly also it would then be very much out of line with the operation of the value-added tax system general in any other country with one exception, Italy.  With that exception they all operate more or less on the number of rates that we do: In Belgium and in Denmark there is one standard rate which is 20¼ per cent all round.  In France there are three rates.  Germany and Luxembourg have three rates also, as have the Netherlands, one of which is zero.  Therefore were we to introduce a fourth rate here we would add to the administrative difficulties both for those who have to make VAT returns and also for the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments cover a whole range of issues.  In an endeavour to reply to the points made in relation to each of them I should say that, first of all, if one is going to exempt furniture and furnishings and bicycles&mdash;let us take that group&mdash;obviously it would be very difficult, outside of the context of a similar rate for many other goods such as household equipment, household non-durable goods, including soaps and detergents and sports goods, also liable at VAT rate, one would not be in a very strong position to argue with those who manufacture. Deputy Bruton spoke about an industry in his town.  Although I was not thinking particularly of such I can think of one in <Col N="456" /> my own town, one of the long established ones in relation to household goods, when perhaps I would have said, in the interest of industry in Nenagh, I should not have taken this step.  I would find it very difficult to say to an industry like that &ldquo;Well, we are going to exempt furnishing but not the household goods you produce for the kitchen, that the housewife uses every day, and they are included&rdquo;.  Deputies Bruton and Barry do not propose that they should be.  In other words, the effect of meeting Deputy Barry's proposals is that I would be asked to place myself in the position of justifying what is unjustifiable and not extending it to others, or else extending it across the whole range, which is not something I would be prepared to do.  I would not be prepared to contemplate doing that this year.  This is the standard rate, although Deputy Bruton used the word &ldquo;luxury&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-five per cent is a high rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>By comparison there are terrifying rates in other countries.  I do not classify these goods as luxuries. This will mean an increase of about 4.2 per cent on the price of the article and if one takes account of the various concessions in the budget which increase take home pay, the effect of this 4.2 per cent is more than matched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's intention is to reduce the VAT rate on furniture, furnishings and bicycles to 20 per cent.  I will not say more than to emphasise that the effect of putting these articles outside the general VAT structure would be that we would have a fourth rate of VAT which, to say the least of it, would be untidy, would impose additional administrative problems and put us out of line with almost all other countries.  There would have been some sense if Deputies opposite advocated the pegging back of the 25 per cent to 20 per cent all over.  They would not then be distinguishing between teapots, which are liable to 25 per cent, and bicycles which would be liable to 20 per cent if the amendment were accepted. In their judgment a teapot is a luxury <Col N="457" /> but bicycles are not.  The overall rate of 25 per cent is less burdensome from the point of view of consumers and those who operate the tax.</P>
    <P>On the question of mobile homes, I should like to point out that they are liable to the 25 per cent rate, but if a mobile home constitutes the principal residence of a person it is liable to three per cent only, and the difference between 25 per cent and three per cent would be refunded to that person if the mobile home were assessed at a rateable valuation. That should be some consolation to Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions the Minister challenged us to say where the money would come from to pay for this reduction.  One of the amendments seeks to remove sports goods, including hurleys, from the VAT net.  As the Minister knows, there are about 300 clubs in the country and their members have to pay £5 each for hurleys.  It is obvious the Minister is contributing a fair share of their cost because a contribution of £100,000 has been given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is more modest.  I do not believe the Minister should have increased VAT on a great many items which the Minister said he did not regard as luxuries.  Many of them are essentials.  The problem is in regard to the furniture industry that Irish <Col N="458" /> manufacturers will be at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> foreign competitors because of this higher VAT rate.  As well, foreign goods attract VAT at point of sale whereas Irish furniture and furnishings attract VAT at point of manufacture. That puts our manufacturers at a big disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that there is a seven-week deferment of payment in this respect and that that should put Irish furniture manufacturers on a par with foreign manufacturers.  That seven weeks deferment would be valuable in the case of goods which would have a quick turnover, but furniture could remain for quite some time as unsold stock because it is a very expensive item and therefore seven weeks is insufficient. In order to reduce the competitive disadvantage suffered by Irish domestic manufacturers <i>vis-à-vis</i> foreign competitors I ask the Minister to give a longer deferment period or to give some other measure of relief.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 73, between lines 45 and 46 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>Section 16 (market value of certain shares in private trading companies) is hereby amended as if, the market value of each share in a private trading company, on or after the 1st day of April, 1980, is 50 per cent of its market value, or £150,000, whichever is the lesser.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 83 of the Bill, as amended in Committee, provides that the relevant section of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act shall, as respects a gift or inheritance after 1 April this year have effect as if £150,000 were substituted for £100,000.  The amendment proposes that in the case of certain shares in private trading companies each share should be regarded as 50 per cent of its market <Col N="459" /> value for the purposes of this section.  I am proposing that the same relief should apply to shares in private companies.  It will be appreciated that the same difficulties could arise in attempts to hand down a business from one generation to another, as exists in farming.  The purpose of this amendment is to amend the capital acquisitions tax legislation through this subsection in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry clearly indicated what his amendment represents, that is, that the same relief be granted in respect of shares in private trading companies as applies to agriculture.  I am not trying to be cynical but Deputy Barry has been consistent in that whenever I make a concession he asks for it to be extended to another area.  I cannot do that.  When I make a concession in recognition of the circumstances that apply in agriculture he asks me to extend that concession.  Here again I must come back to the point which all Deputies are concerned about. From time to time I have heard them talk about the inequity of the application of tax.  We make the case for each group when we are dealing with them but we forget what the impact of the relief would be on the total package.</P>
      <P>Capital taxation yields considerably less than might be expected.  The argument has been raised by those concerned about the narrow base of taxation, because the level of capital taxation is already unduly low.  I do not know Deputy O'Leary's view on this because I have only heard his views about four times during this debate.  Significantly when he does not wish to express a view he remains silent but whether that is in favour of Deputy Barry or in my favour I am not sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural relief was provided in recognition of the special problems affecting that industry, especially the fact that the value of land is quite often determined by factors other than the return that might be expected from it. Therefore, we have encouraged a degree of reason in an approach to coping with the problem of inflated prices of land. <Col N="460" /> Because I acknowledged that the market value of land was higher than the use value of land, it was necessary to introduce very considerable concessions but that argument cannot be used to justify an extension to other areas.  The same problems do not arise in other areas.</P>
    <P>Agricultural relief is restricted to Irish land and Irish farmers.  This amendment&mdash;and this may not be the Deputy's intention&mdash;is unrestricted and would make relief available to foreign shareholders, foreign companies and foreign beneficiaries.  For those reasons I hope I have convinced Deputy Barry that what I have done in one direction I do not feel justified in doing in another area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously there is a difference between a Minister putting down an amendment to a Finance Bill and an Opposition spokesman, because I do not have the same research facilities nor can I see all the consequences of my amendment, but the spirit behind this amendment is quite clear.  Many small Irishowned family businesses get into trouble when they pass from one generation to the next because of the capital acquisitions tax.  I was trying to rectify that position by putting them on the same level as farming.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Reliefs in Respect of Tax charged on Payments on Retirement, etc.</i>
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">Preliminary</P>
    <P>1.  Relief shall be allowed in accordance with the following provisions of this Schedule in respect of tax chargeable by virtue of section 114, where a claim is duly made in accordance with section 115.</P>
    <P>2.  A claimant shall not be entitled to relief under this Schedule in respect of any income the tax on which he is entitled to charge against any other person, or to deduct, retain, or satisfy out of any payment which he is liable to make to any other person.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Relief by reduction of sums chargeable</i>
    </P>
    <P>3.  In computing the charge to tax in respect of a payment chargeable to tax under section 114, there shall be deducted from the payment a sum equal to the amount (if any) by which the standard capital superannuation benefit for the office or employment in respect of which the payment is made exceeds £6,000.</P>
    <P>4.  In this Schedule &ldquo;the standard capital superannuation benefit&rdquo;, in relation to an office or employment, means a sum arrived at as follows, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) there shall be ascertained the average for one year of the holder's emoluments of the office or employment for the last three years of his service before the relevant date (or for the whole period of his service if less than three years);</P>
    <P>(b) one-twentieth of the amount ascertained at (a) shall be multiplied by the whole number of complete years of the service of the holder in the office or employment; and</P>
    <P>(c) there shall be deducted from the product at (b) a sum equal to <Col N="462" /> the amount, or, as the case may be, to the value at the relevant date, of any lump sum (not chargeable to tax) received or receivable by the holder in respect of the office or employment in pursuance of any such scheme or fund as is referred to in section 115 (1) (d).</P>
    <P>5.  Where tax is chargeable under section 114 in respect of two or more payments to which paragraph 3 applies, being payments made to or in respect of the same person in respect of the same office or employment or in respect of different offices or employments held under the same employer or under associated employers, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) paragraph 3 shall apply as if those payments were a single payment of an amount equal to their aggregate amount and, where they are made in respect of different offices or employments, as if the standard capital superannuation benefit were an amount equal to the sum of the standard capital superannuation benefits for those offices or employments;</P>
    <P>(b) where the payments are treated as income of different years of assessment, the relief to be granted under that paragraph in respect of a payment chargeable for any year of assessment shall be the amount by which the relief computed in accordance with the foregoing provision in respect of that payment and any payments chargeable for previous years of assessment exceeds the relief in respect of the last-mentioned payments;</P>
    <P>and where the standard capital superannuation benefit for an office or employment in respect of which two or more of the payments are made is not the same in relation to each of those payments, it shall be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as equal to the higher or highest of those benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> 6.  (a)  In computing the charge to tax in respect of a payment chargeable to tax under section 114 in the case of a claimant, if the claimant has not previously made a claim under section 115 and the relevant capital sum (if any), in relation to the office or employment in respect of which the payment is made, received or receivable by him did not exceed £4,000, section 115 (3) and paragraph (3) shall apply to that payment as if each reference to £6,000 were a reference to £6,000 increased by the amount by which £4,000 exceeds that relevant capital sum.</P>
    <P>(b)  In this paragraph `the relevant capital sum in relation to an office or employment' means the amount or value at the relevant date of any lump sum (not chargeable to tax), or, if there is more than one such lump sum, the aggregate of such amounts or values, received or receivable by the claimant in pursuance of any such scheme or fund as is referred to in section 115 (1) (d) in respect of the office or employment.</P>
    <P>7.  In computing the charge to tax in respect of a payment chargeable to tax under section 114, being a payment made in respect of an office or employment in which the service of the holder includes foreign service there shall be deducted from the payment (in addition to any deduction allowed under the foregoing provisions of this Schedule) a sum which bears to the amount which would be chargeable to tax apart from this paragraph the same proportion as the length of the foreign service bears to the length of the service before the relevant date.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Relief by reduction of tax.</i>
    </P>
    <P>8.  In the case of any payment in respect of which tax is chargeable under section 114, relief shall be allowed by way of deduction from the tax chargeable by virtue of that section of an amount equal to the <Col N="464" /> amount determined by the formula&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">A &mdash; (P× T/I)</P>
    <P>where&mdash;</P>
    <P>A is the amount of tax which would be chargeable apart from this paragraph in respect of the total income of the holder or past holder of the office or employment for the year of assessment of which the payment is treated as income after deducting from that amount of tax the amount of tax which would be so chargeable if the payment had not been made;</P>
    <P>P is the amount of the said payment after deducting any relief applicable thereto under the foregoing provisions of this Schedule;</P>
    <P>T is the aggregate of the amounts of tax chargeable in respect of the total income of the holder or past holder of the office or employment for the five years of assessment immediately preceding the year of assessment of which the payment is treated as income before taking account of any relief provided by section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967;</P>
    <P>I is the aggregate of the taxable incomes of the holder or past holder of the office or employment for the said five years of assessment.</P>
    <P>9.  Where tax is chargeable under section 114 in respect of two or more payments to or in respect of the same person in respect of the same office or employment and is so chargeable for the same year of assessment, those payments shall be treated for the purposes of paragraph 8 as a single payment of an amount equal to their aggregate amount.</P>
    <P>10.  Where tax is chargeable under section 114 in respect of two or more payments to or in respect of the same person in respect of different <Col N="465" /> offices or employment and is so chargeable for the same year of assessment, paragraphs 8 and 9 shall apply as if those payments were made in respect of the same office or employment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Supplemental</i>
    </P>
    <P>11.  Any reference in the foregoing provisions of this Schedule to a payment in respect of which tax is chargeable under section 114 is a reference to so much of that payment as is chargeable to tax after deduction of the relief applicable thereto under section 115 (3).</P>
    <P>12.  In this Schedule &ldquo;the relevant date&rdquo; means, in relation to a payment not being a payment in commutation of annual or other periodical payments, the date of the termination or change in respect of which it is made and, in relation to a payment in commutation of annual or other periodical payments, the date of the termination or change in respect of which those payments would have been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> 13.  In this Schedule &ldquo;foreign service&rdquo;, in relation to an office or employment, means service such that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) tax was not chargeable in respect of the emoluments of the office or employment, or</P>
    <P>(b) the office or employment being an office or employment within Schedule E, tax under that Schedule was not chargeable in respect of the whole of the emoluments thereof, or</P>
    <P>(c) the office or employment being regarded as a possession in a place out of the State within the meaning of Case III of Schedule D, tax in respect of the income arising therefrom did not fall to be computed in accordance with section 76 (1).</P>
    <P>14.  Any reference in this Schedule to the amount of tax to which a person is or would be chargeable is a reference to the amount of tax to which he is or would be chargeable either by assessment or by deduction.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Department of Transport replaced the former Department of Tourism and Transport. The general procedure in the then Department of Tourism and Transport and previously in the Department of Transport and Power was that representations and queries addressed by Deputies to the Department were channelled to the Minister's private office and replies issued from that office.  With the exception of minor variations made by individual Ministers, the practice was that the Minister signed replies to other Ministers and Government Deputies, Opposition spokesmen on the Department's affairs and other Opposition Deputies such as former Ministers.  In the absence of the Minister his Private Secretary had authority to sign those replies.  Replies to all other Deputies were signed by the Private Secretary.</P>
      <P>While I was satisfied that the appropriate high priority was being given to representations and queries from Deputies under the procedure which I have outlined, I considered it appropriate that all replies issuing from my private office should normally be signed by me and I have, accordingly, made an arrangement to that effect.  In order to ensure that there would be no undue delay in the issue of replies my Private Secretary has authority to sign replies in my absence.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department also replies personally to representations and queries addressed to him by Deputies.  His Private Secretary also has authority to sign replies in his absence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport when the propose legislation to transfer the Royal and Grand Canal systems from CIE to the Office of Public Works will be introduced; and if, in the interim, he will arrange for a <i>de facto</i> control of the canals by the Office of Public Works to ensure that every possible use will be made of their amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are at present preparing draft legislative proposals to give effect to the Government's decision to transfer responsibility for the Royal and Grand Canal systems from CIE to the Office of Public Works. Technical legislation in relation to railways and canals is traditionally complex and in the present case there are a variety of matters requiring considerable care, including transfers of staff, transfer and delineation of properties, clarification of the position relating to responsibilities over ground common to the railway and canal, considerations affecting water supplies, water rights and so on.  Every effort is being made to expedite work but I am not yet in a position to say when the legislation is likely to be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration has been given to the possibility of transferring <i>de facto</i> control of the canals to the Office of Public Works in advance of the proposed legislation.  However, there would be considerable legal and financial difficulties in such an arrangement and it is the intention, therefore, that CIE will continue to maintain the canals pending the enactment of the necessary legislation. However, arrangements have been <Col N="473" /> made for consultation between CIE and the Office of Public Works in relation to matters affecting the future of the canals, including such matters as work on the canals by voluntary bodies, amenity groups etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister of State who has already told us of his desire to ensure the highest possible standard of operation in his office can give us some indication in regard to when this legislation is to be introduced, above and beyond the reply he has given, which is identical to the reply given by his predecessor last November?

      <P>I am asking if the Minister is aware that CIE sent a letter to the local authority last year clearly stating that they were unable to cope and were not interested in coping because of their inability in terms of finance, with their responsibility for maintaining the Royal Canal.

      <P>As far as I am concerned adequate finance has been made available for the maintenance of the systems.  The Government have taken a decision in principle to transfer the authority for the maintenance and development of the canal system to the OPW.  That is at an advanced stage but there are legal and administrative difficulties which prevent the OPW from moving in at this stage.

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Memorandum From CIE Concerning Bus Building Project.</Title>
    <P>Since the breakdown in negotiations with Van Hool McArdle for the supply of buses to meet CIE requirement, CIE has had discussions with a number of companies interested in setting up a bus building industry in Ireland.  These included Irish.  UK, European, US and Canadian companies.</P>
    <P>The Board has now approved a Management Agreement contract between Bombardier Ltd. (an Irish Company which is being set up by Bombardier Incorporated Canada) covering a joint project for the production of buses for CIE with the possibility of the firm producing vehicles for export at a later date.</P>
    <P>The main features of the arrangements are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The factory premises for the project, which is located at Shannon will be leased by CIE from SFADCo.  CIE will own all assets, the jigs for the manufacture of buses and all other ancillary machinery and tools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> 2.  Bombardier Ltd. will have the responsibility for the employment of labour, the management of that labour and the construction of buses in accordance with CIE's requirements.</P>
    <P>3.  CIE will provide the designs and the jigs which have been commissioned from Hamburg Consult who are designers for Mercedes Benz.</P>
    <P>4.  CIE has come to arrangement with General Motors of America for the supply of power packs, including transmission and axles for the new bus design.</P>
    <P>5.  All materials for the manufacture of buses will be purchased by Bombardier Ltd. in consultation with CIE.  Bombardier Ltd. will have responsibility for the protection of these materials from theft, fire, etc.  Insurance policies to cover these hazards will be in the joint names of Bombardier Ltd. and CIE.</P>
    <P>6.  In accordance with the Contract, the price of each bus delivered in the first year will comprise&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) actual material costs.</P>
    <P>(b) actual labour and overheads, and</P>
    <P>(c) management fee</P>
    <P>If before the end of the first production period, agreement cannot be reached on prices for buses to be delivered in the second production period, the Contract shall terminate absolutely.  It is intended that in the second and subsequent years, the bus price would be determined as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) actual cost of materials</P>
    <P>(b) labour and overheads</P>
    <P>(c) fixed management fee.</P>
    <P>7.  Bombardier Ltd. will have the right to use the CIE designs and facilities to build buses for customers other than CIE.  In which event, CIE will be paid a fee plus a royalty payment.</P>
    <P>8.  Either party may terminate the Contract by two years written notice to the other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> There are provisions within the Contract whereby either party may terminate the Contract if the other party fails to honour the terms of the Contract with costs being charged against the defaulting party.</P>
    <P>9.  CIE will have the right to appoint two non-executive representatives on the five-man Board of Directors of Bombardier Ltd.</P>
    <P>It is the Board's policy that CIE must have a dependable source for the provision of buses.  In the Agreement with Bombardier Ltd. provision is made for CIE to operate the activity on its own account should it be deemed necessary to do so or should the commercial relationship with Bombardier Ltd. be unsatisfactory. It is considered necessary to use the technical and the management resources of Bombardier Ltd. in the first instance to establish an efficient production line.  It is inevitable that technical problems will arise in regard to construction and the operation of the bus and Bombardier Ltd. are equipped to resolve such problems in view of their experience.</P>
    <P>The factory at Shannon was formerly occupied by the Rippon Piano Co.  It consists of 105,000 sq. ft. SFADCo have made the necessary adjustments to the structure of the factory to accommodate the bus building activity.  There will be provision in the lease for future expansion of the building.</P>
    <P>The intention is that production would commence at the end of this year and the first buses would be available in April, 1980.  Subsequent production would be at the rate of 5 per fortnight.  It is estimated that CIE's bus requirements over the next nine years would be 370 double-deck and 379 single-deck.  In addition to CIE's own requirements, it would be the intention to order such school buses as authorised by the Department of Education from the new concern.</P>
    <P>The employment in the new industry will be approximately 200.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My general policy in regard to road freight transport is to move towards liberalisation of the industry subject to quality control.  In this connection I have asked the Transport Consultative Commission to examine the structure of the road freight haulage industry and to consider the adequacy, cost and efficiency of the services provided for domestic and international road haulage.</P>
      <P>No representations have been made to me specifically about wastage of fuel oil as a result of the existing provisions of road transport legislation but I have received representations about the possibility of permitting backloading by own-account operators.  Accordingly, I have asked the Transport Consultative Commission to consider specifically in the course of their examination the question of backloading for reward by own-account operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I receive the commission's report I will then decide what further <Col N="486" /> measures need be taken in the interest of both users and the hauliers.  There are no statistics available about the operations of unlicensed hauliers.</P>

      <P>The matter is under active consideration by the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Enterprise Travel Limited is a tour operating company registered in Northern Ireland in which Aer Lingus has been a minority shareholder for a number of years.  The airline's current stake in Enterprise is 20 per cent.  The airline's shareholding was financed from its own resources and no public moneys were involved.

      <P>I do not think the Deputy should pursue that line much further because Aer Lingus went to the rescue of the group concerned and are guaranteeing the carrying of all the people involved. Aer Lingus acted in good faith and the suggestion that there were underhand machinations at work as far as the company was concerned is untrue and unfounded.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if, in view of the disquiet in the tourist trade concerning the reduced competitiveness of Ireland as a holiday destination this year, he will take steps to have recent air fares reductions on the North Atlantic applied to European routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat unrealistic to talk about reductions in air fares at a time when fuel costs have trebled in a period of 18 months and airlines have experienced substantial increases in costs generally.  The special promotional fares applying on the North Atlantic including super-Apex, budget and standby fares are not fully compensatory, with the result that airlines, including Aer Lingus, are losing heavily from North Atlantic operations.  Because of this airlines have been forced to withdraw or curtail their services.  Aer Lingus and Air Canada withdrew from the Canada-Ireland route and TWA and Pan-Am withdrew from the US-Ireland routes.  A fares policy which leads to the withdrawal of air services hinders rather than helps the development of tourism.</P>
      <P>It is essential for tourism, as for business purposes generally, that we should maintain year round air transport links with our main markets and trading partners.  This requires a fares policy which will cater for the differing needs of tourists and business travellers and enable the airline to operate economically.  I am satisfied that the level of fares on routes to and from Ireland is not in excess of the level necessary to maintain regular viable services. I am also satisfied that the range of fares on the European routes cater adequately for all segments of the market including the tourist.</P>

      <P>The Dublin-London fares&mdash;£99 for the normal economy fare, £82 for the excursion fare and £64 for the APEX fare&mdash;were implemented by Aer Lingus and British Airways on 1 April 1980.  At that stage I had not given my formal approval for the increases and the fares were applied by the airlines subject to my approval.  If I had subsequently decided to disapprove the new fare levels, any passenger who had paid the new fare would have been entitled to a refund. However, on 15 May 1980, I gave my formal approval for the increases for effectiveness on 1 April 1980, and therefore the question of a refund does not arise.  The procedure followed in this matter is in accordance with well established precedents in aviation.</P>

      <P>Comparisons of different air fares can be misleading unless like is compared with like.  The Belfast-London air service is treated as a domestic service which does not have the same cost characteristics as an international service such as Dublin-London.

In fact there is a specialist adviser on the ground at this time to advise on any measures that might be necessary to control this matter. I am assured that there is no danger of pollution to marine life or damage to the tourist trade as a result of the lifting of this after section.  It is important to get rid of the wreck of this ship from Bantry Bay.

      <P>Existing legislation provides for a considerable degree of Ministerial and Governmental involvement <Col N="503" /> in the affairs of CIE.

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will outline his proposals for the construction of the pipeline to service Dublin city and county with natural gas from the Kinsale gas field; and if he has commissioned engineering reports to ensure that problems associated with the granting of wayleaves will not be inhibiting factors in its construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Feasibility studies on the construction of a gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin are now being carried out by Bord Gáis Éireann at my direction and the exact nature of the design and optimum route will depend on the preliminary phases of these studies.  Bord Gáis Éireann have been asked to include in the first phase a report on the wayleaves aspect.  It is appropriate to suggest that delays in pursuing this project might arise more from the necessity for ensuring the efficient distribution, marketing and sale of the gas to the large premium market in Dublin rather than to the construction of a pipeline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he has somewhat given the impression that the decision on this nationally extremely important matter is going to depend on the behaviour of a private company over whom this House has no control?  Has he not given the impression that the decision will hinge on the way the Dublin Gas Company will conduct <Col N="508" /> themselves over the next couple of years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If natural gas were to be piped to Dublin and supplied to the Dublin Gas Company on the basis on which the Gas Company at present operate, the whole operation would be totally uneconomic and could not be contemplated.  Therefore changes are necessary in the Dublin Gas Company, the nature of which I have outlined before this.  Such changes are necessary before the undertaking of the piping of the gas, which is a very major investment, could be contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that what we are talking about here is the destination of a very major national resource, which is becoming more important every day, and that to throw the decision of what that destination is going to be on the conduct of a relatively small private company may be a national mistake? Has the Minister considered making available to that company any assistance, consultancy or advice of a kind of which they might now stand in need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, very much so.  I have met the management and the representatives of the trade unions concerned and discussed the matter in some detail and what needs to be done.  Also I have made arrangements with the Dublin Gas Company for the engagement of consultants with a view to the preparation of the kind of programme which needs to be implemented to occur within six weeks of the engagement of the consultants, which is taking place today or has taken place yesterday.  I believe that it is feasible to expect the production of such a programme which, if implemented, would create the situation we want to see.  The problem is to establish that that programme when prepared will be implemented. I have indicated that I anticipate that it will require approximately 12 months to gauge whether that is likely to be implemented.  If that is so, I would envisage the decision being made to go ahead with the construction of the pipeline.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Kelly</b> asked the Minister for Energy the anticipated increase between 1980 and 1990 in&mdash;(i) the consumption of all forms of energy and (ii) the consumption of imported oil; the extent to which this rate will exceed the European average; and if he has satisfied himself that arrangements made within the European Community for the sharing of oil supplies will be sufficient to continue the present rate and pattern of <Col N="512" /> economic growth in Ireland based on a high rate of increased energy consumption.&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been estimated that</P>
      <P>(i)  the consumption of all forms of energy in this country will increase from 8.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) in 1980 to 15.0 mtoe in 1990, an average annual increase of 5.4 per cent and that</P>
      <P>(2)  the consumption of oil will increase from 6.5 mtoe in 1980 to 9.5 mtoe in 1990, an average annual increase of 3.9 per cent.</P>
      <P>These estimates are in the course of review in the light of recent and current developments in the oil market and in world economic trends generally.  While I do not wish to be definitive at this time, it seems likely that they will need to be adjusted downwards.</P>
      <P>Forecasts for total energy consumption in the European Economic Community beyond 1985 have not been agreed at Community level.  It is estimated, however, that</P>
      <P>(1)  the consumption of all forms of energy in the Community will increase from 1,032 mtoe, in 1980 to 1,191 mtoe in 1985 representing an annual average increase of 3 per cent and that</P>
      <P>(2)  in accordance with the commitment entered into by member states, oil imports into the Community as a whole during the years 1980 to 1985 will not exceed the 1978 imports figure of 472 mtoe.  It will, of course, be recognised that indigenous oil production in the EEC, mainly in the British North Sea sector, will have substantially increased by 1985 and this will displace imports which would have otherwise been necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements made within the Community for the sharing of oil supplies are intended to come into operation only in the event of a shortage of supplies. It is not possible to say at this stage if the arrangements will be sufficient <Col N="513" /> to continue the present rate and pattern of economic growth in Ireland as this would depend on the extent of the shortage.  However, in supplying estimates for EEC consideration of possible measures to reduce oil consumption, we have strongly emphasised the special growth requirements of the Irish economy and the resulting implications for our future energy needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is a cause for considerable concern that the projected rate of growth in Irish energy consumption on average is almost twice that of other European economies?  Is he satisfied that the programmes he has in mind are sufficient to enable us to maintain that pattern of growth in a world of increasing energy scarcity?  Is he further satisfied that, in the event of our not doing so, we may face serious employment problems and problems of social distruption?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that we have at the moment any accurate estimates or forecasts of likely consumption in the coming decade.  The interdepartmental committee, which was set up in connection with the consideration of the nuclear energy reactor has, as one of its functions, the preparation and refinement of estimates of energy consumption over the next decade.  In due course that will become available.  At present the only estimates we have available officially are those which appeared in the document &ldquo;Energy Ireland&rdquo; issued in 1978.  It is quite clear on the face of it that they are not accurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton and Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the percentage <Col N="515" /> of energy consumption previously estimated which he expects his energy conservation programme will save in 1985; and the basis upon which the calculation has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible or useful at this time to try to set down a rigid global target for energy savings which conservation programmes can be expected to achieve in 1985.  Conservation programmes are being developed for the different sectors and the degree of conservation which can be achieved by 1985 will vary significantly from sector to sector. Those for the industrial and commercial sectors are well advanced, that for the transport sector as yet is less advanced.</P>
      <P>The best current estimates, supported by technical experts and energy users, of the conservation potential in the country suggest that by 1985 a 15 per cent saving on currently projected needs is not unrealistic in regard to the industrial sector, while the potential in the domestic-commercial sector is estimated at 10 per cent and in the transport sector 5 per cent.  The achievement of these savings will depend on the implementation of effective conservation programmes and the estimate of savings will be necessarily revised as experience is gained.</P>
      <P>Very much depends on the public response and commitment.  The achievement of a greater public awareness of the importance and practical benefits of conservation is one of my immediate priorities.  I believe it may be necessary to follow up the general publicity drive with specific new measures in particular sectors which will go beyond exhortation and the possibilities in this regard are being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister basing his projected savings of 15 per cent and 5 per cent on those current projected needs based on the projections quoted by him in reply to the previous question which he has already admitted are inaccurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate in the case of the industrial sector is based on estimates <Col N="516" /> made by the IIRS when they were drawing up their boiler testing service as part of the conservation programme.  The estimates in regard to the domestic commercial sector were made by An Foras Forbartha in connection with projections concerning the housing stock and the effect of insulation on it.  As regards domestic energy, the figures are from my Department.  The question of the amount of projected energy on which the percentage was calculated is one to which I cannot give a specific answer.  I assume they are the projections I referred to earlier in the 1978 document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is essential for any assessment of an energy conservation programme and its effectiveness, that there should be agreement as to the basis upon which these savings are calculated? The Minister should be able, if not now at least on another occasion, to give specific answers to the concurrence between the basis of calculation of the projections for the savings as against the basis of calculation of the projection for increased consumption generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I want to make this clear.  I said earlier, and I want to repeat it now, that it is not possible or useful at this time to try to set down a rigid global target for energy savings which conservation programmes can be expected to achieve in 1985.  I do not believe that it is possible to do this, not only in relation to this conservation programme, but to any conservation programme.  As an example, let me point out to the House that one of the effective things one can hope for from a conservation programme other than a reduction in energy consumption is a switch in the use of certain kinds of energy so that one gets a more efficient use of the energy being used. That does not reflect a reduction in the consumption of energy.  Yet it is one of the things that one would hope for from an effective conservation programme.  I would not wish in any sense to get hung up on particular percentage targets because they are not realistic in the context of conservation.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that it cannot be very easy to make a prediction five years ahead about what an energy conservation programme will achieve.  But I notice that he did make a flying guess under various heads.  He mentioned the private sector, the industrial sector and the transport sector. Would he agree that it would be very useful if he got his Department to add another subhead to this, namely, the public administration or public service sector in view of the fact that this is a sector in which the State has a quite special role, namely, one of command, which it has not got anywhere else and in which the State can itself lay down norms in regard to the heating of buildings, the cleaning of boilers, the effective servicing of vehicles and things like that, and also in view of the fact that the State itself is an extremely heavy energy consumer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of specific sites for the generation of power from wind is being made with a view to ascertaining the potential in this regard on a national basis.  Demonstration projects require unique features to ensure the best chances of success and with this in mind a list of criteria for selection of the island site was drawn up.  Inis Siar best met these criteria.  The Deputy will appreciate that the primary objective of the demonstration project is to ascertain whether a technical and economic basis exists for schemes to provide electricity from wind generation for other islands in due course but the question of selecting further sites must obviously await the outcome of the initial project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

I said that I hoped to have them all in operation within a period of 18 months, so that applies to Inis Siar as far as being in operation is concerned.  Possibly it would be in operation earlier than that but I would hope that that would be the outside time limit for any of them.  The question of when they will be evaluated is one that I cannot answer at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a reply given on 8 November 1979 to a previous Dáil question (Official Report volume 316-8, columns 1288-1293) which outlined fully the sequence of events which it is envisaged will lead to a review of the nuclear energy project.  The inter-departmental committee's report, which is an essential preliminary to the setting up of the public inquiry, will have to await further information on the investigations into the accident at the Harrisburg nuclear plant.  While some reports of these investigations have been published certain critical reports are not now expected for some considerable time.  It would therefore be unrealistic at this stage to suggest a timetable for the proposed public inquiry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed this and <Col N="522" /> other matters with Wexford County Council and I have indicated to them that I regard their role as being different from that of any person or body that might be a party to the inquiry wanting to make submissions and different in so far as the consideration of things like protecting a bird sanctuary in the area is concerned or whether there should be overhead or underground wires.  But since the final decision would not be made by the council its role is not its normal one and yet it is different from that of the ordinary person who might be making submissions to the inquiry.  I have said that I recognise that and that I thought we ought to endeavour to work out, if we can, machinery which will recognise that special role of the council.  Therefore I have instructed my Department to formulate proposals for that purpose which I would hope in due course to discuss with Wexford County Council.</P>

      <P>In relation to quarrying, mining, boring, exploration and so on for uranium, is it proposed to include that in this inquiry?  If so, should not such operations as would at the moment appear to be dangerous await the outcome of such inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Deputy correctly, the answer to the first part of his supplementary is no.  It is not envisaged that the question of exploration or the search for uranium would be the subject of the inquiry which relates to the location of a possible nuclear station at Carnsore.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the supplementary, there is no evidence available either to me or to the Nuclear Energy Board who advised me, to support the contention that there is any risk whatever involved in searching for uranium.  I am not speaking of mining, which is a different problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it is not intended to include this aspect in the Minister's inquiry&mdash;and perhaps I can see the reasons for subdividing the question&mdash;surely this is a matter that <Col N="523" /> should be inquired into.  Because it is a much more restricted area of investigation, would the Minister not endeavour to ensure that the fears being expressed by very eminent people in other counties, particularly people from Australia where such activity has taken place already, are allayed?  From the evidence of some of the very eminent people qualified to speak in this area it would appear that the type of activity concerned is not harmless.  However, as a layman all I can say is that somebody must be telling us lies since one eminent man will say it is harmless while another will say otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>All the evidence and all the advice available to me indicates that there is no danger or risk involved in exploration for uranium.  However, the Deputy will be aware that in an effort to reassure people who may be concerned about this and to allay their fears, I have made arrangements with the Nuclear Energy Board to conduct monitoring of water and soil in areas in which there is any exploration in progress and to make the results of that monitoring available to interested parties in Donegal as it comes to hand.  The monitoring is undertaken both before and after exploration. As I have indicated already by way of reply to a parliamentary question, the information available so far from that monitoring process confirms the advice I have received that there is no increase in radioactivity as a result of the exploration. However, the tests are continuing and the results are being made available as they come to hand.</P>

      <P>I think it was in answer to a question from myself that the Minister replied last on this question.  Is there any good reason for not going ahead with the legislation for this inquiry even in advance of the material in regard to the Harrisburg accident becoming available, though I am aware of the necessity of having this material before any inquiry <Col N="525" /> takes place?  If the inquiry is to have a statutory basis would it not be an advantage to have that statutory basis established now and also to have defined the terms of reference of the inquiry and even to name the personnel who will be involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking from recollection, I think the Deputy did ask me that question before and that I replied to it. At any rate, I am not of the opinion that there is a case for proceeding with the legislation at this time.  There are a number of reasons for that and I shall give one of those reasons.  For instance, we were discussing the question of the role of Wexford County Council in the inquiry. That is something that must be worked out and built into the legislation. A number of other matters have to be worked out, too, but it seems to me that the procedure envisaged will involve the publication of the interdepartmental report covering various aspects, including aspects of safety, health, finance and so on and that that report would be available to the public generally so that all parties will be as fully informed as possible when making submissions to the tribunal.  That whole process will take some time and I do not see any reason in these circumstances for rushing ahead with legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present no standards in Ireland regarding energy efficiency of motor cars for sale.  Since motor car engines are as a rule not manufactured here I am not convinced that it would be appropriate or justified in practical terms to prescribe statutory national standards and to set up the kind of testing and surveillance mechanisms which would be necessary to enforce <Col N="526" /> such standards.  I would of course support the adoption of such standards on an international basis.</P>
      <P>What I am considering is the question of requiring the publication or display in some appropriate form of details of fuel consumption by different car models under various conditions.  This would enable prospective customers to take account of economy performance in deciding on the make or model of car they will purchase.  Information of this kind is in very many cases at present given in the publicity literature available to prospective customers and sometimes it is featured in media advertisements for particular vehicles.  I am, however, considering whether it would be desirable to require that the information be made available in all cases and exactly how it should be presented and publicised.</P>

It is really very doubtful whether, in practical terms, there is any point in our laying down specifications of that kind and setting up the test mechanism and so on that would be necessary in our circumstances.  That is why I am talking about something else altogether.  I do not think that the question of engine efficiency tests is one which is appropriate in our present circumstances.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if his attention has been drawn to a report by the Advisory Committee on Oil Pollution of the dangers of pollution from wells being drilled in deep water on the Irish portion of the Continental Shelf off the west coast, and the special precautions, if any, being taken to prevent the possibility of pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have seen the newspaper reports on this matter I have not yet seen the report by the Advisory Committee on Oil Pollution to which the Deputy refers.  From the press reports it would seem that the committee expressed some concern at the risks associated with oil production in very deep waters by means of a system involving the loading of oil into a moored tanker through a flexible hose.</P>
      <P>I would point out that at the present time there is no oil production from any area offshore Ireland.  Even if the drilling in the Porcupine Basin this summer should confirm the encouraging results we have had from this area over the past two years, it would still be some time before we would know whether or not a commercial oilfield had been delineated. There would then be several years of development work before oil production would commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of a commercial discovery of oil the licensees will be obliged to submit for my approval a development plan for the exploitation of the field.  Any such plan, which would include detailed proposals on all the technical aspects of field development, will be examined most thoroughly; and <Col N="528" /> only if I am satisfied that the proposed production system is satisfactory, particularly from a safety and pollution prevention point of view, will I approve the development.</P>
    <P>I might point out in this respect that research on deep-water production systems is proceeding at such a rapid pace that it would be premature to reach conclusions about the type of systems which may be considered most suitable for deep-water production by the time the development stage might arise off our west coast.</P>
    <P>The licensing conditions which apply during the present exploration phase and those which would apply to oil production impose strict obligations on operators to take all necessary measures to prevent pollution taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if any grant is available towards the cost of installing solar panels in private residences; and, if not, if he will introduce such a grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no funds at the disposal of my Department or, so far as I know available from other sources, out of which grants could be made for installing solar panels in private residences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the priority objectives which I have set for my Department is to ensure a concerned approach, by those best qualified to do so, towards assessing the potential in Irish conditions of solar and other renewable sources of energy.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have carried out a technical <Col N="531" /> and economic study of the potential use of solar energy for the provision of space heating and hot water for dwellings and further work is being done.  The Electricity Supply Board are at present carrying out a study of the practical problems involved and the optimum methods of control in the use of solar energy.  Other research in this field is also in progress.</P>
    <P>Even if, as I anticipate, assistance from EEC sources may be available for research and development work on renewable energy sources, the total funds available for those purposes will obviously be limited.  It is only prudent and sensible to have an assessment and comparisons done of the value of these various sources as a means of meeting energy needs in Irish circumstances.  I, therefore, think it would be premature to conclude at this stage that the use of solar panels has such technical and economic advantages that their installation should receive priority in terms of funding.  I think the Deputy is aware that, leaving technical issues aside, there are economic factors involved which at the present stage of development would confirm my reluctance to afford these appliances such priority on the generalised basis which he appears to envisage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

However, would he assure the House that, in the event of there emerging a device suitable to the kind of solar infusion or installation or whatever it is called here, he would be favourably disposed towards providing financial incentives for people who want to install them in their houses.  Assuming budgetary constriction as there is at the moment, of <Col N="532" /> course, would he be favourably disposed towards providing incentives of this kind?</P>

      <P>What form of encouragement would be necessary, whether it would take the form of grants or otherwise is another matter that I would have to consider at a later stage.  I would not be prepared at this stage to commit myself to grants in relation to solar panels, but the Deputy will find that my attitude in this regard is on the same wavelength as his own.  I want to encourage anything we can do to reduce our dependence on imported energy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is sad that I have to raise an issue of this kind in the House.  I am sure we are all agreed that strikes are undesirable and should take place only when they cannot be avoided. It is a tragedy that a strike, and the bitterness of a strike, should be introduced into a small, peaceful town like Borris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation there is that we have 250 children on outright strike and their <Col N="552" /> teachers on a one day a week strike.  This strike was brought about by a situation in which the parents are not prepared to tolerate the conditions at present obtaining in Borris national school.  These parents are not irresponsible people because the teachers have backed them and have now decided to go on a one day strike per week.  This strike action will continue until the contractor takes up residence on the site.  That is their decision.  They will not be fobbed off by any promises from the Minister or the Department.</P>
    <P>There is a long history to this school. It was built way back in 1832 as a two-teacher school for boys and girls.  There were two large rooms in the school over a basement area.  This was the accommodation there until some time in the 1930's when a third room was added and the two large rooms divided to make it into a five-roomed school.  In 1968, with the change in the education and schools system, schools were amalgamated and, along with a lot of schools in other areas, Borris national school was the subject of this reorganisation, when Rahana and Ballymartin schools were closed.  That brought 60 extra pupils into the Borris school which was already overcrowded and which had at that point outlived its usefulness.  During the amalgamation negotiations the Minister of the day promised that a new school would be commenced immediately in Borris.  To alleviate the over crowding at the time a pre-fab was erected on the site which was to remain while the new school was being built.  In 1977 the school attendance was further expanded and another teacher was required. However, there was no place in the school to house such additional teacher. Therefore, arrangements were made for a room in the parish hall to be used and a large class has been attending this parish hall classroom over the past three years.</P>
    <P>I inspected that room in the parish hall together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Nolan. Senator Governey and Deputy Pattison. and we were appalled at its condition. We went there sometime after the <Col N="553" /> children had left the room for lunch and the stench that hit one on entering the room was unbelievable.  Along with that there was located in that room all the electrical controls for this parish hall, which, in my view, are highly dangerous. There is not even a fire extinguisher sited beside them.  Indeed, it would not be allowed in any factory; but here there is a large class of school children sitting on what might be described as a time bomb. That is the urgency of the situation and what has brought about a strike by the people in the area.</P>
    <P>I should say that, 12 years later, in 1980, we still have no new school in Borris.  The existing school was condemned in 1969 by a health inspector.  It was condemned earlier this year, with a very strong report being issued on its condition and on how undesirable it was to have children attending the school at all. This can be borne out by the incidence of kidney illnesses being suffered by pupils in Borris school, which is unrealistically high.  The local medical officer attributes this to the draught and breezes coming through the floorboards of this school.  It could happen that children's health would be damaged irreparably.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the school structure was inspected by an architect who immediately ordered that the floors be pinned. That work has been carried out with at least nine-tenths of the cost being borne by the Department.  I feel the Department would be far better occupied in building a new school rather than providing this type of make-shift accommodation, propping up floor boards which have worn to a quarter of an inch thickness.  Along with my colleagues I stood on the floorboards in this school, and I did not feel too happy. One felt one was on the chair-o-planes going up and down.  This is the floor the Department had to have pinned instead of getting in and building the new school.</P>
    <P>When I and my colleagues visited this school we were amazed by and very concerned at its condition.  We could not credit that a school housing 250 children <Col N="554" /> could be in such a condition.  I could only liken it to a Dickensian scene.  One could almost shoot the film &ldquo;Oliver&rdquo; at the school.  It was that type of scene. That is no exaggeration.  It had to be seen to be believed.</P>
    <P>Certainly also the toilet facilities at the school are inadequate and intolerable. The children should not have to put up with them.  However, they are secondary to the general condition of the school itself.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the situation obtaining at present, the teachers concerned issued strike notice to expire on 29 April last. They withdrew this notice when a deputation was arranged to meet the Minister, which deputation was received on 22 April last.  I had a parliamentary question answered in the House in relation to the school on the same day.  I attended that deputation with the Minister. Unfortunately, I received word very late and was there for the last few minutes of the meeting only.  I was glad I got word from my colleague across the floor&mdash;Deputy Nolan let me know&mdash;I was glad to be there and be part of the deputation.  Certainly all the public representatives did everything in their power to bring about a successful solution to this problem.  The Minister was not left in any doubt about the feelings of parents, teachers, the management committee and others concerned.</P>
    <P>Under that pressure the Minister gave a commitment that the contract would be placed and signed within two or three weeks.  It is not easy for a Minister to give that type of commitment without being sure of himself, and when the Minister gave such a commitment the deputation accepted it in good faith and left in a happy mood.  Unfortunately the commitment has not been honoured and we are still at the stage when there is no sign of the contract being placed.  As a result, the parents have taken action and 250 children are missing classes at an important stage in their education.  The teachers are frustrated.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, the delay has been caused because the figures submitted by the contractor whose tender was <Col N="555" /> lowest were in excess of those allowed by the Department and, or, the Board of Works for school building, and negotiations were commenced with the contractor who had submitted the lowest tender to reduce his figures.  This seems ludicrous.  This is a responsible contractor, a large sum of money is involved, and it is obvious that the contractor did his costings carefully.  Yet we had the Department saying, &ldquo;We will give it to you if you reduce the amount&rdquo;.  This is a red herring, a delaying tactic, and I call on the Minister to enter into negotiations immediately, arrive at an agreement with the contractor and get the work under way.</P>
    <P>The Department must be realistic and update their figures for school building. In the newspapers this week a report stated there has been a 9 per cent increase in the cost of housing building in the first three months of this year. Therefore, a contractor who submitted a tender six months ago must now add such a percentage, and accordingly the delay by the Department in finalising the matter means that the cost of building this school will be higher.</P>

      <P>In the long run the delay will cost money.  A further red herring has been thrown in in another way.  A bus road was to have been laid down from the public road to the school but the Department now want to cut down on the cost of that road by taking three feet from the original width and taking portion of the priest's frontage to put in a lay-by.  The Department require a saving of £1,500 on the original estimated cost. The local people are prepared to pay that money to get the work under way immediately on the building of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attitudes in Borris are hardening and if there is further delay the children will not go back to the old school until the new one has been built or until the contractor arrives on the site.  When the dispute began parents said their children would not go back until the contract had <Col N="556" /> been signed.  I am asking the Minister to be realistic and to have the contract finalised immediately.</P>

      <P>I put down a Private Notice Question on this matter today. The children apparently will be leaving the school at the end of term and examinations are not involved.  I am acquainted with the history of this dispute and I can tell the Minister that the parents and teachers have shown extraordinary restraint in the last couple of years.  They deferred or cancelled action of any kind.  They did not behave in any way which could be described as provocative.  Time and time again they said they were prepared to accept an assurance that agreement would be reached, the contract signed and work begun.  That has been almost an object lesson in restraint.  Faced with a recalcitrant Department who employed delaying tactics they have shown admirable restraint and I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the community, particularly the children concerned, to get the contractor on the site so that this matter can be dealt with once and for all.</P>

      <P>In the few moments I have I should like to say that what Deputy Crotty has stated about the condition of the school and the other problems in Borris is correct.  We all agree that the Department and the board of management would not have agreed to build a new school unless the old school needed replacement.  I was on the deputation in April in connection with this matter.  The Minister accepted recommendations made to him that the addition of a second story would be dangerous, and he told the deputation to get a contractor and to let him know the exact cost and that he would agree to pay the Department's share to make the second story safe.  There was a promise that the contract would be signed within a couple of weeks.  A few technical problems arose and Deputy Crotty will recall that the Minister told the deputation that the tender for the work, compared with other <Col N="557" /> such tenders, was high.  I can recall his words.  He said he was responsible to the Government and to the nation to get the best use he could for the money available to him.</P>

There is not any doubt in my mind that a contract will be signed and that the building of the school in Borris will go ahead, but I ask the people not to wait until the contractor goes on the site because even though the contract is signed he will have the right to wait a month or two to start work on the site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of introduction and explanation and for the purpose of a clear understanding of the situation, I should say that there are three main parties immediately concerned in relation to the placing of a contract for a national school&mdash;first, the school authorities, second, the Department of Education; and, third, the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The school authorities provide the site, the evidence of title to the site and the local contribution.  The Department of Education determine where the school is needed, the size of the school and provide from the Vote for Primary Education the grant for the cost of the school, apart from the local contribution. The Office of Public Works provide the professional service, examine the plans for the building, report on the tenders and certify the claims for payments as the work progresses.  That has been standard procedure since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is not in dispute that there has been a long delay over a period of years in relation to the arrangements <Col N="558" /> for the provision of this new school.  I agree there has been an unfortunate delay, but it is no harm to place on record the reasons for it.  The proposal to replace this school was first made in 1955, but no progress was made until a site was offered in 1969.  The site did not commend itself to the Commissioners of Public Works; but in 1975, in view of the fact that no other site was available, they agreed.  The title to the site, which was not the responsibility of the Department of Education, was not furnished until 1979.  When analysing the causes of the delay, we must remember all these factors. In April 1979 the amount of the local contribution was agreed.</P>
    <P>In December 1979 working drawings had been received and approved by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The architect representing the chairman of the school board of management was advised to proceed with the preparation of bills of quantities and the chairman was advised as regards the invitation of tenders. Deputy Crotty gave the history of tenders.  I appreciate the positive case made by Deputies here today.  The generosity which Deputy Crotty expects the Department to display in accepting tenders, is not what any good businessman would accept.  I only say in passing that one automatically accepts the lowest as being the best.</P>

      <P>On 22 April 1980 the Minister met a local deputation who wished to discuss with him the matter of the date for the placing of the contract. The Minister said he was in full agreement that a new school was needed urgently but he also pointed out that responsibility for the delay over a period of years did not rest entirely with the Department.  He informed the deputation that the lowest tender received for the contract for the new primary school building was in excess of the normal cost and that it would be necessary to have an examination of the documentation with a view to achieving a reduction.  He also said he would be prepared to <Col N="559" /> authorise the Office of Public Works in due course to place the contract, subject to the agreement of the various interested parties being reached on the modification required.</P>
      <P>A letter was addressed from the office of the Minister for Education to the secretary of the parents' action committee on 9 May 1980 informing him of the situation.  The Minister understands that the Commissioners of Public Works have written to the school architect in connection with the matter and that a reply is awaited from him.  It is desired that a contract for the new premises for Borris national school be placed as soon as possible.  Everybody accepts that.  I repeat what I said in this House on many occasions, that is, that my first priority in the field of education lies in the primary sector.</P>
      <P>The present understandable agitation is irrelevant to what is going to happen within the next few weeks.  Here I join with other Deputies in appealing to parents not to use what is commonly called the strike weapon in the hope of getting what they want ahead of their time.  The Irish sean-fhocal which says you can never recover a day lost from school is very apt.  Even though a parent might understandably be provoked into taking what he thinks is suitable remedial action, that will not influence the Minister to expedite the provision of this school.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>In June 1978 the Government reached agreement in principle on a programme of implementation covering the main areas of the consultants' recommendations in the Derry-Donegal report.  As outlined previously in the Dáil on 14 February 1979 this programme envisaged:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> (a)  Full implementation of the consultants' recommendations for the road programme for North Donegal up to 1985,</P>
    <P>(b)  Joint action with the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland to effect improvements in the cross-Border passenger bus service in the area,</P>
    <P>(c)  Consultation with the appropriate authorities in Britain and in Northern Ireland with a view to reaching agreement on establishing an air link between Eglinton Airport and Dublin,</P>
    <P>(d)  Consultation with appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland to pursue certain joint measures for the development of tourism and the co-ordination of tourism promotion on the lines recommended by the consultants,</P>
    <P>(e)  Conversion of Letterkenny exchange to automatic working,</P>
    <P>(f)  Laying of a cross-Border cable between Derry and Bridgend to facilitate direct dialling between Donegal, Derry and the Belfast area.</P>
    <P>In April 1979 and again in May 1980 a detailed progress report on the implementation of the recommendations in the Derry-Donegal report was forwarded to the Secretary of Donegal County Council.  Again with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to circulate a statement setting out a detailed up-to-date account on the implementation of the study recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Government that what was agreed in the Government decision of June 1978 will be pursued to the fullest extent possible.  Details of the moneys allocated in 1979 and 1980 for the implementation of the roads programme are outlined in detail in the statement which has been circulated.  It is not possible to identify within these figures the specific elements which are additional to normal financing but the Deputy can take it that the Government's commitment to the implementation of the roads programme still stands. <Col N="535" /> In this context the Taoiseach, at his recent meeting with a cross-Border delegation from the Derry-Donegal area, undertook to see what additional financing to that already allocated could be provided in the current year.  A technical and financial review and assessment of present progress and scheduled completion dates of the roads programme is also being undertaken.</P>
    <P>With regard to ERDF aid generally for the implementation of the recommendations of the report these are set out in some detail in the statement.</P>
    <P>With reference to the proposed works at Greencastle Harbour, Co. Donegal, the statement which has been circulated gives a detailed account of the proposed works.  In relation to European Regional Development Fund aid I understand that the proposed scheme has not yet been put forward for such aid.  This scheme, however, will be considered for inclusion in a forthcoming application for ERDF aid at the appropriate time.  This would be in or around the time that the contract for the work has been placed.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any fund in the amount of £50 million which the Deputy refers to.  It is expected, however, that Border areas North and South will benefit under the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund.  Following representations by the Government when the fund regulation was under consideration, the Council of Ministers agreed that Irish border areas would be eligible for consideration.  The Commission of the European Communities adopted and forwarded to the Council of Ministers a number of proposals under this heading including a proposal to make available 16 million units of account for tourism and craft industries on this side of the Border; and eight million units of account in Northern Ireland border areas.  We are hopeful that these proposals will now be adopted by the Council of Ministers in July.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated the Taoiseach met with a cross-Border delegation from Donegal Regional Development Organisation and the Foyle Development Organisation and Strabane District <Col N="536" /> Council on 4 June 1980.  In the course of this meeting the Taoiseach reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the development of County Donegal and to cross-Border co-operation, and indicated that he would consider the points made by the delegation as sympathetically as possible.  In the course of these discussions the Taoiseach reaffirmed the offer of the Irish Government to extend its financial assistance to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Bus Company for a further period in order to ensure the maintenance of cross-Border road passenger services in the Derry-Donegal area.  He also indicated the Government's readiness to bear an appropriate share of the cost of any initial subsidisation required to support the provision of an air service between Eglinton Airport, County Derry and Dublin as recommended in the Derry-Donegal Study and he undertook to use his good offices to ensure the continuation of the CIE rail freight operation based in Derry.  The Taoiseach also announced that the Minister of State at the Department of Transport would have special responsibility for advancing the implementation of the Derry-Donegal Report in the Donegal area and in particular for bringing forward proposals as soon as possible for the provision of a suitable air facility in the East Donegal area.</P>
    <P>Progress Report on Implementation of Cross-Border Communications Study for the Derry and Donegal Area.</P>
    <P>1.  In 1976 the British and Irish Governments appointed consultants to carry out a study on cross-Border communications with the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To examine communications, including transportation (e.g. roads, railways, ports, airports, telecommunications) in the Derry and Donegal area in the light of existing projects and plans in order to determine their adequacy and to make recommendations for future development, having regard to financial constraints&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report, half the cost of which was financed from the EEC Regional Fund, was published in December 1977.  Subsequently the main <Col N="537" /> recommendations of the report were endorsed in a separate study carried out by the EEC Economic and Social Committee which was published in June 1978.</P>
    <P>2.  The implementation of the recommendations in the consultants' report is being monitored at official level by representatives from the respective Government Departments.  Meetings at both ministerial and official level have also taken place with local interests, including local councillors.  Deputations from the three councils in the area had meetings with Mr. Don Concannon, then Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, and with Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, then Minister for Foreign Affairs in February 1979.  Both Minister emphasised to the deputations their appreciation of the work done by the councils in relation to the report and their desire to keep the councils briefed fully and regularly on the measure of implementation proposed.  They undertook to communicate to the councils a progress report on the implementation of the report which they did in April 1979. The information now given provides a further updating on progress in the Donegal area:</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>Roads</i></P>
    <P>As recommended by the consultants the first stage of the road programme for North Donegal will be implemented in full.</P>
    <P>1979 Financing (updating of April 1979 Progress Report)</P>
    <P>Road grants allocated for work in the Donegal section of the study area in 1979 included £265,000 for schemes on the Letterkenny/Derry Road (National Primary N. 13):, £50,000 for the completion of the Lifford by-pass part 1: £30,000 for the Letterkenny by-pass and £88,900 for the Stranorlar/Letterkenny route (including Kilmacrennan Bridge section).  In addition to the above grants totalling £433,900 a general block grant of £781,000 was allocated to Donegal County Council for 1979 for work at the discretion of the council on roads other than national roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> 1980 Financing</P>
    <P>Road grants allocated for work in the Donegal section of the study in 1980 include £263,000 on the Letterkenny/ Derry Road, (National Primary N. 13):, £20,000 for the completion of the Lifford by-pass, and £67,000 for the Stranorlar/Letterkenny route.  In addition to the above grants totalling £350,000 a general block grant of £824,000 has been allocated to Donegal County Council for 1980 for work on roads at the discretion of the council, on roads other than national roads.</P>
    <P>The detailed position regarding the road improvements in Donegal is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inter-Urban Roads</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>(I)  Letterkenny/Pluck Cross, N. 13 National Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Outline design has been completed, and a detailed ground survey has been carried out to enable the detailed road design to proceed.</P>
    <P>At the present rate of progress it is expected that it will be possible for work to begin on the scheme towards the end of 1980.  The design involved a detour from the existing route at Pluck Cross, connecting back at Manorcunningham on the Derry side.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(II)  Bridgend/Pluck Cross, N.13 National Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Two remaining sections of this route are included in current improvement programmes: (a)  1 mile at Manorcunningham adjoining Letterkenny-Pluck Cross route:, (b) Newtowncunningham by-pass.</P>
    <P>Scheme (a)</P>
    <P>Construction of the scheme has commenced. Prospects are that it will take a further year to complete the scheme.</P>
    <P>Scheme (b)</P>
    <P>Outline design stage for this scheme has been completed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(III)  Letterkenny/Kilmacrennan, N.56 National Secondary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Detailed design has been completed for a 1½ mile section of this route adjoining Letterkenny.  Improvement work at a bridge on the route, South of Kilmacrennan, <Col N="539" /> is in progress, and will be completed in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(IV)  Strabane/Lifford, N.14 National Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>The proposal involves a through-pass at Lifford and includes two schemes: (a) The Strabane/Letterkenny Link; (b) The Strabane/Ballybofey Link.</P>
    <P>Scheme (a) is at an advanced stage of completion and is open to traffic.</P>
    <P>Scheme (b) was not included in the programme drawn up by the consultants but is however scheduled in the County Programme for the second half of the 1980s.  Detailed design has been completed and land acquisition by CPO confirmed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(V)  Urban through routes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Letterkenny</P>
    <P>A scheme linking the Letterkenny/ Pluck Cross and Letterkenny/ Kilmacrennan Roads has been in progress since 1977 and was opened to traffic early in 1979.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Freight Transport</i></P>
    <P>The legislation governing the operation of Freight Transport Services has been considerably liberalised and amended in the direction recommended by the consultants by the passing by the Oireachtas of the Road Transport Act 1978.</P>
    <P>In relation to customs facilities, in September 1979, customs officials from both the United Kingdom and Irish Governments completed an examination of customs requirements in relation to traffic between the two countries.  This study took as its starting point the cross-Border customs procedures and documentation.  The implementation in due course of recommendations arising from this stage of the review should facilitate speedier completion of formalities and movement of goods across the border.  An initial simplification of documentation took place from the beginning of April 1980 with the introduction of an aligned set of just two folios comprising, respectively, customs manifest at exportation and customs report at importation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> (c)  <i>Public Passenger Transport</i></P>
    <P>The two Governments have been jointly considering the problems relating to the operation in the area of the Lough Swilly Bus Company, and to this end commissioned a report by industrial consultants costing all aspects of the company's operations.  This report was submitted in April 1979 but before decisions could be taken on the report it was found necessary to provide, with the agreement of the Irish Government, short-term support for the company through CIE.  The Irish Government has since agreed to an extension for a further period of the existing arrangement between CIE and the company whereby CIE would supply buses and financial support to the company in consideration of the continued provision of road passenger services in the North Donegal area by the company. Discussions are continuing between the authorities in Dublin and Belfast regarding the possibility of some Northern Ireland involvement in support of the company's cross-Border services.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>Ports</i></P>
    <P>Approval has been given for the carrying out of the second stage of the development programme at Greencastle Harbour at an estimated cost of £1.12 million.  The scheme will include the extension of the existing pier and the construction of a new pier to provide additional berthage accommodation, deepening of the existing berthage area, reclamation of an area of 8,250 square yards and the provision of an auction hall and other ancillary facilities.  It is estimated that the works will take about 4 years to complete.  Contract documents are at present being prepared for county council approval prior to going to tender.</P>
    <P>(e)  <i>Air Transport</i></P>
    <P>In the cross-Border communications study for the Derry/Donegal area it was recommended that the Irish and UK Governments should jointly examine the possibility of establishing a Dublin/-Derry air link &ldquo;initially with financial support made available to the selected operator for a trial period of say 2/3 years until the prospects for longer term <Col N="541" /> viability could be clearly assessed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In February 1979 the UK Civil Aviation Authority was jointly commissioned to carry out an economic analysis of a proposed scheduled air service linking Derry and Dublin.  The study was designed to assess the possible level of demand for an air link, the cost of providing the service and the level of subsidy required to get the project off the ground.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking the study, having examined the question from the point of view of type of company (entirely new, existing taxi operator etc.) type of aircraft, frequency of service, price levels and levels of demand and using a number of economic analytical methods, found that any service would be loss making, with very little prospects that the service could ever be viable.  In the light of this finding, while discussions continue, no positive action to set up such a service has been agreed.</P>
    <P>(f)  <i>Telecommunication</i></P>
    <P>(i)  The conversion to automatic working of the 57 telephone exchanges in North Donegal is going ahead as part of a £6.5 million development programme for the improvement of telecommunications in the area.  Letterkenny exchange was converted to automatic in October, 1979 and a main trunk switching exchange and a new operator assistance exchange were brought into service there at the same time.  The latter exchanges will serve the entire North Donegal area under automatic conditions.  Automatic working was introduced at Bridgend in March 1980.  Contracts have already been placed for the supply and installation of the automatic equipment for conversion of 36 exchanges and it is expected that conversion of these will be effected progressively later this year and through 1981.  Quotations have been also sought for conversion of a further 7 exchanges.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Industrial problems have caused a set-back to progress with the Dublin/Sligo/Letterkenny radio links which were previously expected in service <Col N="542" /> in 1979.  It is not now expected that the links will be in service before mid-1980.</P>
    <P>(iii)  In addition to the direct dialling already introduced (as at (i) above), the same facilities will be extended to the other North Donegal exchanges on conversion to automatic.  Discussions are continuing between the two authorities on the possibilities of extending cross-Border direct dialling facilities to a greater number of centres on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(g)  Postal Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  Agreement in principle has been reached between the respective postal authorities to restore the routing of mails to and from County Donegal through Northern Ireland.  The operational implications are at present under discussion with the staffs concerned.  A final costing of the proposals must await the outcome of these discussions. Provided the cost is not prohibitive and suitable arrangements can be made, the aim is to restore the mail link through Northern Ireland as early as possible this year.</P>
    <P>(ii)  With regard to the last collection of mail in the North West being processed through Aldergrove, it is now clear that flight times are such that there is no case at present for accelerating the service in this manner.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(h)  Tourism</i>
    </P>
    <P>The recommendation by the Consultants that there should be an integrated approach to the development of tourism in the region has led to the establishment of the North West Tourism Co-Operation Group, consisting of 2 officers from each of the Tourist Boards.  The Group held an Open Forum session in Derry on 3 October when delegates from interested organisations had an opportunity to put forward their ideas.  A further Open Forum Session took place in Donegal Town on 28 March.</P>
    <P>Already the Group has under consideration a number of projects. These include a cross Border tourist brochure, which is due to be published <Col N="543" /> this summer and other joint publicity projects.  The Group is also examining the feasibility of a car-ferry link with the West of Scotland and is seeking to maximise the potential of the American Heritage Trail concept, and the introduction by Loganair of air services to Eglinton and Enniskillen from Scotland.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>European Community Financial Aid</i></P>
    <P>A number of the infrastructure projects envisaged in the Consultants Report have already been submitted for assistance under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  The position in relation to individual projects is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  A grant of £1.5 million is being made by the ERDF towards the cost of converting Letterkenny and other smaller exchanges in North Donegal to automatic working.  ERDF assistance towards the Dublin/Sligo/Letterkenny radio links has also been agreed in the amount of £135,000.</P>
    <P>(ii)  As regards roads, schemes costing £423,000 were accepted in 1978 for assistance from the ERDF involving receipts of approximately £127,000.  The routes involved included Bridgend/ Pluck Cross (N.13), Letterkenny, Kilmacrennan (N.56), Strabane/Lifford (N.14) and the Letterkenny through route.</P>
    <P>(iii)  An application in respect of road schemes for which payments totalling £195,000 were made in 1979, and for which payments in 1980 are expected to reach £177,000 has been submitted for approval for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund and will if approved, be in receipt of a grant of approximately £111,000.  The routes involved include Letterkenny/ Pluck Cross (N.13), Bridgend/Pluck Cross (N.13) and Stranorlar/ Letterkenny (N.56).</P>
    <P>There is every reason to believe that future applications from both Governments will also be favourably considered within the resources of the <Col N="544" /> Fund and that the area as a whole will continue to benefit from EEC assistance. Detailed proposals have been put forward by the Commission on measures for inclusion under the Non-Quota section of the Regional Fund but as yet these have not been agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="545" /> for Energy if any monitoring takes place of the calorific heat value of coal; the interest, if any, his Department have in relation to coal in terms of value for money; if any efforts were made to evaluate the comparative values of different fuels; if he is aware of concern in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Energy do not monitor the calorific value of coal or of any other fuel.  The calorific value of imported coal is normally written into the purchasing specification, however.  I am informed by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards that proposals for monitoring the quality of imported coal are being prepared, in consultation with the National Board for Science and Technology.  The institute also tell me that they are prepared to determine, on payment of an appropriate fee by any interested party, the calorific value of all types of fuel including coal,</P>
      <P>All Irish coal importing companies are subject to detailed price control. Each company must submit to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism a detailed price increase application in support of any price increase which they propose to implement.  These applications are considered by the National Prices Commission who make recommendations in each case.  Price increases, where approved, are sanctioned primarily to compensate the coal importing companies for increased costs incurred by them, for example, freight and other external costs as well as internal operating costs.  Details of all cost increases incurred must be documented fully before they are admitted for price compensation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Prices Commission or the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism have not related pricing to a particular standard for coal but in this regard I would point out that the standard of the bulk of coal imported into this country lies between very close bands.  The IIRS and An Foras Forbartha <Col N="546" /> during the past 12 months have made assessments of the value for money of fuels used for domestic purposes. These assessments or rankings of the whole range of fuels have shown that the apparent value for money of the cheaper solid fuels is only realised when the appliances are of high efficiency. This factor is regarded as more important than the normal fluctuation of quality that may be encountered in the coal supplies, within the narrow calorific value bands referred to.</P>
    <P>Concern regarding the quality of coal received over the winter of 1979 stemmed from difficulties in obtaining suitable supplies of a suitable grade of coal for domestic purposes from the United States at relatively short notice, a problem which was accentuated by the steeply increased demand.  The supply position has now largely stabilised and the quality of coal on offer for next winter should give no cause for concern. Questions relating to the price of coal are, of course, a matter for my colleague the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of repeated complaints regarding a company (details supplied); if he will have such complaints investigated; the appropriate action he can take to curb the activities of this company; if there is any evidence on which Garda inquiries could be based; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have received one complaint regarding the activities of the company mentioned.  This has been the subject of protracted correspondence, but I understand that the matter has now been resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has information about any other complaints against the firm I would be glad to have them considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> He may be assured that if there is any evidence to warrant Garda inquiries, appropriate action will be taken.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs has also received complaints about this firm and is now dealing with them.  I would like to stress however that, in this as in many other commercial transactions, it is a matter primarily for the consumer himself to act with sufficient prudence to ensure that his own interests are adequately protected and to sign contracts only with people who have the competence to carry out their obligations properly.  The need for this caution will remain even after the coming into operation of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill now awaiting enactment, and despite any initiatives which may be taken by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
