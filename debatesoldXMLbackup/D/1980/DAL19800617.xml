      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of Deputies and Senators invited to the State reception held at Dublin Castle on 5 June 1980 in honour of Dr. John Armstrong, Archbishop of Armagh; and the number of members invited from each parliamentary party.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be in accordance with established practice, to provide details of the guest lists for State receptions.  I am satisfied that both Houses of the Oireachtas were appropriately represented on the occasion in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would not be too much to ask for the precise figures for each parliamentary party.  Perhaps I am incorrect, but I understand that there was a great imbalance in that the Government party had far in excess of the other two parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach suggested that there was appropriate representation.  Could he tell us what he thinks is appropriate representation from the different parties?  We are not clear what the word means to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that I made sure that all parties in the House and the different interests were represented adequately on that occasion.  I think that this is the first time that this sort of question was ever put down in the House and it is a great pity in regard to this reception, at any rate, that this sort of question should be raised here.  I had no idea that any of the Opposition parties were disturbed in any way about this matter.  If I had known I would have made sure that it would have been avoided on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his statement on a recent television programme (details supplied) in regard to a federal solution to the Northern Ireland problem and the possibility of different sets of social legislative provisions within that context enunciates current Government policy in regard to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy in relation to Northern Ireland is as outlined by me to the House on 29 May last when opening the debate on that occasion. During the course of the television programme concerned in regard to the matter to which the Deputy refers.  I did no more than indicate that in my view a federal arrangement would allow for the possibility of different social legislative provisions applying in the two areas involved if that were considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his proposal regarding two separate sets of legislative programmes in the social sphere was committing his party, the Fianna Fáil Government, for the first time to a two-nations view of the future of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no such proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach elaborate?  What proposal did he make? He did say that he would look favourably at a situation where two separate legislative programmes in the social field could be envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely pointed out that one of the things that made a federal solution attractive to some people was the fact that it would enable different legislative proposals or provisions to apply in the different areas if that were considered necessary.  I did not go any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that his expression of that view and apparent endorsement of it has given rise to widespread concern both in <Col N="700" /> Northern Ireland and here, and that the putting forward of the federal confederate solution not as a means of reassuring the Unionists against any fears they may have, but as a means of maintaining the sectarian character of our two States exemplified here by the Taoiseach's Bill on contraception&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that rather an odd contribution from the Leader of the Opposition to make when in regard to the contraception legislation his party could not make up their minds where they stood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his proposal in this regard represents for the first time an abandonment by us of our aspirations for the full unity of the Irish people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An interview of that sort is not an occasion for laying down policy specifics, but I maintained specifically throughout the interview that our aspiration was for the unity of all the people of Ireland.  I reiterated that on a number of occasions and I have no hesitation in reiterating it here today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the disadvantage&mdash;not the advantage&mdash;of a federal solution, for which there are strong grounds in present circumstances, is that it might fail to produce the interaction between the two parts of the country which could be fruitful in producing a more liberal Ireland?</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach how his view of two sets of proposals that one would be applicable to one community in Ireland, the other would be applicable to another community in Ireland, could possibly be reconciled with what I understood to be Fianna Fáil's long-standing policy and aspiration, that of Tone, of a united Ireland that would cater for Catholic, Protestant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline in respect of all public buildings used by each State body for which he is statutorily responsible to the Dáil, if easy access to such buildings by means of ramps, lifts or otherwise does not exist for persons using wheelchairs; if so, if he will indicate the name and location of each such building; the services provided therein and the plans, if any, to improve the accessibility of the building to persons using wheelchairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The three statutory bodies for which I have responsibility are the National Board for Science and Technology, the Law Reform Commission and An Chomhairle Ealaion.  The premises occupied by the board at Shelbourne Road and by the commission at River House, Chancery Street, have easy access for persons using wheelchairs.  The premises of An Chomhairle Ealaion at 70 Merrion Square, Dublin, have no facilities for such persons at present.  The council hope, however, to acquire a rear access to the building and this would afford the opportunity of remedying the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

I thought I indicated that I would do that myself, in consultation with the Director of the National Gallery, which I think is the normal procedure.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The defendant in this case, who was from Northern Ireland, was charged with a motor taxation offence and sought to have the case conducted in Irish as a legal right.  This was not acceded to by the court and the judge did not agree to the provision of an interpreter. I understand that with the exception of Welsh, which is specifically catered for by the Welsh Language Act, <Col N="707" /> 1967, the language in which court business is conducted in Britain or in Northern Ireland is English but that an interpreter may be provided in particular cases at the discretion of the presiding judge.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be referring to a recent newspaper article to the effect that a British drillship had moved into the Rockall area.  The activity referred to is taking place over 100 miles north west of the Outer Hebrides and is outside an area over which Ireland claims jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I am aware also that in a small counter-designated area off the Irish north west coast certain seismic work is planned by a British company&mdash;the British National Oil Corporation&mdash;in the coming months.  Since this area comes within an Irish designated area, licences from the Minister for Energy would be required before such work is undertaken and I understand that the company have been so informed by the Department of Energy.  The granting of a licence and its terms will be a matter for consideration by that Department when an application is received and the terms of any such licence would, I understand, be in accord with the normal provisions of non-exclusive licences which carry fixed rental fees and the stipulation that all information granted would be submitted to the Minister for Energy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in the case of the current Commission which took office on 5 January 1977 the President was designated by the European Council in July 1976 and consulted with the Governments of the members states in regard to the selection of the other members of the Commission.  It is generally agreed that a similar procedure should <Col N="713" /> be followed on this occasion.  There was an initial exchange of views at the European Council in Venice in the course of which the case for an Irish candidate was put forward.  Further consultations on this subject are to take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Foreign Affairs Council arrived at a solution to the problem of the United Kingdom contribution to the EEC budget at its meeting in Brussels on 29/30 May.  The full text of the agreement is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, under the terms of this agreement, the British net contribution will amount to approximately 609 million European Units of Account (MEUA) (IR£408 million) for 1980 and 730 MEUA (IR£489 million) for 1981. Thus for the two years 1980 and 1981, the UK net contribution to the EEC budget will amount to approximately 1,339 MEUA (IR£879 million)&mdash;a reduction of approximately 2,585 MEUA (IR£1,732 million).  Deputies will appreciate these figures are approximations based on assumption regarding both the overall out-turn of the budget for 1980, and 1981 and on the contributions to those budgets from customs duties, agricultural levies and VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 1982, if a solution through structural change is not achieved, an arrangement <Col N="715" /> along the lines of that for 1980 and 1981 will be made.</P>
    <P>Concurrently with this agreement on the UK budget problem, agreement was reached on the linked issue of farm prices for 1980-81 and related measures. There was also agreement on a set of principles which will form the basis of a common fisheries policy to be agreed not later than 31 January 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I want to pose is whether the Minister can confirm reports in the newspapers that the agreement about the contribution to Britain is dependent on agreement on the common fisheries policy, as is reported today, and that if that is not agreed the British contribution negotiations will be reopened?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises an entirely new element.  As far as we are concerned, and the other eight countries present at the final meeting when a decision was taken on the issues concerned, namely the contribution and the agricultural prices package, at that meeting certain Foreign Ministers went back to their countries <i>ad referendum</i> and their respective countries made decisions. I am referring in particular to the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany.  They announced agreement with the overall package relating to contribution and in regard to the agricultural prices package that had been reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware and as was brought out in the Government statement of 16 May, the decision of the Government to recommend against participation in the Olympic Games was taken in the light of the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan.  This has resulted in a situation <Col N="719" /> where it is not possible to ensure that the established character of the Olympic Games will be upheld.  The Government had hoped to see conditions restored in which the games could take place successfully.  In an effort to achieve this Ireland joined its partners in the Nine in putting forward a proposal which would allow Afghanistan to resume its neutral and non-aligned status.  This would include a withdrawal of foreign troops and an end to foreign interference there.  Unfortunately, this has not yet happened, although there are proposals on the table.</P>
      <P>In all of these events the major concern of the Government is that the current dangerous tensions in international relations should be reduced. This means, first and foremost, that the principles laid down in the UN Charter must be upheld.  As the Government said in their statement of 16 May, it is our hope that this can still be achieved through dialogue and negotiation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government made a decision that because of the number of withdrawals from participation the games had radically changed and, in conjunction with a number of our Community partners, we decided to recommend that our athletes do not participate. We also made it quite clear that, as a free democracy, our athletes were free to go and many of them decided to go.  That is their business.</P>

In co-operation with the Government of Pakistan, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has launched a programme of humanitarian relief, which is expected to cost $72 million in 1980.  In response to an appeal by the UNHCR for international assistance in financing this programme, the Council of Ministers of the Community approved a contribution from Community resources of $17.7 million in financial and food aid.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Our preparations for the Madrid review conference have been under way for some time and will continue until the opening of the main conference in November of this year.  A major part of our preparatory work is being carried out jointly with our partners in the European Community.  In particular we feel that the area of new proposals for improved implementation of the Final Act lends itself to a joint approach by the Nine.  Among other considerations, proposals put forward by the Nine are likely to carry more weight than proposals with a single sponsor.  We are therefore concentrating on working out with our partners a series of proposals which aim at improving, and setting more concrete standards for, implementation of the Final Act.</P>
      <P>In the Basket I area the Nine are considering supporting the French proposal for a conference on disarmament in Europe and in Basket II, proposals on industrial co-operation and economic and commercial information are among those being considered.  The proposals will also address the Basket III areas of human contacts, cultural questions and availability of information, including working conditions of journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nine will press for improvements in the granting of exit visas where, in the case of Soviet Jewish applicants, a reduction in the number of visas granted has been apparent in recent months.  In this connection I am aware of the position of the Rufuzniks and this problem will be addressed in the proposals.  The Final Act contains a number of important provisions relating to cultural and educational matters, including the study of languages, which affect Soviet Jews and numerous other minorities, and the <Col N="726" /> Nine will address these areas also in Madrid.</P>
    <P>The Nine have already carried out a substantial amount of work on these proposals for improved implementation of the Final Act, but the proposals will not be finalised until much nearer the opening date of the conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's long and detailed reply.  In relation to Question No. 20, which has an immediacy about it, have the Government the intention to raise directly with the new Soviet Ambassador here their concern&mdash;if they have concern&mdash;for the plight of the 1,000 or so members of the Refusniks' families?</P>

      <P>As I have previously stated here, Ireland has indicated its support in principle for the French proposal to hold a conference on disarmament in Europe.  In November 1979, during the Irish Presidency of the European Community, the Nine issued a declaration which agreed to take account of the considerations which inspired the French proposal.  We hope that a mandate for the first phase of the conference will be agreed at the CSCE review meeting which will begin in Madrid in November.</P>
      <P>There are other proposals which Ireland is also considering.  Our strong preference however is for a conference on disarmament in Europe as envisaged by France.</P>

      <P>In accordance with existing international law, Ireland claims sole jurisdiction in respect of all mineral and oil rights over the entire extent of the Continental Shelf around our coast and designation orders have been made by the Government in respect of most of this area.  The Continental Shelf of a coastal state is the natural prolongation of its land territory and the definition of the outer limits thereof and the extent to which a coastal state can claim jurisdiction is one of the issues at present under review at the Law of the Sea Conference. I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 22 November 1979 to a question&mdash;see columns 1570-1572 of the Official Report&mdash;relating to the negotiations at the conference which refers to this issue and sets out Ireland's position.</P>
      <P>As well as the question of the outer limits of the shelf there is also the limit which arises in cases where a shelf is a natural prolongation of two or more neighbouring states when it must be delimited between them.  In the case of the delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Ireland and Britain this question is being submitted to an <i>ad hoc</i> international arbitration tribunal.  The questions to be submitted to this tribunal, including the extent of the areas on which it will be asked to adjudicate, are at present under negotiation between ourselves and the British authorities.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to comment now on either the location or extent of these areas or on any of the issues which arise in the negotiations.</P>

      <P>The cost of producing and circulating copies of the Taoiseach's speech to the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis with the February issue of <i>Ireland Today</i> was £2,010.  Copies of the speech were circulated to 18,000 regular recipients of the magazine and to 750 other people <Col N="732" /> abroad.  The publication and circulation, in insert form, of statements and speeches by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on subjects of national and international importance are a regular feature of the magazine. The first speech by the new Taoiseach, dealing with Government policy on several current political, social and economic issues, was clearly important and it was therefore appropriate that people abroad should see it.</P>

      <P>Immediately following the murder of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne the Security Council held a meeting on 18 April at which the President of the Security Council read a statement, agreed following consultations by all members of the council, including the United States.</P>
      <P>In this statement the members of the council expressed shock and outrage at the report received on the attacks on UNIFIL and the cold-blooded murder of peace-keeping soldiers by the <i>de facto</i> forces.

      <P>In his own intervention the representative of the United States condemned the cowardly murder of individuals engaged, at the council's request, in the highest calling of the United Nations, the cause of peace.</P>
      <P>Subsequently on 24 April the council adopted resolution 467 in which <i>inter alia</i>, it reaffirmed its determination to implement its previous resolutions relating to UNIFIL, condemned all actions contrary to the provisions of these resolutions and strongly deplored certain specific acts including those that led to loss of life among UNIFIL personnel.</P>
      <P>The resolution was adopted by 12 votes to O with three abstentions, including the United States.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann and to revise the constituencies for the election of Members to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Constitution requires that the number of Members of Dáil Éireann shall from time to time be fixed by law and that the Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years with due regard to changes in the distribution of the population.  The obligation to revise the constituencies rests on the Oireachtas but, in order to assist the Oireachtas in their task and with a view to putting an end to charges of gerrymandering, the Government appointed an independent commission to advise on the formation of constituencies. The report of the commission was published in April last and the constituencies set out in the Schedule to this Bill are those recommended by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be appropriate for me to draw the attention of the House to two aspects of the revision now proposed.  First, on the recommendation of the commission, the overall membership <Col N="802" /> of the Dáil is being fixed at 166, that is, two less than the maximum number which would be justified, within the constitutional provisions, by the population as ascertained at the 1979 census. The House will be aware that, from 1947 onwards, the practice has been to fix the overall membership at the maximum number permissible within the constitutional limits.  However, it will be noted that the new Dáil with 166 Members will be the largest since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The second aspect I should like to draw attention to is the question of the population-Deputy ratio in the individual constituencies.  At each revision of constituencies since the High Court ruling in the O'Donovan case in 1961, the Budd judgement, the variation in the population-Deputy ratio from constituency to constituency was restricted to 1,000 persons&mdash;or about 5 per cent&mdash;above or below the national average.  In the scheme of constituencies now before the House, the variation from the national average exceeds 5 per cent in the case of five consituencies. The variation ranges from +6.28 per cent in Carlow-Kilkenny to -6.42 per cent in Mayo east.  Deputies will find a discussion of this matter in Chapter 3 of the commission's report.  It will be noted that the commission came to the conclusion that there is no rigid tolerance level and that the test in every case must be the one referred to in the Supreme Court judgment in the case of the electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961, namely, whether &ldquo;failure to maintain the ratio between the number of members for each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention (of the relevant part of the Constitution)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to comment in any detail in relation to the individual constituencies specified in the Schedule to the Bill.  The scheme of constituencies proposed is largely a county-based one involving only three breaches of county boundaries.  I am sure Deputies will regard this aspect as particularly <Col N="803" /> satisfactory.  Details of the constituencies were published in April last in the report of the commission which was circulated to all Deputies.  A set of maps illustrating the proposed constituencies has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library and I have also arranged to have a set of maps on a smaller scale provided for each Deputy and Senator.  In regard to the sections of the Bill, these contain the standard provisions usual in a Bill of this kind including a specification of the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle may be returned unopposed at the next general election.</P>
    <P>This is an historic occasion in that for the first time the proposals for the revision of Dáil constituencies have been formulated by an independent commission. In entrusting the task to a commission we are following the precedent set in relation to the constituencies for the 1979 European Assembly elections and fulfilling the explicit undertaking given by my party before the last general election that an independent commission would be set up to deal with constituency boundaries.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like, on behalf of the Government, to express appreciation of the manner in which the commission have done their job and to place on the record of the House our thanks to the members of the commission, Mr. Justice Walsh; Mr. Healy, the distinguished Clerk of this House, and Mr. Meagher, the Secretary of my own Department.  I am sure that the entire House will wish to be associated with this expression of appreciation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Bill which has just been introduced represents the sixth revision of constituencies since the foundation of the State.  The constituencies were drawn up in 1923 immediately after the State was founded.  They were revised in 1935, 1947, 1961, 1969, 1974 and this year by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is unique in that it is the first such Bill which has been influenced to a <Col N="804" /> considerable extent by the work of an <i>ad hoc</i> independent commission presided over by a distinguished judge of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Walsh, the distinguished clerk of this House, Mr. Healy, and the man holding the very responsible position of Secretary of the Department of the Environment.  I should like to join with the Minister in tendering the best thanks of this House and all parties in it to that very learned independent commission for the way they did their work within the terms of reference and guidelines entrusted to them.  Their work was carried out in an expeditious manner and in a manner that should bring great credit to commissions. Sometimes we find that when a commission is appointed things drag on and on indefinitely.  That did not happen here.</P>
    <P>I shall make reference to the work of the commission and its terms of reference later.  The Bill is also unique in that it is the first such Bill which has not been embroiled in a bitter controversy and spate of political charges and counter-charges from the very first day on which it was published.  The fact that it has the blessing and benediction of an independent commission must play a big part in that.  I said that the Bill was influenced to a considerable extent by the work of the commission.  The commission's influence was limited because they had to work within the terms of reference and the guidelines given to them by the Government.  These terms of reference and guidelines also influenced the terms of the Bill.  That cannot be denied.  The commission had to work within those terms of reference and make their report within them.</P>
    <P>The learned commission had to have regard to the Constitution and the relevant provisions of the Constitution which regulate elections to Dáil Éireann. The commission, in making their report, were directed to take account of the fact that the membership of Dáil Éireann should not be less than 146 or more than 168.  They were also directed to have regard to geographical considerations in that the breaching of county boundaries <Col N="805" /> should be avoided if possible and that larger-seat constituencies should preferably be situated in areas of greater population density.  The commission were asked to take account of other well-established characteristics in the formation of constituencies such as clearly-defined natural features and the retention of the traditional patterns of three-seat, four-seat, and five-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the commission on the way they tackled those delicate terms of reference and the liberal interpretation applied to the relevant constitutional provisions relating to the drawing up of the constituencies and to the judicial decisions made on those constitutional provisions.  The minimum number of Deputies, having regard to our population, is 164 and the maximum permitted is 168.  The commission decided to recommend 166 Deputies and in doing so felt that that number would, among other things, preserve county boundaries better than any other number. The commission breached county boundaries in the minimum number of cases possible.  From reading the report of the commission it is obvious that the members of it felt somewhat inhibited by the direction that larger-seat constituencies should preferably be situated in areas of greater population density.  That fact was referred to on a number of occasions in the report.  However, the commission, as can be seen from one or two decisions, did not feel firmly bound by that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The commission showed a delicacy in dealing with the recommendation that larger-seat constituencies be in built-up areas and, by implication, that the three-seat constituencies should be in sparsely-populated areas.  The commission also showed a liberal outlook in interpreting the Constitution and judicial decisions in relation to the population-Deputy ratio. Since the O'Donovan case went on appeal to the Supreme Court one school of thought held firmly that a tolerance of 5 per cent only was permitted and that the national average could not be departed from, upwards or downwards, by more than 5 per cent.  Another school of <Col N="806" /> thought held that the decision of the Supreme Court meant that a departure of 5 per cent from the national average was acceptable and that what was not acceptable had not been decided.</P>
    <P>The commission took into consideration the following section of the judgment of the Supreme Court:</P>
    <P>To justify the Court in holding that the sub-section has been infringed it must, however, be shown that the failure to maintain the ratio between the number of Members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention of the sub-clause.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather from the commission's report, it was held that the decision of the Supreme Court did not bind the commission to a 5 per cent tolerance. It appears that the commission was only bound by the extract from the Constitution which I quoted.  In applying that interpretation the commission moved upwards from the national average to between 6 and 7 per cent and it moved downwards from the national average to between 6 and 7 per cent.  The population-Deputy ratio in Carlow-Kilkenny is 6.28 per cent above the national average while the population-Deputy ratio in East Mayo is 6.27 per cent below the national average.  In that case it can be said that the commission departed from the national average by as much as 12 per cent or more.  In doing so the commission gave themselves great leeway to preserve county boundaries. There is a school of thought that, had the commission moved 1 per cent more, it might not have breached any county boundary.  The change represents a big improvement.</P>
    <P>I have laid great emphasis on the directive that larger-seat constituencies should preferably be situated in areas of greater population density.  I make no apology for saying that that term of reference was given to the commission because Fianna Fáil thought that such a move would benefit them.  That is <Col N="807" /> clear.  We know that a three-seat constituency is the most beneficial to a party where that party have a majority in the constituency, because it will give it two seats out of three.  It is fortunate that this country is not divided on a sectarian basis or politically on a class basis but we know that for historic reasons, whether it goes back to the civil war or before it, or for some other reasons, there are parts of the country where one party gets a greater share of representation and of the vote than its national average.  That applies to all parties.  For example, on the eastern seaboard the Fianna Fáil Party normally get&mdash;it has become less of a certainty&mdash;a larger proportion of the vote than its national average.  The contrary is the case in, say, the city of Dublin where the last Euro election and the local elections showed that the Fine Gael Party got the greater share of the votes in that area.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that this particular term of reference was drawn up bearing that in mind because a three-seat constituency benefits the party with the largest vote in the constituency because that party will get two out of three seats, and where a party is in danger of not getting more than 50 per cent of the vote or thereabouts, the best thing for it is to have a four-seater where the party will break even.  The particular term of reference was drawn up bearing those elementary and fundamental facts in mind and to that extent the commission was not a free agent.  No doubt this is a better method of drawing up constituencies than entrusting to the political head of the Department.  Of the six revisions, including the present one, Fianna Fáil have been in charge on five occasions.  I think a guideline should have been included in the terms of reference stipulating that no major area should have a uniform pattern of three-, four- or five-seat constituencies, in other words there should be a mixture.  That is why I complimented the commission for its delicate handling of the terms of reference that I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> It was very conscious of this because time and again it has come back to it in its report.  In future cases the terms of reference should be drawn up with the direction that no area of the country should be confined to any given number of seats, that there should be a mix right across the board.  That would make the commission's terms of reference much more meaningful and give more independence.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes said that we have too many TDs and there has been some criticism of increasing the number of seats by 18 on this occasion.  Unless the Constitution is changed the number of seats will have to be increased from 148 to 164, by 16 seats.  Since the foundation of the State we have gone for the lower qualifying figure, one seat for each 20,000 of the population.  That was the stipulation in the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann as well as in the 1937 Constitution.  While the population was decreasing&mdash;and it was decreasing for most of that time&mdash;that presented no problem.  Now, happily, the population is increasing and if the population continues to increase it may be necessary to re-examine that policy in the future.</P>
    <P>As will be seen in this Bill the Commission and the Government have opted for two less than the maximum number and to that extent it is somewhat of a change.  Until such time as we have a better ombudsman system it is better to err on the side of having too many TDs than not enough.  We do not look like getting the ombudsman system needed in the near future, if we are to go on the Bill introduced by the Government which is really a non-event, an ombudsman Bill without any teeth.  Until we have a proper ombudsman system and proper citizens' advice bureaux it is better to have too many TDs rather than not enough because TDs find themselves over the years and at present discharging ombudsman duties and citizens' advice bureaux duties.  Until these requirements are otherwise met the higher number of Deputies can be well justified.</P>
    <P>Further, in a situation where&mdash;this is no fault of this side of the House&mdash;the present Fianna Fáil Party for reasons <Col N="809" /> best known to themselves have eaten into the number of private Deputies by creating 30 office holders, the number of Deputies left to do the work of a Deputy from a constituency point of review is reduced.  Somebody might say I do not know what I am talking about and might ask whether Ministers of State do constituency work on a subsidised basis with State cars and so on, but I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that because they are appointed Ministers it must mean that in theory at least they are withdrawn to some extent from constituency work and that therefore there are fewer Deputies to serve the people.</P>
    <P>The life of Dáil Éireann, according to the Constitution, is such term as may be regulated by law subject to a maximum term of seven years.  Since the State was founded the Legislature have always opted for five years.  That has been the time for which Dáil Éireann is elected.  Unlike some other countries, notably Germany and the USA, Dáil Éireann may be dissolved at any time and a general election held by a Taoiseach who still enjoys the confidence of the Dáil, which means that he has not been defeated.  I am not putting this forward as the view of my party.  Is it a good thing to have uncertainty hanging over the Dáil and the country that there may be a general election at any time?</P>
    <P>This Government were elected with a majority of 20 and now enjoy a majority of 18.  They still have two years to go, but we are virtually in an election situation. The people throughout the country are speculating and the media are speculating.  I do not wish to appear to want to prolong the life of the Government because, like all the other people throughout the country, particularly those who were hoodwinked by the manifesto, the sooner we get rid of them the better it will be for the country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It deals with constituencies, but the life of the Dáil is near enough to that to make it relevant.  We should think whether it is better for the country to elect a Dáil for a certain period rather than an uncertain period.  We do not call it election fever until an election is actually declared.  I suppose we could call it an election bug which develops sometime before an election and that is not good for the country.  An election could be called for other reasons.  If a Government fall, which could have happened here before Christmas, an election is held immediately.  Some people would argue that, if such a situation arises, it is better to clear the air rather than try to continue operating.</P>
      <P>We have this Bill based, for the first time, on the report of an <i>ad hoc</i> commission. Their report was influenced to a large extent by the terms of reference they got and also, to some considerable extent, by the very solid and commonsense approach of the commission.  We hear a lot of talk about amending the Constitution, scrapping it and having a new Constitution.  We should think about making this commission a constitutional provision.  That should only be done if the terms of reference agreed by all parties in the House are also written into the Constitution.  If we are really anxious to have an absolutely fair and unimpeachable system of drawing up constituencies, that is the way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest decision the commission took was that they would not be bound by a 5 per cent tolerance.  They interpreted the Constitution in a liberal way <Col N="811" /> and came up with this 6½ per cent above and 6½ per cent below.  I congratulate them on that.  The most regrettable feature about the commission was that their terms of reference were drawn up by the Fianna Fáil Government in a way which was bound to be favourable to Fianna Fáil if voting followed its previous pattern.  As the former Deputy Paddy Burke used to say &ldquo;great things are happening in our time&rdquo;.  Most extraordinary things are happening in our time and I believe the manifesto on which the people were invited to vote in the last election was the most extraordinary thing of all.  I believe that patterns I have been speaking about will not be as important in the future as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>This Bill is acceptable to Fine Gael. That does not mean that the Bill will satisfy every Member of the House.  I am sure it does not meet with the approval of every member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I hardly think it meets with the approval of every member of the Fine Gael Party.  The same can probably be said about the Labour Party.  I am sure, no matter how perfect the Bill was, it would be bound to be against the interests of some of the 148 outgoing Deputies.  That would happen even if the Bill were drawn up on absolutely perfect guidelines.  It is acceptable to the Fine Gael Party but that does not mean that members of the Fine Gael Party have not reservations about certain constituencies and certain areas in it.  From the all-over party point of view the biggest and principal reservation that I have is this one about the direction of small constituencies in the west of Ireland and large constituencies in Dublin.  We will have more to say about that when we reach Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said already, this is an unique occasion.  It is the first occasion on which a commission who were not motivated politically recommended to the House a constituency Bill which the Government have to bring before the House.  We all understand that <Col N="812" /> this House is entitled to change that constituency Bill if it so desires.  However, I consider that the people who drew up this Bill did an excellent job.  I would like to add my voice to those congratulating Mr. Justice Walsh, Mr. Healy and Mr. Meagher and I would add to those names the people who really had to do the spadework in the Minister's Department. The Minister must know of these and Mr. Turpin and Mr. Sexton would be two people who would have an extraordinary knowledge of constituencies and constituency drawing.  I believe they helped to bring a very satisfactory Bill before this House, satisfactory in so far as we all believe that those who drew it up did a fair job.  What the result will be and whether it will suit everybody are different matters entirely.</P>
      <P>It is the job of this House to pass constituency Bills which when they become law will ensure that the most popular party or parties or groups in any area will be elected to this House.  As the result of a Bill which I brought into this House, the last general election in 1977 did exactly that.  I can never understand why there was so much dissatisfaction and complaint from people about it.  It was not my intention to put Fianna Fáil into power but if the people wanted to put them in, then it was the job of the then Government to ensure that they got the opportunity of doing it.  They got that opportunity and they put Fianna Fáil into power.  I was amused particularly with the press who seemed to be terribly disappointed with what had been done and they felt that in some peculiar way I and the Government should have gerrymandered it in such a way that a different result would have been produced. That is not our job.  I have grave suspicions that efforts to gerrymander in that way were made on previous occasions. Maybe I am being unfair to predecessors of mine.  Maybe I am unfair to those who drew up previous constituency legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most thankless jobs a Minister can get is the drawing up of Constituency Bills, because not alone members of his own party but members <Col N="813" /> of every party in the House and outside if they get the opportunity will attempt to prove that a point of view which they hold is very important and that the constituency Bill could not be prepared unless there is an input from them to it.  I assure the House that I got a lot more representations from Fianna Fáil than I did from my own party or from Fine Gael the last time.  Maybe that is why it turned out as it did and maybe I listened too much to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We produced a Bill and it did get the results that we saw.  This Bill before us is being drawn up, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, under very tight terms of reference.  The people who drew up the Bill invited the opinions of the general public and I am sure that they got opinions from people who were in a position to offer such opinions to them. They did not get an opinion from me because I did not think that it was any function of mine to give it.  I felt that the experts who had advised me would also be in a position to advise those who were drawing it up now.  They got a lot of advice as to what should be done from the list of people, from people who would have an input and a very good idea of what points of view to put, and from the usual quota of quare fellas.  I saw the list of people who had made representations. Some of the names on the list gave me a good laugh because they were people who would have the idea that a constituency should be drawn up around their own back garden and the quota should be one, themselves, because some of them would find it extremely difficult to get anybody other than themselves to vote for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a relatively short time the commission who were set up by the Government&mdash;and all credit to the Government for setting up the commission, at least it is one promise that they kept and they did not keep too many others&mdash;brought in a result in a relatively short time and the result was found in the main to be <Col N="814" /> satisfactory.  Of course everybody is not satisfied.  No doubt people in this House and ambitious people outside will find some reason to point out that things have been done deliberately to keep them out of the House.  I do not think that this was ever done, even when the politicians were themselves drawing up the constituencies. On one occasion it was alleged that I tried deliberately to exclude somebody by drawing a constituency boundary within a few doors of where he lived.  I assure the House that I did not know that it happened.  I did not know where the man lived, although I knew that he existed.  It was not my intention to do that and I am glad to say that he was returned to the House either because of or in spite of what was done.</P>
    <P>The number selected here to represent the people is the middle one.  It could have been 164 or 168 and they took 166. Again I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick. Despite those who claim that people returned to this House should confine themselves to legislation, all of the men and women coming in here, whether they are Ministers, Ministers of State or ordinary Deputies, are ombudsmen, and the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle must do their fair share in that.  They come in here and have to bring the grievances of constituents to people in authority and until there is somebody to substitute, somebody who can do that job well, this will continue and it is right that it should continue.  I do not agree with those who say that it is wrong that they should spend their time here.  It is a notable fact that it is not those who come into this House and spend hours and hours debating legislation who head the poll at the next election. It is those who write the most letters and make the most representations. I suppose there is a moral in that for all of us and we take notice of it.</P>
    <P>The position about the drawing up of the constituencies is that the commission who were drawing up the constituencies had one recommendation with regard to county boundaries.  I also was anxious to ensure that county boundaries where possible should not be breached.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> Therefore, I know that it was not an easy job to do what they did.  I give them great credit for having the courage to break with tradition on one or two fronts, one that has already been mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick with regard to the number above and below the national average, and the second with regard to the complete break with the general idea of how a constituency should be drawn up.  It is possible that by making a couple of six-seaters instead of five-seaters they could have changed the whole face of the new Electoral Bill. Their terms of reference more or less told them that they were not to go for six-seaters, that they should stick to the traditional numbers, and they did so.</P>
    <P>There is a school of thought which suggests that by introducing a higher number of Members per constituency there is a danger that people who should not be returned to Parliament will be returned.  I do not hold with that, for two reasons.  Firstly, I believe that if the public want to elect somebody to Parliament they are entitled to do so whether we think they are desirable people or not. Secondly, most people who come into that category are those who are only known and supported in a particularly small area.  Even though the constituency is being made bigger and they are given a bigger chance because there is an extra seat or two, in fact it makes it more difficult for them to be elected. They have to get support over a very much wider area.  Indeed, it is well known that somebody who wants to be elected to Dáil Éireann must have at least a quota of support in every ballot box, to put it very bluntly.  If they have not that, they are wasting their time and their own or somebody else's money in attempting to come in here.</P>
    <P>The general trend of support for political parties here is such that changing the size of a constituency in the rural areas does not matter so much.  The whole kernel of the trouble&mdash;if trouble it is&mdash;is here in this city.  If the party in power are able&mdash;as they were the last time&mdash;to get two out of three, it gives <Col N="816" /> them a very substantial amount of support. The number of Deputies returned for a city of this size ensures that it is extremely difficult throughout the whole country to change the representation enough to alter the position.  If, however, as has happened now, there is a five-seater, they would need to get three out of five.  I do not think Fianna Fáil would be too happy looking for three out of five in Dublin at the present moment.  Like some of the Fine Gael people and possibly some of the Labour people, there are I am quite sure, a number of Fianna Fáil people who would not be happy with five seats.  Many of those who were returned in the last election&mdash;who were able, because of the programme which Fianna Fáil had put forward, to come in here and get that extra seat&mdash;feel that within the next year or, at most, the next two years they will be saying goodbye to this place and will only see it again from the top of a bus.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts of life, but the decision to have a commission recommending to the Government the type of constituencies which should be set up was an excellent idea.  Again, while I am speaking about buses, perhaps that is a bus which we missed, because it was also the decision of the previous Government. They had intended, if returned, to set up a commission for the purpose of drawing up the constituencies for the next election. Most certainly I should not look forward to the type of pressure which a Minister would have to suffer attempting to draw up constituency proposals which would please everybody.  Indeed, there were times when I felt that it was possible to close one's eyes and see there every road, lane and house in the country marked out clearly.  It was the usual practice before my time for a particular political party drawing up constituencies to consult the faithful in every area.  Like an elimination contest in regard to football and hurling, they would bring in parishes and then the representatives of the groups together would come along at county level and then at provincial level and so on.  I understand that something similar was done.  It was claimed that one particular Minister for Local Government <Col N="817" /> was able at any particular time to put his hand down on a parish and say that there were so many Fianna Fáil votes there, or that the percentage of Fianna Fáil votes was so much and therefore that must go one way or the other.</P>

      <P>It would be quite simple and a much easier job now.  The Minister's hand would be going down very much less often than it was.  Quite honestly, unless the man were a genius, he could not have done it and no effort may have been made to do it.  It is very difficult to do things like that.</P>
      <P>The drawing up of a constituency plan for the whole country depends on the expertise of civil servants who will count, not the people who are likely to vote one way or the other, but the actual number of people living in a particular constituency area.  I thought that the Minister might have referred to it because it is a fact that is not too well known.  It is not voters that affect the size of the constituency; it is, in fact, people.  That is one of the reasons why Mr. Justice Budd's judgment might possibly not be as strong as it appears to be because there could be areas where the number of people without votes could be great.  However, taking it all in all, a very commendable effort has been made by the people who drew up this recommendation, which has been converted by the Minister for the Environment into a Bill before the House.  I cannot, for the life of me, see why there should be any delay about having the matter put to the House and to the Seanad, to clear the decks and give the Taoiseach the opportunity of finding out whether or not our people support him in the policies which he is at present attempting to operate, or lack of policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief in my expression of opinion on this constituency commission report and the Bill <Col N="818" /> now before Dáil Éireann.  Possibly, a little bit of history is being made here today in the sense that it appears that all parties are accepting this independent commission's report.  Words of praise have been expressed to the three people in charge of this commission&mdash;Mr. Justice Walsh, Mr. Gerald Meagher and Mr. Michael J. Healy.  As far as I am concerned, however, they will get no Christmas cards from me.  Again, as far as I am concerned, they have made a total job of pulling asunder the constituency to which I have been elected since 1964, putting part of it into Roscommon and a larger slice in with West Galway.  I find myself living in East Galway with neighbours in Roscommon and having to decide to stand for election in West Galway.  I am not the only person to find myself in that position in that constituency.  I could contend that what has been done is fair in the sense that the commission did not take into consideration the location of existing politicians.  In an almost totally rural area, such as I represented in the past, I contend there should be three-seaters, particularly in rural areas thinly populated.  Here one must be mindful that a TD's work entails much travelling and, as was expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick, the lack of an ombudsman in this country means that a TD finds himself, as I have found since I was first elected in 1964, playing the role of endeavouring to get for his constituents their rightful entitlements.  That is the system as it operates here, even more so under the present administration and particularly since the addition of the new Ministers of State, who are manipulating decisions made in Departments and channelling them out to a certain section of their own party.</P>
      <P>I must refer to one aspect of this system, again pertaining to the role of the TD.  The Minister present has two Ministers of State, one of whom is named Connolly.  A cousin of mine who bought a house in Galway sought a grant and received a nice letter from the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, informing her that the grant was being paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputy Molloy was not notified of the decision.  Were it not for the fact that I put down a parliamentary question it never would have come out at all.  That is the role of the TD under the present system.  I never envisaged TDs in general in that particular role but it is our job to act and work on behalf of our constituents.</P>
      <P>I am personally knifed in this division and, as far as anybody in Country Galway is concerned, it is a most unnatural division.  It is not suitable to anybody geographically.  The commission say in regard to Galway:</P>
      <P>The 8 seats allocated to Galway could be arranged in two 4-seat constituencies or in a 3-seater and a 5-seater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They decided in favour of the three-seater and five-seater taking in Galway city, a large rural area south-east of Galway and, of course, the Connemara area west of Galway, making it a five-seater. People who belonged in the Galway electoral area, as distinct from the new West Galway constituency, on the north-eastern side of Galway city&mdash;here I am talking about electors in general&mdash;expressed the opinion that they found it difficult to identify with a lot of people they did not know, that is, for council election purposes.  Now a line has been drawn which reminds me of what Deputy Tully was saying a moment ago when he spoke about every village, crossroads, boreen and so on. Now a line has been drawn from Caherlistrane along by Claretuam, Corofin, up into Athenry.  Everything west of that line, taking in Gort and that country, all that area that was formally part of East Galway, now forms part of the West Galway constituency.  Indeed, there are people in that area who can readily identify with West Galway and others who cannot.  Incidentally, in the area now taken in as part of West Galway there are on the register at present somewhere in the region of 13,000 to 14,000 voters.  Then between 5,000 <Col N="820" /> and 6,000 voters have been taken from Glenamaddy, Creggs, Williamstown and Ballymore areas and put in with County Roscommon.  That affects me personally. Possibly there are other people who would like to express an opinion on that subject but who, possibly because of the positions they hold and so that it would appear there may be total silence from the Fianna Fáil Party on this Bill, are prevented from so doing.</P>
    <P>The people in that area cannot identify with County Roscommon at all.  The county boundary is something one associates more with the Gaelic Athletic Association.  Traditionally one was Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, Clare or whatever, a very definite identification with one's country.  In constituency revisions effected in the past a part of County Roscommon was brought in with West Galway to form a three-seater which was then known as North Galway while at the same time another part of County Roscommon near Ballinasloe was brought in with Clare/Galway.  Now the reverse situation obtains.  If they had taken the part of Roscommon that was in with Galway before and put it in again, electors would say: &ldquo;It was there before anyway&rdquo;.  Now a part of Galway that never looked to anybody other than Galway representatives is amalgamated with Roscommon.  Those people find it very difficult to identify with Roscommon and Roscommon politicians.  Indeed the part of Galway that has been included in Roscommon is too small to allow a representative of any party that might stand for election there any chance of political success.  Their chances of a seat in this House are rather limited.  Possibly nobody would be foolish enough to stand for election there.  I suppose most of us are foolish anyway from time to time but whether or not we are, those who fail are an awful lot more foolish than the fellows who make it.  I am not satisfied with the way these boundaries were revised because they hurt me a lot politically.  The commission tried to be fair but they made a very big mistake, although maybe it was not really a mistake.</P>
    <P>Members of the commission were independent <Col N="821" /> and nobody can complain about that.  When ex-Deputy Boland and Deputy Tully revised the boundaries they were the bosses and had to take a great deal of abuse from everybody. Everybody looked at their position geographically and decided if he or she had been adversely affected by this report.  The members of the commission will not be getting any Christmas cards from me because as far as I am concerned they made a botch of Galway.</P>
    <P>Deputies should express their opinions on this Bill.  A few Deputies like myself will object to this legislation on a personal basis and others may say that it was a bad job, although I think they did a good job.  Because of the change in population over the past few years we had to have the boundaries revised but if the population continues to increase, it will not be too long before we have another revision.  Then new members will be appointed to the commission to do this job and it is possible they will make a botch of it.  Therefore, it is necessary for Members of this House to express an opinion on this Bill and if necessary to put down amendments.</P>
    <P>I am not putting down an amendment on this Bill but on future Bills it may be necessary to put down amendments because the commission members may not know their jobs as well as the members who drew up this report.  If I put down an amendment and it were accepted, it would leave this legislation open to a great number of amendments, with the result that the boundaries drawn up by the independent commission would be tampered with so much that they could no longer be said to have been those decided by the commission.</P>
    <P>I accept this Bill, although I am not happy with what has been done with the new constituency known as Galway-West. In 1964 I was elected in the Kinvara area and I now look forward to representing the people of Galway city and west of the city.</P>

      <P>I will not necessarily follow the same pattern as the spokesman for my party.  The commission's <Col N="822" /> terms of reference were to advise and report on the formation of constituencies for the elected Members of Dáil Eireann.  They were told to advise and report but the silence and the fear to speak on this legislation makes me afraid.  This is very bad because it implies that when we set up a commission we will have a fear complex about challenging their recommendations.  This is not the first of this type of commission although I hope it is the last.  The report of such a commission should come before an all-party committee.  I have been on all-party committees and they debated reports and if changes were necessary, they were made in an orderly way.</P>
      <P>I am apprehensive at the way this Bill is being put through the House.  I do not think it is good for democracy.  In my view the House is washing its hands of its responsibility to legislate.  When we come up against controversial or touchy legislation, or legislation that may be seen to give the Government of the day an advantage, do we say we cannot make a decision because it would be unfair, or do we say we should not be seen to do this but that we should give it to a commission?  The commission are told to advise and report but when the report is submitted we are afraid to make our views known with the result that their recommendations in the form of legislation are presented to this House and passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the role of the TD as the general factotum in the constituency and taking from him his right to legislate.  This is very serious.  I hope this does not gain any great momentum because it is important that this House draws up legislation, discusses it and comes to decisions.  If either side of this House brought the commission's report in the form of a Bill, the Opposition would be roaring across the floor about the unfair way this legislation was gerrymandered, or Sylvester-mandered or Barrett-mandered.  The hypocrisy annoys me.  If such a scheme were devised by the Government, there is no doubt that this debate would continue <Col N="823" /> for weeks.  Every constituency would be looked at, examined with a fine tooth comb and accusation after accusation hurled across the floor.</P>
    <P>I am not casting aspersions on the commission.  They were given a job and did it well.  I am blaming the House for giving them the job because the principle is wrong.  Whether jobs are thankless or otherwise we are elected to do them and if we in Parliament cannot trust ourselves to do these jobs, no wonder the general public would not have faith in us. We must have confidence and trust in one another in dealing with this type of legislation.  Apparently we have not this trust in ourselves because we have given the job to a third party and their report is accepted because to reject or change it would be seen to reflect on the independence of the commission.  I must hark back to the terms of reference of the commission and say that in my view it is the prerogative of this House to fine comb this legislation and make decisions on it.  Our job is to examine proposed legislation and to put down amendments when necessary.  No three people have the preponderance of knowledge about these matters.  They carry out their task to the best of their ability in the fairest way but that does not mean that it is right.  This House is failing miserably in its obligations.</P>
    <P>There is nothing revolutionary or sensational in the Bill because most of the constituencies can be kept within the confines of a county and not many changes were necessary.  The changes which were necessary mainly concerned areas in and around cities.  Deputy Donnellan spoke about Galway and there certainly seemed to be problems for him and others.  I have no doubt that had this Bill been approached by an all-party committee such matters could have been examined in an objective way.  However, a paralysis of fear gripped Members of the House and they could not be seen to make changes or to do anything at all. That attitude does not bode well for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> Some weeks ago I travelled by train to Cork City with another Deputy and he pointed out several farmhouses miles from the city which were part of his constituency. It did not seem to make sense that an urban constituency should stretch so many miles into the country. The city areas will not suffer because they will be electing city Deputies but the rural area will suffer because these Deputies will not be <i>au fait</i> with rural problems.</P>
    <P>We have heard much pious talk about the inner city area of Dublin.  The south side of the inner city has been carved up three ways.  The elected representatives will come from a far bigger area of the outer city and consequently the inner city will not be seen to be represented. People living there will not be able to exert the same pressure on public representatives. I make this point because I am concerned about the inner city.  There has been talk about taking into account natural boundaries and communities and had this been a consideration in this case the inner city representation could have been preserved and Deputies could have been elected to work in the interests of these communities.  I do not wholly blame the commission because they would not be aware of the tightness of the inter-related communities in these areas whose common bond is survival. These areas being fragmented, their chances of survival are lessened.  This is very sad because all their lives these communities have been fighting uphill battles.  It is only in the years since the Coalition came into power that we have seen a positive policy for the development of the inner city but that commitment seems to be on the wane.  People living in this historic part of the city will have to struggle to find out who represents them.  Will the representatives be as conscientious as they might be?  Will they have a commitment to a small area they represent or will they always look towards the large part of the constituency? Human nature being what it is, I do not think there is much doubt about the answer.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the House an example <Col N="825" /> of what I have in mind.  A block of flats in the James's Street area is divided down the middle.  One half on the western side will be in the same area as Clonee on the Meath border while the other half of the block will be put in with St. Peter's Road in Walkinstown, the other end of the county.  Perhaps it was felt that the terms of reference were for larger constituencies but other factors also had to be taken into account.  All of these matters should be discussed in an all-party committee.  We set up such committees to deal with other Bills and perhaps it is not too late for the Minister to consider an all-party committee for this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think that suggestion will be adopted.  There seems to be some kind of paralysis or fear about commenting on reports of committees. What I am saying here is my personal view, not the party's view.  I think that criticism should be voiced about legislation before this House.  If we are going to hand over our responsibilities to commissions and meekly accept their reports without comment it will be a sad day for democracy.  I oppose commissions.  I do not think they are a good idea.  We are the elected representatives and if we have not the courage to do our job we should get out.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about a gerrymander and a &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo; but elections have disproved that myth.  The last election proved it beyond all doubt because Fianna Fáil got their largest majority. The Irish people will make their own decision on the basis of what they think right.  We should not be spineless when we are considering legislation that might be unpopular.  I have no doubt that if the Government had thought about setting up a commission to deal with the question of contraception they would have done so.  In that way they could have washed their hands of responsibility and could have put the blame on the commission.</P>
    <P>We should not drift along in a lazy fashion.  It is much easier to get somebody else to make a decision and if something goes wrong that person can <Col N="826" /> be blamed.  However, that is not a responsible attitude and it is not one that should be adopted by this House.  We should not allow any erosion of the powers of this House but I am afraid that is happening.  Whatever way the lines are drawn we cannot influence or change people's attitude.  I do not know what all the fuss was about when discussing this independent commission. There was an attitude that it could be tinkered with to the advantage of a political party but that is not on.</P>
    <P>The commission did a good job within their terms of reference and I have no criticism of them.  I believe they acted in the way they were told to act and they used discretion with regard to the figure of 5 per cent.  This was a breakthrough. The 5 per cent is a restrictive measure. Every time a census is taken we have to split up the constituencies.  We should look at this area and we should arrange to have constituencies redrawn every ten years or so.</P>
    <P>The redrawing of constituencies is not new to me and I have had to move house on at least three occasions because of the redrawing of the boundaries.  I do not complain as that is one of the hazards of political life.  I regret that we did not set up a special committee to look at the report of the commission and to come to agreement about whether or not it should be changed in the interests of the constituents.  Perhaps it would not be changed but we should not set a precedent that will force us to abide by any commission's proposals, whether we feel they are in the interests of the people or not, without a debate.  A commission's proposals are not unalterable and we should not be afraid to set up a special all party committee to look at such proposals in future.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister wants to have this Bill passed before the summer recess but if that is what the Minister wants, obviously there will not be time to set up an all-party committee to deal with this.  However, I appeal to the Minister to consider that point.  This would show that we are prepared to objectively examine reports and advice <Col N="827" /> from commissions.  I am not being personal about this because I am quite happy with my constituency but I earnestly appeal to the Minister to consider setting up an all-party committee because we should not give the impression that a commission when set up has the last word.</P>

      <P>The Bill is necessary and, having regard to the increase in population, it is undoubtedly desirable.  People in both urban and rural areas are entitled to full representation in this House.  This House is the only medium through which the public can express their opinion through their elected representatives.  I have been in this House during the passage of quite a number of electoral Bills which dealt with constituency boundaries.  Looking back at the official reports it can be clearly seen that there has always been a very loud expression of opinion from both sides of the House about the right to fix constituency boundaries.  When Deputy Boland was Minister for Local Government he introduced such legislation here and it found approval with some and disapproval with others.  There were allegations and counter allegations that there were suspicious motives behind every line of that legislation. When Deputy Tully as Minister for Local Government redrew the constituencies, charges were made that Deputy Tully was fixing constituency boundaries to suit himself and his political party and the Government of which he was a member.  In the light of the serious criticisms and charges made in this House in relation to fixing the boundaries and constituencies, what course was left open?  The only course was to appoint an independent commission to make recommendations to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This commission was set up.  Most of us who are Members of the House have long knowledge of every member of that commission.  They were asked to submit a report and recommendation in accordance with the evidence of population both urban and rural and what they <Col N="828" /> thought would be an impartial and fair recommendation in relation to Dáil constituencies. Every single member of that commission can rightly be described as having no direct political interest and as a man of supreme integrity.</P>
    <P>If I were asked to express an opinion I would favour a majority of three-seat constituencies in order to give the best possible type of representation to people in the smaller type constituency.  I have been a member of a five-seat constituency and the one I have the honour to represent has not been changed one iota since the foundation of the State. Naturally enough, such an arrangement suits me ideally.  As I have said on more than one occasion in this House, the best and proper type of representation is the smaller type constituency so that elected members can be easily reached by all constituents and, at a rate of 20,000 voters per member, a reasonably good service can be given.  Each Deputy can be seen frequently in every part of a smaller constituency and can render a proper and loyal stewardship to those he represents.</P>
    <P>The ideal solution would have been to have a single member constituency but this was rejected by a referendum some years ago.  This type of constituency would lend itself to frequent changes of representation unless the elected member had his ear to the ground and was up and doing.  Although I favour the single member and the single non-transferable vote it should have been possible to have proportional representation and have Members elected on the basis of a single Member constituency using the PR or transferable vote to return the elected Deputy.  However, the people decided otherwise and when they do we must courageously accept their verdict as expressed in the ballot box.  There is little we can do about altering that position because of the decision taken by the people.</P>
    <P>If an all-party committee was set up to make recommendations on constituency boundaries I would not be envious of the responsibility the chairman of such a committee would have, because various <Col N="829" /> Deputies could not under any circumstances agree on the proposals submitted by various Ministers for Local Government.  Such an all-party committee could sit for at least 18 months and then submit a report giving the minority and majority view.  No matter what type of constituency boundaries politicians would recommend they could not possibly meet with the favour of all politicians.  The next best thing was to have an independent commission of men of sound integrity who were familiar with the election laws, the working of this House and the administration of the laws passed by this House from judicial benches.  A more independent expression of opinion could not be had than the report to which we can rightly refer in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have one fault to find with the Bill. Section 5 deals with the re-election of the outgoing Ceann Comhairle.  It is correct, and it is the procedure in practically every democratic parliament, that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle is automatically returned unopposed.  The same provision should be included for a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>There is little use in a pious expression of thanks for what may be considered as a favourable comment when it is not in the Bill.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle takes over the duties of the Ceann Comhairle in his absence and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle must always be in attendance at Parliament. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has his responsibilities to undertake in the House, it must occupy more than a fair share of the time he is away from his constituency.  Those of us who have been <Col N="830" /> abroad from time to time realise the handicap it is to be away from one's constituency. For that reason I have always felt&mdash;not just today&mdash;that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who must be in attendance at every single sitting of the House, should have the same facilities available to him as the Ceann Comhairle has.  I do not know if the commission were asked to make a comment on the electoral position of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am not referring to the present occupant of this very exalted position but I am considering the case of every Leas-Cheann Comhairle to come. We have a correct arrangement for the automatic re-election of a Ceann Comhairle and, because of the numerous handicaps experienced by any Leas-Cheann Comhairle in constituency work due to his commitments in this House, it is only right that he should be automatically returned as a Member.  I should like to hear the views of other Members on this. It is our duty to consider a variety of legislation and put forward our options on such legislation.  I feel I am in order in directing the attention of any future commission which may be engaged in the task of fixing constituency boundaries to the fact that the position of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be considered.</P>
      <P>We should have heard something today about the problems that will have to be faced when the membership of the House is increased to 166.  Will the Minister comment on the position that will prevail after the next general election with regard to accommodation? At present we have to work under the worst conditions possible.  It is not possible for us to devote sufficient time to consideration of legislation or constituency work because of poor facilities.  At present two and three Members must endeavour to work in what can only be described as an airtight bird cage.  It is impossible to work under such conditions.  Ministers of State have the poorest office facilities I have seen in any House of Parliament I have visited.</P>

The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, an extremely sensible, intelligent and long-serving Member, must be aware of the fact that we do not have sufficient parking space for the existing number of Deputies and I should like to know what will happen when up to 20 extra Deputies arrive.  We are all aware of what it is like to work in poor conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the section concerning the register of electors.  This Bill presents a Minister with an opportunity to improve the situation in relation to the compiling of the register of electors. In my view there should be a provision for the carrying out of frequent inspections by a senior official of the Department of the Environment of the Register of electors.  Such an investigation should be carried out with the help of the local authority official responsible for the compling of the register.  The present situation is most unsatisfactory.  I cannot offer any explanation why many <Col N="832" /> people when they go to the polling booths are informed that their names are not on the register of electors.  Something should be done to improve that situation.</P>
    <P>In the course of recent debates it has been stated that this House was handing over its authority and power to independent commissions.  This House is the supreme authority and I do not think Members are handing over their power or authority.  If any Member feels there is nothing to prevent him tabling amendments for consideration.  If a difference of opinion arises in relation to any townland, or group of townlands, suitable amendments can be tabled and on such occasions it should be possible to permit a free vote.  I can recall free votes being permitted in relation to the constituency of South Mayo and the constituency of Wexford.  I am sure the Minister for the Environment would permit a free vote in relation to any controversial matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the commission on the efforts it made, as far as possible, to avoid cutting across county boundaries.  In rural constituencies the county boundary is the boundary that is readily recognised by the people and it can be a great inconvenience to the electorate, to candidates and to elected Deputies afterwards when county boundaries are disregarded.  This is my first experience of an electoral Bill in which the greatest consideration has been given to retaining as far as is humanly possible county boundaries.  This is most desirable and I hope the same will apply in the case of any other future legislation and that county boundaries will be adhered to.</P>
    <P>What better system of fixing constituency boundaries could one have? On an issue of this kind political parties have not trusted each other in the past. Human nature being what it is, I do not think it is possible for them to trust each other on the creation of constituency boundaries.  So, the only way in which it can be done is the way set out in this Bill. Dáil Éireann is the supreme authority on all occasions and no independent group can usurp its authority.  Dáil Éireann is <Col N="833" /> the supreme authority in this democracy. In the past we have handed over our powers, perhaps wrongly in some instances. We should cherish very carefully the power and authority we have here.</P>
    <P>In the case of fixing Deputies' salaries, which is the responsibility of another Minister, I have always held that it was not right for Deputies to fix their own salaries and that an independent and if possible judicial report should be made in that regard having regard to incomes and rates of pay which in the opinion of such an independent body should apply to Dáil representatives.  No matter on what occasion we tried to fix our own salaries one political party took advantage of another with the result that we lost a great deal of respect.  If Parliament is to function properly every effort must be made in Bills of this kind in regard to constituency boundaries, facilities, rates of remuneration and so on to achieve the best possible result.  So far as the Minister for the Environment is concerned the main object of any legislation should be to create renewed confidence in Dáil Éireann and maintain the highest standards of dignity.  We cannot expect the public to respect the dignity of this House if we do not exercise our powers and authority in a fair and impartial way.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to this Bill.  It does not concern my constituency.  I am quite happy with the administrative counties of Laois and Offaly which I have the honour to represent for so many years. Great and numerous problems will be created as a result of the influx of so many new Deputies into the House.  I hope the Minister will immediately consult with his ministerial colleagues so as to achieve the best possible results in bringing about improved facilities in every respect.</P>
    <P>I do not think a better job could be done as regards this Bill.  When a report of this kind is introduced in the form of legislation it may not please all Deputies and may still be subject to a variety of criticisms.  Yet, I do not see any other way of dealing with this kind of controversial problem and I convey my <Col N="834" /> compliments to the commission and every member of it for what I sincerely feel is a fair, impartial and completely non-political report in which they consider the best possible representation for the people so that they would be democratically represented in Parliament by increased numbers in accordance with increased population.</P>

      <P>The limited number of speakers, especially on the Government side, would certainly lead one to believe that this whole matter is a <i>fait accompli</i> and that no matter what suggestions or amendments are put forward it is most unlikely that they will be accepted. Anything I may say on this Bill is a personal opinion; I am not speaking on behalf of my party.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Bill is so narrow in its context.  It merely implements the findings of the Constituency Commission. While I fully support the ideals behind the setting up of that commission I thought that a somewhat more comprehensive Bill incorporating other reports issued in recent times might have been presented.  I specifically refer to that section of the Devlin Report which dealt with the working of Dáil Éireann and the remuneration and working conditions of its Members together with much-needed revision of Dáil procedures such as published recently in a policy document initiated by our party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The more cynical members of the public look on this Bill and on the commission's report as a case of extending the number of &ldquo;Jobs for the boys.&rdquo;  I should like to dismiss here and now that version.  I believe every Member of the <Col N="835" /> Dáil would do likewise.  It is the commission's intention to see that the public are properly represented under the terms of the Constitution.  I am not very sure that the commission are correct in assuming that that is the best thing for the people.  I know you ruled out previous speakers when they spoke about working conditions but it is very difficult to divorce the two matters.</P>

I would prefer to see 112 Deputies in this House if they were allowed work under proper circumstances and were given the proper type of secretarial assistance and office accommodation, both of which are lacking at the moment.  We have the intolerable situation where one secretary is supposed to do the secretarial work of six or seven Deputies.

      <P>The Constitution says in relation to Dáil Deputies that there should be at least one Deputy for every 20,000 of the population, or at most 30,000. Successive Governments, as well as this commission, have aimed at the higher rate of representation, one for every 20,000.  That may not be the best solution.  It would be more honest to face up to the fact that Deputies are unable, because of the restrictions I have mentioned, to do the type of legislative research which is necessary and take <Col N="836" /> part in Dáil debates to an extent which justifies their existence to the fullest.  It should be the aim of this House to see that every Deputy is fully briefed and has proper back-up service and secretarial service to carry out that function. It would be much better if the number of Deputies was reduced and facilities, secretarial and otherwise, were vastly improved.  The ideal solution would be to have the maximum number of Deputies and the best possible facilities.  We are getting almost the maximum number of Deputies but the facilities are at a standstill, which is not a satisfactory situation.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers said they hope that in time to come the burden of Dáil Deputies will be reduced by the advent of the ombudsman and information services. I hope that alleviates the position. Oireachtas Committees are an excellent idea and have been a wonderful innovation in recent years on EEC legislation and the Joint Committee investigating the affairs of State and semi-State bodies.  We are coming around to a rational system of parliamentary procedure, which is well in train in other countries but is comparatively new in this country.  That type of operation would greatly enhance the work of the Dáil if the type of ancillary services to which I have referred are improved.  It would give the Dáil a vastly improved function and would lead to a far better service to the public at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the type of electoral system under which we operate.  I agree that the multi-seat constituencies, which are referred to at some length in the Bill, are not a satisfactory answer to our problems.  I do not believe that, because previous suggestions and previous amendments to the Constitution were defeated, we should abandon the idea of the type of constituency previously mooted.  We should think again about the most satisfactory type of constituencies.  I am not saying I am in favour of a single-seat constituency with a non-transferable vote.  I believe that probably was a mistake in the referendum of 1959.  I believe there would be <Col N="837" /> public acclaim, and possibly strong backing from the bulk of politicians, for the idea of a single-seat constituences based on the transferrable vote.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is a great duplication of effort by Members of the Dáil in that constituents, some with the highest motives and others not, go not only to one Deputy but to two, three and possible four Deputies of that particular constituency in an effort to pressurise a Government Department, a Minister or a local authority into getting some favour done.  I do not think that is in the best interests of the working of Parliament or in the best interests of Dáil Deputies themselves.  I have no time whatsoever for the constituent whose case is not justified who utilises such pressure to get something which he or she may not be fully entitled to.</P>
    <P>This whole area might have been covered in this Bill.  It is unfortunate that the Bill is so narrow that it is only an implementation of the report of the commission. I know the debate here this evening has to be restricted, but I hope the Minister will take the point that we would like to see legislation which is more broadly based and which would lead to a more intelligent and less time-consuming running of this House.</P>
    <P>If I may get in on the commercial, I wish to refer to the changes envisaged in this Bill.  As has been pointed out in the Minister's speech, there are only three breaches of county boundaries as the Bill stands at present.  That is an excellent day's work on the part of the commission. In most matters they have struck rigidly to the guidelines proposed originally.  They were rather confined in their work because of the Supreme Court decision in 1961 and their terms of reference accordingly were limited.  I am going to suggest to the Minister that by a very slight amendment to the existing Bill before us those boundary breaches could be reduced from three to two, and the case I have in mind is that which takes half of County Waterford and puts it into South Tipperary.  By extending the tolerence level slightly, by as little as 1 per cent, there need not be any <Col N="838" /> breach of county boundaries at all in this case.  I would like the Minister to have another look at it.  I know that his own Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Fahey, feels just as strongly on this matter as I do and would be here today making his case except that he has been indisposed for some time past.</P>
    <P>On page 18 of the commission's report it is stated: &ldquo;Not only population should be taken into account but also the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions and the existence of divisions created by such physical features as rivers, lakes and mountains.&rdquo;  That quotation from the commission's report refers back to the Supreme Court case of 1961.  Now I would like to refer to the factors as they relate to the present Waterford constituency.</P>
    <P>Regarding average population per Deputy, if South Tipperary, without the addition of County Waterford, was allocated four seats, the ratio would be only 7.26 per cent below the national average.  In view of the variations from the national average proposed by the commission in Carlow-Kilkenny, which is 6.28 per cent; Laois-Offaly, which is 5.74 per cent; Louth, which is 6.13 per cent; East Mayo, which is 6.42 per cent; and West Mayo, which is 6.27 per cent, the variation of 7.26 per cent is not unreasonable. It is less than .8 per cent if you compare it with East Mayo.  On the other hand, South Tipperary, without the proposed addition from County Waterford, could thus be a four-seat constituency on population grounds alone, as an entity.  Regarding the present Waterford constituency, the ratio would be 7.54 per cent above the national average, again not an excessive amount when compared with the other tolerance levels.</P>
    <P>The commission decided that the factors other than population to be taken into account were the desirability so far as is possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as county, townland, and electoral divisions and the existence <Col N="839" /> of divisions such as rivers and mountains. Waterford at present is separated from South Tipperary by the well-known boundaries of the county line and the present constituency division.</P>
    <P>There are two prominent and well-known boundaries which would be a major factor in any decision.  I refer to the River Suir, which is the natural boundary between Waterford and Tipperary and which at present is being breached by bringing a portion of Waterford into South Tipperary, and I refer also to the mountain ranges of the Comeraghs and the Knockmealdowns, again being breached to bring part of Waterford into South Tipperary.  Therefore, by increasing the tolerance level by a mere 1 per cent you would not have to breach two major boundaries, one a river and the other a mountain range.  In those circumstances it would be justified to leave Waterford as an integral county and city, as one four-seat constituency and to do likewise with South Tipperary. Waterford is separated from Tipperary by the River Suir and the Comeragh mountain range, two very important physical features.</P>
    <P>Taking the three factors of population, well-known boundaries and physical boundaries, the commission would have been quite justified in making the present South Tipperary constituency a four-seater and leaving Waterford as a four-seater. Therefore, I put it to the Minister that he can reduce the number of breaches of county boundaries mentioned in this Bill from three to two merely by increasing the tolerance level which he has in East Mayo of 6.4 to 7.5 at the maximum for County Waterford and South Tipperary.  That would be in the spirit of the Supreme Court decision of 1961.  The figure mentioned in that Supreme court decision was 5 per cent, but great play was put upon the factor of physical boundaries and county boundaries, and I have here today pointed out that all of those come into play between the two constituencies of Waterford and South Tipperary.  Surely 7.5 per cent would not be an unfair tolerance level to <Col N="840" /> ask for.  It would not be an undue derogation from the limits which have been set down.  In welcoming the Bill, I ask the Minister to examine closely the point in question and give serious consideration to retaining the existing county boundaries to coincide with the constituency boundaries.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the House for the manner in which it has dealt with the Bill.  As pointed out by different speakers, it is refreshing at this time to be dealing with a constituency revision Bill in a calm and reasonable manner, as compared with past experiences when Bills of this nature were before this house, twice during my time, in 1969 and 1974.  There was then a lot of disagreement and bitterness in some of those debates, which I am happy did not occur on this occasion. The reason for that is the change of atmosphere arising from the fact that the new constituencies have been recommended by an independent commission, following on a commitment given by the leader of my party just prior to the last general election.  That is my recollection. I understand from those sitting in the House today that there was an intention to give a similar commitment if the result of the election had been different.  There would appear to be general agreement among the parties that a commission was the best way of tackling this job because of accusations about gerrymandering on different occasions in the past, some of them, of course, ill-founded.</P>
      <P>The voters and the people in general accept that the commission was the best way to do the job.  We as a Government, accepted the recommendations in the report of the commission and this Bill implements these recommendations, as presented to us.  It was a decision of the Government and the party to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien expressed the opinion that we might not be doing our duty as Members of this House in handing over responsibility such as this to a commission. We did not hand over the responsibility to the commission.  We asked <Col N="841" /> them to make recommendations and to advise the Houses of the Oireachtas on this matter.  This is exactly what they have done and nothing else.  It is up to the House to accept or reject these recommendations or if they think fit, to attempt to amend them.  In that way the House is the final arbiter of the new constituencies and has not got rid of its responsibilities in this respect at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan recommended that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle be automatically returned, in the same way as the Ceann Comhairle.  We, unfortunately, cannot embody that in the Bill. The position of the Ceann Comhairle is set out very clearly in Article 16 of the Constitution, which does not include the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>Unfortunately.</P>
      <P>More than one speaker mentioned that the ideal type of constituency was a one-seat one.  A lot of people in this House thought that in 1968 and supported it, but the electorate did not think so and the two issues were overwhelmingly defeated as I recall, in 1968, and the same thing happened in the fifties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission, having received the final census report, worked in all haste. There was no delay whatsoever in reporting back and presenting their report.  They did an excellent job in a reasonably short time.  The report was published around 21 April and there was a time, before the Bill came before the House, when the parties or individuals considered what was involved in it. Again, it is only a recommendation and advice being offered by the commission <Col N="842" /> which has been accepted by the Government. We are now in this Bill implementing what was contained in that report of the commission.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Deputies who contributed and who joined with me in complimenting the members of the commission. It is not for me to defend or criticise any part of what is contained in the commission's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a voluntary contribution of £6,230,000 by the Irish Government to the sixth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The association was established in 1960 to help finance development projects and programmes in the poorest developing countries.  It is one of the organisations that make up the World Bank Group, the others being the World Bank itself and the International Finance Corporation.  Membership of the World Bank is a prerequisite for membership of the association.  Day-to-day management of the association is handled by its management and staff, under the President of the Bank Group, Mr. Robert McNamara.  The management report to an executive board of 20 directors elected by the bank's member countries. Policy matters are decided by the board of governors of the association which consists of one governor for each member country.  The association has 122 member countries at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the association's resources are limited, relative to the needs of its less well-off member countries, priority is given to the very poorest countries. Thus, nearly 90 per cent of the association's lending goes to countries where <Col N="843" /> large sections of the population have <i>per capita</i> incomes of, on average, £100 a year.  In some of the countries <i>per capita</i> income would be less than half this amount.  The association helps by financing projects aimed at raising agricultural output and also by supporting investment in roads, telecommunications, water supply and other infrastructural improvements that are essential to economic growth.  The association's loans are on highly concessional conditions&mdash;50-year repayment periods, no repayments for the first ten years and no interest charges.  The projects financed by the association must, of course, be economically and financially viable and must meet the same standards as those required by the World Bank itself. Unlike loans given by the association, lending by the World Bank is essentially on commercial terms and the International Finance Corporation also provides equity and loan finance on an essentially commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The International Development Association obtains its financial resources in a number of ways.  The principal method is through periodic replenishments provided by its richer member countries, also known as Part I countries.  The other member countries are known as Part II members and a number of these also participate in the replenishments.  The resources made available to the association to date comprise, in round figures, initial membership subscriptions amounting to $1 billion, transfers from the surplus income of the World Bank of $1½ billion, and replenishments of nearly $18½ billion.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined the association on its foundation in 1960, and subscribed $3 million to the initial capital.  This country did not contribute to the first or second of the three-yearly replenishments of resources, but made a contribution of $4 million to the third replenishment. Ireland was still a Part II member at that time.  Ireland became a Part II member in 1973, because of the economic progress which had been made over the previous decade, and because of our membership <Col N="844" /> of the EEC.  All the other EEC members, and most OECD member countries, hold Part I status.  It was accepted that this would involve a continuing commitment to contribute towards the financing of the association.  As a Part I member, Ireland contributed £3.1 million to the fourth replenishment and £5.8 million to the fifth replenishment.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the current replenishment&mdash;the sixth replenishment&mdash;began at the end of 1978 and concluded towards the end of last year. The negotiations agreed on an overall amount of £12 billion for the replenishment. This represents an increase of 55 per cent in US dollar terms over the amount of the fifth replenishment.  The vast bulk of the funds will be provided by Part I countries.  The basic principle adopted in the allocation of contributions among these countries was that each would maintain in this replenishment the same share as it had taken in the fifth replenishment, with a number of exceptions in the case of some major contributors.  The allocations have been made on the understanding that commitments to them are not final until approval has, where necessary, been obtained from the legislature of each donor country.  The outcome of the sixth replenishment negotiations has recently been approved by the association's board of governors.  The replenishment will enter into force when member countries contributing 80 per cent of the total replenishment formally notify the association that they will pay their allocated amounts.</P>
    <P>As for previous replenishments, donor countries have the right initially to substitute non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand notes for cash payments. The notes, denominated in the member's currency, are to be deposited over the three years 1980 to 1982.  Actual cash payments under the replenishment will arise over the years 1981 to 1990.  The precise rate at which the funds are called upon will depend on the progress made in implementing the projects financed by the replenishment.</P>
    <P>As a Part I member of the association, <Col N="845" /> Ireland is, as I have said earlier, expected to contribute to the periodic replenishments.  In accordance with the sharing arrangements agreed in the negotiations the Government have indicated that, subject to legislative approval, they are prepared to contribute the amount appropriate to Ireland, that is £6,230,000.  The contribution will count as part of our official development assistance.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the association is covered by the International Development Association Act, 1960.  As in the case of earlier replenishments the Bill now before the House makes provision, by way of amendment to the 1960 Act, for our contribution to the latest replenishment.  The proposed amendment also brings together the earlier payments provisions in the 1960 Act and those inserted by the subsequent amending Acts.</P>
    <P>This Bill, when enacted, will, therefore, enable Ireland to maintain its role in helping to finance the work of the International Development Association and, through it, to continue to assist some of the poorest developing countries around the world.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here this evening with the matter of our contribution to the International Development Association, which contribution will count as part of our official development assistance.  Therefore this Bill affords us an opportunity of looking at Ireland's role, not just in the matter of the International Development Association but also in the context of its view and policy on official development assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are dealing with the matter of official development assistance, this contribution being part of it, it is important to point out that the present Government, by reneging on <Col N="846" /> their commitments, have severely damaged the good work developed so well by voluntary and official agencies in recent years.  Furthermore they have tar nished the name of Ireland abroad and brought disgrace to this nation.  Those are hard words but I feel they need to be said.</P>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of discussing this issue in this House.  In regard to the Bill before the House, while expressing the aforesaid views I will be voicing the support of my party for the Bill because it is the policy of my party to ensure that the contributions made by the State by way of official development assistance be increased so that Ireland can hold its head high among the nations of the world in that regard.  The situation in regard to official development assistance as far as this country is concerned will not be saved I am afraid, by the provisions of this Bill.  We are in a situation in which the moneys that will ultimately be payable under this Bill will not in fact be paid this year at all and, therefore, will not in any way rescue the situation the present Government have allowed develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite simply the situation today is that if the Government met their specific commitments, given in this House and outside it, our total payments by way of official development assistance&mdash;loosely called aid to the Third World&mdash;in this year would be of the order of £21 million, whereas the figure is £16 million only, there being a shortfall of £5 million.  Even if that figure were paid this year we would not have a whole lot to be proud of because we would still be well short of the commitment which this country, along with the other developed countries, made at the United Nations to contribute 7 per cent of GNP by way of official development assistance.  At the same time there has been an improvement in this regard in recent years.  This improvement started from a baseline in 1973, when the Coalition Government came into power, at which stage the level of aid was .036 per cent, a percentage that was less than that in the year 1960 when Ireland first joined the International <Col N="847" /> Development Association.  That was the position facing the Coalition Government when they assumed office in 1973.  Because of a positive policy and commitment by the Government at that time that figure was substantially increased over the years.</P>
    <P>May I say, in that regard, that the moneys voted by way of increases for official development assistance&mdash;which included earlier moneys which were voted under the International Development Association (Amendment) Bills of 1973, or 1974, and 1977&mdash;were supported by the Opposition of the day.  The outlook at that time was that we should be doing better.  Furthermore, there was a specific commitment given in this House by the then Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs.  I had hoped that Deputy O'Kennedy, who was then Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs and who was until recently Minister for Foreign Affairs, would have been presenting this Bill here this evening.  The Bill, even though presented by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, falls within the ambit of the Department of Finance. Without absolving the present Minister in any way, the specific commitments given by the Fianna Fáil Party in the past were given by Deputy O'Kennedy.  I might mention the terms of that commitment. On 27 February 1975 Deputy O'Kennedy said in this House, and I quote from Volume 278, column 1372 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>...we commit ourselves to ensuring that, irrespective of our budgetary or balance of payments problems, we shall set aside year after year the appropriate sum to ensure that we reach at least the target set by the Minister&mdash;0.35 per cent of our GNP within five years.</P>
    <P>That was the stated view of Deputy O'Kennedy, then Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs, speaking on behalf of his party in this House.</P>
    <P>The figures for official development assistance were increased substantially <Col N="848" /> during the term of the Coalition Government. In fairness to the present administration, they have maintained that momentum over the last couple of years which gave cause for hope to those with an interest or a commitment in the Third World, and to those with a belief that it is in the interests of mankind that there should be a proper level of aid to the Third World.  Unfortunately, that momentum was not alone slowed down but set back in the current year.  The former Minister for Foreign Affairs took over the Department of Finance and now holds the purse strings.  While not in any way absolving the present Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy is the person I would like to be addressing here tonight. That is the background to the situation we face today.</P>
    <P>As I said, there has been a very substantial reduction in real terms in voluntary aid.  The only increases of any consequence granted were because of international obligations we could not get out of.  This is a sad day for this country and for this administration.  It may appear to the present Government that there are not any votes in the Third World, but this is not a matter which could be considered in terms of votes.  There are many hundreds of thousands of people in this country who year in and year out make their voluntary donations in this area.  These figures have been increasing in the current year in contrast to the record of the present administration. These people will form their own conclusions and will come to their own decisions about what to think of a Government who renege on such an important area.</P>
    <P>The whole question of official development assistance should not be discussed in a political context.  There should be a commitment by the entire nation&mdash;backed by the people but given a lead by the Government and supported by the Opposition&mdash;to do our very best in this area, because we are not doing it at the moment.  The present situation is that in those areas where the Government had power to cut back from the point of view of contributions to United <Col N="849" /> Nation bodies, such as the Commission for Refugees, there was a cut of 24 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I guarantee that I will keep to the question of international development assistance and where the money is going.  These moneys hopefully will ultimately reach the Third World. When discussing this Bill we have to look at the present situation in the Third World, see the problems there and what we should be doing about them.  I might <Col N="850" /> ask if we are doing enough under this Bill, although my view is that of course we should discharge our obligations and our payments should be made in different areas.</P>
      <P>This Bill is mainly related to funds for the association which will help in the financing of projects of an agricultural and infrastructural nature.  The forte of this country is in the area of personnel, helping in the developing of these countries by providing people who are experienced from the point of view of the work being done by volunteers from different State agencies who have gone out to help in establishing transport and electricity undertakings, providing nurses, doctors, teachers and so on.  This is an area where we have a particular strength.  At the same time we have to look at the problems with which we are trying to cope.  It was in that context that I was looking at the question of refugees. This is a very big problem in the Third World&mdash;ten million and increasing. Mention was made today about the number who fled from the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan.  They are now taking refuge in Pakistan and so on.</P>
      <P>When we in the country talk about assistance to the Third World and aid through official development assistance, we have to look at this question in a broad context, appreciate the effects of the policies now being adopted, the welshing on the commitments already made and how that will set back the work that has been done over the last number of years, which is hopefully not suffering a mortal blow but which will be set back for many years.  It is in that context and not in a political context that I take this opportunity to develop the point and to speak on this area. Whatever is said, there is no doubt that this work will suffer a very severe blow in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not bore the House with detailed statistics of the various bodies involved in this kind of work.  We have already been given some of these figures&mdash;the number of people working in Kenya and Tanzania, the number that cannot be increased, the projects that will have to be <Col N="851" /> slowed down or abandoned and the new projects which have been planned and are ready to proceed in the current year but which will have to be stopped.  The moneys we are asking the Government to spend in this area are relatively small, but the influence which they bring in the Third World is very large indeed.  When there is a reneging on those commitments the damage caused thereby is therefore that much greater and this is already evidenced by reports from countries where we have been concentrating aid, such as Tanzania and Lesotho, as well as other countries where we have been making a small effort in recent years.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the problem in regard to bilateral aid might be resolved, as suggested by the Minister on 24 April, has not met with any favourable response from anybody who has knowledge and experience in this area.  I was questioning the Minister as to whether there was any prospect of an increase in bilateral aid&mdash;I am forewarning him that the matter may arise again in the near future&mdash;and he suggested that there could be a possibility of a transfer of funds from the multilateral to the bilateral programme.  People with whom I have discussed this matter indicate very strongly that this certainly would not be a solution.</P>

    <P>The moneys are going to the International Development Association who concentrate their lending on countries where large sections of the population have a low <i>per capita</i> income.  Obviously this must be supported.  In the past aid has resulted in the relatively rich in these countries getting richer and the aid did not percolate through to where it was most needed.  It was a theory during the sixties that there would be a seepage and that aid to the wealthier people would <Col N="853" /> percolate through to the weaker sections of the community.  The International Development Association are carrying out work which will help in providing the basic needs of the population in general and money is being spent on projects aimed at raising agricultural output, improving communications and water supplies and so on.  I support this entirely, while at the same time making the distinction in regard to the type of aid in which we can specialise which deals more with people, an area in which we are particularly good.  It is right and proper that we, along with the other developed nations, should contribute and pay our share towards bodies such as the International Development Association to enable them to disburse their funds and provide the facilities which are so badly needed by the poorer sections in these countries.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to bear in mind the history of this association.  The Minister mentioned in his speech the fact that we joined in 1960 but we did not contribute thereafter to the earlier replenishments and this was an unfortunate attitude on the part of the Government of the day.  I would point out that we became qualified as a Part I member in 1973.  It is no coincidence that this was the year in which the Coalition came into office. There was a dramatic change in our policy in all matters of official development assistance and aid to the Third World.  In the intervening years we have provided the amounts which, if not legally, we are morally bound to pay to the International Development Association. In broad terms the amount may seem small enough in the context of the figure of $ 12 billion which is quoted for the overall replenishment.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Chair.</P>
      <P>This Bill, entitled the National Heritage Bill, 1980, deals with an important part of our heritage&mdash;the physical remains of our past.  We hope that other aspects of our heritage will be dealt with in later legislation.  The Bill sets out to modernise and extend the National Monuments Acts, 1930 and 1954.  These Acts provide the legal protection of our heritage at the moment. There have been many changes since 1954, such as new techniques of exploration, rapid industrialisation and intensive agriculture.  These require new legislative powers to ensure that they do not damage our heritage.  The Government have been working on new legislation for the past ten years but it is very slow in coming forth.  Therefore, Fine Gael decided to introduce their own Bill in order to accelerate matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now outline the effect of each section of the Bill.  Section I relates the Bill to previous legislation on this subject. Section 2 contains definitions.  Section 3 introduces for the first time control on the taking of objects from, or otherwise disturbing, shipwrecks or other ancient structures now below the high water mark.  There are a number of important shipwrecks around our coast, particularly the Spanish Armada wrecks. In at least one known case they have been plundered without any control <Col N="855" /> because of the lack of the power which this Bill will now confer on the Commissioners of Public Works.  This Bill will basically impose the same controls on excavation or searches at sea as are applied to archaeological excavation on land.  However, a specific exception is made for work carried out at sea for the purposes of safety.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is designed to provide better information to the public and the Oireachtas on all aspects of archaeological excavation and prospecting carried out on land and on sea.  The requirement to be imposed on the Office of Public Works to present a report each year will provide an added assurance that all those carrying out excavations comply in full with their statutory obligations to report promptly on their excavations.  There have been a few cases of extremely long delays in the presenting of statutory reports on excavations which had been carried out with the aid of public funds.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is designed to ensure that ancient buildings which are still being lived in by families can be effectively preserved.  Up to now the Office of Public Works could only take into their care a building which had become uninhabited or, in plain words, a ruin. These buildings become derelict before anything can be done about them.  One has only to look around this city to see buildings of great historic merit, which are still inhabited, falling slowly into dilapidation because their owners cannot or will not preserve them.  Section 5 will remove the barrier against the Commissioners of Public Works becoming the guardians of such inhabited buildings.</P>
    <P>Section 6 ensures that objects found in excavations of shipwrecks will be preserved and, where necessary, lodged for safe keeping and public display in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Section 7 closes a loophole in existing law which risks the export or retention for exclusively private enjoyment of important historic objects.  Up to now only <Col N="856" /> the person who actually found it was legally obliged to report the existence of an historic object.  If he passes it on, or sells it, to an antique dealer or collector there is at the moment no legal obligation on the dealer or collector to report the objects to anyone.  In practice antique dealers and collectors are much more likely than casual finders to appreciate the significance and value of a historic object.  Therefore it makes a lot of sense to extend the obligation to report the possession of historic objects to such people.  A loophole whereby people could claim that they were not certain that an object was of archaeological significance is also removed.  If they ought reasonably to have believed it was an historic object then they will be obliged to report it.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is concerned with the use of metal detectors in searches for archaeological objects.  Already anyone who digs for an historic object is bound to get a licence to do so, but no licence is required to prospect with a metal detector. We believe it is important that unauthorised excavations should not take place.</P>
    <P>Although some important metal objects may be found, historic items of a more fragile or non-metallic character may be destroyed or damaged in the process.  If the exact context and level at which the objects were found is not recorded&mdash;as is likely in an unauthorised excavation&mdash;information about the origin and significance of the objects may be lost for ever.  The only way to ensure that our past is not destroyed is for all excavations, whether prompted by readings on a metal detector or not, to be properly authorised by competent authorities.  This section will require that the use of metal detectors for archaeological purposes be licensed. This will not ban their use but it will ensure that they are used responsibly.  The section will not interfere with the use of metal detectors for normal industrial or agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is designed to ensure that there is no repetition of the occurrence at Wood Quay, Dublin, where the Government <Col N="857" /> authorised the destruction of a national monument without having obtained the consent of the Dáil.  In future any consent to the destruction of a national monument will have to be incorporated in an order, which will only take effect after it has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will place the responsibility for protecting our national heritage firmly on the shoulders of the Members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the product of three years' work.  Not all of it is my work&mdash;much of it has been done by my colleague, Deputy Bruton.  Even so, there are bound to be aspects in which it can be improved by amendments or additions. We will particularly welcome reasonable amendments emanating from the Government, who can draw on the extensive experience of the Office of Public Works and the National Museum.  The Government may indeed have a larger measure of their own in preparation, but the preparation of a larger measure is not an excuse for failing to enact this one.  The subjects that this Bill deals with are all urgent.  They cannot wait two or three more years for a comprehensive Government Bill.  Any drafting defects in this Bill can be easily corrected by amendments which we will welcome. The important thing is to act now and to show that this, the 21st Dáil, will protect our national heritage.  I urge all parties to support this Bill and ensure that it becomes law.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dáil Éireann I had an opportunity to travel to a number of places on parliamentary delegations.  I remember being in Strasbourg in the company of the present Minister of State on a fact finding mission prior to our entry into the EEC.  We were approximately five or six days in Strasbourg and on the last day of our visit we went on a tour a guide pointed out all the seen much in Strasbourg, when we went on the tour a guide pointed out all the things that had been preserved and I was quite amazed.  We should follow their example and preserve our heritage.</P>
    <P>On the invitation of our parliamentary colleagues in Europe we visited Berlin. <Col N="858" /> Berlin has been ravaged by two wars, one in 1918 and the other in 1945.  The amount of work that has been done to restore the city, particularly in East Berlin, is remarkable.  It would be an education for all Members of the House to be brought on a guided tour of Berlin to see what the Germans have done in such a short time.  We could relate it back to our situation.</P>
    <P>In 1979 at the invitation of the Iraqi Government I visited Baghdad and had the pleasure of visiting Babylon and places of that nature.  A lot of the treasures of that country have been plundered by the British and are in British museums in one place or another but at the same time a lot of effort has been put into trying to preserve their past by a relatively undeveloped country and until recently a very poor country.</P>
    <P>Relative to the United States or other places, Ireland is a very old country and we should be very proud of our heritage. We should do our best to preserve it, if not for ourselves, then for future generations. The preservation of our heritage could also be a tourist attraction.  Even from that point of view this Bill should be accepted.</P>
    <P>This Bill might be rejected on the grounds that the Government have already prepared a Bill.  Many people could add to what we have in the Bill as it stands and it could be amended, but it should not be just thrown out like most of the measures brought in by the Opposition during Private Members' Time. Two other Bills on this subject were enacted, one in 1930 and the other in 1954, but neither was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It should be no shame or embarrassment to the Government to support legislation brought in by the Opposition. It should not be considered that any legislation we propose is bad and that by virtue of their electoral majority the legislation proposed by Fianna Fáil is all good.  On that basis I invite Members to listen to what we have to say on this legislation so that they may be open to cast their vote one way or the other.</P>
    <P>This is a remarkable day here because we have a Bill that will probably be accepted <Col N="859" /> without division, that is the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1980, on which Deputies expressed their opinions.  I expressed my opinion about its defects and the failings as far as I am concerned, but on a national basis there is not too much wrong with it.  This second Bill should be accepted by the Government in the same way, as it is not a political Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House and I ask all Deputies to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the interest being taken in the preservation of our national monuments by Deputy Donnellan, as shown by his introduction of this Bill to amend and extend the National Monuments Act, 1930, and the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that since the 1940 Act was passed, and even since the amending Act in 1954, there have been developments in relation to archaeology and in the whole matter of the preservation of national monuments which have prompted many people to wonder about the adequacy or otherwise of our existing legislation.  It will be acknowledged by anyone who is familiar with the subject, that our present legislation provides quite extensive powers for the protection of monuments and of archaeological objects and in many respects compares quite favourably with the level of protection given in other countries.  But in recent years some matters have emerged, or have taken on an importance which was not foreseen when the present statutes were formulated, which simply are not adequately catered for by the provisions of the existing statutes. Among such matters are two with which Deputy Donnellan's Bill attempts to come to grips, namely, the protection of shipwrecks of historic importance and the control of electronic devices when used by people searching for archaeological objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan proposes to give shipwrecks&mdash;or sea wrecks as he <Col N="860" /> describes them&mdash;the same protection that is given to monuments on land, and he also wants to see curbs placed on the use of electronic devices by people prospecting for archaeological objects on land or in inland waterways.  One point which might be remembered in relation to both these issues is that diving for wrecks and searching with metal detectors for buried treasure are activities which are regarded by many people as legitimate and harmless pursuits. They have become part of the world of hobbies and recreational activities, facilitated in both instances by increases in leisure time and developments in technical equipment.  They undoubtedly afford innocent enjoyment to a lot of people, but unfortunately it is also a fact that both activities are pursued in certain instances by people who are motivated solely by the prospects of easy gains, who do not care what damage they might do to the setting in which any finds they retrieve may have rested.</P>
    <P>Even where the exploration, whether under water or on land, is carried out with genuinely honourable intentions, there is always the danger that untrained and unskilled hands will damage or destroy evidence that would be of value to a qualified investigator.  I would in principle, therefore, endorse what Deputy Donnellan is attempting to achieve.  I am conscious of the particular difficulties associated with drawing up provisions to deal with shipwrecks.  In this connection, I draw attention to the report of the Council of Europe's Committee on Culture and Education in 1978 on the Underwater Cultural Heritage.  In an appendix to the report the position in regard to legal protection was reviewed in some detail.  It was found that the position varied substantially from country to country not only in the amount of legal protection afforded to the underwater heritage but in the laws as to ownership of items lying underwater and in the laws relating to salvage and wreck.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from paragraph 2.1.4 of the Council of Europe report on The Underwater Cultural Heritage, 1978, which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> Although it is obvious that there is a considerable volume of law on the cultural heritage in European waters this is not to say that there is adequate protection.  The laws as shown take many forms.  Individual laws also vary greatly in context; from the very complex and complete to the simple and rudimentary.  This does not seem to be a reaction to the complexity or simplicity of the problems facing individual countries.  Rather the law has sometimes followed particular acts of despoliation; sometimes it represents a compromise between vested interests (which may not be represented in other countries); sometimes it was all that parliamentary time could be found for; sometimes it is a simple extension to the underwater areas of complex antiquities legislation that developed from many years experience on land without consideration of its appropriateness in the new environment.</P>
    <P>The question of ownership of items of the underwater cultural heritage is at present very confused.</P>
    <P>2.2.2 Items in territorial waters of a state may be controlled by quite different rules.  A primary consideration in the case of ships and their cargo, is whether or not the owner has abandoned these objects.  If abandoned, does title pass to the finder, the state of the finder or the state within whose territorial waters they have been found?  The most common practice under national law seems to be for title to be deemed to pass to the last. However, it must be made clear that abandonment is usually something that must be strictly proven: mere non-use does not suffice to bring about abandonment.</P>
    <P>Moreover, some states now provide for termination of ownership rights in ships and cargo sunk within territorial waters after a specified period of time (Spain and Portugal).  Items in territorial waters will also be affected by the salvage laws, that is the salvage provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, apply &ldquo;at any place on or <Col N="862" /> near the coasts of the United Kingdom or any tidal water within the limits of the United Kingdom. Although the salvor usually does not have title to what he raises he does have certain rights in relation thereto in order to ensure his reward for effort and risk involved.</P>
    <P>2.3.3 There are great differences in applying the concepts of salvage laws to the recovery of objects from the sites of shipwrecks where the cultural and historical value of these objects in their context outweighs their economic value, because if the person who has gained possession of the site is interested only in the economic value of the objects recovered there is no guarantee that the site will be correctly treated.  Much of the historical and cultural value of the objects may result from their position and relationship to other objects.  A salvor will not normally be concerned with this aspect although a good context can increase commercial value too.  He will find no value in things such as ships' timbers and furnishings which are of immense interest to the archaeologist.  Furthermore, there are problems in gaining possession of the archaeological site: the wreck may be too scattered and dispersed to enable possession to be taken and this issue may be further complicated by the law relating to wreck.</P>
    <P>The use of metal detectors by people searching for objects hidden beneath the surface of the ground has been seen by many people for some time as something which should be brought under control. In Britain, recent legislation has provided penalties for the unauthorised use of metal detectors at the sites of national monuments and in areas of archaeological importance and there have been calls for similar provisions to be brought in in this country.  It should be stressed, however, that under the law as it stands at present, anyone who without the consent in writing of the Commissioners of Public Works excavates or digs anywhere in the country in search of archaeological objects, <Col N="863" /> whether or not a metal detector is used, is committing an offence and is leaving himself open to a fine.  If the searching is done at the site of a national monument, the person faces possible imprisonment as well.</P>
    <P>As I am sure everyone will agree however, unless we have a well informed alert and responsive attitude by the general public to such activities, legislation on its own will be almost worthless. I note that by means of a seemingly innocuous deletion Deputy Donnellan would propose to make quite a significant extension to the type of property which would come within the scope of the legislation.  I refer to his proposed amendment of section 5 of the 1930 Act, whereby he wants buildings occupied as residences to be brought within the provision which would enable their owners to give them into the guardianship of the Commissioners or of a local authority.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the proposed deletion the way would be open for the owners of architecturally or historically interesting buildings, still in use as dwelling houses, to seek to have the commissioners take them over for maintenance.  I am not sure if that is the principle behind Deputy Donellan's proposal, but if it is I would agree that there could be cases where properties of the nature in question could be regarded as having a place in our cultural heritage and it would be a pity to see such structures falling into neglect.</P>
    <P>In some countries there are schemes to provide assistance to the owners of buildings of historical or architectural importance, to ensure that such buildings are adequately maintained, and there have been calls from time to time that we in Ireland should also make special provisions in that regard.  One of the ways in which it was argued in the past that assistance could be given was through relief from rates, but of course with the general removal of rates from residences the owners of such properties have benefited along with the owners of more modest dwellings.  The Government <Col N="864" /> have also given the owners of such properties relief through the modification of the capital taxation laws.</P>
    <P>An examination of the approach to the protection of monuments in other countries indicates that in many European countries monuments are protected and preserved under three different types of legislation, that is, (a) Ancient Monuments Acts; (b) Planning Acts and (c) Historic Buildings Acts.  Under (a) the State accepts direct responsibility for the protection and preservation of monuments including responsibility for the execution of any necessary works and the cost thereof.  In some cases a date, up to which architectural monuments are regarded as ancient monuments, is specified in the legislation.  Under (b) protection is extended to monuments by the control of development through the planning authorities.  In the case of (c) the State and/or local authorities provide assistance to owners or occupiers of buildings of great historical or architectural importance by affording relief from rates or taxes and/or by direct financial aid or compensation as an incentive to the owners or occupiers to preserve the structures as part of the country's heritage and also as a valuable recreational resource.  The general consideration here is that the building is still in use or still capable of being used for the purpose for which it was originally intended or for an analogous purpose.</P>
    <P>So far as Ireland is concerned, I feel that there is a lot to be said on the side of the framers of the 1930 Act who excluded occupied buildings from the application of the provisions of the National Monuments Acts.  I would repeat that this does not mean that we would regard with equanimity the prospect of any of these distinguished houses going to rack and ruin, but we feel that the onus to see that they survive rests primarily on the owners.  Whether or not Deputy Donnellan would accept that proposition, he would perhaps agree that the problem of seeing how best to go about ensuring the proper upkeep of occupied houses is rather distinct and separate from that of preserving deserted <Col N="865" /> and generally ruined monuments of the past.  If there were to be any question of legislative provision for State assistance to maintain occupied buildings, it would probably be desirable to have whole new procedures and systems set up to deal with them, rather than try to squeeze them into the existing legislation for national monuments by deleting, as Deputy Donnellan proposes to do, the present exclusion in section 5 of the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>The other major point of Deputy Donnellan's Bill seems to be that aimed at amending section 14 of the 1930 Act. I do not propose to dwell on this suggestion apart from saying that I would more readily have understood an amendment aimed at giving means of appeal to a person who was refused a consent under the section rather than making it necessary for him to make a case not only to the commissioners, but to both houses of the Oireachtas as well, before he could get a consent.  I am of course in complete agreement with the intention to increase substantially the penalties for infringement of the Act.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that it is understandable in the wake of an event such as the recent momentous find in County Tipperary that people would want to take a critical look at the legislation relating to the protection and preservation of our relics of the past to see in what respect it may be desirable to make new provisions or to modify existing ones.  On that account we appreciate Deputy Donnellan's concern to see the enactment of the Bill which he has now brought forward but because of its many shortcomings I must oppose any further consideration of that Bill.</P>

Much work has already been done on the preparation of a new Bill and I can assure the House that it is our intention to have it ready for introduction as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In supporting this excellent Bill from the Fine Gael Party, moved in the name of Deputy Donnellan, with a fair degree of godfathership coming from Deputy John Bruton, I must say that I was saddened by the response of the Minister of State in what was otherwise an excellently read script.  Unfortunately, the text of the script does not augur well for our monuments. We must be honest on this non-contentious issue, now that Wood Quay is being slowly and systematically taken apart.  The Minister knows in his heart&mdash;I hope he corrects me if I am wrong&mdash;that he does not have the heads of a Bill agreed by the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Leyden would be well advised to look after Roscommon rather than national monuments.  As the mover of this Bill has already said in a very generously made offer it is open to amendment.  The sections of it could be amended and if the expertise and undoubted experience of the Board of Works were brought to bear on this Bill which is already printed and published, I suggest, in a spirit of co-operation to the Minister that we would be much further along the road than we are at present. There are many reasons why the drafting of legislation can be delayed and many of them may have nothing to do with the Department in question which initially sponsors the Bill.  Deputies on this side of the House accept and recognise that.  We know that the Department are not in sole control of the heads of a Bill or its contents and that a Bill must take its place in a queue.  I hope that the same argument I am making now will be applied and accepted when the Government party move over to this side of the House and measures such as this can be accepted in Private Members' Time without opposition for the sake of opposition and voting against it for the sake of voting against it.  Whatever about the Government's refusal last week to take a much more contentious Bill in regard to land.  I do not think this is a contentious measure in the context of party politics.  It is to that extent that the inevitable response of the Minister of State here is regrettable.  It is proper that I should open my contribution on the Bill by regretting that and I am sure other speakers will concur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the mover said, the Bill is an amending one which attempts to amend the two Principal Acts, the 1930 Act and the 1954 Act.  The question of shipwrecks, which is the first section that it relates to in terms of where it wishes to extend or amend the law, has become all the more critical now because of the improved technology which makes the unauthorised piracy of shipwrecks below <Col N="868" /> the high water mark all the more feasible. It is in response to that technological change that this section has been brought in.  It is in response to that new technological reality that the Government should be moving rapidly.  We have seen that they are not prepared or are unwilling or unable to move quickly and it is regrettable that this measure as it stands cannot be accepted in principle on Second Stage by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The question of metal detectors reached a certain prominence because of recent finds in Tipperary and, more to the point, in the UK.  This represents the introduction of a new kind of technology which makes it possible for people who otherwise would not do so to hunt for treasure.  They are not acting particularly on behalf of the national heritage and as a consequence, particularly in a country like Ireland where many treasures were buried in the panic and flight from a Viking raid, many unknown portions of our national heritage which we have not yet seen may come to light in our time or that of our children or grandchildren and are potentially at risk from this kind of activity if we do not attempt to regulate it.  Regulating it by amending the two Principal Acts will not necessarily be the end of the story as people can still do what they propose if they want to do it, but the law would be considerably strengthened if this measure was included. I do not see that as unreasonable. While the Minister has made the inevitable response, I think subsequent Government speakers are under obligation to flesh out the argument presented by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of this Bill proposes to amend and extend the Principal Act in a manner I would welcome very much whereby the guardianship of buildings could be taken over either by the commissioners or, significantly, by a local authority if the buildings were inhabited. I shall come back to that later but I want to run through the extent of the Bill.  The significance of that in the context of a definition of a national monument in 1980 is considerable.  It has an urgency that is as pressing in my view as the need <Col N="869" /> to do something about metal detectors after the Killenaule find.</P>
    <P>There is another very reasonable amendment providing a very sensible precaution regarding the exportation of objects.  Yet the Minister did not see fit to respond to it.  Then there is the question of getting the approval of this House, to which section 9 of this Bill and section 14 of the Principal Act relate, regarding the notification of and approval by the House by way of order.  Unless national monuments are being systematically taken apart every other week the requirement that approval of the Oireachtas be sought before dismantling or destroying a national monument is not unreasonable and will not clutter up our timetable here, particularly in view of the manner in which the Private Members' Bill proposes to bring it before the House.  Lastly there is the section calling for proper examination and systematic reports by licensees who obtain licences to excavate what is the property of all the people of the country in trust of the administration, the national heritage, publication of reports and making known information on their finds.  Again, this is a reasonable amendment.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the question of ancient monuments and extending guardianship, there is a fundamental question here relating to the whole purpose of this House.  We are either concerned about making laws as a legislative Assembly or we are here as rubber stamps with flesh and bones and feet enabling us to walk into the lobbies because an executive of 15 Cabinet Ministers and a non-elected civil service effectively decide what Bills will or will not become law.  We might as well be watching this on television and writing letters to our constituents.  If we are not able to make laws in areas where I believe there is probably substantial agreement or consensus, the whole question of the effectiveness of the Oireachtas in this sovereign Republic must be seriously questioned.  I say that with some regret because I do not think the Minister would come into the House willingly and wantonly trying to put down this proposal.  A good deal of <Col N="870" /> enthusiasm and energy have gone into this Bill.  A Bill has been produced and that is more than the permanent civil service have been able to do over the past ten years for whatever reason.  The reality is that the Bill has been published and, rather than sit down and systematically amend it with all the expertise and experience that the Office of Public Works and the commissioners have, the Government have seen fit to shoot it down because it comes from the wrong side of the House.</P>
    <P>The record should show, and I hope the public will be so informed, that in 1980 in this country republican democracy has been reduced to the level that on a consensus issue we cannot say: &ldquo;Yes, we agree in principle.  We do not like this section and we want to amend that section, but we will take it into Committee Stage and incorporate it in a Government Bill&rdquo;.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned we do not seek a political pound of flesh on this matter.  If the Government want to dress it up and come back with some face-saving formula, we will be more than happy to discuss it with them.</P>
    <P>A provision that I think is becoming increasingly important and which I hope will be incorporated in the official Bill which we are promised in slow gestation is contained in section 5 of this Bill.  The definition of a national monument in 1980 must be seriously reviewed.  I think there was a sense that only those monuments that were manifestly ancient, or manifestly ruins or manifestly belonging to a safe Celtic period would be deemed national monuments with the consequence that when I was a member of Dublin Corporation, part of the problem for a long time was that the official experts who were advising the members of the local authority refused to accept the possibility that this site might even be a national monument.  If in 1975 we were of the view that Wood Quay was potentially a national monument the decisions that a lot of councillors took on the professional advice of the directors of the National Museum would have been different.  We have played far too safe on <Col N="871" /> the definition of what is a national monument.</P>
    <P>Many parts of our towns and cities increasingly, in a corporate sense, whether inhabited buildings, squares or simple aspects of towns or cities, have now become part of our culture and must be brought under the protection of some kind of legislation.  This Private Members' Bill rather than the Planning Acts is the kind of legislation which I envisage would cover it.  Some very interesting theoretical work has been done by a number of sociologists and urbanologists, the most notable being Professor Bogdon Bogdonovich of the University of Budapest, whose work was frequently referred to in 1976 during the European Architectural Heritage year.  It is now clearly accepted by many authorities in Europe generally that national monuments are no longer the big imposing buildings of the established authorities of the day, that the castles, palaces, cathedrals and fortresses only relate to one aspect of a people's culture, usually that of the ruling class of the day whether it be the church, the army or some oligarchy of one kind or another and that, increasingly, the cities and towns that were made and the houses and buildings, whether for working in, living in or for both, which were made by people, are as much a part of the national heritage and consequently constitute a national monument, as the traditional imposing monuments.</P>
    <P>Those buildings are not being protected. The Planning Acts, the 1976 Act and the Principal Act of 1963 do not give adequate protection to such areas we would describe as national monuments particularly if they are lived in. The Minister of State spoke about the rates relief which has now been wiped out.  I am not aware of anybody living in a Georgian-preserved house in Dublin who benefited from rates relief because the building was listed in A or B of the development plan of Dublin city.  I am very well aware of the cost of maintenance and rehabilitation that such an old building requires, particularly if we <Col N="872" /> take into account the damage that is done by heavy trucks and atmospheric fumes of one kind or another on the mortar binding the bricks and all the other technical things that make the preservation of those buildings so costly in 1980.  Between now and the end of the century whole sections of our cities and towns whether it be Galway, Kilkenny, Dublin or elsewhere throughout the country will be undoubtedly at risk.  The Minister of State said that it was up to the owners of those properties to maintain them.  His colleague in the Department of the Environment, implementing and administering the Planning Acts of 1963 and 1976, is giving power to local authorities to put conservation area orders on sections of those towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I have always held that a proposal by a local authority to conserve a particular street façade is an effective form of expropriation if the local authority do not agree to take on some of the obligations of ownership.  That means some contribution towards preservation and maintenance. Dublin Corporation, with which I am very familiar, have listed for conservation whole street façades of the city of Dublin.  They have simply said in their development plan: &ldquo;The front of your building now belongs to the city of Dublin.  You must maintain it and you cannot alter it.  If you let it get into a state of dereliction you are in breach of the law.&rdquo;  The corporation, by doing that, on behalf of the city of Dublin, have expropriated the external façade and appearance of that building but they have not consequently said that in return for doing that and in return for the recognition of part ownership of the property, which is now in that person's name, they will make some sort of contribution towards its upkeep if that is found to be necessary.</P>
    <P>This Bill says in one particular section that with the consent of the local authority the local authority could become the guardian of such a monument. That seems to me to be an adequate provision to enable a local authority, if they so choose and if they <Col N="873" /> have the mandate from the councillors in that local authority, to move to preserve something which they consider to be a national monument.  There is no provision at the moment for members of Dublin City Council to say that they will make a contribution towards the cost of reinstating the derelict buildings along the eastern or southern flank of Mountjoy Square.  If the Minister accepted this Bill in principle tonight Dublin Corporation could possibly do that.  The newspapers as recently as yesterday spoke about the state of dereliction of many buildings in Dublin.  I believe the city of Dublin would willingly contribute towards the restoration of those areas if they had the legal power.  This Bill would enable a local authority to do something they cannot do at the moment.</P>
    <P>I particularly regret that the Minister of State did not see fit to accept the Bill in principle.  It was evident from the way he spoke that he simply saw the Office of Public Works might be made a present of a whole lot of buildings which they could not cope with.  I can accept that, but I do not believe the provision should be turned down on the grounds that the Office of Public Works have not the capacity to respond or that the Commissioners of National Monuments feel that this would be an extraordinary burden on their already overburdened staff. If that is the nature of the resistance and the problem it should be said, and the Office of Public Works should look for additional staff or they should say that if a national monument is inhabited by a person, a family or a group of people, it should be taken into guardianship by the local authority and the local authority should be responsible for it.</P>
    <P>The definition of a national monument in the context of a popular function will move further and further away from the idea of palaces, churches and fortresses to include more and more things of everyday use and familiarity because they are rightly part of our national heritage and deserve protection.  They will be lived in and used in part and in whole.  We have no protection for them at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> The rate of the dereliction of buildings is such that between now and the end of the century many of them will go into decay particularly where large trucks are trundling through cities and towns and the level of air pollution is such that it will attack the fabric of those buildings. That pollutant attack on the fabric of buildings is well known to us.  The National Library had to be substantially repaired because of the pollutant attack on the stonework.  The Acropolis in Athens is under serious risk because of the traffic around it and the air pollution in Athens.  These problems will not go away.  If we have to wait for another ten years for a Bill to come from the Office of Public Works we are talking about another 10 to 15 years, to at least 1990, before we get some kind of response.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister can do between now and the time when the vote is taken on this, but some more substantial response is required from the Government of the day.  This is a Fine Gael measure and it is for them to decide, I suggest, in discussion with the Minister of State, how it could be progressed.  I am sure the mover of the Bill and Deputy Bruton would be more than prepared to sit down and discuss all the ways in which it can be done.  I believe Deputy Donnellan is on record already&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as making such an offer.  Simply to turn it away on the basis that you are doing your own measure or you do not like some of the provisions in it without taking up the clear option of amending it, to say that you are preparing your own Bill and then to admit that you do not even have the heads of it agreed, is to indicate quite clearly that there is a legislative gap at present in our laws which is not being filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all the more galling that this Government party, from the Taoiseach down, tripped over themselves to get into the National Museum to see the Killenaule find and be photographed amply <Col N="875" /> up beside it and celebrated the chance discovery of this find by what would be an illegal detection.  There was nothing to prevent the person who found it from selling that object or giving it to somebody else, and given the current interest in Viking remains and in that era of European history&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that interest, it is quite positive that it would have found a very substantial price in the foreign market if it had been so sold.  Fortunately, the people who did find it were sufficiently public-spirited to do what they did with it.  I hope that they have been properly and adequately compensated and given due recognition for it. However, we have no guarantee that subsequent to that action, because there are a vast number of sites around the country, other people who are doing exactly the same are going to be so imbued with public spirit or a sense of obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be due to the previous incumbent of the Department of Foreign Affairs and perhaps not unrelated to the fact that the find was in Tipperary and not Roscommon, that it was well photographed, publicised and sent around in the journal <i>Ireland Today</i>, and that it was in the National Museum where, rightly, it provoked a lot of interest.  The sense of self-confidence which this nation can derive from looking at works which have been made and fabricated in this country by our forefathers should be enhanced and encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the European Architectural Year a lot of talk and rhetoric were put out by different organisations.  One of the phrases that was carried through that period of 1976 was that a people or a State or a nation without a heritage was like a person without a memory.  That is a very apt description.  Would any of us willingly put our own memory at risk to <Col N="876" /> the extent that our memory would be either capable of being mind-detected away from us or stolen or exported without our agreement?  I do not think so.  We are not talking about anything high-faluting or a minority interest that concerns a small portion of the country's population.  The genuine interest and enthusiasm shown in the Killenaule find are an indication of the real desire there is for some positive action.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the same could be applied to the question of Wood Quay.  In this instance of the tragedy that was Wood Quay and its whole sorry, sad saga the local authority of which I am a member were duped systematically by the officials in the museum.  I am using that verb carefully because I can recall vividly being told assuredly that there was nothing really of value on that site, yet within two years it was declared a national monument.  The public must be informed of the requirement to publish the finds if one excavates.  There is an idea among certain archaeologists that the national heritage is their particular trough from which they would systematically draw PhD or MA theses and the last thing one is supposed to do is to tell anybody about these finds or publish them so that the public might get at them.  That is not a concept of a national heritage at all.  It is like some private research project going on for their benefit with the exclusion of the public.  There may be many reasons why a report on an excavation cannot be completed within a particular time.  I have done research work and I know some of the difficulties attached to that. However, the systematic report back of the finds that a private individual, qualified or otherwise, has, by virtue of the licence granted to him or her, obtained on a national monument is an absolute essential.  The finder should report back to the body who are accountable, this Assembly here, Oireachtas Éireann, and that has not been the case.</P>
    <P>The members of Dublin City Council were treated with utter contempt by the professional archaeologists of that time for reasons which were not related to <Col N="877" /> archaeology.  If the truth were to be told about that occasion, it was because the vaults of the National Museum were full and could not take any more finds from Wood Quay that a decision was made in relation to its non-importance.  There were other matters also and the difficulties were complex, and I use the adjective advisedly.  Wood Quay was a sad saga for many of the people involved directly in it, and this House has heard enough of it to be aware of that.  In the context of this legislation and Second Stage debate in relation to our reporting back and making information available and requiring the consent of the Houses of the Oireachtas before a national monument can be taken apart systematically, I would support that fully.  Once a monument has been declared to be a national monument it is not, therefore, uniquely at the disposal of either well-intentioned or well-motivated civil servants or archaeologists.  There must be some recourse back to the democratic process.</P>

However, I would hope that in the replies from subsequent speakers on the Government side, who have been briefed properly by the Minister of State, that the debate on this Bill will continue for some more time, they would indicate clearly (a) a realistic timetable of that debate and (b) what sections of this very useful legislation&mdash;well worked out as far as I can see leaving aside the technalities of it&mdash;would be incorporated in a Government Bill and what section would not be incorporated, and why.  I welcome this Bill and I regret very much that it seems to be destined to an inevitable defeat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to criticise a Bill being prepared by a colleague from the west of Ireland, Deputy Donnellan. <Col N="878" /> This is the first Bill with which Deputy Donnellan has been associated here in the House and I regret that it is not quite the type of Bill that we would like to see going through.  We have asked and will be asking for the withdrawal of this Bill because, as the Minister has stated, we are in the process of preparing a Bill which will be far more comprehensive and detailed than this rehashing of the former Act.  I suppose this Bill came about basically because of the publicity about the finding of the hoard in Tipperary which was a tremendous boost for this country, and I am delighted that the Taoiseach and all the Ministers took such an interest on behalf of the State.  I am proud that we have a Taoiseach who is involved with cultural as well as political matters.  It is good for this country that this find is being promoted in the booklet <i>Ireland Today</i> by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which was drafted by Deputy Donnellan of the Fine Gael Party with the help of Deputy Bruton, would not be one which we would be inclined to support.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEllistrim, and his Department are working very actively to prepare very detailed legislation.  This situation came about owing to the use of metal detectors.  Deputy Donnellan's Bill deals with the important matter of metal detectors.  Treasure hunting with these devices has become one of the fastest growing hobbies throughout Europe.  It is estimated that there are close on 1,500 treasure hunters in Ireland.  I understand that a club was formed recently to bring these treasure hunters together.  This may be a welcome development, as there will be a tendency for such a group to follow the example of other countries and adopt a code of practice which will embody respect for our national heritage, our monuments and sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My county, Roscommon, is well dotted with sites of an archaeological and historical nature and I would not be inclined to allow the use of these detectors in or near these sites.  However, there are plenty of opportunities for the use of these metal detectors.  On farming land <Col N="879" /> there could be some pieces of treasure buried for many years which could be located.  However, without legal restriction on the use of these instruments the position cannot be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has already stated that the existing legislation provides a reasonable level of protection to our monuments, and this applies even to the users of metal detectors.  As things stand, they may not dig, or otherwise disturb the ground, anywhere in search of archaeological objects.  Furthermore, the Broadcasting Authority Acts require that a licence be obtained to use radio transmission equipment which could and would include equipment of the metal detector class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the question; I am making the case that it could, and it could be tested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say, but in my view there is a case to be made that these detectors could come under the Broadcasting Authority Acts and this could be tested from that point of view.  Anyway, it has not been tested. These detectors are not a major problem at this stage.  I have not seen any being used in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great interest in these detectors and there will be a greater interest in future years.  It could become a very useful and entertaining hobby for a lot of people but we would oppose their use in or near archaeological sites, particularly if they disturbed the ground or any part of the building, which of course is covered under the Acts at the moment.  If the users of these metal detectors detect any sound they should report immediately to the National Monuments Section.  Under no circumstances would I recommend that they interfere with the ground in the pursuit of these objects, because they could do an immense <Col N="880" /> amount of damage.  Any national monument taken into the care of the State is covered by law and anyone interfering with them would be liable to prosecution. That is the basic legal situation at the moment.  I do not think there is any law barring the use of these metal detectors, provided they do not interfere with the actual site or the ground.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnellan proposes to raise the level of fines and to increase the penalties for failure to report, or incorrect reporting of, archaeological objects and for unlicensed archaeological excavation and, generally, for breaches of the provisions <Col N="881" /> set out in his Bill.  However, it would be desirable that penalties for all breaches of the National Monuments Acts should be in proportion to the offence and to each other.  A piecemeal approach will only lead to anomalies where certain offences are subject to high fines and others of equal seriousness bear only minimal penalties. This is another argument in favour of a completely new Act instead of an <i>ad hoc</i> legislation of the type here proposed.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has assured the House that work on the drafting of new legislation is at an advanced stage.  I consider that Deputy Donnellan's Bill should be withdrawn.  Reading through this Bill, it is simply a rehashing and amendment of legislation which the Minister of State agrees, and I do too, should undoubtedly be updated.  The Minister, with the detailed advice of all the experts in his Department, will be in a far better position to provide really good legislation than, with all due respect, Deputy Donnellan, with, I understand, legal advice from Deputy Bruton, whose hand was in the production of this legislation.  As former Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Education, le us be fair about it, Deputy Bruton did not do very much in the National Monuments Section.</P>

      <P>In the constituency of Leitrim and Roscommon, or the new constituency of Roscommon and part of Galway, we are fortunate to have many national monuments.  I pay a special tribute here today to the Minister of State, Deputy McEllistrim, whom I credit for work being started on Roscommon Castle in Roscommon town, the first work that has been carried out there for many years.  Indeed, under the Coalition Government and again when the party of Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Bruton was in power they were not at all concerned about the national monuments in Roscommon. There was not one shilling spent in Roscommon, either on the fine Dominican Abbey or on Roscommon Castle.</P>

He has become really involved in this Department.  Even though he has other responsibilities, such as drainage and so on, in respect of which he is doing very well indeed and was responsible for a major drainage scheme on the Boyle River, North Roscommon &mdash;a scheme which I understand is to start very soon&mdash;he still has time to involve himself in the national monuments section.</P>

That is why I feel deeply committed to and involved in the preservation of our national monuments. I would support any decent Bill that would contribute to the preservation of our heritage but this Bill is a rehash only. I suppose it was produced just to grab some headlines for Deputies Donnellan and Bruton because God knows they need them.

I am sure that people generally will be delighted to await a proper Bill to be prepared by the Government which will be introduced in due coure.</P>
      <P>Again on the subject of national monuments I am asking the Minister to take over a monument at Ringdune, St. John's Castle, in County Roscommon one of the most historical sites in the country.  When and if excavation takes place at that site I hope there will be finds there equal to those in Tipperary. We must remember the archaeological and historical finds, like the Cross of Cong, that have been made in Roscommon, examples of the fine workmanship of our predecessors in my county.  I know the Minister of State is very sympathetic to Roscommon.  If the necessary funds are made available I hope that the Board of Works excavating there will make discoveries equal to anything found in the past.</P>
      <P>I am anxious also that work be carried out to Ballintubber Castle, near Castlerea, about 15 miles from Roscommon town.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt referring to the recommendation made by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence of the Australian Parliament in their report of November 1979 entitled &ldquo;Human Rights in the Soviet Union&rdquo;. This recommendation was &ldquo;that the Australian Government give consideration to the establishment of a permanent, independent, international organisation to inquire into the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes&rdquo;.  The Australian Government have not yet stated their position on the matter.  If the Australian Government were to propose the establishment of such an international organisation and to seek our support, the Government would then consider the matter and take a decision in due course.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a &ldquo;Freedom Charter&rdquo; was adopted at a meeting on 26 June 1955 by a number of South African organisations.  I am, generally, in sympathy with the aspirations and objectives contained in the charter&mdash;and end to apartheid and equality for all in South Africa.  It is not, however, our practice to commemorate specific anniversaries of this nature.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to make known as the United Nations their opposition to apartheid and their view that fundamental changes leading to the abolition of apartheid are required.  The Government will also continue to seek such changes in co-operation with its partners in the Nine but consider that, in the absence of diplomatic relations, representations by Ireland directly to South Africa are not likely to be effective.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the <Col N="741" /> Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies may be aware, ten of the 15 seats on the United Nations Security Council are filled by election from the general membership of the UN for periods of two years at a time.  Under present arrangements, two of these seats are held by states belonging to the Western European and others (WEO) Group; both of these fall vacant at the end of this year.  We have indicated our intention to seek election at this autumn's General Assembly to one of these seats for the period 1981-82.</P>
      <P>It is our hope that the WEO Group may be able to reach agreement to endorse two candidates, including Ireland, for the two seats.  In the event of endorsement, candidates are normally elected as a matter of course by the General Assembly.  Agreement within the group is, however, far from certain; in its absence, there would be an open election in which the candidates seek support from all UN member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of Ireland's becoming a member of the Security Council we would continue to approach foreign policy issues on the same lines as we do <Col N="742" /> now.  In particular, Ireland's election to the Security Council would not mean any change in our policy in regard to military alliances.  Elected members of the council come from all regional groups and reflect different tendencies in international affairs.  The WEO seats on the Security Council have frequently been held by states that are not members of NATO, for example Australia, Finland, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated in my reply to Question No. 37, I hope, if the need arises and if there are savings in the multilateral allocations, to be able to transfer funds from the multilateral side. Although it is too early yet to say whether there will be savings or how much might be available, it will, of course, be necessary for me to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in order to effect such a transfer.</P>

      <P>Ireland signed the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Radical Discrimination on 21 March 1968.  It is the intention of the Government to ratify the Convention.</P>
      <P>Discussions as to the steps, including domestic legislation, that would be necessary to give effect to obligations under the convention are continuing between the Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>I agree that it is desirable that we should ratify the convention but there is no direct connection between the convention and our candidature for the Security Council and I do not consider that we would have postponed seeking election to the Security Council on this account.</P>

Multilateral agreements of a technical nature are not published as they are available through the relevant organisations responsible for these agreements.</P>
      <P>An index to the series was published in 1954, 1962, 1967 and 1975 which lists all the international agreements published up to 1970 inclusive.  The most recent index, for 1971 to 1976 inclusive, will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 and 346 together.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their Twelfth Interim Report recommend, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Dublin Metropolitan District be extended to include the whole of Dublin city and county with the exception of the District Electoral Division of Rathmichael.  It is my intention to proceed with this recommendation.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of Rathmichael arises from the fact that, for local government purposes, it forms part of Bray Urban District.  However, any request that it be included in the revised Dublin Metropolitan District would be considered on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as transferring certain areas to the Dún Laoghaire District Court is concerned the position is that, in the event of the Dublin Metropolitan District <Col N="748" /> being extended to include them, it would be for the President of the District Court to decide the court venue or venues at which the business from those areas would be transacted.</P>

    <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to Questions Nos. 123 and 142 on 4 July 1979, it is impossible to lay down any hard and fast measures for the conservation of fuel in the use of official cars and it must be left to individual Ministers and Ministers of State to take account of the need to conserve fuel in the use of the official cars assigned to them.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 and 362 together.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in reply to a previous question in this House (Official Report, column 1265, 21 November, 1978), the statistical records kept in court offices do not, as a practical matter, enable civil actions related specifically to the non-payment of ground rents to be distinguished from other actions.  Apart from any other consideration, that distinction would involve a decision in each case as to whether the particular rent should or should not be described as a ground rent and this would involve an assessment of the terms of the particular lease or tenancy and perhaps of other matters also.  The same considerations apply in the case of ejectment orders.</P>

      <P>It may be taken that, if the District Court Rules committee consider that there is a need for permitting cases outside the Dublin Metropolitan District to be dealt with at any sitting of the court in the relevant District Court District, the rules will be amended accordingly.</P>

      <P>The only social work posts funded directly by my Department are in the Probation and Welfare Service of my Department. These posts are not deployed by reference to health board or community care areas but by reference to the activities of the service, which involve servicing the courts, the prisons and places of detention, the special schools, the Youth Encounter Scheme, the Adoption Board and also involve looking after persons <Col N="754" /> after their release from custody. There are at present 129 posts in the basic grade of probation and welfare officer and they are deployed throughout the country as follows: Dublin 71, Cork Nine, Limerick Nine, Kerry Five, Wexford Five, Waterford Five, Westmeath Five, Galway Five, Sligo Five, Louth Six, Wicklow One, Cavan One, Laois One, Tipperary One.  In addition there are 24 senior probation and welfare officer posts, four assistant principal probation and welfare officer posts and one principal probation and welfare officer post.</P>
      <P>Social work posts in voluntary adoption societies are partly funded by annual grants paid by my Department.

      <P>The only children who could be said to be in public care in institutions funded by or under the direct control of my Department are boys in the 12 to 16 age group detained in Loughan House, the Special School at Blacklion, County Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, under section 69 of the Children Act, 1908, a boy is conditionally discharged from the school to return to his parent's home or to stay with friends, it is made a condition of the discharge that he accept supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service of my Department.  Where a boy is discharged other than to reside with his parents or <Col N="755" /> friends, accommodation is made available to him in a hostel.  These hostels are run by voluntary committees which are supported by grants from my Department and they provide accommodation for older boys also.  To date boys from Loughan House have been accommodated in Sarsfield House and in Lions Villa.</P>
    <P>The amounts paid by my Department to the committees of those two hostels in respect of 1979 were £16,827.78 and £21,691.60 respectively.</P>
    <P>Where a boy has completed his full period in the school he is discharged unconditionally. In such a case counselling and advice facilities are only provided by the Probation and Welfare Services for the boy and his family if they are prepared to accept those facilities.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities consider that the provision of a sub-station in the Sheriff Street area would not be warranted at present and that the existing arrangements whereby the area is served from Store Street station make the best use of available police resources.  One of the difficulties about providing a new station in any area is that the members necessary for station duty would have to be supplied from existing Garda strength in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, <Col N="756" /> thereby reducing the number of men available for outdoor police duties.</P>
      <P>Special measures have been taken by the Garda to deal with the incidence of crime in the area and every effort is being made to maintain a high level of patrolling there on a 24-hour basis having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.</P>
      <P>As regards the association's suggestions relating to custodial care, the position is that the provision of custodial care for children between seven and 16 years is primarily a matter for the Minister for Education.  Loughan House is being operated by my Department as a special school for boys between 12 and 16 years as an interim measure pending the building of a new school by the Department of Education at Lusk.  The old St. Vincent's School premises, which were mentioned by the association in this context, have been acquired by my Department for a staff training school and for prison staff housing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1980 civil service recruitment programme is already well under way <Col N="762" /> and assignments made by the Civil Service Commission during the first five months of 1980 totalled 3,748.  Comparable figures for the same period in 1979 would not be valid because of the postal dispute but the comparable figure for the same period in 1978 was 2,703. The recruitment programme in 1980 will continue as planned.</P>
    <P>Employment opportunities in the public service for young people also exist in the Garda Síochána and the Army and there are current recruitment campaigns for these services.</P>
    <P>It is important to see youth as part of the overall labour market and the Government's total job creation efforts for 1980 will substantially benefit young people.  The significant measures involved in the Government's job creation package include increased allocations for the Industrial Development Authority, the public capital programme and the creation of the Employment Guarantee Fund which is being jointly financed by the Government and employers' organisations.</P>
    <P>In addition, a number of special youth employment schemes introduced by the Government over the past few years to alleviate youth unemployment are continuing in 1980.  The success of these schemes may be gauged from the fact that from a participation of about 2,000 young people in 1977 the participation last year rose to over 11,000.  It is hoped that the number of young people who will benefit from these schemes during 1980 will at least continue at this level or even increase.</P>
    <P>The four main such schemes are&mdash;the Environmental Improvements Scheme Programme, the Temporary Grants Scheme for Youth Employment, the Worker Experience Programme and the Community Youth Training Programme. The Environment Improvements Scheme which is implemented by local authorities provides for the employment of unemployed young people under 25 years of ago on work of an environmental, amenity or recreational value to the community.  Under the Temporary Grants Scheme administered by the Department of Education, grants are <Col N="763" /> provided to youth and sport organisations towards the cost of the projects aimed at improving local amenities.  The Work Experience Programme administered by the National Manpower Service of the Department of Labour is aimed particularly at unemployed school-leavers in the 18 to 20 age group; by placing them with employers in the private and public sectors for a 26 week period these young persons are enabled to gain practical experience over a range of different jobs and this enhances considerably their prospects of suitable permanent employment.  Indeed, over 80 per cent of the WEP participants have got permanent jobs more than half of them in the firms with which they were originally placed.  The AnCO Community Youth Training Programme provides grants towards employing young people on projects designed to improve existing amenities or provide extra amenities for the community.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department provide a service for any person seeking employment and for employers recruiting staff.  I would suggest that young persons leaving school this year who are seeking employment, should call to their local office of the National Manpower Service where they will be given advice on careers, employment opportunities and training courses etc.</P>
    <P>I should also mention the special programme introduced by the Government this year for the provision of sports and leisure centres throughout the country which will provide both employment and recreational facilities for young people. An allocation in excess of £5 million has been provided for this project.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to the House that I am awaiting a report being prepared by a sub-Committee of the Manpower Consultative Committee on Youth Employment.  I understand that this report is being considered at present by the Manpower Consultative Committee and should be available to me shortly. I hope to be in a position to make a statement regarding the recommendations <Col N="764" /> of the Committee in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>Detailed guidelines on the procedures to be followed in the recruitment of child care workers in residential homes under the aegis of the Departments of Health and Education were agreed with the Resident Managers Association and circulated in December 1979.  The guidelines cover the requirements referred to by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>These homes are financed on a capitation basis and I am satisfied that the <Col N="776" /> procedures for recoupment of expenditure to the homes are adequate to ensure proper accountability.</P>

These special centres are financed under a budget system, which incorporates the normal safeguards applying to budget arrangements in the health services.</P>

      <P>Regular meetings take place between officers of my Department, the Department of Education and a sub-committee of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors representing the managers of the majority of residential child care homes.  At these meetings issues arising in residential care and in the operation of residential homes are discussed.</P>
      <P>A small numbers of homes, providing approximately 5 per cent of the total number of residential child care places available are not represented by the sub-committee referred to above.</P>
      <P>The managers of these homes were invited some time ago to discuss with officers of my Department the main developments in child care and the question of their representation in future discussions concerning residential care.  It is the intention of my Department to keep these homes fully involved in any developments in residential care and to involve them in regular meetings with the representatives of the majority of homes.</P>

      <P>The manager of each residential home, normally in consultation with the relevant health board, makes arrangements for <Col N="782" /> the care of children when the time comes for them to leave the home.  Health boards support homes which provide accommodation for young people aged 16 and over while completing their education or apprenticeship.  Many homes continue to provide accommodation to young people until they find a job or an alternative place to live.</P>
      <P>Health board social workers assist young people leaving residential homes in finding employment and accommodation. They also advise them on the services available to them and may also help them financially.  A number of health boards support hostel facilities for the after-care of young people who have lived in residential care.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give separate revenue costs for after-care of children and young people as the costs are part of the on-going child care services.  In 1979 a grant of £40,000 was made available to the South-Eastern Health Board to support the provision of after-care accommodation for boys and girls.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit in respect of five separate periods of incapacity between 2 April 1979 and 28 May 1980.  Payment of benefit could not be authorised as her insurance cards for the contribution years 1977-78 and 1978-79, on which entitlement to benefit depended, had not been received in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following inquiries it was established that she had been in insurable employment for sufficient weeks in each of these contribution years to qualify for benefit but the stamped cards have not been received from the employer.  Special credits have, however, been allowed in respect of the weeks of insurable employment in those years.  These credits <Col N="785" /> have the effect of qualifying her for benefit in respect of all five claims.  Payment of all disability benefit due was issued on 13 June 1980.  The question of her entitlement to pay-related benefit is being investigated and payment, if any due, will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The claims of persons living in the Republic whose only employment is in Northern Ireland are normally the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Ministry.  Persons who become wholly unemployed here may, in accordance with EEC Regulations, be entitled to payment of unemployment benefit, including pay-related benefit under the Social Welfare Acts, if their contributions in Northern Ireland included an element for unemployment and if they satisfy the statutory qualifying contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons who have paid the full rate of contributions in the Republic and in Northern Ireland may have the contributions paid in both parts of the country aggregated for the purpose of establishing entitlement to old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widow's pension, orphan's contributory allowance and treatment benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  Such persons may in fact qualify for payment of pension in both parts of the country.  The special provision in relation to unemployment benefit also applies to persons who have insurance in both parts of the country and who become wholly unemployed in the Republic.</P>

      <P>The method used is provided for in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, as amended.  The actual income from the sources mentioned by the Deputy is not taken as the means. Instead a value is put on the capital using the following formula:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Non-contributory old age pension.</i></P>
      <P>The first £200 of capital is excluded. The yearly value is taken as 5 per cent of the next £375, plus 10 per cent of the balance over £575.</P>

      <P>Drogheda Harbour Commissioners have submitted proposals for amendment of their pilotage bye-laws so as to provide for increased pilotage dues. I have recently directed the commissioners to publish the required <Col N="794" /> statutory notice of their proposals and when the time for receipt of objections-representations has expired I will have a decision conveyed to the commissioners without delay.</P>
      <P>The commissioners have also applied for my consent to increase charges for the use of cranes and grabs at the harbour. I am awaiting further information from the Commissioners in regard to that application.</P>
