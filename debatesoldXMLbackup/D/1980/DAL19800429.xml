    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will make representations to the British authorities to remove the permanent military checkpoints on the four main Donegal Border road crossings namely, Lifford Bridge, Mullennan, Bridgend and Muff, as these are the only remaining permanent military checkpoints along the Border and are a source of delay and harassment for persons travelling on these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The British authorities are aware of the anxiety of the Government that the inconvenience caused to traffic by the presence of cross-Border security checkpoints should be minimised.  I raised the matter at the meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 15 April.  Indeed, the British share our concern.  However, checkpoints are necessary for security purposes and as long as the present situation continues, some measure of inconvenience will be inevitable.</P>
      <P>When representations are made to me about the situation at any particular crossing, the matter is investigated and, where appropriate is pursued with the British authorities.  I have received no such representations recently in regard to Lifford Bridge, Mullennan, Bridgend or Muff.  If the Deputy could supply details of the delay and harassment to which he refers I will have the matter investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken note of the fact that this group of crossings in and out of Donegal, starting with Claddy bridge and moving north as far as Muff, are exceptional?  These crossings are all in and out of Donegal, particularly north Donegal and, where other crossings have been removed, new ones have been added in this case.  Will the Minister take note of that?  I will get him the information in relation to harassment <Col N="5" /> and the times of such that goes on at these points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will designate the Republic of Zimbabwe as a country for special priority in our bilateral aid programme in view of their emergence from a period of bitter civil war with the consequent damage to life and property and the need for a programme of reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the practical measures by way of aid or otherwise, being taken in response to the request by the Government of Zimbabwe for assistance from the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Although the new Government of Zimbabwe have not made a formal request for assistance to us, we are aware that the new State will need support in order to overcome its short-term difficulties and to lay the basis for its future economic development.</P>
      <P>As the bilateral aid programme is already fully committed for the current year, the bulk of funds being allocated to four countries&mdash;Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia&mdash;it is not at this stage envisaged that Zimbabwe would be included among the &ldquo;priority&rdquo; or concentration countries in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government will be most anxious to assist and co-operate with this newly independent state the exact form and content of this co-operation will need to be determined in the light of the wishes of the new Government of Zimbabwe and of available resources. Our usual practice, in formulating our development co-operation programmes is to respond to the wishes of our partner <Col N="6" /> countries, in whatever way is appropriate, after joint examination of the possibilities for co-operation envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the bilateral programme is committed for this year but, having regard to the nature of the relationship and the fact that the Zimbabwe republic is the only African State in which there is a substantial Irish population or population of Irish origin, is the Minister prepared at this stage to indicate the willingness of the Government to enter into negotiations with the Government of Zimbabwe with a view to incorporating it in the bilateral programme for 1981?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will certainly investigate the matter with a view to doing what the Deputy suggests and, although it is not strictly relevant to the question, we will be sending a trade mission there inside a matter of a month or six weeks organised by CTT with a view to establishing trade contacts and possible outlets.  But I agree with the Deputy on the importance of this new State and its great potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to cut across my colleague.  Is it the situation that, apart from good intentions, really we have nothing to offer by way of response to the appeal which this State has made to the international community for aid to get itself up off the ground?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The opening of diplomatic relations with states with which we do not at present have formal relations is a matter which is kept under continuous review in the light of our international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.  It would be inappropriate and contrary to international practice to speculate publicly about the Government's possible intention in regard to the establishment of a resident diplomatic mission in Zimbabwe or elsewhere as this requires the prior agreement of the State concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> With regard to the possible appointment of honorary consuls abroad, this, too, is a matter that is kept under constant review and requires the prior agreement of the other state.  In the case of Zimbabwe the Government there have not yet indicated their attitude in principle to honorary consular representation. It is premature, therefore, to contemplate the appointment of an honorary consul in that country.</P>
    <P>I can, however, say that this whole question is under consideration at present and the Government hope to establish diplomatic relations with Zimbabwe as soon as it is feasible to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what the Minister has just said about the time limit involved, is the delay on this side or on their side?  Can he give a timetable before negotiations can start?  Having regard to the fact that the Republic of Zimbabwe is the only African state in which there are up to 20,000 people of Irish origin, would he not agree that it must rank for priority for a full residential diplomatic presence from the Republic of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have initiated talks with the Zimbabwe Government with a view to ascertaining from them what sort of diplomatic presence they want established in Zimbabwe.  These talks are proceeding at present.  As an immediate way of dealing with the matter we may accredit a neighbouring Ambassador there.  I appreciate the importance of having an immediate diplomatic representation.  The initial reaction was not that favourable towards having the honorary consul type of representation.  I prefer the more professional type of representation.  They are thinking in terms of that and so am I.  What we will do fairly soon, as a start, is accredit one of our Ambassadors in a neighbouring African state to take in Zimbabwe as part of his mandate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in a written reply in the Dáil on 4 March last, the instability in El Salvador and its violent repercussions have been a source of grave concern to the Government.  The country's gradual drift towards civil war, with all its terrible consequences, appears to have been even further hastened by the deliberately provoked killings of innocent civilians during the funeral of Archbishop Romero at the end of last month.  The Government condemn unreservedly this abhorrent and cowardly act.  The <Col N="10" /> callousness of the deliberate massacre, which was clearly designed to achieve a political purpose, was demonstrated by the fact that the majority of those who died were reported as being elderly people who had come to pay their last respects to the memory of a man who had fought so valiantly to uphold their rights.</P>
    <P>It appears to us that political stability in El Salvador can only be achieved when the people of El Salvador have been given the opportunity to choose freely an administration which would truly reflect their wishes and which would commit itself to the principles of equality, social justice and respect for human rights.  Where, as in El Salvador, chronically unequal distribution of wealth exists, a stable society cannot develop until such time as genuine attempts are made to raise the standard of living of the majority of the population. However, before any real progress can be made on such basic reforms, it is clear the immediate problem of the country's drift towards further violence and possibly civil war must be averted. Urgent and genuine efforts by all sectors of the community are required in order that agreement may be reached on some common action which would receive the support of the majority of the population and halt the growing polarisation between left and right.</P>
    <P>While contacts between Ireland and El Salvador are limited, it appears to us that an important element in the present situation in El Salvador is the inability of the present administration, in the face of growing violence from right and left, to exert its control or to make any concrete attempts to institute basic reforms. Given the right circumstances, however, it is conceivable that the present regime could act as an interim administration and restore some form of stability pending the election of a representative Government.  It will be appreciated therefore that the question of an immediate arms embargo against the present regime in El Salvador, regarding which representations have been received, needs to be considered <Col N="11" /> carefully.  An embargo on arms to a particular country is normally a matter for individual states to decide and the United Nations has only instituted an arms embargo where there has been a clear threat to international peace and security, and not in the case of the violation of human rights in a particular country.  However, the representations which the Government have received on this matter are receiving careful attention.</P>
    <P>The violation of human rights by all the opposing factors in this tragic situation clearly warrants discussion at international level and the Government are presently considering how the matter might be raised in the most appropriate United Nations forum and what support might be available from other countries for such action.  Ireland is also continuing to keep the development of the situation in El Salvador under close review, together with our partners in the Community.</P>
    <P>On 31 March the Nine member states of the EEC, including Ireland, issued a joint statement on the tragic death of Archbishop Romero.  The statement was as follows:</P>
    <P>The Governments of the member States of the European Community express their condemnation of the assassination of Monsignor Oscar Arnulfo Romero, Archbishop of San Salvador.  They remain firm in their conviction that this deplorable crime will not prevent the ideals of justice and respect of human rights embodied by Monsignor Romero and deeply felt by the Nine from being asserted. </P>
    <P>As I stated in my message of sympathy to the President of the Episcopal Conference of El Salvador following the assassination of Archbishop Romero, it is our hope that a situation will come about whereby his great work for social justice and his concern to ensure full respect for human rights will be carried forward for the benefit of all the people of El Salvador.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister, with a certain feeling of helplessness that very little can be done but bearing in mind not alone the awful death of Archbishop Romero but also the fact that about 1,000 people have died since last year there, would indicate if anything positive or constructive is taking place at the UN or if there is any concrete proposal to try to bring some kind of pressure to bear on the situation or have some kind of intervention.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that there is a very serious contrast in our attitude to Afghanistan and to the Lebanon?  We made a very brisk and completely justified protest to President Carter who armed the Israelis who armed Haddad.  In the circumstances of the appalling killing in El Salvador we <Col N="14" /> have a very lackadaisical attitude to the whole area where we could make a protest.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our action in the Lebanon was taken within a United Nations context and we are trying to do this in El Salvador also.  Within the United Nations umbrella it is not easy to do what one would like to do about regimes where it is alleged that breaches of civil and human rights have occurred.  The UN have moved reasonably effectively in areas where there have been breakdowns in civil governments.  The establishment of a United Nations presence can help, as happened in Cyprus, the Congo and the Lebanon, where they have run into some difficulties. It is very difficult for the United Nations within the present structure to do much about El Salvador, the Philippines and a few other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government condemn violations of human rights wherever they occur and have consistently striven, in international organisations and through the channels open to them, to bring about an end to such violations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the policy of the Government of the United States in regard to the provision of military assistance to other countries is one for that government themselves to decide.  I do not believe that it would be appropriate for us to make representations <Col N="17" /> in the matter.  I have however noted that in a number of cases US military assistance to other countries has been suspended because the US considered that the human rights situation in those countries was seriously unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>As regard the question of trade relations, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given on this matter by my predecessor on 8 November 1979.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it not been the persistent policy of successive Governments to maintain a position of non-commitment, of neutrality, in respect of issues generally?  If one does not accept that, and if one is not necessarily linked to the Americans on these issues, do we not take up the position in regard to Afghanistan that violations of human rights have taken place there and that we will be justified in taking up a particular posture?  Why can we not do that in regard to El Salvador also?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are aware of the report published earlier this year by Amnesty International which <Col N="18" /> alleged that torture has been used against political prisoners in Singapore. The Government have also noted that the Government of Singapore are reported to have rejected, in a statement on 31 March, the allegations of physical ill-treatment contained in that report.</P>
      <P>In the joint statement issued on 6 March by the Foreign Ministers of the EC countries, including Ireland, and of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, which comprises Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, the Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to world peace, international co-operation and understanding, economic development, social justice and human rights.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government have consistently condemned the violation of human rights wherever they may occur.  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively promote the protection of human rights, particularly in regard to torture of persons in custody, by all available means and particularly in international fora such as the United Nations General Assembly.</P>

No small country has been anything like as active as we have been in promoting human rights, in seeking to back the United Nations wherever they have stepped in to prevent minor wars breaking out, or more important, to prevent greater wars breaking out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The events up to 16 April last were the subject of my statement to the Dáil on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will already be aware that, following the abduction and murder of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne in the South Lebanon on 18 April, the Government <Col N="23" /> held a special meeting on the morning of Sunday, 20 April.  Following the meeting, the Government issued a statement expressing their serious concern, setting out their views on the position of the United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon and the Irish contingent, and outlining the action they intended to take in this regard.  I will circulate this for inclusion in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>I would not, therefore, intend to repeat its contents in detail.  However, I think that I should reiterate the Government's belief that UNIFIL has made a significant contribution towards the prevention of an outbreak of more general hostilities in the Middle East and their belief that Ireland should continue to play its part in the UN peacekeeping effort by maintaining its contingent with the force.  Any UN peacekeeping operation, however, depends fundamentally on a necessary minimum of co-operation and support from the Governments who wish to see it interposed between parties in conflict.  It cannot function effectively if it is prevented by deliberate policy from full deployment in its area of operation, and if it is the target of harassment and attack by forces supplied, trained, advised and supported from outside by a UN member state.</P>
    <P>All involved must now see that it is necessary, once and for all, to create conditions which will allow the force to carry out its mandate in every respect, throughout the area assigned to it, in conditions of adequate security for its personnel.  The Government have noted that on 18 April the Security Council which set up the force and gave it its mandate stated its intention &ldquo;to take such determined action as the situation calls for to enable UNIFIL to take immediate and total control of its entire area of operation up to the internationally recognised boundaries&rdquo; and they look to the Council for this action. In the Government's view, taking account of the fact that the role of the force is a peacekeeping one, this requires specific decisions of a political and diplomatic character, leading to the <Col N="24" /> removal of all outside support for the Haddad forces.</P>
    <P>Following a debate on the situation in the Southern Lebanon which took place over two weeks ago, the Security Council adopted a resolution on the subject on 24 April 1980.  In this, it reaffirmed its determination to implement its previous resolutions in the totality of the area of operations assigned to UNIFIL up to the internationally recognised boundaries, and strongly deplored acts that have led to loss of life and physical injuries among UNIFIL personnel.</P>
    <P>The Acting Permanent Representative of Ireland in New York addressed the Council on two occasions in recent weeks.  He has also kept in constant touch with the Secretary-General, responsible officials in the Secretariat, and representatives of the other troop-contributing countries.</P>
    <P>I should recall that UNIFIL is under the command of the United Nations, vested in the Secretary-General, under the authority of the Security Council. Command in the field is exercised by the Force Commander appointed by, and responsible to, the Security Council.</P>
    <P>For their part, the Government are endeavouring to assist the UN and the Secretary-General in promoting this objective by diplomatic means.  I have invited the other troop contributing countries and the Secretary-General to participate in a meeting at ministerial level in Dublin on Friday next to discuss the serious difficulties faced by UNIFIL in carrying out the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council and the conditions that would be necessary to enable the force to function effectively and with reasonable security for its personnel.</P>
    <P>The Irish ambassador to Israel met Prime Minister Begin on 20 April to convey to him the contents of the Government's statement and the Taoiseach's personal concern about recent developments. The Prime Minister subsequently reported on the meeting to the Israeli Cabinet.  The Prime Minister unreservedly condemned the killing of the Irish soldiers and reiterated that Israel would <Col N="25" /> do its best to end the harassment of UNIFIL by the <i>de facto</i> forces.  He repeated that Israel did not control Major Haddad. The ambassador emphasised that, in view of the nature of the relationship between Israel and Major Haddad, the Irish Government looked to Israel to restrain him effectively.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Nine in Luxembourg on 22 April, the Foreign Ministers agreed, on my proposal, to issue a statement expressing their revulsion at recent events and calling strongly on all concerned to give their fullest support to the measures decided on by the Security Council, so that UNIFIL may be in a position to carry out in full its peacekeeping mission. This statement, a copy of which I will also circulate for inclusion in the Official Report, is being brought to the attention of the Israeli Government by the Italian Presidency.  I know that the Nine will continue to give their full support to the effort to enable UNIFIL to operate effectively and in reasonable security.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has also written a personal letter to President Carter, asking him to use to the full all the influence his Government can command in the present situation, and thanking him for the US Government's helpful interventions in the past.  I am having a copy of this letter placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>As regards reports by the United Nations, I am also arranging to have placed in the Dáil Library copies of special reports issued by the Secretary-General, subsequent to those referred to in my statement to the Dáil of 16 April last.  In accordance with standing regulations relating to death in UN service, the United Nations will, of course, carry out an investigation into the circumstances of these deaths, but this has not yet been completed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I know that the House will join with me in extending our deepest sympathy to the family, relatives and friends of these soldiers who died while courageously carrying out their duties in the most difficult circumstances in the service of the United Nations and <Col N="26" /> in the cause of world peace.  I am confident that the contingent now beginning its tour of duty will carry out its tasks in the same impartial and competent manner that has brought Irish UN units so much honour in the past.</P>
    <P>Following are the statements referred to:</P>
    <P>Statement following Government meeting Sunday 20 April 1980.</P>
    <P> 1.  The Government held a special meeting this morning to consider the situation arising from the murder on Friday of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne, two members of the Defence Forces serving with the UN Force in Lebanon, and the death some days previously of Private Griffin from injuries received earlier.</P>
    <P>2.  The Government expressed their deepest sympathy to the families and relatives of the three men, all of whom died while courageously carrying out their duty in the service of the United Nations and in the cause of peace.  The bereaved families should know that everyone in Ireland shares their grief and their sense of loss.  That this grief is shared by the international community is evident from the many moving expressions of sympathy which the Government have received from abroad.</P>
    <P>3.  Following these wanton killings the Government heard reports from the Minister for Defence and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, including the steps taken by Irish representatives at the United Nations and in various capitals during and immediately after the latest tragic incidents.</P>
    <P>4.  Ireland has a long and honourable record of service to UN peacekeeping over many years.  The Government believe strongly that this commitment should be maintained and that the officers and men of Ireland's Defence Forces should continue, as they have for 22 years to play their part effectively in peacekeeping operations at the request of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>5.  The Government are extremely concerned at recent developments and at the further difficulties which have been <Col N="27" /> placed in the way of the force in carrying out its mandate from the Security Council effectively, and in conditions of reasonable security for its personnel.</P>
    <P>6.  In the dangerous situation in the Middle East, the UN Peacekeeping Force in Lebanon has a particularly important&mdash;indeed a vital&mdash;role to play. The force has made a significant contribution towards the prevention of an outbreak of more general hostilities in the Middle East.  The precipitate withdrawal of the force now would dangerously upset such stability as exists in the area.  Such a withdrawal could lead to intervention by other outside forces.  At the present time of heightened international tensions this could have the most serious consequences and might easily lead to wider war.</P>
    <P>7.  The Government recognise this, and they believe that Ireland should continue to play its part in the UN peacekeeping effort by maintaining its contingent with the force.  But any UN peacekeeping operation depends fundamentally on acceptance of the force, and of its role, in the area where it is to serve, and on a necessary minimum of co-operation and support from the Governments who wish to see it interposed between parties in conflict.  No UN peacekeeping force can function effectively if it is prevented by deliberate policy from full deployment in its area of operation; nor can the participating countries allow the officers and men of their forces who have volunteered for service at the request of the international community to be the target of harassment and attack by hostile irregular forces which are supplied, trained, advised and supported from outside by a UN member state on the grounds that it considers the existence and the activities of those forces to be helpful to its security.</P>
    <P>8.  The Government understand that Israel is concerned for its security; and they sympathise with the grief felt by the people of Israel when death or injury is caused by attack from across its border as in the recent tragic incident at Misgav <Col N="28" /> Am.  They emphasise, however, that there is no evidence that the infiltrators who carried out this attack came through the area where UNIFIL has been allowed to exercise effective control. Governments in the region, and all those Governments which wish the force to continue in being, must now see that it is necessary once and for all to create conditions which will allow it to carry out its mandate in every respect, throughout the area assigned to it, in conditions of adequate security for its personnel.  It is clear, that a return to the situation as it existed before the attack on At-Tiri two weeks ago, while it may be a first step, is quite insufficient.</P>
    <P>9.  At their meeting today, the Government noted that, on the evening of Friday, 17 April, following the murder of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne, the President of the UN Security Council, with the agreement of all 15 member states, made an important statement at a special meeting of the Council.  In it he reaffirmed</P>
    <P>the intention of the Council to take such determined action as the situation calls for to enable UNIFIL to take immediate and total control of its entire area of operations up to the internationally recognised boundaries. </P>
    <P>The Government now look to the UN Security Council for this action.  Specific decisions must be taken of a political and diplomatic character to implement the stated intention of the Council, taking account of the fact that the role of the force is a peacekeeping one.</P>
    <P>10.  In particular, the intention of the Council that UNIFIL should take &ldquo;immediate and total control of its entire area of operations&rdquo;, requires that the irregular Haddad forces who have been the major source of the problems created for the UN Force, and the direct cause of the recent loss of life by Irish soldiers, must cease their harassment and attacks. This means that they must be deprived of all outside support so that there will be an end, once and for all, to the threat which they have posed, almost on a daily basis, to the units of the force since it was first set up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> 11.  The Government have therefore decided to propose to the other troop-contributing countries that at an early date they consult closely with each other and with the UN Secretary-General to consider how far such measures as may now be taken by the Security Council, which has the responsibility in the matter, will be adequate to ensure that the force can function effectively and with due regard for the safety of its personnel. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will now seek to arrange an early meeting at Ministerial level with the other troop contributing countries.  First contacts are already under way to this end.</P>
    <P>12.  The Government have noted the assurances given by Prime Minister Begin of Israel to President Carter that Israel would co-operate fully with UNIFIL.  On the instructions of the Taoiseach, the Irish Ambassador to Israel, Mr. Seán Ronan, will meet Prime Minister Begin today to convey to him the Taoiseach's deep personal concern. He will discuss with the Prime Minister how Israel intends to carry out the assurances it has given and deal effectively with the forces of Major Haddad.</P>
    <P>13.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will also bring the present serious situation to the attention of the Foreign Ministers of Ireland's partners in the Nine, at the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday and Tuesday and he will inform them of the views and of the concern of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>14.  The Government are keeping the whole situation under continuing review. </P>
    <P>Statement by the Foreign Ministers of the Nine on the situation in Southern Lebanon and the position of the UNIFIL Force.</P>
    <P> 1.  The Foreign Ministers of the Nine member States of the European Community meeting in Luxembourg on 22 April considered recent developments in relation to the United Nations PeaceKeeping Force in Southern Lebanon (UNIFIL).</P>
    <P>2.  They expressed their profound <Col N="30" /> revulsion at the recent killing of soldiers of the force and especially at the brutal and cold-blooded murder on 18 April by the irregular forces of Major Haddad of two unarmed soldiers of the Irish contingent.</P>
    <P>3.  The Ministers recalled their statement of 11 September, 1979 reaffirming their support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and calling on all parties to give full assistance to the UNIFIL operation and to respect the decisions of the Security Council.  They express very serious concern that armed attacks continue to be made on the UNIFIL troops, installations and equipment and that obstacles continue to be placed in the way of the force in its efforts to carry out effectively, and throughout the whole of its area of operation, the peacekeeping mandate it received from the Security Council.</P>
    <P>4.  The Nine believe it is vital that steps be taken to ensure that UNIFIL is permitted to carry out fully the tasks assigned to it and they support the efforts of the troop contributing countries to ensure that this will now be done. They note that it is the intention of the Security Council, as stated on behalf of its member states by the President of the Council on 18 April &ldquo;to take such determined action as the situation calls for to enable UNIFIL to take immediate and total control of the entire area of operation up to the internationally recognised boundaries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>5.  The Foreign Ministers of the Nine call strongly on all concerned to give their fullest support to the measures decided on by the Security Council so that UNIFIL may be in a position to carry out in full the important peacekeeping mission with which it has been entrusted on behalf of the international community. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's very long reply, will he state if the Government have had any contact <Col N="31" /> with the Governments of the countries supplying troops to UNIFIL?  If so, will the Minister state the nature of the contact? Secondly, will the Minister tell the House if he or his Government have done anything to end the campaign of vilification against our troops in the Lebanon by the Israeli press?  Thirdly, will the Minister agree that having taken sides already or having shown our hand we are regarded as an unfriendly nation and, therefore, have lost a considerable amount of our influence in persuading the Israeli Government to back off the Haddad forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the first part of the Deputy's question already.  I have invited the other troop-contributing countries and the Secretary-General of the United Nations to participate at a meeting at ministerial level in Dublin next Friday.  I have been in close contact with all of the troop-contributing countries of whom there are ten.  There are five in Europe&mdash;Norway, Italy, France, the Netherlands and ourselves&mdash;as well as Senegal, Fiji, Nepal, Nigeria and Ghana.  All ten countries will be represented here on Friday.  They fully support our attitude and our approach in this matter, that it should be preceeded with on a diplomatic basis to seek to achieve a situation where the UN mandate can be effective so that UNIFIL troops can control the whole area of the Lebanon up to the boundaries of the Lebanon.  This is the crux of the whole problem.  This initiative, with all troop-contributing countries moving in concert, is the sensible approach.  We do not intend to take unilateral action; we will take this kind of diplomatic action.  We have already taken action on it and, hopefully, the meeting on Friday will result in a positive diplomatic approach being made that can result in the achievement of what I am saying, namely, making effective the mandate which UNIFIL is seeking to carry out on behalf of the UN.  Our position has not in any way been minimised.  As a member of the UNIFIL group we play <Col N="32" /> our part with the other nine nations.  We propose to act as one of the group within the United Nations context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to my third question&mdash;the fact that we have already shown our hand or taken sides and thus have minimised our influence with the Israeli Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question.  We are not in the Lebanon in an Irish capacity.  This is the question I was really answering.  We are there as part of the UNIFIL force, one of ten contributing countries and most of them have taken the same attitude as Ireland with regard to a Palestinian homeland. Practically all of the troop-contributing countries have taken the same stand that we have taken.  We are all acting under the UNIFIL umbrella and on behalf of the United Nations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister two questions.  First, is it proposed that there be any change in the defensive tactics of the Irish unit in the UN force?  It would appear from reports that were published that it has been the tactic of our force, in line with the tradition of our units in UN peacekeeping forces, not to return fire even when under fire except in cases of extreme danger while other units have taken a different attitude and have returned shot for shot.  In view of the problems created by different tactics of different units, is it proposed that the tactics be made uniform? If so, does this involve a change of tactics on our part?  Perhaps it would be better to leave my second question for the moment while the Minister replies to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked by the Deputy is pertinent and it will be one of the most relevant and germane aspects of the discussion we are having with other troop-contributing countries next Friday.  It is important that this aspect be fully clarified.  So far as Ireland is concerned, our view consistently has been that we regard our role as a peacekeeping role rather than a peace-enforcement role.  Some countries have tended to take the peace-enforcement aspect.  We want to ensure that there is a uniform attitude in regard to the conduct of the UNIFIL operations.  We made it quite clear that the operations should be on a peacekeeping basis.  Our whole thrust in having this conference, and if we get agreement from the other troop-contributing nations, would be to proceed on diplomatic lines and to exercise the appropriate diplomatic pressure where it can be exercised to ensure the withdrawal of the Haddad troops.  In my view, it is very dangerous to go on the peace-enforcement line.  Candidly, Ireland would view that as a mistake. We would view it as appropriate that the UN and the ten troop-contributing countries should act on the ground in a peacekeeping role and should act in concert in a diplomatic role to achieve the required diplomatic pressures to enable the withdrawal to take place.  If it does not work, then that is an entirely new situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I come to my second question I should like the Minister to tell the House why has this lack of uniformity in tactics persisted since last October?  Which forces are operating in accordance with the directions of the UN command?  From our point of view it is most unsatisfactory that there should be criticism of our forces pursuing what seems to me to be the correct peacekeeping tactics while troops from other countries are pursuing different tactics.  Why have we allowed the situation to persist since last October <Col N="34" /> without securing uniformity and leaving us vulnerable both to attack and to criticism for being unduly defensive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall UN mandate is entirely a peacekeeping mandate, not a peace-enforcing mandate.  The difficulty in an operation such as UNIFIL is that there are a number of countries with diverse military traditions.  It is not easy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is six months too late.  The Minister attempted to deal with the other question but he did not really answer it.  I want to know how it is proposed to implement the Security Council resolution about moving up to the frontier line if Israel refuses to withdraw its support of Major Haddad given that the Minister has doubts, which I understand and appreciate, about the UN changing to a peace-enforcement role.  How is a solution to be enforced if Israel does not co-operate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that with the moral pressure exercised by the ten countries acting together and bringing the appropriate pressure to bear on the United Nations and on the Security Council in particular this should operate as a diplomatic lever <i>vis-à-vis</i> Israel in regard to her attitude to Major Haddad's <i>de facto</i> forces that have bedevilled the situation in that buffer zone existing at present between the UNIFIL forces and Israel.

Would the Minister accept that there should be some standardisation of armaments among the UNIFIL troops and in so far as other contingents have certain armaments, including the anti-tank Tow missile, which the Dutch have and for which our contingent have to radio to zero in on positions when we want shots fired by them and also the heavy machine gun&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the amount due to Ireland arising out of UNIFIL operations in the Lebanon and the steps being taken to recover the amount outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before replying directly to the Deputy's question, I should first like to point out how the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is financed.</P>
      <P>By decision of the Security Council UNIFIL is financed by contributions from all UN member states.  However, because some countries withhold their contributions to UNIFIL, there has been a shortfall to date of about 26 per cent in the amount of money available to run the force.  After it has met its own direct costs, the UN reimburses troop contributors for their extra costs with the money available under various headings approved by the General Assembly such as additional pay and allowances, usage factor for personal wear and equipment, depreciation costs, supplies costs and death and disability claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that for the period May 1978, when we first joined UNIFIL, to April 1980, the amount of money which could be claimed by Ireland under the various reimbursements headings would be about £9.3 million.  Because of the limited amount of money available for reimbursement to troop contributors, however, it seems unlikely at present that this country will receive more than £4.7 million of the foregoing of which approximately <Col N="39" /> £3.6 million has been received to date.</P>
    <P>The extra cost actually incurred, over and above regular expenses such as ordinary pay, in providing a contingent for service with UNIFIL, is however less than our entitlement under the reimbursement arrangements.  It is estimated that over the period already mentioned, May 1978-April 1980, this extra cost did not exceed £6.2 million.  On the basis that £4.7 million of these costs would be reimbursed by the UN the net extra cost to the State of providing a contingent for the first two years would be about £1.5 million.  On the same basis the net extra cost to the State of providing a contingent for a further six months would be about £400,000.  I should emphasise the figures given can only be rough estimates at this stage.</P>
    <P>Since it became evident about a year ago that there would be a shortfall in reimbursements, the matter has been urgently pursued by the Irish mission in New York at the United Nations and in conjunction with other troop-contributors. The mission has maintained close contact with the Secretariat in the matter.  Furthermore, the Irish delegation to the recent UN General Assembly played a prominent role in drafting and presenting the resolution dealing with the financing of UNIFIL and ensured that these resolutions contained specific provisions aimed at improving the financial situation of UNIFIL.  In addition to some technical improvements, the major such provisions were:</P>
    <P>the creation of a Special UNIFIL account to receive voluntary contributions for the force was set up and the UN Secretary-General will make a twice-yearly appeal for such contributions.</P>
    <P>a review of the standard rates of reimbursement to troop contributors will be carried out at the next UN General Assembly this autumn.  In view of increased costs, the case for an increase in the rates will be clear.  The UN <Col N="40" /> Secretariat has in fact already begun to examine cost figures supplied by troop-contributors. </P>
    <P>I am of course continuing to take any action open to me to bring about an improvement in the finances of the force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention has been drawn to the exploitation of children in Colombia by their working in coal-mining industries and if he will bring every possible pressure to bear by all agencies open to him to ensure that such abuse of young children ceases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are aware of recent reports which allege exploitation of young children in Colombia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These distressing reports have aroused our greatest concern, particularly in view of the high hopes for the protection of children against such abuses which were raised as a result of the International Year of the Child in 1979.  These reports are particularly appalling because we are aware that such abuses are not isolated phenomena.  Indeed, as the Deputy will be aware, an Amnesty International report on <Col N="41" /> children published last year highlighted the fact that many children in several parts of the world are victims of the persistent violation of their human rights.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between Ireland and Colombia it is difficult for the Government to make representations directly to the Colombian authorities. However, I can assure the Deputy that representatives of the Irish Government will continue to participate actively in the various efforts in international fora, and particularly in the United Nations General Assembly, to transform the international concern about breaches of human rights into effective action towards preventing such breaches.  The promotion of respect for human rights remains an active concern of the Government's and the protection of human rights in the case of children as set out in the 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child is clearly of the utmost importance.</P>

I put questions to him about whether he had authorised certain actions.  The first question I have to ask the Minister for the Public Service is if he will withdraw his Minister of State's request to the Civil Service Commission, referred to in the Minister of State's statement in a Sunday newspaper, that the names of applicants for positions in the Civil Service be furnished to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The second question is to ask the Minister for the Public Service whether his Minister of State met last week with members and/or staff of the Civil Service Commission established under the Acts of 1924 and 1956; if so, at whose request the meeting was held; what issues were raised; and what decisions were taken on these issues at or following the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the <Col N="43" /> permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take these questions together.</P>
      <P>First of all, I wish to deny quite categorically that any request was made by me or by the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service to the Civil Service Commissioners or to the Departments for the names of applicants for positions in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I wish to emphasise that there has been no change of any kind in relation to procedures governing entry to the Civil Service by means of competitive examinations held by the Civil Service Commission.  Nor is there any wish on my part or on the part of any of my colleagues for any change which would in the slightest take away from the impartiality and independence of the commission.  We fully recognise the great merit and benefit of fair, impartial and independent recruitment procedures.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, it is true that the Minister of State and I met the three Civil Service Commissioners and the secretary to the commission on 23 April 1980.  The meeting was held at our request and was to discuss certain informational and procedural matters which were giving us cause for concern.  One matter which we raised was the refusal of the commission to allow students about to sit the leaving certificate examination to defer taking posts in the service until after they had sat their examination.  This is a matter on which Deputies on both sides of the House have made representations.  I consider it a perfectly legitimate matter for me to take up with the commission to see if a solution could be found to the practical problems the commission would undoubtedly face if vacancies were to be kept open for any length of time.</P>
      <P>Other matters which we raised related to the time taken to fill vacancies and the general approach of the commission to the supply of reasonable and up-to-date information to both candidates or public representatives approached by candidates in accordance with modern requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting, the Minister of State and I were at pains to emphasise that, in <Col N="44" /> raising these practical matters, we were in no way attempting to interfere with the independence and impartiality of the commissioners in the discharge of their statutory functions.  No decisions were taken at the meeting.  The commissioners are considering the points put to them and I am awaiting their response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made reference to information to public representatives in accordance with modern requirements.  Is he aware that his Minister of State told <i>The Sunday Press</i> that he, as the Minister responsible for the civil service and responsible to the Dáil, was looking for accurate and up-to-date information in relation to all job applications and that he justified this at length in a long statement published in <i>The Sunday Press</i>, in quotation marks for the greater part?  In these circumstances will the Minister elaborate on what information to public representatives in accordance with modern requirements was sought from the Civil Service Commissioners?  Will the Minister accept that the practice hitherto has been, in relation to appointments, as I know from being a Minister, that neither the Minister nor the Department concerned have any information about who are applicants for posts until the people concerned have been selected? This protection against any attempt to influence or to pretend to influence is part of the tradition of this State and has been almost since the foundation of the State.  Will he have regard to that when he is replying to the question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had listened attentively to my reply he would have had much of the information he is now seeking.  I want to repeat that both the Minister of State and I emphasised that our concern for the independence of the Civil Service Commission was not in question at the meeting.  The Deputy referred to a report in <i>The Sunday Press.</i> At no stage did the Minister of State say that he was seeking information in respect of job applications.  If I may, I will quote from my reply clearly for the Deputy:</P>

    <P>I might further say that the approaches by public representatives come from all sides of this House.  All we were seeking was that the information would be made available to candidates, and to public representatives requested by candidates, in accordance with modern requirements.</P>

        <i>The Sunday World</i> has been mentioned.  There was a selection, obviously a very selective selection, of five names in that article.  They could equally have selected five or 25 names <Col N="49" /> from those benches opposite.  To support what I am saying, let me now read for the House the standard reply that went out to those five representations that were mentioned, or at least to some of them because they were not identical. Let me read it in case anybody in this House believes what has now in a mean way been alleged by Deputy FitzGerald:</P>
      <P>I refer again to your representations on behalf of ..., a candidate at the competition for Clerical Officer.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries in the matter from the Civil Service Commissioners and am informed that results of this competition are expected to be available in about a fortnight's time.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners will be in touch with Mr. .... direct about that time concerning his result and if he has done sufficiently well and satisfied the usual requirements as to health, character, etc.  he will be offered appointment.</P>
      <P>May I wish Mr. .....every success in the competition. </P>

      <P>I want to answer that because my integrity is at stake here <Col N="50" /> too and we are going to defend that.  The Deputy has asked a very specific question in relation to something that appeared in an article in <i>The Sunday World.</i> The first point that I want to make on it is that the letter from which the sentence was deleted was in response to somebody approaching me in connection with application forms and again I will read it, if I may.  Again I will not mention the name:</P>
      <P>Thank you for your recent letter and the kind wishes you expressed.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries from the Civil Service Commissioners about your interest in a position as Placement Officer in my Department and I understand that the closing date for the receipt of completed application forms for the open Placement Officer competition is 31 January. </P>
      <P>The date of the letter is 29 January.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>I have asked the Commissioners to forward an application form and relevant documentation directly to you.</P>
      <P>May I wish you every success with your application. </P>
      <P>What was the necessity for that sentence in the context of that letter?  That was the only one from which it was deleted. What that gentleman on that Sunday paper goes on to say is absolutely untrue and I deny it categorically.</P>

      <P>Apart from the specific case of Mr. Lambert with which we are all concerned, I wish to raise two aspects that I would like the Minister to deal with.  Are the Minister and the Government concerned that an Irish citizen can be picked up and arrested in a supposedly friendly neighbouring country for an alleged relatively&mdash;at this stage&mdash;trivial offence that is supposed to have occurred 34 years ago?  What will the Government do about this?  Secondly, are the Government concerned about the treatment that is reported to have been meted out to Mr. Lambert in a supposedly friendly, civilised country and what will the Government do about <Col N="55" /> it so as to ensure that there will be no repetition of such treatment in regard to any future occasion on which an Irish citizen might be arrested there?</P>

      <P>When this man's innocence is undoubtedly proved what mechanism is available for the British Government to make amends to him and to his family?  Surely in all the circumstances this is a case of mistaken identity but in the meantime Mr. Lambert is held in Dover on the interim order of the magistrate.  Mr. Lambert has been there for four days and has to remain there to prove his innocence, and how he is going to do that I do not know, and he has been asked to provide two independent sureties of £10,000 each and to report to the police once daily.  This is an odd view of British justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that area I am satisfied that Mr. Lambert's legal advisers are pursuing the matter fully. There is no question of any discrimination against Irish citizens as such.  For some reason best known to themselves the British Government are following up all cases of desertion of the British Army over a long period of years.  There is strong evidence which seems to indicate that this is a case of mistaken identity but this is a matter to be worked out in the courts there.  This is an extraordinary matter but Mr. Lambert's legal advisers are following it up fully.  I have done what I can through our Ambassador in London and through the British Ambassador here whom I met this morning. The British Ambassador is aware of our position but the matter will have to go through the court procedures in England and hopefully there will be a successful outcome as far as Mr. Lambert is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill concerns the information which is printed on the cover of packaged goods.  I understand that this legislation is related to EEC proposals on the matter.  I would be grateful to know the extent to which we must introduce this legislation in full in every respect as a direct result of EEC legislation.  How much of the Bill is of our choosing, some of the terms of which we can alter, and how much of it is required by EEC legislation?  I understand that other European countries have applied different rules in respect of the information that must be printed on packages containing goods for export from one country to another and by applying these rules it is possible for countries to keep goods from other countries out.  Similar legislation can be used as a hidden means of protection against imports rather than for its proper purpose. In order to achieve free trade of goods the Community has felt it necessary to bring about uniformity in regard to the requirements which may be imposed by individual member states in connection with the information they may demand on packages for sale in their jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard for us to assess this legislation properly unless we have the information I have asked for which is not contained in the Explanatory Memorandum or in the Bill.  I am in favour of free trade within the Community and, therefore, I would favour any legislation which facilitates it.  The type of information that one requires to have presented on a package can vary considerably from one country and one culture to another.  Shoppers in different countries would require different information.  One cannot say that Italian consumers would <Col N="139" /> require the same information as Irish consumers.  That suggests that we could have difficulties arising from imposing a uniform stance.  Another matter I should like the Minister to consider is that it might be decided that in a certain situation one might want additional information not already provided for in EEC legislation but the only way one can have anything done about this is to have a directive passed requiring this information. It will take so long to get through such legislation that the need for it may have passed.  That would be the position in the case of some new packaged goods introduced specifically to the Irish market by an Irish producer.  If the Minister has not the freedom to insist on certain information being put on a package according to Irish law and must await an EEC directive it may take a long time.  A difficulty would arise if the goods in question are not in common currency throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>There is a need for information on packaged food as to the nutrient value of it.  A lot of food is being sold in packages or tins which may have variable nutrient value.  People may not know the calorie content of the goods and we must remember that many people are concerned not to consume more than a certain number of calories a day.  Some may consider such people to be obsessive in the pursuit of this matter but it is a legitimate interest.  In respect of packaged foods it would be valuable to have the calorie content of the food stated on the package.  I am not aware that it has been considered important to give this information but an Irish Government may wish to require that it be given.</P>
    <P>Would this Bill, if it does bring us into a European setting as far as this information is concerned, prevent us from requiring that that sort of information be furinished?  I am aware also that the Consumer Information Act contains extensive powers under which the Minister may, by order, require certain information to be given in respect of certain <Col N="140" /> goods.  I do not fully understand why the powers contained in that Act are not used to bring about whatever requirements are needed&mdash;for example, why it was necessary to have a separate Bill on quantity control in respect of packaged goods.  Perhaps the Minister could explain why that procedure was not followed.</P>
    <P>If this Bill in its entirety is one required by EEC rules, I am somewhat surprised that the European Communities Act was not the instrument used for its introduction.  I should like some information in that respect also.</P>
    <P>I should like confirmation also that the only matter with which this Bill is concerned is quantity.  Might I ask the Minister if that is so; that it is quantity only and nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be very long anyway.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it deals with a subject which for a long time has been near and dear to my heart, that is, that proper information be presented to the public on packages.  The Bill does not deal with a very wide range of information; it deals merely with what might be described as the nominal contents of a package.  I agree wholeheartedly with what Deputy Bruton said in regard to other information being included on packaging in the future, one being the calorie content of foodstuffs.  Possibly such would be a good public relations exercise for the manufacturing company concerned.  When I was last in the United States I noticed that it was more usual for them to show the calorie content on their packaging.  For very many years the public in the United States have been very conscious of the need to keep their weight under control because overweight is accepted now as a real danger to life.  I noticed that even on chocolate bars the number of calories was shown.  I hope I am not obsessed with the idea of calorie counting, but it is very helpful to be shown the calorie content of any package one may be buying.</P>
      <P>We should be leading the way, where we can, in getting the EEC to insist on certain minimum standards for packaging, one such requirement being the display of the date of manufacture.  Here I am talking about food products where at present the dates of manufacture are shown by way of code.  I believe that the public have more right to know the date of manufacture at any retail outlet.  It is extremely urgent that the EEC issue a directive that the date of manufacture be displayed on all goods, also the date by which the product should be eaten. There is a tendency for a lot of stale foods to be sold in certain types of retail outlets.  One must be careful always where one buys foodstuffs, particularly bearing in mind their present cost&mdash;items such as biscuits, sweets and so on.  All packaging should display not merely the date of manufacture of the product but also the date by which it should be disposed of.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy advocating something that should be in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I should like to see that included.  I should like to see it included in some future directive of the EEC.</P>
      <P>Another item which should be included in a Bill such as this is the obligatory display on packaging of the country of origin.  Very often one sees &ldquo;Foreign made&rdquo; displayed on a particular article.  The country of origin should be shown on all goods, which is a right of all buyers.</P>
      <P>One problem often encountered in relation to buying certain types of goods&mdash;and here I am thinking not merely of Ireland but of the Continent as a whole&mdash;is in a situation in which a food manufacturing business goes bankrupt, when the job lot buyers move in and buy all the stock.  They might buy warehouses full of stock which could take a long time to be disposed of, which in itself could well present a health hazard.  That type of protection for the consumer should be built into legislation. The public should be adequately protected particularly in relation to foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>The passage of this Bill facilitates us in easier access to EEC markets.  But manufactures here should be leading the way, by voluntarily displaying further information on packaging.  I know that at present they must show the ingredients. That is the law in all European countries. One cannot export any product without its ingredients being shown on its package.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment by the Minister of the special inspectorate.  I hope they will do their job effectively.  It is very important that there be sufficient surveillance at retail as well as at manufacturing level.  Any extra protection that can be afforded consumers is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for a programme to educate consumers as to what they should expect, as to what kind of standards they should be demanding.  Television lends itself very well to this type of <Col N="143" /> programme, but radio can be effective in this way too.  The viewer would be made aware of what could be obtained from a good company who were concerned for the consumer compared with what might be expected from a company who were interested purely in manufacturing and consequently, whose produce might not be as fresh or as good as it should be. One is sometimes horrified on visiting some small manufactures and finding that they work under very crude conditions. I am talking about the one-man type of business, of which there are many in such places as the UK and on the Continent as well as in Ireland.  I visited many such businesses in the days when I had an agency for flavourings and essences and when I used travel around the country a good deal, both north and south.  The sort of operations I have in mind would convince anyone of the need for this kind of legislation in the interests of the consumer; but first the consumer must be educated in the kind of standards that he should demand.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to elaborate on the last paragraph of his speech in which he stated that he would not expect all industries to be able to switch overnight to the new system and that, accordingly, provision was being made in certain circumstances for temporary derogations from the system. Perhaps the Minister would give us an example of what he has in mind.  I do not think that there should be any great delay in respect of companies ordering wrapping papers on which will be printed the information which is provided for in this Bill.  Because of the high cost of wrapping paper very few companies would be likely to order very far ahead. That is why I am satisfied that a six-month period would be adequate in this case.  However, if the drafters of the Bill had something else in mind in providing for temporary derogations I should be glad to hear what it was.  I welcome the Bill and hope that it will be the first of many such pieces of legislation.  This may be considered a small Bill, but it is very important from the point of view of the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first occasion on which I have had an opportunity of speaking formally to the new Minister of State, I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success and happiness while in office.  I should like to have my good wishes conveyed also to his private secretary who is a neighbour of mine and whom I have known for a long time.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should like to make a general point in regard to legislation of the type now before us.  There is a good deal of very important legislation passing through the House nowadays in regard to consumer affairs in general.  Many of these pieces of legislation have widespread implications for industry and for the consumer.  Sometimes it is difficult while the legislation is going through to obtain the views of people whose opinions would be valuable.  In this context I would ask the Minister to consider the setting up of a Committee of the House who would consider in detail this kind of legislation.  While not wishing in any way to denigrate the Minister or his Department, they bring forward legislation from one particular viewpoint, a viewpoint which may be limited to some extent; whereas a Committee of the House comprising Deputies from all parties, and who would invite people from outside to come in and comment on proposals for legislation, would be playing a very worth-while role in regard to the drafting of the Bill concerned. I am thinking in terms of comments being invited from, say, representatives of the trade union movement, from the Consumers Association of Ireland and from the Confederation of Irish Industry. What I have in mind is an actual Committee Stage at this point with the Minister and his officials being present. In this way the many viewpoints expressed could be collated and examined in regard to the drafting of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As spokesman on consumer affairs for my party I have available to me the help and advice of a number of people in relation to legislation coming before the House, but I am limited in what I can do. Despite the fact that the Minister has the <Col N="145" /> backing of an extensive Department he is limited, too, in regard to foreseeing the difficulties that can arise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes, but I am disappointed in that it is exactly what I thought it would be from my reading of it and from my reading of the Explanatory Memorandum.  The point I am making is that the Bill deals only with quantity and that, therefore, it fails.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have included specific sections dealing with the standard and quality of goods.  It should also have included a section dealing with the description of goods.  It should have included a section dealing with the contents of packaged goods.  It should have included provisions about the latest date on which a person could eat foods in safety.  These four items should have been included in a Bill of this nature.  This Bill only deals with quantity, which is important, but it is not sufficient.  The Bill should have dealt with the other items I have mentioned and I am disappointed that it does not do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards publish standards on a regular basis.  But if people do not wish to accept the standards laid down by the institute they are under no obligation to do so. This is a distinct flaw and it should be remedied at the earliest possible opportunity. In the main the standards set out by the institute are reasonable and it is necessary that they should be made compulsory.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that a Bill dealing with the quality of goods would be difficult to draft and to implement.  Nevertheless it is absolutely necessary at this time to have a Bill dealing with the quality and standard of goods.  The institute set out standards here in Ireland.  In relation to building materials, for example, people drawing up contracts can have the materials specifically included, but in many instances people are unable to ensure that proper standards are maintained. Legislation is necessary and this Bill would have given us an ideal opportunity to draw up the necessary legislation. We are going to have to pay far <Col N="146" /> more attention to the standards set by the institute.  In relation to one particular item, the cords on children's anoraks, a statutory instrument was brought before the House and passed and the type of cord in question is not being used now.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have been able to encompass a far wider variety of examples. I wonder how people are going to see that this Bill is implemented when it is passed.  It deals with quantity.  In some cases there may be difficulty in measuring or weighing goods.  People may need to have goods examined by the institute to provide evidence in a court case, but the institute is, to all intents and purposes, closed to consumers' complaints at present.  I worry over this.  There is one exception and that is cases of safety. The institute take telephone calls and messages and deal with such complaints. But on listening to a radio interview sometime ago I understood from it that even in relation to safety measures alone the institute is over-extended in the work it is being asked to do.  After this Bill is passed it could be three months or more before a person wishing to have a case investigated could have this done.  It is good to see a Bill of this nature being passed but unless we can have cases investigated properly and thoroughly by competent people then the Bill is nothing but hot air.  I appreciate the goodwill of the Minister, but goodwill is not enough. The Bill must have teeth and muscle and the people must be there to do the job.</P>
    <P>The institute has been closed to consumers' complaints for four to six weeks and it will be closed for a number of weeks more.  This is not good enough and it must be remedied.  All the consumer legislation that has been passed through the House is good legislation and we are fully in agreement with it, but it is no use passing legislation if it cannot be fully implemented.  I ask the Minister to bring to the attention of the Government the necessity to provide the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards with more staff to deal with complaints and more equipment to carry out examinations.  I have had people telephoning me to know if I can make <Col N="147" /> representations to the institute about particular items and I have done so.  The institute have been very helpful and they have co-operated and have investigated complaints for me.  I do not know whether they jumped the queue or not. But I was asked to make requests for people who are not in good circumstances. In one case there was a large family involved and the item concerned had cost them a sizeable amount of money.  They were being driven backwards and forwards and they had nowhere to go.  If legislation is going to be passed the necessary back-up services must be provided and the scope of the institute must be extended.  If we do not extend the scope of the institute to deal with industrial complaints, this legislation will be of little avail because people will be unable to have their claims processed and dealt with.  The Minister should bring that to the attention of the Government at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputies Bruton and Briscoe dealt with food analysis and the calorie contents of food.  Some of this information is on packets but the scope should be extended to include vitamins contained in the food and the items that went into the preparation of the product.  This is essential and desirable.  I recently came across a case where a farmer was using a spray. He was not aware of the power of it and on emptying it out it caused considerable damage to a small river.  It is essential to set out the effects of the products.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the House to cases where children lost their lives after taking sprays and so on which contained poison.  Some effort has been made to be more specific in the labelling of such products.  However, I am not satisfied that what has been achieved up to now has been satisfactory.  It is essential to state whether items are poisonous or not. More stringent precautions should be taken in regard to items imported into the country that may be poisonous.  At present the notices are not comprehensive enough and are inadequate.  It is essential that the contents be set out and <Col N="148" /> also the results of the use or misuse of the product.  An analysis of the items should be displayed on the carton and overall package.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Department might consider some kind of educational programme to explain to people the way in which they should dispose of products.  Poisonous items are often left lying around houses or sheds.  An effort will have to be made to see that such items are not left lying around because they present a danger to the person using them, their children or family.  Could this be incorporated into the Bill?  The Bill should try to do that because a lot of people are insured and a lot of lives are lost.  People should be told to dispose of such items by putting them into their bins.  As regards sprays used by the farming and industrial sectors the Government will have to take the lead in educating people on how to dispose of these items.  It is all too easy to spill it out into a river.  That is not good enough when one is dealing with poisonous products which can cause pollution.</P>
    <P>As regards the weight of products, an item such as turf is very hard to weigh.  I understand from fuel merchants that they are not selling fuel by weight but by the bag or in some instances by the lorry.  I received a letter from a person in the St. Vincent de Paul Society who is concerned at the way in which elderly people are dealt with when purchasing turf by the bag as distinct from by weight.  The letter says:</P>
    <P>I would like to draw your attention to the sale of fuel especially turf not alone in... but all over the country. The local St. Vincent de Paul Society are very concerned about the manner in which it affects not alone the poor and needy but everyone who is in the unfortunate position not to be able able to buy this fuel by bulk. </P>
    <P>People were not getting the number of hundredweights of turf.  When this was questioned the society were informed that turf is no longer sold by weight but by bulk and the reason given was that it would be too costly on the consumer or <Col N="149" /> would mean extra men being employed to weigh the fuel.</P>
    <P>The letter went on to say that bags of turf were sold at the same price but that they varied in weight from five stone seven pounds to seven stone three pounds, including the bag.  In other words, a person could buy a bag of useless white turf which will burn in a few hours, while good quality turf will last.  These people are buying turf by the bag.  The Minister, in co-operation with Bord na Móna and the fuel merchants, should try to ensure that turf is sold to elderly people by weight, not by the bag. In many cases these people are not getting value for money.  It is important that they get quality and quantity for their money, which they are not getting. I do not see how this Bill can be of assistance in this instance but I would ask the Minister if it will remedy....</P>

      <Col N="150" /> We are being caught by EEC directives. This legislation deals with something of immense importance&mdash; quantity.

      <P>I am concerned about the stamping of our exports.  Carcase beef is stamped by the Department of Agriculture using a purple dye which is not harmful and it gives the plant and factory number.  However, this dye is very unsightly.  After this beef has been skinned and cut into individual portions, this purple dye is stamped on each cut. Could this colour be changed?  Under the EEC directive the British stamp is brown, the same colour as the meat.  It is very important for our export trade that the colour of this stamp be changed and the directive should be looked into.  If this cannot be done it might be possible to package and label our meat.  The labels could show the factory number and all other relevant information.  This is of importance so far as agricultural exports are concerned.  For example, our meat, which might be used for hamburgers, might still have purple dye showing.  As I said, while this is not harmful it is very unsightly.  That is why I would like to see our meat exported in packages or cartons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was dealt with at considerable length following a symposium on meat packaging about a fortnight ago.  I do <Col N="151" /> not profess to be an expert on this matter but I have been in communication with meat factories and the Department of Agriculture to try to remedy the problem.  There are three forms of packaging, Cryovac, Swiss Vac and the vacuum pack.  In the Cryovac, the beef is tied up with a clip and this helps to extend the life of the product.  It is an easy way to package meat.  The Swiss Vac method is similar but it is heat sealed and a clip is not used.  The meat can be chilled in both, and it is an almost perfect way to package it.</P>
    <P>The basic problem is that we will have to go to the EEC with a request to have the directive changed.  I understand the Department are anxious to have the directive changed as are many members of the farming organisations.  It is a matter of tremendous importance and this is evident from the statements made in the past fortnight following the symposium.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with a few other points and to give notice that I may be submitting amendments on them on Committee Stage.  I am interested and concerned about a number of the provisions in section 17.  Subsection (1) refers to a person who fails to perform a duty imposed on him under section 9 or 10 and it states that he shall be guilty of an offence. Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P> (a) If a person has in his possession for sale, agrees to sell or sells a package to which section 8 of this Act applies which is inadequate and either&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i) he is the packer or importer of the package, or</P>
    <P>(ii) he knows that the package is inadequate, </P>
    <P>he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(b) Where&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i) a package to which Section 8 of this Act applies is made up pursuant to an agreement or arrangement between the relevant packer and another person, and</P>
    <P>(ii) the package is inadequate, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> (iii) such packer delivers the package to or to the order of a person to whom, under the agreement or arrangement, it falls to be delivered, </P>
    <P>such packer shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(c) For the purposes of this subsection a package to which section 8 of this Act applies shall be regarded as being inadequate if the quantity of the goods included in the package is less, by more than twice the amount prescribed for the purposes of section 9 (5) of this Act, or, as may be appropriate, twice the relevant amount calculated in the manner so prescribed, than the quantity marked in pursuance of this Act on the package. </P>
    <P>I do not wish to drag this out but it seems that the packer referred to could be an ordinary worker on the shop floor who has had orders to package foods.  I do not think it is the ordinary working man who should be responsible.  It should be the company managers and so on, all of whom should be aware of the legislative provisions.  The phraseology concerns me.  If the Minister does not consider an amendment I will be tabling one on this section because it seems to me that as the Bill stands the ordinary worker could be brought to court and penalised.  Hundreds of shop workers could be prosecuted as the Bill stands.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to make the public aware of the provisions in the Bill. I hope that both he and the Department will explain its provisions publicly before the Act comes into operation.  Its implications are varied and many and the public should be told about them.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in regard to weight and quantity and I am sure the Minister is aware many items lose weight after manufacture.  Bread, for instance, is heavier immediately after being baked than it is later on.  What is the position in that respect?  When, from the point of view of the consuming public, does the Minister say items should be weighed?  Is it when they leave the factory or later at <Col N="153" /> the retail level?  It is important that the Minister would give us his views on these matters.</P>
    <P>Dealing specifically with confectionery, when there are increases in the price of sugar and different items involved, what happens is that instead of the prices going up, the contents are reduced in size.  Could the Minister take steps to ensure that the consumer is not being caught by these shady practices, particularly concerning imported goods?</P>
    <P>When I go abroad on holidays or on business one thing which strikes me forceably is the poor quality of some Irish packaging for export.  We are losing millions of pounds of exports due to inadequate and improper packaging and the Government should try to do something to combat this.  On occasions I have put down questions in the House dealing with imported goods which we ourselves are producing and are not able to sell because we are not marketing them properly and not packaging them properly.  The importation of these goods into the country is affecting our balance of payments.  There are honourable exceptions to this.  Kerrygold made a marvellous breakthrough in butter sales and Irish Mist has made a tremendous impact right across the world because of the product and its packaging.  Our food exports will have to be seriously looked at by the Confederation of Irish Industry, the trade union movement, the consumers' associations, the Government and particularly the Minister's Department.  This is of tremendous importance to our whole economy.  If a girl goes to a dance, how she gets on depends on how she is dressed.  The packaging is of extreme importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, we have lost millions of pounds on exports of food items through not having sufficiently modernised packaging of a high standard. <Col N="154" /> Could the Minister include, in this Bill, incentive bonuses to ensure that our industrialists and our agricultural exporters improve their marketing?  It would have a tremendous impact on our exports. A campaign for the improvement of packaging could be carried on in conjunction with this Quantity Control Bill. The Minister has the authority vested in him by the power of the people of Ireland to commence such a campaign at the earliest possible opportunity.  The money spent would not be sizeable. There could be competitions.  With improvement in the packaging of our goods, those who sell them throughout the world would reach a much larger market.</P>
      <P>I must say, in fairness, that a lot of our goods for home consumption are well packaged but there is a lot to be desired at present in some cases and this Bill should incorporate some means to remedy that situation.  I welcome the Bill although there is a lot of ground to be made up, particularly regarding the items I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him very well in the years to come.  This legislation is, indeed, very important but I am not in wholehearted agreement with the Deputy on the far side of the House. I am more concerned with what is inside the package than with the package itself. We might try to sell our goods in Europe with very elaborate packaging or containers but, basically, the average housewife is more concerned with what she gets in the package than the look of the package itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last 30 years, selling of goods has changed considerably.  We now have large supermarkets where everything on the shelf is in a package or in a can.  In my parents' time, you went into a shop which had sacks of flour or meal or whatever it might be, and you bought your pound or two as needed. You bought only what you required but, unfortunately, in this day and age you must take off the shelf what is there.  One thing troubles me nowadays and that is <Col N="155" /> that the quantity is geared towards people who buy in bulk.  I feel very sorry for the elderly, for people living on their own, for old age pensioners who must buy about three or four times what they need.  By the time they have used all or half the goods, they are stale and have to be disposed of, which is a complete waste of money.  Is it possible, in this Bill, to suggest to the manufacturers, or ask, or compel them, if possible, to package smaller amounts of commodities? What does an old age pensioner or a person living on his or her own want with two pounds of sugar which might last three months or more? There should be some way around this problem.  Goods packaged in too large quantities are potatoes, flour, custard.  I know one can go into a butcher's shop and buy small amounts of meat but a person who might wish to shop in a supermarket will find it impossible to buy small quantities of meat.  The packages generally contain three or four chops and if the shopper is an old person he or she may only require one chop. Consideration should be given to people who wish to buy small quantities of food.</P>
    <P>I should also like instructions to be printed on packaging advising people to remove the goods when they get home. In this connection I am thinking of cardboard containers covered with cellophane.  Food should be removed as quickly as possible from such packaging. vegetables, in particular potatoes, and fruit deteriorate rapidly when kept in plastic wrapping.  On numerous occasions I have had to return food to shops because it had deteriorated in its plastic container.  I must say that the majority of shops and supermarkets are good about exchanging food that is not up to standard.  I have no complaint about them in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many of the cartons carry a code date but this means nothing to the average shopper.  The final date by which the food should be used should be marked on the cartons and it should be done clearly so that shoppers can see it at a glance.  As a result of a new lifestyle, litter <Col N="156" /> has become a serious problem in Ireland and on the continent.  All of us have become more conscious of the environment and of the desirability of keeping it as clean as possible.  I should like to see labels on containers asking purchasers to dispose of the containers in a proper way, not just to throw them on the ground.  In this connection, I am thinking particularly of items bought by children.  The amount of litter in shopping centres is quite incredible&mdash;sweet papers, cartons and lollipop wrappings are scattered all around the area.  An appeal to purchasers to dispose of litter in a proper way might be of some help.  I have a complaint to make with regard to containers of cleansing fluid.  After using a container for a very short time one finds it does not function any more and one has to throw it away even though it is only half used.  The container clogs up and cannot be used.  This is very wasteful and it causes much annoyance.  Perhaps the Minister could look into this problem.</P>
    <P>Certainly we pay the price for progress.  The price of packaging in recent years has been quite considerable.  If a container can be disposed of that is not too bad&mdash;perhaps it can be used to light the fire although nowadays many people have central heating and do not light fires.  Even more difficult is the matter of bottles and cans.  I realise that this matter is not in the Bill but I think the kind of containers being used should be examined. They should not cause harm or damage.  There are broken bottles on every road in the country and it is very difficult for local authorities to deal with this.  In the years to come I hope we will be able to use all the material that we are throwing out at the moment.  The packaging of goods costs a fortune but we are doing nothing to recycle it.</P>
    <P>I welcome anything that will help the consumer to get a better deal.  Now that we are in the EEC we are importing a considerable amount of tinned items and the language used on the labels on these tins is a foreign language.  There is nothing in English or Irish&mdash;although I accept that the majority of people speak <Col N="157" /> English more easily than Irish&mdash;to indicate what is in the tins.  There is nothing to indicate how to use the commodity. It is difficult to know whether you should take it out of the tin or heat it in the tin.  People just buy them &ldquo;on spec,&rdquo; and hope for the best.  There should be some indication to the shopper what these tins from other EEC countries contain.  There are also tins containing sprays that can be very dangerous and there should be far more information on these indicating what they are and whether their use involves any danger.</P>
    <P>It has already been said that the calorie content should be mentioned on packaged goods.  I think vitamin content is mentioned on most items but I do not know if people understand this, and if people need vitamins it is the medical profession that should advise them.</P>
    <P>Again, I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this legislation.  I hope it will do some good for the consumer and that the extra cost of commodities, now included in the price because of the extra packaging, will be worth while.  I trust that this legislation will at least offset the increase in costs due to elaborate packaging.  Finally, I ask the Minister again to investigate the possibility of instructing industrial packagers to make smaller amounts available for people who cannot afford the cost of larger packets or who are unable to carry them. It would be useful if there could be more packaged goods offered in small quantities than are available at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very timely piece of legislation.  From my own experience I wish to add one or two observations. I hope these will be covered in the Bill and I would appreciate it if the Minister would confirm that when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with packaging and labelling of goods.  Recently there has been an increase in emphasis on consumer protection.  We have brought about improvements in standards here aided and assisted, as in this case by EEC-heightened consciousness in the <Col N="158" /> area.  Whenever innovations in the area are introduced there are those who actively seek to undermine them for their own unhelpful reasons.  I have no doubt that commercial success dominates all the thinking of certain people who are not particularly motivated by the consumer's welfare and who would immediately seek loopholes in such legislation. Accordingly, I ask the Minister whether in the labelling or packaging of goods it will be any longer possible to utilise such expressions as &ldquo;permitted preservatives included&rdquo; or &ldquo;colouring included&rdquo; or &ldquo;flavouring included&rdquo;&mdash;remarks which have the appearance of giving an insight into the calibre and quality of the goods but which in fact only deceive.</P>
    <P>I have noticed an increasing number of ordinary household goods which either have these nebulous or meaningless expressions on them or have nothing at all, especially as regards quantity.  I hope that when this legislation is enacted it will be obligatory to include on such packages, not just generalisations like &ldquo;permitted preservatives&rdquo; but precise information whether in regard to chemicals or natural foods or whatever is involved.  People are entitled to full and explicit knowledge in all these respects and it would be helpful if the Minister would confirm that this is the aim of the Bill because there is growing concern, some of it scientifically supported, about what are called junk foods. I am glad to see this heightening of awareness about the need to protect the consumer.  Also, the onus will now shift to where it should rightly be, on the manufactures of goods.  Until recently, retailers who could not reasonably be expected to have an analysis of each commodity they sold were liable to prosecution on the basis of the contents of such products.  I remember a man who was fined £20 or £21 for selling a bar of chocolate which contained a worm.  I trust that liability for worm-infested chocolate&mdash;I hope that this was exceptional, that there is not much of it on the market&mdash;would rest where it should rightly rest, on the manufacturer.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to pay tribute <Col N="159" /> to retail organisations, particularly RGDATA which for many years has pressed this point home.  It is getting a response here.  However, let us not be deceived by the idea that by introducing some compulsory obligation on manufacturers to put a reference to the contents on the packets we may be doing all that is necessary.  We should ask them to spell this out.  The sort of generalisations with which housewives are sometimes confronted are meaningless or even deceitful in some cases&mdash; perhaps not deliberately so but by omission they are.  When young children today are eating an enormous amount of trashy food, junk food, processed food&mdash;there is a distinction&mdash;in increasing volume there is real point in a Bill such as this and in ensuring that its terms and implications are as clearly stated as possible.  I have no doubt that all responsible manufacturers will respond heartily to such promptings.</P>
    <P>I think this will benefit the Irish manufacturer particularly because of the tradition of good food and natural care for high standards in these areas that exists in that industry.  There should be no hesitation or reluctance on their part in complying with the Bill and I am sure there will not be.  It is very important that such legislation should make it obligatory to spell out in detail percentages and the exact nature of all elements in such food so that a housewife can make valid assessments of what she purchases.  Regulations regarding the size of print and perhaps the colouring of packets and so on are also imperative so that there would be no diminution of the effect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Retailing today is a science and not a hit or miss game.  In parts of the supermarket industry experiments are carried out on the effect of colour, size, placement and positioning in supermarkets of various goods.  These experiments are understandably designed to elicit a finding which would aid the marketing people to make the maximum impact in sales.  The housewife is in a much inferior position in combating that scientific approach. <Col N="160" /> She has nothing to lean on but the parliament which represents her and the support of legislation such as this and similar legislation already enacted. Let us make sure that if and when this Bill becomes law it is meaningful, genuinely explicit, comprehensive and legible and, above all, that it is policed rigorously&mdash;not with a view to harassment or intimidation but to ensure that we mean business when we talk about protecting the housewife.  Marketing of foods is a very skilled business today and I think one which obliges us to assist the housewife in dealing with the marketing skills involved.</P>
    <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to the possibility of considering&mdash;perhaps not in this Bill but in separate legislation&mdash;the promotional activities of advertising agencies in this regard?  I have found it anomalous, to say the least, that a retailer selling a sealed package can be prosecuted and fined because of its contents when common-sense and reason indicate that he or she could not be aware of what the package contains while the advertising agencies&mdash;good luck to them in so far as they are successful&mdash;quite glibly and aggressively market products in a way which in many cases exaggerates their benefits, where there is no legal code operating and where in no case of these three dozen or so advertising agencies in this country is there any analysis or examination of the goods so marked. Therefore, we must have consistency if we are going to get into the area of consumer protection, which is an obligation on all of us.  Accordingly, I ask the Minister if he will be kind enough to refer to the one or two questions which I have put to him.  I wish him every success in his new capacity and also in this Bill which sets out to assist the housewife today in the many challenges which face her in her daily choice of shopping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their kind welcome to me on this the first occasion on which I have the task of presenting a Bill to the House.  I thank <Col N="161" /> them also for their general welcome of the Bill and their comments on the proposals.  I will endeavour as far as possible to cover the points raised in their contributions and if there is anything I can do to help in any way I will be glad to do so.</P>
      <P>First I propose to address myself to the question raised by Deputy O'Toole and Deputy Bruton of markings on packages.  A request was made for a standardised form of marking.  This is provided for in the EEC directives which describe the size and shape of the e-mark, the size of figures to be used in the marking of quantity and the units of weight and volume to be used.  These details will be reproduced in regulations to be made under the Bill.  All markings will be required to be easily legible without opening the package and should be of considerable assistance to the consumer.</P>
      <P>In so far as markings are concerned, this Bill deals only with the marking of quantity and the identification of the packer or importer.  Other markings of the nature of trade descriptions&mdash;a matter referred to by Deputies Briscoe, Enright, Lemass and Keating&mdash;are controlled by the requirements of the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1978, while matters such at date and price marking and ingredient listing will be subject to control under EEC directives on food labelling and unit pricing recently issued in Brussels, and in due course we will be proceeding on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this Bill.  These are new directives issued only recently from Brussels and we will be taking them up and making them into our own law here in the future.  Indirectly this brings me to the question of product liability raised by Deputy O'Toole.  The provisions of this Bill are designed to control filling processes and quantity rather than quality&mdash;this is a point I want to emphasise&mdash;and as such do not extend to product liability.  However, I assure the Deputy that his point has been noted <Col N="162" /> and will be borne in mind for consideration in the context of later legislation.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by some Deputies of the question of penalties and general enforcement procedures.  While I agree with Deputy Quinn that the maximum penalties are rather stiff, I emphasise that it would be necessary to prosecute only in the case of deliberate or habitual failure to comply with the requirements of the Bill and that the factory inspectorate which will be specially constituted and trained for the task not only will operate a control function but will also be available to assist and advise packers encountering genuine problems.  This is very important.</P>
      <P>On the question of introducing stiffer penalties for habitual offenders, I am of the view that the powers of the inspectorate in relation, for example, to the seizure of goods combined with the cumulative impact by way of penalties which a series of prosecutions would give rise to are adequate safeguards.  It is my earnest hope that the question of maximising penalties will not arise.  At this stage I cannot estimate the final size of the inspectorate as these control procedures are an innovation not only in Ireland but in the European Community as a whole, but whatever manning levels are arrived at finally will be adequate for the task.</P>
      <P>While the Bill as it stands provides for the appointment only of officers of the Minister as inspectors I propose to move an amendment at Committee Stage which would enable inspectors of weights and measures, who at present are not officers of the Minister, to be appointed. I understand that some of the weights and measures inspectors are interested in undertaking work under the Bill.  The experience which such inspectors have had in the enforcement of weights and measures and merchandise marks law could be very valuable in getting the new inspectorate on its feet and we would not wish to preclude the possibility of such appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point of concern was the derogation clause.  While the outside limit of derogation laid down in the Bill <Col N="163" /> is 31 December 1985, it is expected that the majority of temporary derogations from the Act will be for periods of months rather than years.  They will be granted primarily to enable packers to use up existing stocks of labels and containers. Derogations may however be granted, in exceptional circumstances, for longer periods and for other requirements of the Bill&mdash;for example the requirement to use approved equipment or to make checks at prescribed periods.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that all applications will be considered on their merits and, if granted, it is my intention that they will be subject to a precondition that packages temporarily exempted will comply with the present law in regard to marking and quantity of contents.  I dare say that the Deputies and everybody know that these laws are strict at the moment, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the reason for having a derogation clause at all is to enable the Act to be brought into operation within a reasonably short period after its enactment, thus facilitating those manufacturers who are already in a position to comply with its requirements and who feel that their competitiveness, particularly on export markets, is affected adversely by the present requirement to pack to the minimum rather than the average.  The fact that we have included this provision will prove that the Bill is not, as suggested by Deputy Bruton, merely an exercise in bureaucracy but is of real interest and value to manufacturers and consumers.</P>
    <P>I will attempt to deal with other points raised by the Deputies.  I say to Deputy Bruton, who discussed various matters, that the Bill itself and the EEC legislation with which the Bill is concerned apply to packages of a certain weight or volume.  They are defined in the directive which I read out earlier, but this Bill is all-embracing.  It enables the provisions of the EEC legislation to be applied to all prepacked goods.  Deputy Bruton also inquired why we should not use the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  While <Col N="164" /> there are provisions in that Act relating to the declaration of contents of packages, they were not designed to deal with the implementation of complex EEC directives such as we have here and for drafting reasons a separate Bill was necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright was worried about the legislation.  He said that a committee of the House should be appointed to discuss it, that it was hard to get the views of the people, and so on.  I say to him that Bills such as he mentioned can be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  When the EEC Directives came in the Minister appointed a consultative committee to advise him and that committee was composed of people right across the board representing all sections of society.  That committee can be reconvened at any time if required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear on that. Would the Minister elaborate?  Of whom does the committee consist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the question of implementing the EEC directives arose the Minister established a consultative committee representative of the Department, the weights and measures inspectorate, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Packaging Institute, the Pharmaceutical, Chemical and Allied Industry Association, the Federation of Trade Associations, RGDATA, An Bord Bainne, the Irish Quality Control Association, the Irish Glass Bottle Company, Arthur Guinness and Son and the National Consumer Advisory Council.  The committee covered a wide spectrum of Irish society who would be interested in all matters.  It would not be difficult to reconvene the committee to consider any future legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that that committee issued a report without a minority report.  They were in general agreement.  The Deputy referred to the position which will arise if people ask him to refer a problem to the IIRS.  As the Deputy is aware that body is concerned more about technical matters, but the local weights and measures inspectorate will weigh a package on request by a consumer.  There is no need to send such a package to the IIRS.  I agree with the Deputy's comments in relation to dangerous substances but that is more a matter for the Department of Health. Such matters could not be incorporated under this Bill.  The Health Education Bureau have done a lot of work in this area through television and newspaper advertisements.  They have warned people about dangerous substances and what to do with packages that are half-used. In my view those who throw away half-used packages of poisonous substances lack civic spirit and are guilty of a criminal act.</P>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy in relation to the sale of turf is a weights and measures matter.  If the turf is in a sealed bag it comes under the terms of the Bill but the sale of turf in open bags is not covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The package must be sealed to be subject to this legislation. Another Bill will be introduced later to deal with weights and measures and what the Deputy has stated will be covered in that.  Deputy Enright asked what was meant by the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo;.  I will be seeking legal advice on that matter and I will communicate with the Deputy.  It is not the intention of the Bill to make the worker liable.  If there is any contravention of an order we want the businessman brought to court so that the <Col N="166" /> matter can be set right.  It was never our intention to involve the worker on the shop floor.  The matter will be investigated so that the word will not be misinterpreted in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright also dealt with the presentation of our goods abroad.  I will bring his comments to the attention of CTT.  A question was raised about goods that lose weight after packaging. Such goods always create a problem.  A packager will be expected to put sufficient goods into a package to ensure that the package does not become so light as to be inadequate but he will only be expected to ensure that the average weight and number of an unstandard package remains correct for seven days. It is proposed to provide in regulations for goods that lose weight after packaging.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned the provision of goods in small quantities.  That is an opportunity which firms might take up to their advantage.  I accept that those who live alone, old age pensioners and those on a set income do not want to buy large quantities of goods.  In this competitive world it is difficult to see how it would be possible to introduce a law to implement her suggestion. However, I will have the matter considered. Many Deputies mentioned the fact that foreign language appears on a lot of goods sold here but I should like to remind Members that we are supposed to be involved in a &ldquo;Buy Irish Campaign&rdquo;. However, other Bills will be introduced in the near future to deal with such matters.  Deputy Lemass was also concerned about litter outside shops and on our streets, but that is a hygiene matter which should be taken up with the Departments of Health, the Environment and Education.</P>
      <P>Deputies were concerned about disposal of cans and recycling.  A lot of study is being carried out in relation to those matters at present.  Many nations are concerned with the disposal of waste and whether it is possible to recycle it. The Department are keeping abreast of progress elsewhere in relation to this.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to enable two international conventions dealing with arbitration to be ratified.  The first is the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.  It was drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations and adopted by the United Nations Conference on International Commercial Arbitration in 1958.  The second is the Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States. This convention was sponsored by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&mdash;the World Bank&mdash;and was opened for signature in 1965.  The Bill also contains an amendment of the Arbitration Act, 1954, in relation to the power of a court to stay proceedings in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement, domestic or foreign.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal first with the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.  Before doing so perhaps I could refer briefly to the present law.  There is a right of enforcement of foreign arbitral awards at common law by instituting proceedings on the basis of the foreign award.  In addition, the Arbitration Act, 1954, which gave effect to the 1923 Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses and the 1927 Geneva Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards, contains detailed statutory rules for the enforcement of foreign awards.</P>

    <P>Ratification of the New York Convention has also EEC implications.  Article 220 of the Treaty establishing the European <Col N="168" /> Economic Community obliges member states to enter into negotiations to bring about the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal enforcement of arbitration awards.  The member States decided that this obligation could best be met by all members acceding to the New York Convention. As a result, arbitration awards were specifically excluded from the scope of the 1968 EEC convention dealing with the enforcement of judgments.  Ratification of the New York Convention, therefore, will have the incidental effect of enabling this country to comply with the obligation imposed, in relation to arbitration awards, by Article 220.  All other member states of the Community, with the exception of Luxembourg, are already parties to the convention.</P>
    <P>The New York Convention was designed to replace the 1923 Geneva Protocol and the 1927 Geneva Convention to which I have already referred. The 1927 convention was the first multilateral treaty dealing with the enforcement of foreign arbitration awards.  Certain features of that convention gave rise to dissatisfaction which eventually led to the drawing up of the New York Convention in 1958.  As compared with the earlier convention, the 1958 convention applies to a wider range of awards, reduces and simplifies the formalities with which the person seeking enforcement must comply and makes obstruction by the other party more difficult. The convention has received general international acceptance to the extent that to date 56 countries have ratified it.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the New York Convention.  Article I of the convention provides that the convention will apply to awards made outside the state in which recognition and enforcement is sought.  That article however permits any contracting state to restrict enforcement, on the basis of reciprocity, to awards made in the territory of another contracting state.  The definition of award in section 6 of the Bill takes advantage of this latter provision by restricting the application of the Act to awards made in another contracting state.  It is appropriate <Col N="169" /> that we should undertake to enforce only awards arising in a country which, in its turn, will enforce Irish awards.  As I have mentioned, the New York Convention applies to a wider range of awards than does the Geneva Convention.  To be eligible for enforcement under the earlier convention an award had to be made between persons subject to the jurisdiction of different contracting states.  This restriction, which brings in questions of the nationality or habitual residence of the parties, is not repeated in the New York Convention.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that an award shall be enforceable either by action or in the same manner as the award of an arbitrator is enforceable under section 41 of the 1954 Act.  Under that section an award may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or order of the High Court to the same effect.  In accordance with subsection (2) of section 7, an enforceable award will be recognised for all purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the documents which must be produced by a person wishing to enforce an award in accordance with Article IV of the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 9 sets out the grounds on which enforcement of an award may be refused pursuant to Article V of the convention. These grounds are broadly similar to the existing grounds for refusal of enforcement under the Geneva Convention as set out in Article 56 of the 1954 Act.  In some instances they are restated in a simpler and clearer fashion. The New York Convention makes important changes in the burden of proof imposed on each party.  Under the Geneva Convention it is for the person seeking enforcement to prove that the arbitration agreement is valid, that the award was made by the agreed tribunal and in conformity with the law governing procedure, that the award has become final and that the award was in respect of a matter which may lawfully be referred to arbitration.  Under the New York Convention once the party seeking to enforce an award has furnished to the court the duly authenticated <Col N="170" /> award or a certified copy and the original arbitration agreement or a certified copy, together with translations if required, the burden passes to the other party to prove the existence of any of the specified grounds on which enforcement may be refused.  The Geneva Convention was considered to place an excessive burden on the party seeking enforcement.</P>
    <P>The New York Convention also allows a court before which enforcement is sought to adjourn the proceedings and order the party opposing enforcement to give security if he has applied for the setting aside or suspension of the award. This power to order security to be given has no counterpart in the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 of the Bill implement Article VII of the convention.  The effect of section 10 is that the Geneva Protocol and Convention will no longer apply to an award to which the New York Convention relates but will remain applicable between Ireland and countries which have not ratified the New York Convention but are parties to the earlier protocol and Convention.  The effect of section 11 is to preserve the right of enforcement of foreign arbitration awards which exists at common law.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.  The purpose of this convention is to promote the flow of private investment into underdeveloped countries by providing a means of resolving disputes between foreign investors and the countries in which they have invested.  It represents the culmination of efforts over previous decades to promote investment in countries needing it and at the time same to ensure protection of such investment. One of the problems was the absence of an international facility specifically designed to resolve disputes between private investors and sovereign states. Because a private investor had no status in international law, he had no direct access to an international institution, such as the International Court of <Col N="171" /> Justice, in a claim against a sovereign state.  The private investor would therefore have to pursue his claim before the municipal courts of the state in question, which he might not always wish to do, or seek diplomatic assistance from his own state.  Tribunals set up by private organisations such as the International Chamber of Commerce where frequently unacceptable to Governments in disputes with private interests.  An effort was made in 1962 to adapt the rules of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to permit that body to deal with disputes between foreign investors and states, but this was not successful. The Washington Convention therefore fills a lacuna in international law by providing an international facility&mdash;the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID&mdash;before which private investors and states can deal with each other as equals.  Because the private investor is thus given direct access to an international institution, the convention provides in Article 27 that he must forego diplomatic assistance from his own state in relation to the particular dispute unless of course the state with which he is in dispute fails to comply with an award made under the convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the increase in violence and vandalism in urban areas and calls on the Government to introduce positive and comprehensive plans to eradicate this serious and growing problem. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We put down this motion because we are all aware of this very serious problem in the urban areas today and not necessarily to highlight it because it is highlighted daily in the papers.  I want to put forward <Col N="172" /> some constructive suggestions.  We are all interested in solving this very serious type of problem.  People may want to make emotive speeches, but emotive speeches do not solve it.  It is our duty as legislators to be aware of what is happening. When we see the danger signals, this House is the place to discuss them and to try to come up with some reasonable and helpful solutions.</P>
    <P>Vandalism will have to be looked at on two levels, the short-term solution and the long-term solution.  Long-term solutions for the eradication of vandalism will not solve the immediate problem.  Basically, law enforcement is the Minister's business, but this problem covers a wider field than the Department of Justice.  We would need to have a string of Ministers giving a commitment to try to tackle this problem.  One of the major causes of vandalism is bad housing and the social consequences which emanate from bad housing, overcrowding and bad planning.  We need to put sufficient capital and sufficient thought into planning our cities from the point of view of environmental, social and economic planning.</P>
    <P>We will have to look at the economic facts.  In the Government's White Paper on housing it is intended to take a back seat with regard to inner city housing.  I may be wrong about that, but that is my interpretation of it.  If that is the case, we will not solve these problems; we will compound them.  Education is another very serious aspect, particularly at primary level, in areas where there is a high level of vandalism.  There are also the aspects of overcrowding in classrooms and the socio-economic groupings in one school.  All this does not make for a good society and does not give our children a break.  We talk about cherishing all our children equally, but in the case of inner city primary education it can be said we are not cherishing all our children equally.</P>
    <P>How many of those children go on to second level education, not to speak of third level education?  The figures show the stark reality.  Third level education does not exist.  Those are two aspects: <Col N="173" /> bad housing and poor educational facilities.  The recreational facilities are ill-conceived and ill-thought out.  There is not a sufficient capital input to provide youth development officers.  Our youth policies are totally inadequate and do not deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>Most of these areas lack leadership and, therefore, the provision of youth development officers is very important. Their numbers would need to be trebled or quadrupled.  Some areas can generate their own youth leaders with training programmes, and so on.  The Government seem to adopt the attitude of piecemeal bureaucracy&mdash;what is good for one area must be good across the board.  Of course, that is not the case. The cost of vandalism is astronomical.  It is a soaring cost on our society.  That refers to the economic side, but the cost in human terms is not calculable.  One has only to look around to see the tragic cost in human terms.</P>
    <P>I have given the House some of the causes of this problem.  They are genuine and will stand up to scrutiny.  If we are serious about attacking this problem in the long-term, we must have proper educational programmes which relate to the people in the areas, and not some obscure educational curricula which do not relate to the people and to which they do not respond.</P>
    <P>It is important that the pupil-teacher ratio should be very much lower than it is.  Because of overcrowding in the home and lack of ambition on the part of the parents, from day one their children are underprivileged and are not in a position to take advantage of formal education. We can only do this by lowering the pupil-teacher ratio.  In these areas there are many classrooms going abegging and the actual cost will not be great.  I am aware that the Minister is looking at this and is making some effort to do something about it but the time is long overdue and we should be making positive decisions to get organised and select the right type of teacher for these areas.  There should be direct contact between parents and teachers so that teachers will be aware of the conditions <Col N="174" /> under which children are living and will be aware if there is a problem or if the child is not being properly fed.  This sort of approach towards education could raise the standard considerably.</P>
    <P>Many children leave school unable to read or write and that is a recipe for vandalism. These children inevitably feel inferior, they blame society and take it out on society.  Our attitude towards education in these areas is very important and a greater amount of money should be invested on job training and job experience programmes.  People who come from homes where the father is constantly unemployed consider that a normal way of life and are not encouraged to adapt to normal working hours.  Job training and job experience at an early age will help them to adapt to regular working hours and to work.  This sort of thing will get them away from the attitude that they are not able to work and that work cannot be part of their way of life.</P>
    <P>The whole area of housing is also very relevant and we must make a positive decision to spend more money on housing. This would promote the type of community spirit we all wish to see and will help to do away with marauding vandals in the streets.  I know there has been a lot of controversy between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner about whether or not there is an increase in the crime rate and this type of conflict does not do anybody any good.  Anyone living in the city can see quite clearly that urban vandalism is on the increase. The fact that people just do not bother reporting it any more is an indication. The breaking of windows and the attacking of old people is an everyday occurrence and only a very small percentage of this type of thing is reported.  The statistics, whatever they are do not relate to reality, and I wish we did not have to see this type of conflict between the Garda and the Minister as it is not a healthy sign.</P>

      <P>It is, because if a conflict can be seen between the Minister and the law enforcement body it is not healthy for law enforcement.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is but I will not go beyond that.  The things that I mentioned that have to be tackled obviously do not come within the Minister's Department.  These things will have to be tackled right across the board.  An inter-departmental committee for the inner city of Dublin, a committee that would have been relevant to any inner city situation, regrettably seems to have been shelved.  The inner city report touched on many of the positive things that should have been done to improve the environment in the city.  If we can improve standards by way of housing, recreational facilities, jobs and so on, at least we will be tackling some of the causes of the problem.  It appears that the findings of the interdepartmental committee have been shelved.  If that is the case then it would appear that the Government&mdash;I say the Government because it will have to be a Government decision&mdash;have no intention of tackling the source of the problem, in which case they are remiss and must take a major share of the blame for the existing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even within the Minister's Department it can be shown that there are insufficient gardaí on the beat.  Indeed, I know of one Garda station under strength to the extent of 30 in number, a Garda station in the inner city area.  That situation must be examined.  If the cost and economics alone are examined&mdash;and that is what Governments often do&mdash;it will be seen that the viable thing to do is to increase Garda strength.  In my view an increased number of gardaí on the beat will prevent <Col N="177" /> crime, and prevention is what we should be talking about.  It is all very well to arrest and convict after a crime has been committed&mdash;that is part of their duty&mdash;but prevention will be affected in addition to carrying out environmental improvements, by way of a strong Garda presence on the street.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what I am talking about, I heard quite recently of a particular task force and Special Branch men who had a certain place marked out.  They knew an armed raid was going to take place there. Just as they were ready to move in and arrest, a soldier in uniform passed the scene.  That soldier in uniform put off those prospective offenders.  That is a clear indication that the mere presence of the Garda Síochána on the street will act as a deterrent to such offenders, who will know there is a great risk of their being arrested.  Always our gardaí on the beat were respected and served our community well.  I should like to see more of them patrolling our streets.  I realise that there are certain areas where they would find it difficult to operate alone.  Again that is something that must be faced and resolved.  When we have reached the sorry stage of having situations in which Garda patrol cars are now targets for thugs, God help the rest of us.  If these people are not afraid of the gardaí, then we are all in trouble.  Only the weekend before last there were three people killed in the city&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should get involved in something that is, as far as I know, before the courts, or is liable to come before them.  The Deputy can make his case without mentioning specific cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Three people were killed by a stolen car.  It did not raise a ripple; it was as if nothing had happened. I had often thought that some time people would be killed, when it would bring things to a head.  People were killed in that incident and, regrettably, nothing happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a certain Garda station last Saturday evening the patrol cars could not <Col N="178" /> come onto the streets because in that area there were a number of stolen cars being driven about, like marauding dogs looking for patrol cars to ram.  That is true.  I got that information from a reliable source and I am satisfied it is true.  It is now the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to tackle the Garda.  Again last weekend in a particular case two cars chased a Garda inspector for half an hour with the intention of running him down.  Obviously, in that process a man can be killed.  The offenders did not succeed, but they called out his name&mdash;they had the wrong name&mdash;the name of the man they were calling being a respected member of the Garda Síochána who was doing a lot for that area.  Yet they tried to run him down.  This is a fact of life we must face.</P>
    <P>I know this may seem to be emotive, but when one represents an inner city constituency one hears regularly that old people cannot walk the streets; they cannot even go to church, to evening mass without having their handbags robbed. This happens in broad daylight.  They do not feel secure in their homes without having several locks on their doors.  In such situations if a fire occurs there is no doubt but that they will be unable to open their doors fast enough and will perish because of their fears of what is outside.  When people do not feel safe in their homes it is time we called a halt.  It is time we said: this far and no further. When our people cannot walk the streets of our cities without fear or being molested we are in trouble.</P>
    <P>Unless we take both short-term and long-term preventive measures, this very serious problem will worsen.  There is no doubt about that.  Crime is on the increase. I know it.  I am hearing of cases regularly&mdash;people telephoning me, deputations coming to see me asking &ldquo;What will happen?&rdquo;, &ldquo;When will something be done?&rdquo; I know that the Minister recently had to meet a deputation of his own inner city Deputies because they are receiving the same complaints.  It is certainly not something new to me.  Every Deputy, particularly those who represent inner city areas, is hearing about it regularly.  We want to <Col N="179" /> see visitors being able to move around without being molested.  We want to see our elderly people able to move about in comfort.  Only yesterday I led a deputation to the corporation about a certain problem, and many of that deputation mentioned that they could not leave their homes unattended.  One woman said &ldquo;I must have a babysitter&rdquo;.  There were no babies in the house but she had to have somebody to mind her home while she went out.  It seems that even when couples are leaving their homes they must do so at different times: the husband leaves now and the wife in ten minutes time because, if they are seen leaving together, their home became a target for the boys.  That is the genuinely sad situation obtaining in our cities, cities with a fine heritage.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to take preventive measures.  We hear a lot of talk about Loughan House and incarceration. I am not somebody who wants to incarcerate everybody who commits an offence, but there are individuals roaming the streets of this and other cities who have no regard or respect for human beings, individuals who are incorrigible, who cannot and will not respond to training and advice, individuals for whom a place must be found.  In Dublin there is need for a place of custody for serious offenders.  They go to court where they get bail and within 24 hours they are back in the business of robbing and wrecking cars and all we are told is that there is nowhere to put them. If we are thinking in terms of building a custodial centre we should ensure that it is designed as a place of strict training for work and not as a place of leisure.  I would be in favour of short sentences in such places for the incorrigible.  For others who come before the courts we should think in terms of the whole aspect of community work with a view to having a system on the basis of that which operates on the Continent whereby such people are sent to do such work as clearing derelict sites and to help in all sorts of community schemes.  Those who are likely to respond to such treatment <Col N="180" /> should be given that opportunity but in regard to those who are preoccupied solely with attacking the weak and the elderly positive action must be taken. That is why we must stop the pussyfooting.</P>
    <P>I am talking about short-term measures but the long-term measures are the ones which concern me most.  There is no point in our having short-term proposals for dealing with the problem if we fail to take account of the long-term situation.  When there is a positive commitment to the long-term we can talk about the steps to be taken in the meantime to solve our social problems.  First, we must ensure that the breeding grounds and the training grounds for the type of activity we are talking about are eliminated.  By pursuing positive steps we will ensure in the long-term that our cities and towns are places we can be proud of and in which we can walk without fear of being attacked.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this whole area of vandalism but we must take the situation step by step.  I am sure the Minister has heard the phrase, &ldquo;an acceptable level of crime&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always rejected it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that there is an acceptable level of crime is to say that crime is justifiable.  In a report sent to the Minister by the sergeants and inspectors association there were put forward some positive ideas for dealing with crime. These people are the experts.  They are the people on the ground who are dealing with the situation on a day-to-day basis.  I have not been able to get the report concerned but from the excerpts from it that I have read it is obvious that these men are making a serious attempt to deal with the problem in as humane a way as possible.  I should hope that the Minister would take their recommendation into consideration in regard to whatever steps the Department may take in respect of this whole area with particular emphasis on vandalism and the stealing of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> Another aspect of this matter is the inconsistency of the courts.  There should be some consistency in this regard and the punishment should suit the crime.  If people engage in violent activity they should have to pay for their deeds in some way or other but in my opinion the courts are inconsistent in terms of the punishment imposed.  I do not believe that the Garda are getting sufficient support from the courts.  While members of the force may work very hard to effect arrests they are often treated in court as if they, and not the accused, were in the dock.  This must be very disheartening for the Garda.  We must ensure that they have everything they need to deal with crime.</P>
    <P>There is need for a much greater number of junior liaison officers in our cities. Such people could play a major role in monitoring the activities of young people and observing what potential they might have.  They could keep a fatherly eye on young people who might drift unwittingly into crime and could become involved in worthwhile activities for them in problem areas.  In many such areas the Garda are resented and are not getting the co-operation they deserve from the people of those areas generally. That is why I am suggesting that we appoint more of these junior liaison officers who could make for better relationships between the Garda and the offenders.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this, to take up this matter as possibly one of the most serious problems facing our society today because if it is allowed drift on and get worse the city will become a jungle and it is not far removed from being that at the moment. People will want to move out of the cities and leave them there for the vandals and marauding thugs.  This would be sad.  I have been around the cities on the Continent and I was rather surprised by what I saw.  It was different from Dublin where everything is chained up, locked up, bolted up, and even at that it is still not safe.  The time has come when we have to take this on in a very serious and positive way.  Certainly the Minister will have my full support and the support of <Col N="182" /> all on this side of the House in whatever action he takes, because people are getting fed up.  I am surprised we have not had a backlash.  But let us not wait for a backlash.  Let us take it on now and deal with it in a positive way.</P>

    <P>Despite the recent happenings in our cities, for example, where gardaí have been attacked, where Garda vehicles have been damaged and Garda personnel have been at serious risk when cars have been driven at them and at their vehicles, I am confident that the members of the Force will not be deflected from combating such activities.  A good deal of publicity has been given in the media to a number of the incidents of the cars and public concern has been expressed about them.  In every instance the perpetrators were travelling in cars which had been taken without the consent of their owners.  I can inform the House that to date charges have been preferred in all but one of the cases concerned. That is something that is not given prominence.  Indeed less than 1 per cent of the publicity that has been given to this recent craze of bashing police cars has been given it.  In all but every one, charges have been preferred.  Let me mention briefly something that was mentioned by the Deputy.  He said that squad cars were afraid to come on to the streets the other night.  I have asked my officials who should be in a position to know and who would know if such were <Col N="183" /> the case and we have no knowledge of it. We have certainly had no report from the Garda authorities that this situation arose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I got it from a reliable source.  I am not saying it is correct. There was one man who was 19 or 20 years in the Force and he said it was the first time he could not come out in his car because of the &ldquo;marauding dogs&rdquo; as he called them.  I can tell the Minister where it was.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that I do not accept what the Deputy says as being what he believes to be true.  What I am saying is that if such were the case then it is the responsibility of the officer concerned to tell his authorities and they would, as a matter of courtesy, tell me. We had no knowledge whatsoever of it, nor indeed have we any knowledge whatsoever of it, nor indeed have we any knowledge of two cars chasing a Garda inspector for half an hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I do not doubt that the Deputy has been told this.  I must say again that the Garda inspector concerned has not reported it or if he has it has not been reported to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I mention that and the reason I go to the trouble of nit picking, if it might appear to be such, is that in all but one of the cases where police vehicles have been rammed charges have been preferred.  Let me further say&mdash;and I believe this will probably come out in court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I understand that the mother of a 12½ year-old who <Col N="184" /> was driving the car was a passenger in the car and was seemingly enjoying herself at that time.</P>
      <P>The problems for the Garda that are posed by acts of vandalism and violence on the streets of our cities are considerable and the Garda cannot be expected all alone to carry the burden of dealing with them.  There are those who loudly proclaim that the causes of the mindless anti-social behaviour that often characterises such acts derive from deficiencies in family and social life, from bad housing, from lack of amenities and so on.  I do not altogether exclude these factors but constant attribution of them as the root cause of the whole problem is not acceptable. There can be no tolerance in a democracy for these law-breakers.  There can be no excuse made for violent attacks on the weaker sections of the public&mdash;the old, the infirm, the very young.  Regrettably it is often they who suffer from the violence and the depredations of the vandals.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are our defence. They are in the front-line in combating crime.  They deserve to get the wholehearted support of every citizen.  I know that they do get a considerable amount of assistance from the public. They have acknowledged that help.  But I urge that an even greater contribution be made.  Any information that anyone has, however trivial or unimportant it may seem, that may have a relation to a criminal offence, he should pass it on to the Garda.  They will be grateful for such information and, maybe, it will result in the detection of the offender.  That is the most effective deterrent against the criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course parents have a responsibility in all of this.  The criminal acts we are talking about here are in many instances being done by young people whose parents cannot altogether escape censure.  The schools, too, can make a contribution by inculcating in the young a respect for their fellowmen and for public and private property.  Young people will respond if they are given proper guidance and I should like here to <Col N="185" /> pay a tribute to the excellent work that is being done by the many voluntary organisations that cater for young people.  The boys clubs, community centres, parish centres and the like are all providing real and positive assistance in this regard.  The local authorities too have a role to play.  Dublin Corporation, particularly, has made a very direct impact by providing playgrounds and recreational facilities in very many areas of the city.  I acknowledge the work they and other local authorities have done for the travelling people by the provision of serviced sites for them.  But despite all this good work, we are still faced with problems.</P>
    <P>I believe that it will need the concerted and continuing efforts of all those involved to work together to provide young people with outlets for their energies and enthusiasm in legitimate activities. It is right to point out to those who may not know it, or who choose to overlook it, that we in this country are not alone in having a crime level which is much higher than it was ten years ago.  A rise in serious crime has occurred in many countries over the past few years and what has happened here is a reflection of what has happened everywhere. No doubt here I run the risk of being accused of complacency because I make this point.  No fairminded person who knows my record and the record of the Government in the area of law and order can validly make that accusation.</P>
    <P>The reason I refer to the possibly worldwide escalation in crime is to put our situation in context.  It would be wrong for anyone to get the impression that high crime rates here arise from any dereliction of duty by the Garda Síochána or from any failure on my part, as Minister for Justice.  It is my job as Minister for Justice to see that the Force have the resources of men and equipment that they need.  This is not an appropriate occasion to deal at any length with the causes of crime but the crime rates here, as elsewhere in the world, arise from a combination of many factors which include changing social and moral values in the community.  These <Col N="186" /> changes have made the primary functions of the police&mdash;the prevention and detection of crime&mdash;that much more difficult to accomplish.  Let me here again underline one important point, that the community must realise, that sector of it, the vast majority which is well-behaved and law-abiding, that crime prevention is not just a matter for the police.  It is everybody's responsibility.  We can all help the Garda and, of course, ourselves, by taking common-sense precautions to protect ourselves and our property, in this way making things that much more difficult for the potential criminal.</P>
    <P>It will be generally agreed that essentially the Garda need manpower, and manpower that is well-selected and trained and deployed in the most effective way.  They need transport and communications and a range of varied equipment. My record in looking after all these things is one that I am not afraid to defend.</P>
    <P>In relation to manpower&mdash;and with due respect to Deputy Desmond I am not omitting woman-power&mdash;we have excellent ban-ghardaí as well as men&mdash;I would remind the House that when I took office as Minister for Justice in July 1977, the strength of the Garda Síochána was 8,485.  By 31 March this year, Garda strength had been increased to 9,577 and recruitment is continuing with a view to bringing the strength up to 10,000 by the end of the year.  In all, a total of 1,509 gardaí have been recruited since July 1977 but, allowing for wastage through retirement and deaths, the total net increase in strength since then is 1,092.  The next batch of 90 recruits will complete their training in Templemore on 8 May next and the majority of them will be assigned to stations in Dublin.</P>
    <P>During 1979, the Detective Branch was increased by approximately 300 members and the strength of the Garda Technical Bureau is now being increased to provide for four investigation units instead of one as at present, whose services will be available to assist in the solution of serious crimes.  The Special Task Force is also being increased to approximately <Col N="187" /> more than double its present size so that it can more readily respond to whatever demands are made on it.</P>
    <P>There have been comments for some time past about the alleged need to improve the quality of Garda recruits.  I dealt with this matter fairly fully in reply to a recent Dáil question and here I will just repeat three points: first, the vast majority of recruits coming into the Force in recent years have qualified in the leaving certificate examination.  The figure is that at the last intake over 94 per cent had the leaving certificate. Secondly, the academic standard required for entry to the Garda Síochána is comparable to the standard set for entry for practically every major police force in Europe.  Thirdly, I have the assurance of the Garda Commissioner that the standard of recruits coming into the force in recent times is as high as at any time in the past, if not higher.</P>
    <P>Recruit training is being reviewed to see whether the existing programme is adequate in terms both of content and duration.  I can assure you that the findings which emerge from this review will meet with a very positive response from me.</P>
    <P>In-service training&mdash;that is refresher training for serving gardaí&mdash;has been introduced and is being gradually extended. The Government took a decision some months ago to establish a residential Police College for the training of middle and senior rank officers.  I should mention that to strengthen the management structure of the Force the Government also some months ago, appointed two additional assistant garda commissioners, one of these to have specific responsibility for force training at all levels.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1978, a new unit was set up in Garda Headquarters, headed by a superintendent with special responsibility for the operation of a community relations bureau, and for the overall administration of the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  The main objective of the bureau is to increase the co-operation and improve relations <Col N="188" /> generally between the Garda Síochána and the public.</P>
    <P>The superintendent and inspectors in the bureau have given a number of talks to various community groups and associations in the Dublin area, and in addition a selected inspector in each district in the Dublin Metropolitan Area has been given special responsibility for community relations work in his particular area.  In general, these inspectors help members of the public and youth or community organisations who need advice; they also keep in touch and co-operate with groups and organisations in their districts and so encourage a better understanding of Garda problems.</P>
    <P>It is essential to ensure that members of the Force are deployed in the way that enables them most effectively to perform their duties.  Here some experimentation is necessary.  Modern transport has created certain problems for police&mdash;it has made criminals much more mobile&mdash;even to the extent as Deputy O'Brien said of ramming Garda cars&mdash;and takes up much police time in dealing with traffic congestion, accidents and so on.  At the same time transport is an invaluable aid to police&mdash;it makes it possible for them to maintain a presence over a wide area and to respond quickly to incidents or calls for assistance.  Patrol cars, controlled by radio, make different systems of policing possible and studies are at present being carried out by a joint Garda and Department of the Public Service study team to see what organisation of mobile and foot patrols can best meet our needs, both in rural areas and particularly in the developing new suburbs of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>We are told constantly that what is needed is the garda on foot, patrolling his beat.  In the same breath we are told that this system of policing is outmoded having regard to the fast cars and sophisticated methods used by modern criminals.  What we need is a satisfactory level of Garda presence on our roads and streets where they are easily accessible to the public but at the same time the Force must have the means of responding quickly to whatever demands <Col N="189" /> arise.  A garda on foot, patrolling a suburban roadway may give reassurance to the residents there but he can be of little help in the case of a burglary or some other crime which arises maybe only a quarter of a mile away.  It is necessary to establish what allocation of men to different areas and what combination of foot patrols and patrol cars is best suited to our needs, and work is going ahead rapidly on this.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the maximum possible number of gardaí are made available for operational police work, an examination is being carried out to see to what extent gardaí on clerical duties can be replaced by civilians.  The Force already have the assistance of approximately 300 civilian staff but I am hopeful that this number can be considerably increased. It is obviously desirable that gardaí who are specially selected and trained for police duties should not be utilised on duties which do not require police training, skills or powers.  The possible extension of civilianisation is being examined in full consultation with the Garda staff associations under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and I am hopeful that good progress will be made soon.</P>
    <P>I propose now to give the House some crime statistics for 1979.  The figures I give are provisional figures&mdash;and I stress that&mdash;and there is a possibility of some variations in the final figures when these have been compiled.  It is hoped that the Commissioner's Annual Crime Report for 1979 will be ready for publication in a few months' time.  Although we are dealing here with violence and vandalism in urban areas, I think it would be useful to view the problem in context of the overall crime situation.  The number of indictable offences for 1979 is provisionally 64,051 which represents an increase on the 1978 figure of about 3 per cent.  A total of 26,310 of these offences were detected in 1979; this is a detection rate of 40.0 per cent, which is about the same as the rate for 1978.</P>
    <P>Turning to incidents of vandalism I do not think that I need weary the House <Col N="190" /> with reams of statistics.  I will confine myself to giving some figures about the situation in central Dublin.  The number of reported incidents of malicious damage in the city centre in 1979 was 6,211; in 1978, the figure was 5,924, in 1977, 5,997 and in 1976 5,593.  Of course the level of vandalism is high and is a matter of serious concern.  Since I have taken up office Garda strength in the four Garda districts in the city centre has been increased by 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Vandalism is also on the increase in Cork City, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, but I am advised that outside these urban areas this type of behaviour is not causing a serious problem, though of course the members of the public who suffer from the actions of vandals view the situation in the light of their own experiences. I do not blame them for that. Anyone of us who was a victim would react the same way.</P>
    <P>Current provisional overall crime figures for the Dublin Metropolitan area are not good.  They have not been good for many years now and despite the measures that have been taken by the Government and by the Garda the level of crime remains far too high.  Vandalism and violence have increased, but I am not despondent.  I have every confidence in the Garda Síochána and, so far as I and the Government are concerned, they will not be denied the resources they need to do their job.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to comments made by Deputy O'Brien with regard to an alleged conflict, a row or, as one newspaper put it, a public brawl between the Garda Commissioner and myself.  At a dinner in Limerick last week I went into this in great detail because it was my first opportunity with a Garda audience to deal with the matter since publicity was given to what happened in Galway. There was no row, no conflict, or anything remotely approaching a row or conflict, between the Garda Commissioner and myself.  I do not have to ask anybody to accept my word for that because I can prove it very easily.</P>
    <P>The statement I made about crime levels and for which the commissioner, <Col N="191" /> according to one newspaper, had &ldquo;rapped&rdquo; me, was not thought up by me or by anybody in my Department.  It was a statement provided by Garda headquarters. The story that I was trying to conceal the true picture and that the commissioner found it necessary to reveal it, is completely untrue and is not in accordance with the facts.  I could be more specific.  I, as Minister for Justice, have no source of information about crime levels other than the Garda Síochána.  It is therefore impossible for there to be any conflict between us about these figures because I get the figures from them.</P>
    <P>Crime statistics are not secret.  They are published yearly in great detail in the commissioner's annual report.  For a variety of reasons, the 1978 report was not available until quite recently and showed a small decrease in crime when compared with 1977.  When the 1978 report was being published some weeks ago I said in an interview&mdash;and I am not now referring to the Galway speech but to an earlier interview&mdash;that the decrease, small though it was, was welcome and I paid tribute to the Garda Síochána for their efforts in securing such a result.  I went on to say that indications were that the 1979 figures when available would turn out to be of about the same level.  That was exactly and precisely the information supplied to my Department by Garda headquarters. That was not bad news, bearing in mind that we had previously witnessed increases of the order of 20 per cent between one year and another.  Having made that remark and having paid tribute to the Garda&mdash;which was the whole point of what I was saying&mdash;I went on to point out that I was not foolish enough to think that a small reduction of this kind should make us complacent about the crime situation.</P>
    <P>I repeated the gist of those remarks a few weeks later in Galway.  I did not even speak of the downward move in 1978 but of the halt in the upward trend. I did so before a Garda audience for the purpose of enabling me to lead into a <Col N="192" /> tribute to the Garda Síochána for their efforts.  The commissioner in his speech in Galway was good enough to respond by thanking me for my tribute to the Force making the observation that the hope I had expressed about the 1979 figures might be slightly optimistic.  That was the sum total of the &ldquo;challenge&rdquo;, the &ldquo;contradiction&rdquo;, the &ldquo;row&rdquo;, or, as one evening newspaper put it, the &ldquo;public brawl&rdquo; between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner.  Life is full of hazards.  I clearly said in Galway and elsewhere that there was no room for complacency about the figures but, believe it or not, the same newspaper accused me of being complacent.  One cannot win.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Brien for accepting what I said, that there was not, is not and will not be a row, because I can prove beyond a shadow of doubt that there was not.  I appreciate the Deputy's very responsible approach in this area.  It would be very bad for the morale of the police if there was a row.  The police, as a body, need 100 per cent support and co-operation from all the community if they are to take on the criminals, whether they be juveniles or adults, and to deal effectively with them on behalf of our community.</P>
    <P>I had a number of meetings recently with the Garda Commissioner and Garda authorities about what I believe is a very serious problem in this city, as it is in other cities.  This is a very big problem.  The temporary arrest we had made in this type of juvenile crime is on the increase again.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Brien on his comments on Loughan House.  I did not like to establish Loughan House, I never wanted to have to do it, but there are people who would be free if members of the Labour Party had got their way, and perhaps members of Fine Gael.  They have a motion on the Order Paper asking that Loughan House be closed.  As I said, I did not like the idea of Loughan House, but I do not make apologies to anybody for having it.  I have been pilloried for it by the do-gooders.</P>
    <P>I say to them that it will be kept there, <Col N="193" /> and if necessary I will open more of that type of institution.  If it is necessary to have such institutions to protect the community, the old and the infirm, I have a responsibility to provide them and that I will do.  Some youngsters of this age are in for rape, for assaulting and mugging old people&mdash;I am talking about the people in Loughan House. They are not just put in there.  They are being trained to be channelled back into society again.  Some of those who have been in Loughan House have been brought back into society and we hope and pray that we will continue to be successful with this work.  Those who complain in this House about the high rate of vandalism and violence, which I agree exists, would do well to remember that when you talk to the old people who have been mugged or whose handbags have been snatched, you learn that if they are to be protected as they must be, those, as they were called by Deputy O'Brien, incorrigibles must be taken out of circulation for the protection of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eileen Desmond is shaking her head and smiling.  She was on the radio the other night asking for my resignation as Minister for Justice.  She is about to speak and perhaps she will tell us what she will do about the under-16 rapist or the mugger.  Will she bring him down to Togher in Cork and let him loose there?  No fear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commence by congratulating Deputy O'Brien.  This is a commendable motion, it is opportune, it is of pressing concern to a great number of people throughout the country.  Deputy O'Brien is concerned about his own area.  In his reply the Minister referred to the Togher area in Cork.  Of course that is of real concern to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I compliment Deputy O'Brien on his appeal for lack of emotion in this debate.  It is important that we do not give way to emotion, as the Minister displayed in the closing part of his speech.  That is not at all helpful.  We all have different views about how to <Col N="194" /> solve this problem and it is not a matter of confrontation across the floor of the House.  The motion calls for a positive and comprehensive plan to deal with this problem and I did not see the need for the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>In his motion, Deputy O'Brien did not imply any lack of support for the methods of the Garda in combating crime.  He appealed for an unemotional, responsible approach to it.  The only area with which I agree with the Minister is that he appreciates that crime and violence in our society might be rooted in deprivation.  These things may be rooted in the fact that many of our citizens have been treated unjustly and that there is a great sense of alienation and hopelessness among many people. This is a long-standing problem which calls for a long-standing solution, as Deputy O'Brien said.  That is the aspect of the problem to which we must address ourselves.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, there is an immediate, short-term problem to be dealt with.  I agree with those who say that it can best be dealt with by the positive presence of more gardaí on the beat throughout our cities.  That is not inconsistent with our opposition to the move to open Loughan House.  We believe in the preventive role of the Garda.  That is the role they see themselves performing in relation to crime.  They hope they will have the co-operation of citizens.  Unfortunately the victims of that crime are in the main deprived people themselves, the elderly and the disabled.</P>
    <P>They are the people, as the Minister said, who are the victims of even gang rape.  They are condemned to live in insecure surroundings, deprived of the amenities which people in more favoured areas take for granted.  They look to us for a short-term solution to their problems and, as I have said, we see that solution in more gardaí on the beat, gardaí with better equipment and morale.  The only problem in this respect is that people who may be alienated and deprived cannot see that the law works impartially, and that the same force of the law is being applied to those who are <Col N="195" /> deprived as to those in more favourable circumstances.</P>
    <P>Violence is the root cause of vandalism and I am afraid violence is acceptable in our society.  I am afraid there is a great tolerance here of violence.  Groups and individuals are very concerned at this tolerance.  Our young people see violence on television.  They are exposed to it from the moment they are born and therefore have a great tolerance of violence.  We are inclined also to turn a blind eye to violence in the home.  We have a Family Home Protection Act, we have barring orders when violence occurs within the home, but we have not had proper enforcement of these barring orders, despite several questions and appeals to the Minister to have those provisions tightened up.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to say that for many of our children violence begins in the home.  Both parents and children in many instances are the victims of an unjust society and by our tolerance in that respect we are exposing children to violence from the moment of their existence. That might be all right for children with more enlightened or favoured backgrounds because they get a proper sense of balance.</P>
    <P>This debate is about an overall comprehensive plan to deal with violence in the long-term.  In the areas where violence is most prevalent&mdash;and I am not saying that violence does not apply right across the board or in the more privileged areas&mdash;and in the areas where it is more obvious and more apparent, there is a total lack of amenities.  I am surprised that the Minister attaches so little importance to this.  I favour the line taken by Deputy Fergus O'Brien, which is consistent with the line we have always taken on these benches&mdash;that we need an overall long-term plan to combat the violence that exists in those urban areas of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Some people in the first analysis, come from homes which, through no fault of their parents, are deprived.  We must start with proper housing.  We have built huge, heartless, mindless estates <Col N="196" /> with no centres, no recreational or community facilities, no prospects whatsoever for a community spirit.  Children of that deprived background and bad housing, with parents who are themselves deprived, lack a favourable start in life.  They must have security in the home and prospects of education and of employment.  Pre-school facilities are also very important.  Estates need day centres and pre-school facilities to combat the injustice and deprivation perpetrated on these areas by society.  These should be our priorities but, instead, in these areas we have classrooms with the largest number of children per teacher. There is a complete lack of teachers to make up for the deprivation of these children, which is, unfortunately, their birthright.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility for the upholding of law and order and is the one to whom a motion of this nature is addressed in the House, but there is no question of any one Minister having overall responsibility for tackling this problem, whether on a short-term or long-term basis, particularly not on a long-term, basis.  We must have changed attitudes towards housing, towards education, and involvement with health problems.  It has been stated many times, including quite recently, that a number of the people who commit acts of violence need psychological care and health care in one form or another.  It has been proved beyond doubt, without going into statistics, that the people who are in line to be committed to Loughan House were in the main underweight under par so far as education is concerned, deprived in every way.</P>
    <P>The Minister when opening Loughan House told us that he intended closing it within three years and giving us a more modernised approach towards these victims of our society.  He horrified me tonight by saying that he was going to keep Loughan House open and to open more such institutions.  This is against all the thinking and all the advice given to the Minister and we are talking here about children.  No child is born bad; he is the victim of his environment and <Col N="197" /> should be so treated.  We have children who are perpetrating these crimes of violence and who have gone before the courts before, many of them perpetual offenders because there is no follow-up service worth talking about.  There is the expansion of the service of which the Minister speaks tonight but that is only a drop in the ocean compared with the needs which exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, in response to my question earlier this year in relation to Loughan House, admitted that a number of children had been released whose whereabouts are not known.  That is a terrible indictment, for which I do not hold the Minister and his Department wholly responsible.  These children whose whereabouts are not known are in the vulnerable position they were in before they were committed to Loughan House.  There should be some follow-up service, some extension of the juvenile liaison service to cover these children who are supposed to be the greatest offenders and who must be contained to the extent that they have to be incarcerated in that closed prison situation. What the Minister has said does not alter my attitude towards Loughan House. You can lock people up for as long as you like, but if you have no follow-up service you build up a sense of frustration and alienation.  The service must be geared to bringing these people back into society and making them feel that somebody cares.  Given proper environment, consideration and affection, children will not respond with acts of violence against their fellow citizens. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>We have the question of employment prospects for the boys and girls who are often the unfortunate victims of society. I have no wish for this situation to continue but it is a question of how to go about changing it and what will bring about a greater measure of justice and <Col N="198" /> equity in society, which, in turn, will eradicate this violence.  We have the question of the employment prospects of people living in those areas from which vandals come and of children who have come before the courts and have records.  There are areas in our cities where an address mitigates against getting employment.  People in those areas have come from deprived homes, have no education and are deprived when it comes to being accepted by society into positions of employment.  I make my case for a long-term solution, based on fair treatment for all and special consideration for children who are at risk and who might be the victims of hard core criminals.  We have always made a case that there might be a very small group of people who need containing, who could be incorrigibles, as we say, and who may suffer from illness in one form or another.  A lot of our children are exposed to that sort of environment because of the lack of facilities.  I appeal, in the closing moments of this debate that, if this debate does nothing else, it might impress upon the Minister the need to encourage his colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Government generally, to take some action on a Children's Bill, some action on the report of the task force, which I understand has now been submitted and which certainly is in preparation for some time.  This would be a substitute for the Children's Act of 1908 and the School Attendance Act of 1926 and would be a measure of up to date thinking, so far as children are concerned.  I stress the need of children from deprived areas.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 30 April 1980.</P>

    <P>The total number of Air Corps cadets recruited in the period 1970 to 1979 inclusive was 75.</P>
    <P>The number of Air Corps cadets who successfully completed their flying training and were commissioned as pilot officers in that period was 45.  The number of cadets who did not complete their flying training in that period was 30.  The total number of pilots who left the Air Corps through resignation, retirement, death, and so on in the same period was 33.</P>

    <P>The last competition for Air Corps cadetships was held in 1977.  With a view to improving the situation, consideration has since been given to selecting Army officers and/or Army cadets for training as Air Corps pilots.  The matter will be decided shortly before the next competition for Army cadetships is announced and in the light of the revised establishment for the Air Corps.  It is anticipated that a class will commence flying training later this year.</P>

    <P>Attendance at all forms of training in An Fórsa is on a voluntary basis.  Only reservists on the effective strength of An Fórsa may attend training.  In order to remain on the effective strength, members must attend at least 24 training <Col N="69" /> parades, each of not less than two hours duration, or their equivalent in hours of training&mdash;for example, field days, weekend camps&mdash;in each training year.</P>
    <P>As regards full-time training, members may, with their own consent, be required to attend on one occasion as soon as possible after enlistment for a course of basic training of not less than 14 and not more than 30 days.  Thereafter, members may, with their own consent, be required to attend in each training year for a course of training of not less than seven and not more than 14 days.  In addition, <Col N="70" /> provision is made for attendances at full-time training for special purposes, such as potential officers' courses.  Periods of full-time training are devoted as far as possible to training as such but members may be required to participate in normal barrack duties during such periods.</P>
    <P>The establishments and strengths, by corps, of officers and men of An Fórsa as on the 31 December of each year from 1970 to 1979 are given in the appended statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will give the following details of the new organisation of the Reserve Defence Forces, in particular the FCA, (i) how the new organisation differs from that given in the Irish Defence Force Handbook 1974 (ii) the number and rank of regular personnel in the FCA and (iii) the difference in uniform and insignia between FCA and PDF and the changes that are planned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisation outlined in the Irish Defence Force Handbook 1974 incorporated the FCA and PDF in an integrated brigade structure.  The new organisation provides for the separate <Col N="72" /> development of the PDF and FCA as combat and local defence forces respectively. The appended statement shows the FCA corps structure as it existed prior to reorganisation and as it exists at present.</P>
      <P>The FCA are now organised on a command basis with a special staff in each command.  A new directorate of Reserve Forces which has overall responsibility for the development of all the reserve elements, of which the FCA will be the largest component, has been established.  This directorate will cater in a special way for the development of the FCA and other reserve elements.</P>
      <P>The following is the authorised establishment of PDF personnel employed on duties with FCA units or assigned to Command FCA Staffs:</P>

    <P>A new uniform has been approved for issue to non-commissioned personnel of the FCA.  The uniform will be similar to that issued to members of the Permanent Defence Force except that the berets will be green and the tunic will have maroon epaulettes and an FCA flash.  The question of bringing the FCA officers' uniform into line with that of Permanent Defence Force officers is also under consideration.</P>

    <P>Particulars of the cost of these services to the Garda Síochána are not readily available as separate records of such costs are not maintained.</P>
    <P>In accordance with standing arrangements relating to the use of Air Corps helicopters on behalf of Government Departments, the only expenses paid by my Department in respect of the services of Air Corps helicopters are expenses such as the cost of fuel and subsistence expenses of the crews.  These expenses are paid on the basis of the current cost of fuel and current rates of subsistence allowance.  No charge is made where Air Corps helicopters are requisitioned by Gardaí to assist in cases such as mountain and sea searches or rescues, which the Department of Defence regard as public rather than Garda duty.</P>
    <P>Helicopters were hired from private or foreign sources on three occasions during 1979 and for security reasons I do not propose to give details.</P>

      <P>Military assistance may be provided for the Garda either in response to specific requests made in circumstances of a non-recurring kind or in accordance with standing arrangements governing particular kinds of operation.</P>
      <P>Specific requests are made, generally speaking, on the basis that the safety of Garda personnel requires that military assistance be available or else that, because of numbers of personnel required to deal with a serious situation of an emergency character, the Garda could not cope by themselves.  Such requests are made by the most senior member of the Garda Siochána involved, and where possible by way of written request signed by a member not below the rank of inspector.  If time permits, the prior approval of the Commissioner is sought.</P>
      <P>Examples of standing arrangements are the escort of explosives in certain cases and the carrying out of certain Border patrols.</P>
      <P>Approval of the Minister for Justice is not required for specific requests but where there is a recurring situation, involving a repeated commitment of military personnel, the matter is dealt with at ministerial level.  There is no rule of principle that Garda personnel must be present but in practice they almost always are present except on certain escort duties or certain patrolling duties when there may or may not be a Garda presence.</P>
      <P>Military personnel acting in aid of the civil power in such circumstances have no specific authority as military personnel to make arrests, but they have those powers of arrest that the law vests in citizens generally.  Section 15 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976 provides certain powers of arrest for members of the Permanent Defence Force when requested in accordance with that section to assist the Garda but no request under that section has been made by the Garda since the enactment of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The strength of the Garda Síochána allocated to stations in Dublin city and county on 31 March 1980 was 3,048.</P>
      <P>The precise arrangements made for the allocation of manpower as between foot patrols and other duties in any particular area are matters for the Garda officers concerned.  The number of gardaí on foot patrol in Dublin varies considerably from time to time and depends on factors such as the available resources, local circumstances, other demands for Garda services and the time of day or night.  In any event it would be contrary to established practice to give details of the number of gardaí allocated to particular duties in any particular area at any particular time.</P>

      <P>Offenders on release from prison may avail of the help and facilities provided by the probation and welfare service of my Department.  The service provides counselling and advice for such offenders and their families.</P>
      <P>Offenders who have completed their sentence are not obliged to accept supervision but it is offered to all offenders before they are discharged.  Very few do, in fact, accept supervision.</P>
      <P>Offenders who are granted full temporary release under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 are usually released on condition that they accept supervision by the service during the period of the release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a scheme was introduced whereby certain offenders are released to serve the balance of their sentence in the <Col N="92" /> community under intensive supervision of the service.  In such cases a probation and welfare officer would have only four or five offenders to look after: at present 14 officers are engaged exclusively on this work.</P>
    <P>My Department provide a day-centre (with workshop facilities) in Dublin for those released on intensive supervision. In addition my Department support financially voluntary committees who provide living accommodation, work-training, or day-centre facilities for discharged or released offenders.</P>
    <P>Apart from staff engaged on intensive supervision, no other staff are engaged exclusively on after-care of offenders. Usually after-care is carried out by staff as part of their overall case-load.  Consequently it is not possible to give a meaningful costing of the after-care element of their work.</P>

These operations may not be carried out at night, unless the permission of the harbour master has been received.  Houses for the transfer of petroleum are examined and pressure-tested under the supervision of the harbour master and all pumping ceases while other ships are moving in the vicinity.</P>
      <P>Draft by-laws relating to the discharging, loading, handling, storage and distribution of petroleum within the limits of the port of Drogheda are currently being examined in my Department.  These by-laws are intended to prevent the risk of accident, including oil spillage, by ships and storage tanks at the port.  I hope to be in a position to approve these by-laws as soon as the necessary consultation procedure has been completed.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have been requested by my Department to consider what they can do to facilitate or promote the recovery of useful materials.  In general, the action taken has been to provide or encourage provision of facilities for deposit of old cars, household equipment and other metal scrap, waste oil and bottles so that such materials may be collected by commercial interests for recycling.  Little, if any, of the domestic and commercial refuse collected by local authotities is recycled at present since the market prices for recovered primary materials would not cover the costs involved in sorting, cleaning, marketing and delivery.  There may be prospects for at-source separation, for example of paper and cardboard, but in the present state of the waste paper market, prices are unlikely to make paper recovery operations viable.</P>

      <P>RTE consider that the reception of RTE 1 in this area is adequate and assume therefore that the question refers to RTE 2 only.  Since the RTE 2 service was introduced in November 1978 from a limited number of transmitters and transposers the service has been extended to areas served by a further nine transposers and further extensions are in hand.  RTE are not, however, in a position at this stage to say when the second service will be provided in this area.</P>
