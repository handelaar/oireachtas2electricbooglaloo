      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will now publish the reply he has received from President Carter to his letter on the Middle East conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to release the text of private correspondence from a head of Government. However, as I said in this House last Wednesday, the terms of President Carter's reply were positive and encouraging.</P>
      <P>The President expressed his deep concern about the attacks on UNIFIL and stated specifically:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" />&ldquo;I was shocked by the murder in cold blood of two Irish soldiers&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>which he further described as &ldquo;an act of barbarism&rdquo;.  The letter recounts US efforts to bring improvement to the situation in Southern Lebanon and to make it possible for UNIFIL to fulfil its mandate. The President agreed with my view of the vital importance of UNIFIL and said he welcomed</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the courageous decision of your Government to maintain Irish participation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The President's letter also expressed his desire to continue close co-operation with us to resolve the difficult problems facing Southern Lebabon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the President's letter as being encouraging. Did the letter encourage the Government to argue for a boycott of the Moscow Olympics?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Olympics were not referred to in the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether the letter indicated that President Carter had taken or would take steps to put pressure on Israel to stop them supplying assistance to Major Haddad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms he indicated his intention to do everything possible to ensure that UNIFIL would be enabled to fulfil its mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no reference to any representations to Israel on the subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously that would be part of the efforts which the President would undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But he did not refer to it?  It is the Taoiseach's suggestion that it is part of it, but he did not say that?</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. that 104 completed advance factory units totalling approximately 1.4 million square feet are vacant at present.  Of this number, 26 are small industry cluster units.  The location and area of each of these factories is contained in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> Comhairle, I propose to have circulated. I would add that 65 of these factories, totalling over 980,000 square feet or 70 per cent of the total area, are at different stages of negotiation with the promoters of relevant projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Manufacturing firms are not obliged to notify me of job losses <Col N="11" /> and I do not therefore have precise information on this matter.  However, information on redundancies provided to the Department of Labour by employers in these three sectors shows that in 1979 the number of redundancies was 939 in the textiles industry and 307 in the clothing and footwear sectors combined. The corresponding figures for the first three months of this year are 549 and 96 respectively.  These figures are derived from notifications which must be given under the Redundancy Payments Acts in circumstances where employers are laying off workers who are regarded as being qualified for redundancy payments. To that extent the figures may not be regarded as comprehensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question refers to employment in manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>(a)  Manufacturing firms are not obliged to notify me of job losses and there are no official statistics available. The only relevant statistics available are those for proposed redundancies in manufacturing industries as notified to the Department of Labour; in 1979 the total was 4,313 and, in the first quarter of 1980, 1,479.</P>

      <P>The development of industries based on exploitation of our natural resources is a fundamental part of overall industrial strategy and both the IDA and SFADCo., in the exercise of their promotional powers, encourage the maximum use of native raw materials.  While the IDA's annual reports give a broad sectoral breakdown of jobs approved, it is not possible to provide more precise information on the number of jobs created by exploitation of our natural resources, as many firms across a wide range of sectoral activity will use both native and imported, raw and semi-processed, materials to some degree and in varying proportions.</P>

      <P>The reply I gave refers to manufacturing industry which is our particular responsibility in the Department. A number of other Ministries have responsibility for the exploitation of natural resources, for example, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Energy.  The statistics involved go across the whole spectrum of manufacturing industry. There is a long list of job approvals in various sectors for 1977, 1978 and 1979.  I can give it to the Deputy by way of letter if he so requires.  In the IDA five-year plan for the development of industry and for job targets they have a specific area where industries using natural resources as raw material are referred to.  They are above target at present and aim to provide 5,000 new jobs in manufacturing industry over the next ten years and refer to the fact that about 1,800 new jobs could be created in timber harvesting and processing by 1985. The ratio in manufacturing industry to service industry is about 1.1 : 1.4 so that for every job in manufacturing there is about one or one-and-a-half jobs in service.</P>

It is not possible to distinguish further between firms using all or some degree of native raw materials and those using imported or semi-processed materials.

      <P>I am aware of the statement in question.  I am informed by the IDA that they are satisfied that the history of industrial relations in the Limerick area was a significant factor influencing the company's decision not to proceed with the project.  In the light of the company's sudden withdrawal, the IDA had considered that the only new element which could have given rise to their decision was the current difficulties at Aughinish seen against the background of the earlier disputes which led to the closure of the Ferenka plant.</P>

In the past a number of Irish State-sponsored bodies under various Departments assisted countries in the Third World.  Is there any general review of the situation or is it being done piecemeal, Department by Department?</P>

      <P>At present a standard specification for requirements for <Col N="23" /> smoulder and flame resistant upholstery is being drawn up by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the IIRS, and the question of making this standard specification mandatory by regulations is under consideration.</P>
      <P>A notice to this effect for the attention of the upholstered furniture industry was published in the press on 11 January 1980.

      <P>It is not possible to say that all upholstered furniture on sale in this country at present satisfies fire resistance tests.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and accordingly the other parts of the question do not arise.  However, as the question apparently is based on reports which have received some publicity but which were unfounded, I think it right, for the information of the House, to give some additional particulars.</P>
      <P>The Government, whose statutory responsibility it is to make appointments at chief superintendent and superintendent levels, decided in November last that the promotion interview boards which sit in these cases to make recommendations to the commissioner and, through him, to me and to the Government, should include a civilian&mdash;by which I mean a non-Garda member. That was the only decision the Government made on the matter and they did not nominate any particular person for this purpose or any panel from which the person would be selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection of the civilian was made by the commissioner who also decided that it would be appropriate that the civilian should chair the board and that he himself should withdraw from it.  As such decisions are internal administrative ones, I would not normally make any further comment, but in the particular circumstances, in case there is any lingering suggestion that the commissioner <Col N="27" /> was under some form of pressure from me to withdraw from the chairmanship or from the board, I wish to make it quite clear that this was not so.  However, I think I should make it equally clear that when he told me what he had in mind and of the reasons for it, I appreciated the force of those reasons and&mdash;again because of the publicity that was given to this matter&mdash;I am prepared to say that the fundamental reason for the decision was that he was anxious to take this opportunity to solve the recurring prooblem of his having to take himself away from his ordinary duties as commissioner for the periods necessary to chair those boards.  That recurring problem was one that was greatly added to by the fact that, on the very same occasions, two other officers in key positions, namely, two deputy or two assistant commissioners who traditionally sat on those boards with the commissioner, were also required to be away from their ordinary duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

It would appear that the Government took a decision to put a civilian on the board and that the commissioner decided in those circumstances, in view of the fact that this altered his role in the matter, that he would not serve on the board and nominated somebody else to do so.

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

Apparently these were left out in the printing or typing of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, Part I, line 23, after &ldquo;telegrams&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or automatically or technologically transmitted messages&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very brief amendment and is a point on which I should be quite willing to take the Minister's advice.  We felt that <Col N="71" /> it would be desirable to extend the possibility of the limitations imposed by the section here, on letters and telegrams, to include other possible technological developments which may arise.  I am not suggesting that this is necessarily the best wording, but the concept is that, rather than having to go back to the House, to include such some phrase which would allow for technological development, or for automatic or technologically transmitted messages.  Would the Minister take the point that there may be a need to supplement letters and telegrams?  I am sure that in a few years' time these will be an outdated form of communication.  That is the essential point involved in this very modest suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is our intention to oppose this amendment, it is important that I give the justification for that.  The definition of arbitration agreement in section 2 is framed to take account of article II (2) of the New York Convention which provides that the term &ldquo;agreement in writing&rdquo; shall include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement signed by the parties or contained in the exchange of letters or telegrams.  The purpose of the definition in section 2 is to give effect to that provision in the Convention.  It would not be open to us, as a contracting party to the Convention, to unilaterally change that definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add that it will be a matter for the courts to interpret the definition.  It may well be that a court will accept that the definition would cover an agreement come to between the parties as a result of automatically or technologically transmitted messages.  For example, the definition of arbitration agreement since the 1954 Act speaks only of an agreement in writing, without mentioning letters or telegrams.  Despite this, the courts in the United Kingdom have interpreted the identical provision in the English Arbitration Act of 1950 as including an agreement found in correspondence consisting of a number of letters.  There is no <Col N="72" /> reason to suppose that our courts would take a different view.  As I have indicated, it seems likely that the courts will regard the definition as also covering other modern methods of transmitting written messages.  Effectively, the courts would have open to them the course to interpret the definition to include automatically or technologically operated messages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to unduly delay the House on this point.  This is a problem which could arise right through this Bill, to some extent.  The spirit of the convention&mdash;in my view acceptable to everybody here&mdash;does not necessarily have to be reflected in the verbatim extraction of the precise expression of words in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Minister is assuring us that the reference to exchange of letters or telegrams is sufficiently comprehensive and sufficiently malleable, as it were, to be capable of interpretation in the light of the technological developments which will occur to communication. I suppose we should be satisfied but I do not see why we should not give expression to that concretely in terms of words rather than hoping that a benign judge, endowed with some kind of superior wisdom to those who drafted this Bill, will be able to see something in it and try to stretch the elasticity of those words to include that.  It is a pity we cannot do that because part of the approach to good legislation should be to plan for the future and to be able to say that in ten years time the word telegram will probably not be there, that the people will possibly have visual units in their homes connected to their television sets and they will communicate in different ways.  This Bill should reflect that evolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not totally satisfied with the Minister's explanation, which is essentially to throw back to the court or the adjudication of a competent authority to devise in some mysterious way that we mean things other than letters and telegrams when we say letters and telegrams.  It is clear what letters and <Col N="73" /> telegrams mean and I do not think they are adequately flexible to embrace the kind of concept we are thinking of.  I leave this point with the Minister and it is up to him to take it up if he sees fit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition includes letters and telegrams.  While it says that, it does not exclude any other kind of agreement.  The Deputy probably has in mind telex and such technological aids for transmitting messages as well as telegrams.  The answer is that we are following the Convention which does not refer to telex.  It is expected that the court would interpret the definition in that regard.  This Bill is legislating for the terms as set out in the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and as already stated there is a precedent in the UK where in another area of legislation the courts have been prepared to extend the interpretation to include matters which were not prescribed for in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather regrettable that we have to increasingly trust the court in the area of law making, which is really what we are suggesting here.  The Minister's hope is that if that event arises at a future date the court will interpret it as we wish it to be interpreted.  It seems to me that the onus is primarily on us to give clear and precise definitions and phraseology and legal expression to our intent.  The convention, which this reflects, is approximately 13 years out of date and it is unwise for us to be bound hand and foot by the actual wording in that document.  It would seem reasonably sensible to say: &ldquo;There is a point there, let us see how we can reflect it in words&rdquo;.  I remain convinced of that and also that sooner or later an issue will come up and we will be keeping our fingers crossed that the courts, as they have done on many occasions recently, will be obliged to bail us out of trouble which it is primarily the responsibility of the law makers to cut away.  When that day comes I hope the results will be right.  I will leave the matter at that.  The Minister may be satisfied but I am not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to section 12 of the Arbitration Act, 1954.  Subsection (1) of that section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming through or under him commences any proceedings in any court against any other party to the agreement or any person claiming through or under him in respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any part to such proceedings may, at any time after appearance and before delivering any pleadings or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings, and that court, if it is satisfied that there is not sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was, at the time when the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all the things <Col N="75" /> necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, may make an order staying the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill we are discussing repeals that section.  This section leads on to section 5 and I would have preferred if section 12 of the Principal Act were left in the Bill.  I oppose it being repealed for reasons which I will develop when we discuss section 5.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I oppose section 4 of the Bill is that it sets the context in which the area of jurisdiction and freedom of the courses is whittled away and is circumscribed.  The grounds within which the courts were able to say if they were satisfied that there was not sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred are implicitly removed from the courts' area of consideration.  I believe that that will lead to consequences which we can talk about later.  I oppose section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the proposals made by the Deputy relating to the power of a court to stay proceedings.  His first proposal to delete section 4 would involve the reinstatement of the 1954 Act which deals with the power of the court to stay proceedings in relation to domestic agreements and in relation to agreements to which the 1923 Geneva protocol applies. His amendment to section 5 would substantially re-enact section 120 of the 1954 Act and would result in two legislative provisions having substantially the same effect.  More importantly, there would then be no provision giving effect to Article II (3) of the New York Convention which requires the court to stay proceedings unless it is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being <Col N="76" /> performed.  A provision of this nature is necessary if we are to implement the New York Convention.  I can deal with the New York Convention in fuller detail in relation to section 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it necessary, in order to include this reference to nullity and so on, to repeal this section?  Surely the results which the Minister desires to achieve, the ratification of the significance of the New York Convention could be got by including a relevant section to that effect which would not cut across the letter or the spirit of section 12 of the 1954 Act and that is effectively what I am trying to have put in here.  I do not see why we must repeal section 12 in order to include the essence of what the Minister wishes to include from the New York Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is replacing it with a much tighter and more circumscribed section.  Why not include a wider umbrella of jurisdiction for the courts in what is included in the Bill rather than tying the hands of the courts and giving them extremely limited freedom to operate in this area, a limitation based only on their perception of an arbitration agreement being null and void or inoperative?  Why not take advantage of the volume of case law that has been built up over the years and allow them this wider freedom within which they could operate in line with the New York Convention?  I do not understand why it is necessary to restrict the power of the courts, because after all that is the primary and essential guarantor of justice.  Anything that impinges on the justice permeating influence of the courts is to be looked on with suspicion. I wonder where the demand came for this section.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to case law, but there is no case law in this regard.  In the application to domestic agreements section 5 changes the law.  It replaces section 12 (1) of the 1954 Act which enables the court to stay proceedings if satisfied that there is not sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration and the party making application for a stay is ready and willing to proceed with the arbitration. The reason for this change is the principle that parties should be held to their agreements.  This principle is accepted by the courts.  Their practice in relation to applications under section 12 (1) of the 1954 Act is to stay proceedings, in other words to hold the parties to their agreement.  Section 5 confirms this practice.  This is also the law in other EEC countries and we are bringing our law into line with them.  What we have done in section 4 is to repeal section 12 (1) of the 1954 Act and we have replaced it in section 5 of this Bill.</P>

The paramount consideration should be whether justice is being done. That is a function primarily left to the courts.  We could ensure that people kept to their agreements if we introduced draconian legislation, but nobody would suggest that.  Perhaps we should move on to section 5 where we can discuss this in greater detail.</P>

      <P>This is purely a drafting amendment. The word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; is unnecessary there and could possibly create some kind of confusion.  I do not understand how anyone could commence any type of proceedings in a court other than legal proceedings.

I consulted with the parliamentary draftsman and he is happy with the phrase &ldquo;legal proceedings&rdquo;.  It is not really important and the word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; can be left in the section without causing difficulties. However, I have no objection to dropping the word and I am prepared to accept the amendment.  The word was never in section 12 (1) of the 1954 Act and that is being repealed under section 4 of this Bill; but the word was always used in section 12 (2) of the 1954 Act which is being retained and developed under section 5 of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is the kernel of the Bill in terms of the concern we have about it and I appeal to the Minister to carefully consider the impact of this section.  Will the Minister be good enough to indicate where the demand has come from for this section?  Section 5 of the Arbitration Bill, 1980, as proposed, is in effect a replacement of section 12 of the Arbitration Act, 1954, but there is a very different tone and area of latitude in the new section which has treated public interest detrimentally.  The answer may be, as the Minister hinted in his Second Stage speech, that we are merely agreeing to the convention. However, there is no way in which we or <Col N="80" /> any other country is bound hand and foot by the use of words involved in the convention.  Our desire is to accept the spirit of it without being hidebound by the language used.  The Minister in his Second Reading speech said, as reported at column 813 of the Official Report of 6 May 1980:</P>
      <P>At present a court has a discretion under section 12 (1) of the 1954 Act on whether to stay proceedings in a dispute covered by a domestic arbitration agreement whereas in the case of a foreign agreement section 12 (2) of the same Act obliges the court, except in certain circumstances, to stay the proceedings.  Domestic arbitration agreements are therefore being assimilated to foreign agreements in this regard.  I think it is desirable in principle that parties should be held to their agreement.</P>
      <P>There is no argument about the latter point.  We all believe that it is desirable in principle that parties should be held to their agreement.  The only qualification that any of us would have in that regard would be that such an agreement would concur in its implementation with what we commonly accept to be justice. However, whereas the court could, as it were, assess the overall view or perspective of the reasons for staying the proceedings up to now, the proposal is very different.  The proposal takes that right away from the courts, deprives the citizen of the right to apply to the courts, and says:</P>
      <P>... the court, unless it is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed or that there is not in fact any dispute between the parties with regard to the matter agreed to be referred, shall make an order staying the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a serious, significant, fundamental diminution of the freedom of action of the courts and as such is opposed strongly and basically in principle by my party.  I do not care what we are according to, the ultimate guarantor of the right of citizens in this country&mdash;we <Col N="81" /> have that potential&mdash;is our courts system.  All of it is not perfect and one of the frustrations that some of us have is the inability to talk about it anywhere.  If we ask questions about it here they are ruled out of order and there is nowhere else to ask questions.  There are very important questions to be asked about some aspects of court procedure and about individual actions of a number of judges.  Nevertheless, the overwhelming burden of good that the courts do is something that we should impinge on only after the most careful deliberation and in the most essential circumstances. This does not accord with section 5. Why is this here at all?  The Washington Convention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will dispose of the amendment first.  If the Deputy wishes to raise any matter on the section he is entitled to do it then, but amendments must go first and must be disposed of before the section is debated. We are dealing with amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill gives effect to article II.3 of the New York Convention.  Its effect goes further than this.  As well as requiring a stay in relation to agreement to which the New York Convention applies, it requires a stay in the case of all arbitration agreements whether they are agreements to which the Geneva Protocol of 1923 or the Washington Convention applies or whether they are domestic agreements. There need be no fear whatsoever that the powers of the High Court as they obtain at present are being interfered with, minimised or reduced in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also to state that article II (3) of the New York Convention provides that the court of a Contracting State when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an arbitration agreement shall, at the request of one or other of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.  There was a somewhat similar provision in the 1923 Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses to <Col N="82" /> which effect was given in section 12 (2) of the 1954 Act which is being retained which will be replaced by section 5.  The Washington Convention provides in article 26 that consent of the parties to arbitration under this convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as we remain on amendment No. 3.  It is very difficult for the Chair to follow some of the reasoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In this regard our High Court has full and complete power under the Arbitration Act, 1954 to supervise arbitration proceedings in this country and to ensure fairness and justice to all parties.  It can intervene in the proceedings where there is undue delay in conducting the proceedings or where there is or is likely to be a lack of impartiality on the part of the arbitrator, where the arbitrator has misconducted himself or the proceedings or where the question of fraud by any party arises.  The powers of the High Court include the power to appoint arbitrators where there is failure by a party to appoint or lack of agreement among the parties as to the arbitrator to be appointed, the power to remove arbitrators or revoke their authority, the power to set aside an arbitration agreement and the power to send the matter back for reconsideration to the arbitrator.  Also any party to arbitration proceedings here can request the arbitrator to state any question of law for the decision of the High Court and if the arbitrator refuses the High Court can require him to do so.  None of these powers of the High Court is affected by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What section 5 does is to require a court to stay proceedings where there is a valid arbitration agreement unless the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed or where the court is satisfied that there is, in fact, no real dispute between the parties <Col N="83" /> for settlement by arbitration.  This requirement has been part of our law in regard to arbitration agreements in which the 1923 Geneva Protocol applies since section 12 (2) of the 1954 Act was enacted.  We could not have ratified the Geneva Protocol if we had not included the provision in the 1954 Act.  The provision is necessary also in relation to arbitration agreements for the purposes of the New York Convention and the Washington Convention and we could not ratify those conventions in the absence of that provision.</P>
    <P>I have tried, without repeating much of what has been said, first of all to confirm that there is no minimisation of the courts' powers.  Secondly, this subsection deals purely with a provision, in the absence of agreement, to put a stay on proceedings until such time as arbitration has an opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that amendment No. 3 is opposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us is hostile to the concept of arbitration.  It is simply a question of being very chary indeed about reducing the power of the courts. The Minister has assured the House that that is not the case but if the English language means anything, the potential for action in section 12 of the Arbitration Act, 1954 which the court has is wider fundamentally then the potential for action in the new section, the new section being much more circumscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another document which is relevant here is the Constitution of the country and there is at least an argument that this section could be unconstitutional by virtue of the fact that it impacts detrimentally on the constitutional provisions relating to the power of the court in our State.  I do not see why the Minister, even espousing the cause of embracing the conventions referred to, could not accept my amendment which says simply that in line 10 where the Minister's proposal is that the court unless is it satisfied, and so on, would read &ldquo;and the Court, unless it is satisfied that there is <Col N="84" /> not sufficient reason&rdquo;.  giving the court the power to decide what is a sufficient reason rather than restricting it and trying its hands on the definition of a concept which is null and void.  I will take a practical circumstance which might help. Some of the points that the Minister has mentioned are good theoretical points, such as the possibility of reference to the High Court, point of law and so on.</P>
    <P>However, in reality it is not like that. An arbitration agreement, first of all, is mainly a private affair.  It will be done presumably in a room somewhere off the main concourse.  Unlike the courts, I presume there will not be a public disgallery, that the press will not be present and that there will be no public dissemination of what is going on.  This fundamentally changes the nature of working towards agreement.  The typical example could be a builder selling a house. As I understand it, almost all builders have an arbitration clause in their contracts. This means that the couple buying a house will be put in the position&mdash;they have no choice today when looking for a home&mdash;of accepting the arbitration if it comes to that.  It is a bit of nonsense to pretend that somehow both parties, acting in full and sovereign entitlement and knowledge of their rights, decide they will agree to arbitration if something goes wrong.  In reality, it is very much the strong against the weak in circumstances like that.  The weak, the would-be purchaser, is in no position to tell a builder that he wants the arbitration clause out of the contract: he would not get the house.  The same is true of many insurance contracts.</P>
    <P>There will be people who will abuse this section, who will see it as a means of prevarication and therefore I do not know how we can be assured that there will not be grounds for worrying about delays in the procedure.  There will always be unscrupulous people in our society who will abuse whatever legal provision exists.  In the construction industry as an example, there is a minority there as everywhere else who will see that they will be able to get behind closed doors the kind of subjugation of the <Col N="85" /> public interest which they would not get in a public court because judges would be able to act with wide autonomy and because the press would report an abuse and the public could come in from the street and see it.</P>
    <P>This measure shifts the focus of argument into a smoke-filled back room with two or three people present and the dice loaded heavily against the public interest. I am asking the Minister to broaden the measure to give power to the courts to say: &ldquo;There is another reason why the proceedings can be stayed or not&rdquo;, rather than the only reason which the Minister is willing to allow which is that the arbitration agreement is null and void, is inoperative or incapable of being performed.  By definition that would mean that there was no need for the court to adjudicate at all&mdash;if it is null and void, it is null and void and the court has no function.</P>
    <P>The Minister is perhaps unconsciously misleading himself because there is no way that it is reasonable to pretend that there is not a significant and detrimental impact on the power of the courts in this section.  It is just not true, and if the Minister looks at it again I think he will find that is so.  I am very concerned about public access to information, to the arbitration proceedings.  I do not know and have not been told from where the demand has come from for this section. So often in this House we respond because somebody is looking for something.  If there are people looking for this section it is only those who have a vested interest in ensuring that the manner of subjugating people to an agreement is taken out of the limelight to a backroom somewhere.  Arbitration is good and helpful but I say, for the sake of the public interest give the courts the freedom to operate which traditionally they have had under section 12 of the Arbitration Act and which I think the Constitution gives them and the public would grant them if asked, rather than insert this restrictive clause.  If the Minister analyses it he will find merit and weight in what I have said.  The proposed amendment is simply to <Col N="86" /> broaden those reasons and achieve, hopefully, the advantages to which I am drawing attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the situation has not changed in that there was a somewhat similar provision in the 1923 Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses to which effect was given in section 12 (2) of the 1954 Act.  This is being replaced by section 5 of this Bill.  Section 12 (2), now section 5, gives a further extension of cover to the two Conventions. I see the court's position as not really altered at all but we are allowing for a situation where arbitration can effectively operate in a certain specified way. Deputy Keating has suggested that parties to arbitration agreements may be at a disadvantage, that the arbitration may be used as a delaying tactic and so on. There is no question of any party to arbitration being put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other party.  Under our laws arbitrators must act fairly and impartially and the High Court has full power to ensure that they do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual arbitration clauses provide that each party will nominate an arbitrator of his choice and that these two arbitrators will appoint a third.  If an arbitrator misconducts during the proceedings or does not conduct the proceedings properly he can be removed by the Court and the Court can set aside the award.  Where there is or is likely to be a lack of impartiality on the part of an arbitrator the Court can revoke the authority of an arbitrator.  Where the dispute concerns any question of fraud by any party the Court can set aside the arbitration agreement.  Any party to an arbitration hearing if dissatisfied with the decision of the arbitrator can have a case stated on any question of law for decision by the High Court.  The High Court has power to ensure that the arbitration proceedings are not used as a delaying tactic.  If one party attempts to delay matters by refusing to appoint an arbitrator or by failure to agree with the appointment, the Court can make the appointment.  If arbitrators do not proceed with due dispatch they can be removed by the Court.  If the Court finds <Col N="87" /> there is no real dispute between the parties in relation to the matter to be referred to arbitration and the arbitration agreement is brought forward purely as a delaying tactic, the Court will refuse to stay the proceedings under section 5.  On that basis, I totally reject Deputy Keating's points that arbitration takes place in a smoke-filled room and that it is removed from proper coverage by press and the media, because the powers of the Court leave a remedy open, a very clear and specific remedy, in almost every area relating to arbitration, if either party is dissatisfied with the operation of arbitration.  That is a very significant power.  Even after arbitration, if any of the parties are dissatisfied they can come back again to the Court.  All the Court is providing for is that arbitration should operate in a certain situation but if it does not operate properly and fairly and meet the situation appropriately there are still remedies and mechanisms whereby the Court can take certain action and the ultimate remedy can be found by either party in the courts.</P>

      <P>One could perhaps deduce that some extra provision had been built in here.  The reality is that part of the process of justice being seen to be done is being removed from the forum of the courts and if in the end things go wrong the court can be invoked.  Would the Minister accept that even with the fairly public scrutiny of court procedure at present, it is difficult enough on occasions to concur in the view that justice is always done or seen to be done even in the public courts?  I do not know if the Minister would agree with that but it is my strong view.  One sees extraordinary occurrences in the courts.  How can we assume that the interests of justice being done or being seen to be done are going <Col N="88" /> to be served by removing one tier of it out of that forum into a situation where the courts are not given the power they had?  They are given a restricted power to adjudicate only on the nullity or the degree to which the agreement is void.  I say this kindly but if the Minister were in good faith in this, I do not see why he would not include this enabling facility for the court to say; &ldquo;There is another reason, apart from it being void and inoperative, which makes us think that we should proceed in this way.&rdquo;  We are now rewriting that clause.  That is very important. I do not believe there is any way round that.  The Minister referred to section 12 (2) of the 1954 Act, but subsection (1) is quite specific and is being replaced by section 5 in terms of the impact this Bill will have.</P>
      <P>If the arbitration clause is misused a person can stop or delay an impact detrimentally in the interests of justice being served because it is more difficult for people in a backwater to have the same kind of focus on their rights if they are weaker, than it would be in a public court.  We all know it is not very easy there either.  For example, people are waiting for judgments for years.  Even the courts, with the best will in the world presumably, have difficulty now and again.</P>
      <P>How will we adjudicate what the criteria are in the arbitration room, hall or convention?  For example, will there be public access to the arbitration proceedings?  Are members of the press entitled to be there?  Are members of the public entitled to be present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could be sure about this we probably would not have to have the amendment.  Whichever way one looks at this the reality is that part of the very important concept of justice being seen to be done by our courts in accordance <Col N="89" /> with the Constitution is now being put into a backwater.  People who are inarticulate, relatively impoverished or in some way unable to compete will find that their rights will not be helped here.  I have no doubt that this section is not connected with their rights.  I do not know why it is there.  I do not know it there has been a demand for it.  I am suspicious of it.  People with good intent devised this section, but in my view they are misguided.</P>
      <P>The courts have built up precedents, clauses which were used in the earlier Act and which will now presumably be bypassed.  I suggest that the amending section will benefit the strong against the weak.  The weak people will be unable to contest a proposed agreement which has an arbitration clause.  For example, how can a young couple buying a house tell a builder they want a different contract? They will not get the house.  That is the way this operates in real life.</P>
      <P>The Minister said on 6 May 1980, at column 813, Volume 320, of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Of course any party to arbitration proceedings here is entitled to require the arbitrator to state a case on a question of law for the decision of the High Court.</P>
      <P>It would be improper to suggest that they have a right to be consulted on issues outside that very strict definition of a case on a question of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those and other reasons which I tried to outline I feel this section is profoundly wrong and will be shown to be wrong.  We are cutting the ground from under the courts in some respects. We cannot have an arbitration procedure which operates openly and above board while at the same time giving the courts the same rights they traditionally enjoy to ensure that for any reason they see fit they can comment one way or the other on those proceedings.  We are not doing that. Their right to comment in section 5 is restricted to the question of null, void and inoperative or on appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  That cannot be <Col N="90" /> construed as being other than severely disadvantageous to the rights of the citizen, particularly those who are not in a position to purchase the best legal brains and to provide the best backing for their case.  We have an obligation to these people and to others.</P>
    <P>The builders and contractors are an obvious example where the buyer is effectively forced to enter into a contract with an arbitration provision in order to get the house.  Disputes as to defects, for example, must be settled under arbitration. No one is going to tell me that the might, of the building and construction industry can be pitted equally in an off stage room against a young couple trying to start life.  It does not work like that.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured us that justice will not be circumvented and that the courts will not be undermined in that regard, but who is to assess the degree to which the arbitration has been fair and just?  The safer avenue is to allow the courts to adjudicate.  All I want is to retain the power the courts have under the 1954 Act and under certain clauses of the Constitution, not to give them more power.  The Minister might consider that.  Public policy dictates that justice should be seen to be done.  That should be a potent element of a justice policy in the community.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a young couple buying a house.  If there was an arbitration case brought by such a couple, I have no doubt that its impact would be strengthened if the case was heard publicly rather than privately in this type of arbitration procedure.  The question of justice being seen to be done has always been a tenet of justice in this community. It will not be seen to be done to the same effect if this clause is not amended as I suggest.</P>
    <P>I agree arbitration has its merit.  There is the question of relative speed perhaps, but the Minister casually said I can be assured there would not be any grounds for prevarication.  I do not see anything to assure me of that.  Arbitration hearings could be speedier, more informal, there could be less animosity or division <Col N="91" /> and less general harm arising from these arbitration proceedings&mdash;and that is the idea behind it&mdash;but that may not be so.  It must be remembered that we are talking about a situation where there is a clear dispute, where the parties are already somewhat antagonistic to each other's interests.  Accordingly it is very important that we should not try to rewrite their interests, particularly with reference to their powers to go before the courts.  I want to know why we should reduce the power of the courts.  I believe we should be trying to widen their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>These are the grounds on which I would like the section to be amended, and I want the Minister to say if these traditional safeguards of public access&mdash;scrutiny by the press, openness in every sense of the word, including publication of minutes&mdash;are referred to. I have no doubt that the kind of arbitration procedure envisaged by him is not the type that will welcome what would be interpreted as being an intrusion.  In those circumstances the closed door analogy, whatever about the smoke-filled room, is relevant and accurate. Therefore we must take a stand on this.  I cannot accept&mdash;and no reasonable reading of the sections would accept&mdash;but that there is a significant departure from the power of the courts in this regard.  Chequered as they are in some aspects of the way they perform their duties at present, the reality is that the courts do a great deal of good.  If I have any regret it is that they have to do some of the work that we should be doing.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution is constantly being re-written by the manner in which the courts have had to adjudicate on major issues because we, the politicians, had not the courage and the wisdom to act before being forced to do so by the courts.  Let us not diminish the power of the courts.  Let us at least let them retain the power they have.  That is why I plead with the Minister to accept this amendment which extends the possibility for the court to act to accord to the section of the 1954 Act which, when it was being <Col N="92" /> introduced, presumably was seen as a wise move in itself.  That we need a protocol after all which this Arbitration Act of 1954 reflects is a matter outside our control in the same way as the New York Convention and the Washington Convention are outside our control.  What we are in control of and what we should be quite certain about controlling is the type of legislation on our Statute Book.  I have no doubt that if the public were widely aware of the effect of, whatever about the thinking behind the section, they would not be at all happy about it.  I have no doubt that a test case will arise about it and I hope on that occasion we will not have some unfortunate person having to go to the European Court of Human Rights to obtain his rights.  I have grave qualms about the constitutionality of this section as well.  I would be grateful if the Minister would consider these points with particular reference to the openness of the arbitration proceedings and if he would be quite specific about why he will not grant this modest extension which I seek for the courts to act with reference to the reasons why they can act and which are circumscribed in section 5 of the Arbitration Bill, 1980.</P>

      <P>The whole point of the Arbitration Act, 1954 was to ensure that arbitration is conducted in an impartial and fair manner and the practice of the Court is to ensure that and to stay proceedings.  In other words, the Court accepts that people who have agreed to arbitration should be held to their agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arbitration has been an established feature of our law and, as in all other developed countries for a very long time, a method of resolving disputes.  Our law in relation to arbitration is contained in the 1954 Act and I am not aware of any <Col N="93" /> suggestion that the Act is repugnant to the Constitution.  The important point is that arbitration does not exist as an independent system but is at all times subject to the control of the High Court. Rules for the proper conduct of arbitration hearings are laid down in the 1954 Act and it is the function of the High Court to ensure that these rules are complied with.  Under the Act the High Court has extensive powers to regulate the activities of arbitrators to ensure fairness and justice.  The Deputy mentioned a young couple having no option to accept the arbitration clause in a building agreement.  In fact the practice of the court has been to stay proceedings in all cases up to now and, as I said earlier, the court's powers in this regard are enormous and there can be no situation where the arbitration system can misuse or abuse its power without the Court having a very direct input.  If there is any evidence of fraud or misuse or any delaying tactics by any of the individual parties by way of not agreeing to a particular arbitrator, or by not appointing an arbitrator, there is a remedy to be found in the Court and the Court has, under the 1954 Act, held that power. There is no minimisation or reduction of that power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  But where parties are consenting or agreeing to arbitration it is an established and acknowledged practice that they should be allowed to <Col N="94" /> proceed and if there is any misuse of the system then the Court has enormous powers in that regard and the supervision and control of the arbitration system is very much in the hands of the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is clear.  It is not exactly black and white but it is in black and green here.  The reality is that the Minister is now saying that the proceedings can only be interfered with if the court is satisfied that the arbitration <Col N="96" /> proceeding is null and void, inoperative and incapable of being performed and so on.  Up to now the range of power was wider.  It could say for a particular reason not related to these points that it was going to stay the proceedings, to expedite the proceedings, or whatever the expression is.  That power is now limited and nobody can pretend otherwise.  That is the kernel of this Bill, the restriction on the right of the court to adjudicate on the widest parameter of concern and evidence as it sees in its wisdom as being relevant to the interests of the public in this regard.</P>
      <P>That is the kernel of it and I believe, and the Minister has in fact indicated to me, that there is reason for concern in that regard, that there is evidence to show that up to now the court could stay proceedings and it did not have to refer to a short list.  The courts are going to have to refer to a list now and I have no doubt when they do that that there are those whose interests would be served by the amendment I am proposing who will no longer be so served.  That is what this section is about and this is the primary cause and nub of concern of our party with regard to this Bill.  It has a detrimental impact on the courts.  I do not think there is any way we can accept that.  We could argue about it all evening but I believe that is the case.  I think the Minister has corroborated that.</P>

      <P>This is a small point.  Being a former English teacher one gets concerned about propositions and things like that. Perhaps the lawyers have very good reason for this form of usage.  In line 42, subsection (2) the words occur &ldquo;treated as binding for all purposes on the persons as between whom&rdquo;.  Is the second &ldquo;as&rdquo; necessary?  Unless there is some great reason for its use, the amendment proposes its deletion.  &ldquo;Between whom&rdquo; seems a more normal use of the language than &ldquo;as between whom&rdquo;.

Section 55 of that Act is identical with section 7 of this Bill except that section 55 relates to the effect of awards under the 1927 Convention, whereas section 7 of the Bill is concerned with the New York Convention, and it is desirable that the text of both provisions should be identical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, Part III, subsection (3), line 49 after &ldquo;award&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or if the competent authority is satisfied that there is other sufficient reason for the non-enforcement of the award&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to have added after the word &ldquo;award&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or if the competent authority is satisfied that there is other sufficient reason for the non-enforcement of the award&rdquo;.  I think that there has been a mistake in the stencilling of the amendment, that &ldquo;line 49&rdquo; should read &ldquo;line 40&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It would then read: &ldquo;it would become public policy to enforce the award, or if the compenent authority is satisfied that there is other sufficient reason for the non-enforcement of the award&rdquo;.  This comes at the end of the list of reasons why enforcement of the award might be refused.  The point is to allow the widest possible discretion to people who are competent authorities in this regard to adjudicate on the reasons why the enforcement of an award might be refused.  We might strengthen it if we said they were other reasons apart from those listed from (a) to (f) and subsection (3).  The amendment I am proposing would mean that such a reason could be considered.  It would not materially affect the spirit of the convention.  There could be a reason which could come up which we have not allowed for and this clause would allow for it without having to bring it back to the House again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to give effect to Articles V and VI of the New York Convention.  Article V sets out the grounds by reference to which enforcement of an award can be refused.  If we are to ratify the convention we can neither add to nor subtract from these grounds in our implementing <Col N="101" /> legislation.  The grounds for refusal of enforcement in the section are comprehensive and are designed to protect the interests of each party.  One of the grounds for refusal is public policy.  It is a matter for the Courts to determine the extent of public policy in this area and to refuse enforcement if it would offend against our ideas of justice.</P>
      <P>Every country that becomes a party to this Convention accepts an obligation to ensure that Convention awards will be enforced in its territory unless those grounds for refusal, which are the same for all countries, apply.  Thus we are assured that Irish arbitration awards will be enforced under the conditions in all the other contracting states and that the Courts in those countries would be confined to the same grounds of refusal as are contained in section 9.  This amendment should be opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point the Minister made is not relevant.  On Second Stage the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should undertake to enforce only awards arising in a country which, in its turn, will enforce Irish awards.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the reciprocal nature of the scheme is accepted but that does not mean that we do not have a particular domestic response on occasion.  There may be reasons why some other issue could come up which we are not allowing for, for example, something which could be particularly Irish or domestic. It is a dangerous precedent to spell out reasons for refusing.  As soon as the ink is dry an issue could come up on which everyone would agree there should be action but unfortunately the Act would not allow for it.  Skilled legal people will ensure that that argument is pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of these may be carefully scrutinised by highly trained legal people whose job it is to look after the interests of one party.  I feel it is limiting and that we should broaden it.  If it is broadened in such a way that we are dealing with a country which does not accept enforcement of an Irish arbitration award, it does not arise.  There could be good and <Col N="102" /> valid reasons, other than those set out in section 9, why awards could not be enforced. Why limit the jurisdiction of the courts which are concerned with justice? We may have examples of contractual legal arguments over the years, individual issues and precedents being set, which we are now keeping off court, because they do not come under this jurisdiction.  That is regrettable.  This section could be availed of by unscrupulous people with economic weight and power to grind their adversary into subjugation.</P>
    <P>It would do nothing but strengthen the Bill if we added &ldquo;or if the competent authority is satisfied that there are other sufficient reasons for non-enforcement of the award&rdquo;.  Presumably the competent authority would be the court.  It would be unfortunate to be wise with hindsight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality of the situation is that unless we accept the conditions for non-enforcement which are laid down by the convention we cannot ratify it and we cannot minimise, reduce, alter or change it in any way.  It is a question of accepting, as has been done in other countries that have ratified it, the grounds as stated.  There is no record of a foreign arbitration award ever coming before our courts for enforcement.  Accordingly, there is no case law on this subject to which section 9 would have any relevance.  Foreign arbitration awards have rarely, if ever, come before the United Kingdom courts for enforcement and there is little or no English case law on the subject either.  There is some Irish case law on other aspects of arbitration to which section 9 is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts, and I do, that there are circumstances like this where, by the acceptance of such a convention we, wittingly or otherwise, accept significant changes on the jurisdiction of the courts.  Perhaps we have to do that to be in accord with the convention but it is something we should guard against.  We should be able to accept most of the convention without having to accept the very language of it.  We are ultimately the arbiters of our own <Col N="103" /> destiny in that regard.  These are international documents whose structure is often fabricated with a total different value system and set of economic, social and other priorities.</P>
      <P>We should not blandly accept the full implications of it if there is an argument or a case to be made that it impinges on the jurisdiction of the courts.  Such a case can be validly made in this regard.  The Minister feels he cannot accept the amendment because we have to buy all or nothing of the convention and that is regrettable.  Those who signed the agreement in 1957 might not have been fully aware that we would not have power to change even a comma, cross a &ldquo;t&rdquo; or dot an &ldquo;i&rdquo; on the reasons for refusal of enforcing the award.  We should have more sovereignty than that.</P>

      <P>Section 14 states:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may discharge any obligations of the Government arising under Article 17 of the Washington Convention...</P>
      <P>We are talking about financial dischargements in that regard.  The Minister referred to this in his opening speech. What exactly does that mean?  What financial implication is there?  How much will it cost us and where will the money come from?  Is it part of the budget of the Minister for Finance or what is involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section refers to obligations of the Government arising under Article 17 of the Washington Convention which obliges the contracting States to meet any deficit of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes established under that convention.  Is there a ceiling on the deficits of the Inter-national <Col N="104" /> Centre or are we giving a blank cheque?  I am not necessarily opposed to the idea of an unlimited amount.  The principle of arbitration is good and we should not be carping or grudging in our co-operation here but, if possible, I should like the Minister to tell us what we are talking about in terms of costs. Further, I should like the Minister to tell us how our assessment is made.  Is it done per head of population?  What are the criteria for deciding our contribution?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <P>This section deals with expenses.  It covers two types of payment but we will deal with the matter referred to by the Deputy, namely, possible payment under Article 17 of the Convention which provides that where expenditure of the International Centre established under the Convention exceeds its receipts the excess shall be borne by the contracting states.  Since the centre came into existence in October 1966, its expenditure has been covered entirely by the value of services and facilities made available by the World Bank free of charge and by income from the sale of publications.  So far it has not been necessary to call on contracting states to meet excess expenditure under Article 17.  I presume that should such a demand arise it would be out of public moneys voted in the usual way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 18 and 19, to delete &ldquo;and may provide that the decision of the Minister on any such question shall be final&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have looked again at section 5 particularly with reference to the question of whether under subsection (2) regulations could make the Minister the final arbiter of the saver in subsection (4) and also I have looked again at the right of appeal in subsection (2).  In regard to the first question, that is, the question of the Minister being the final arbiter of the saver in subsection (5), I wish to make it clear that this is not the case.  I am advised legally that the provisions of subsection (4) place an absolute bar on the Minister from exercising his power in making a scheme of regulations under the Bill in such a manner as would contravene the saver in the subsection.  The <Col N="107" /> position is that in the exercise of his power to make a scheme of regulations the Minister would be required legally to act in accordance with the saver.  In making a scheme of regulations the Minister would accordingly be debarred by virtue of subsection (4) from providing for superannuation conditions which were less favourable in the case of relevant persons than their existing superannuation conditions, save on the exercise of an option on their part for such conditions.  If, consequently, a question should arise as to whether the new conditions were less favourable than the existing conditions, the matter would be open to the judgment of the courts.</P>
    <P>Independent of the provisions of subsection (2), I am advised further that the only questions in respect of which the Minister could provide for an appellate function under subsection (2) would be questions arising from within the context of the scheme or regulations made under the Bill.  The question of whether the provisions were less favourable than the superannuation conditions set out elsewhere would not be appropriate to certain appeal.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposed right under subsection (2), the appeals position under existing law is that, while there is not specific provision for recourse to the courts, neither is there a provision that a decision given on appeal by the Minister shall be final.  Therefore, subsection (2) as drafted goes beyond the present law by providing that a decision given by the Minister determining a question arising under or by virtue of the making of a scheme or of regulations shall be final. The amendment by deleting this provision in effect continues the existing position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I raised a number of points on this section on the last occasion because I was unhappy about the powers which I thought the Minister was taking in subsection (4) and, particularly, in subsection (5).  I considered that so far as subsection (4) was concerned, the <Col N="108" /> Minister had an argument because that subsection provides that the Minister shall not exercise the power to impose a scheme that is less favourable than an existing scheme.  I conceded that the Minister had an argument in saying that the subsection imposed a statutory obligation on him not to impose a less favourable scheme on employees.  I am glad to have the assurance of the Minister that subsection (4) has been reconsidered by his advisers and that he has been assured by them that his original interpretation as given to the House on Committee Stage is correct.</P>
      <P>I am happy enough now that that interpretation is correct and I accept the Minister's assurance.</P>
      <P>However, I said on the last occasion that there should be no doubt about subsection (2) to which I objected because it appeared to me that the Minister was taking on himself the appellate jurisdiction which would enable him to decide on appeal points arising out of regulations made by him.  I said that in my opinion there could not be any argument about that.  It is interesting now to hear from the Minister of State that on checking up on the position he finds that section 5 probably goes further than the existing law.  I know that these two amendments exclude from subsection (2) the very words which I regarded as particularly objectionable.  These were the words to the effect that the regulations might provide that the decision of the Minister on any such question as I have been talking about should be final.  Also, being removed is the provision that the decision pursuant to the scheme shall be final.  I regard these amendments as being some improvement on the section as drafted and I am obliged to the Minister for having reconsidered the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We have had quite a lengthy discussion on this Bill, particularly on Committee Stage.  It is only right that a Bill of this nature be fully debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is a Bill enabling the Minister for the Environment to initiate superannuation schemes and provide for the payment of gratuities to employees of certain bodies, largely those of local authorities.  I think health boards are also being brought under its provisions, and other bodies acting as agents for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill to regularise the position in regard to these superannuation schemes and the payment of gratuities and pensions is long overdue.  I want to put on record in the strongest possible terms that I object to the procedure adopted on this Bill, that is, that of validating schemes drawn-up and pensions and gratuities that have been paid irregularly, without the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas, as far back as 12 years ago.  That is a dangerous procedure; it is that of ruling by Departmental circular because the schemes about which I am talking and the pensions and gratuities paid have been done by virtue of official Departmental circular.  In this type of democracy schemes should be initiated and payments made only by the authority of this House and not in anticipation of it.  Exact examples do not come to mind at present but there is more and more of a drift or tendency to govern by official circular in anticipation of legislation being passed by this House. When I made that point before the Minister said time and again that <Col N="110" /> everybody was delighted with the pensions paid under the schemes drawn up. I concede that; of course they were, but what I object to is that these schemes were all drawn up without this House being consulted, without the people who get their authority from the electorate and who are authorised to decide these things being consulted.</P>
    <P>All of that could be avoided by a short, enabling Bill, lasting for 12 months or two years, giving the Minister fairly blanket authority for a limited period with an obligation to report back to this House.  I cannot see any difficulty about that.  I do not think any reasonable Opposition would object to that.  Indeed any Opposition, whether it be Fine Gael and Labour or a Fianna Fáil Opposition, would be guilty of a dereliction of duty if they sat here year after year allowing local authorities and other bodies to act without any authority, thereby encouraging Department of the Environment auditors, who are the watchdogs of the public purse and, as I understand it, the agents of the Comptroller and Auditor General, to turn a blind eye on these irregular transactions in anticipation of legislation which may come some time, or may never come, on the authority of an official circular from the Department of the Environment.  Instead of this practice developing and there being more of this sort of Administration of public affairs, I hope we have seen the end of it.  As long as I am in this House, if I become aware of local authorities or Departments of State operating irregularly in anticipation of authority forthcoming at some date in the future, I will go on record as objecting to it.</P>

      <P>One big question is the <Col N="113" /> question of the outside bodies on the county committees of agriculture.  This is creating a little curiosity on how exactly it is going to be worked out.</P>
      <P>A question was raised on Second Stage, to which we have had quite a few answers pointing in different directions. Outside members to 40 per cent are being preserved for the rural organisations. Certain qualifications are laid down under the Act.  I should like to know how exactly this issue is going to be worked out.  We have, as the Minister knows, in our county, as in every county in Ireland, numerous organisations representing agriculture.  In Wexford alone, we have the IFA, the Young Farmers' Clubs, the ICA, the BBA, Muintir na Tíre, Wexford Liquid Milk Producers, the Co-Operative Marts, Waterford Co-operative.  We also have the Dublin Liquid Milk Producers.  I do not envy any Minister who has the responsibility of trying to sort out, in the event of a dispute, what organisations should get seats on the county committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Approximately six seats will be available in Wexford for the outside bodies&mdash;I am taking this as an example. We have at the same time approximately nine or ten different organisations representing all the different sectional interests of agriculture within that county. The Bill clearly specifies the qualifications of each person to be determined by the Minister.  I should like to know what criteria the Minister will use when determining the qualifications of each person.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in the event of a dispute between the different organisations in each county, how will the Minister operate this system whereby he will select certain organisations to be represented on the committee of agriculture?  This is something which has not been clarified up to now.</P>

      <P>The Chair wishes to come in at this stage. The Chair allowed the Deputy to raise the question and will allow it to be answered.  I would point out that this matter was debated in full on the principal <Col N="114" /> day.  It does not really arise.  If the Chair wants to be completely strict, it does not arise on this Bill; it was a matter for the Principal Act.  However, it has been raised and I shall allow the Minister of State to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the situation on one point.  The Minister has no say whatever in what members any rural organisation nominate, or the calibre of person to be nominated by them.  The responsibility of the Minister will be to consider all representations made.  All CAOs have been notified and asked for a list of rural organisations in each county&mdash;active rural organisations, I mean, not ones that mushroom overnight.  The Deputy will understand that organisations that have become active just now because there might be a possibility of getting representation on a committee of agriculture will not be considered.  The Deputy will appreciate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have also been received from various rural bodies. These will all have to be looked at and considered on merit.  That is basically how it will be determined.  I want to say that it will be determined on a county to county basis, not blanketwise for the whole country.  As the Deputy will appreciate, some counties have the ICMSA and others do not, some have small farmers' organisations and others have not. I am sure the Irish Countrywomen's Association are more active in some counties than in others.  All those things will have to be taken into consideration when a final decision is arrived at.  I want to stress again, as I did on the last occasion when we discussed this Bill, that the Minister will not have any say whatsoever in relation to the people who will be nominated by those organisations, as to who he considers should get representation in any one county.</P>

      <P>I understand that the new committee may be set up in the next couple of months.  Do I take it that the date of the annual general meeting of each county committee of agriculture will be changed in accordance with a time factor in relation to the new committee?  Up to this our annual general meeting was always held immediately after the county council elections and we just carried on from one year to the next.  It will take some time to bring this Bill through the Seanad and to have it enacted so there may be a delay of at least another month.

If the county committees wish to hold their annual general meetings I am sure they are as well aware as I am that this Bill will become law within the next couple of weeks.  I hoped to have this Bill passed a few weeks ago, which would have allowed us time to go through the rural organisations, have all the necessary documentation made out and notification sent to county councils to fall in line with the annual general meeting or within the 14 days the Deputy is talking about.  If this Bill does not become law within the period of time the Deputy is talking about it will be up to the county committees of agriculture to hold their meetings or not to hold them.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this on the Second Reading of the Bill and Deputy Enright raised certain points on the definition of the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo;.  I indicated to him that we would probably bring in some amendments.  We each had the same view, that was that the packer, the worker on the floor, was not going to be the person who would be held responsible one way or another.  Amendment No. 1a reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 3, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;directs and authorises&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would alter the definition of the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo;, which is &ldquo;the person who in the course of business placed in the container included in the package the goods so included&rdquo;.  This definition is important because the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the duties to be discharged by a packer in regard to the quantity of the contents of the package, the equipment to be used by him in the making up or checking of packages, the records he must keep and the way in which a package must be marked. Heavy penalties are provided for failure to perform these duties.  It is intended <Col N="120" /> that the duties should lie in the person or firm responsible for the packaging process rather than in an individual employee of a packaging firm who performed the action of filling goods into a container.</P>
    <P>The intention of the proposed amendment to insert &ldquo;directs and authorises&rdquo; after &ldquo;person who&rdquo; would seem to clarify this concept.  The amendment must be considered in connection with amendment No. 1b which proposes a further alteration arising from this amendment in the definition of &ldquo;packer&rdquo;. If amendments Nos. 1a and 1b were to be accepted the definition of packer would read, &ldquo; `packer' means, in relation to a package, the person who directs and authorises in the course of business and has placed in the container included in the package the goods so included&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the proposal to insert &ldquo;and has&rdquo; before &ldquo;placed&rdquo; is difficult to understand.  At first glance it would seem to reinforce the idea of physically placing the goods in the container and consequently it would nullify the effects of the insertion of &ldquo;directs and authorises&rdquo; as proposed in amendment No. 1a.  However, it may be that it is intended to mean &ldquo;has caused to be placed&rdquo;.  If so, it would exclude the owner of a very small packaging plant who both directed and performed the operation. The two amendments Nos. 1a and 1b, therefore, are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. a1b is being proposed in the hope that it will eliminate the difficulties seen by the Deputy in the original definition.  The amendment reads:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 4, to delete &ldquo;business&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;carrying on a business placed or caused to be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the definition of &ldquo;packer&rdquo; to ensure that the duties to be discharged by a packer shall lie in the person or firm responsible for the packing process rather than in an individual employee of the packaging firm who performs the action of filling the goods into a container. <Col N="121" /> If this amendment is accepted the definition of &ldquo;packer&rdquo; will read, &ldquo;the person who in the course of carrying on a business placed or caused to be placed in the container included in the package the goods so included&rdquo;.  This is a reasonable amendment which clarifies the position, and when the Bill is enacted it will indemnify completely the workman on the floor against being held responsible one way or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather strange that the Minister has to come in and amend the definition in this fashion.  It would seem that initially enough thought had not been given to the definition of the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; in this case.  This Minister is interpreting the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; as a person on the factory floor, a servant of the owner, an employee who is carrying out the physical function of packing or causing to be packed through some automatic provision such as a machine or so forth.  In the broader sense &ldquo;packer&rdquo; would mean a person engaged in the business of packing in a carton, tin or whatever receptacle the goods are being packed into.  The Minister's amendment would seem to be tautologous in many respects if you accept that the broader sense of the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; would be this more acceptable sense in the case of this Bill.  I do not see that the interpretation of the word taken by the Minister, which is the person on the factory floor, the employee or the servant of the company carrying out the physical job of packing would be the normal interpretation and the Minister's amendment would seem unnecessary.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Enright would be much clearer:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 3, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;directs and authorises&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way in which the employer, or the packer as I see it, the person carrying out the business of packing as a business, could not be held responsible if Deputy Enright's amendment, &ldquo;directs and authorises&rdquo; is inserted after &ldquo;who&rdquo;.  That puts it beyond yea or nay. <Col N="122" /> With all due respect to the Minister and the draftsmen I think it makes a much more concise effort at defining beyond any doubt the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; than the Minister's amendment.  There is nothing in conflict between amendments 1b and 1a, as the Minister has stated.  If you read the amended definition &ldquo;packer&rdquo; means, in relation to a package, the person who directs and authorises in the course of business and has placed in the container included in the package the goods so included; I see nothing conflicting in having the two amendments made.  In fact it is a much tidier effort at defining the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; beyond any doubt provided you accept that packer is the person in the business of packing, not his servants or employees on the workshop or factory floor.  In the light of what I have said, I am putting forward Deputy Enright's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite unusual for a Minister of any Department to bring in amendments of many kinds to his own Bills.  When Deputy Enright and I discussed this matter on Second Stage we agreed that the employee should be protected at all costs and that there should be no doubt about it.  The amendment we are introducing places responsibility fairly and squarely on the person carrying on the business.  That means definitely that it is the person who is carrying on the business, the proprietor. In Deputy Enright's amendment it states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;packer&rdquo; means, in relation to a package, the person who directs and authorises....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You could direct and authorise and still not be the person carrying on the business.  You could be an employee at some level directing and authorising somebody to proceed with something while you would still not be the person carrying on a business.  We do not want to have any doubt about this once the Bill is passed, if anything goes wrong.  If the weights and measures people are involved they will want to know who is carrying on the business and want to go to the person who is carrying on the <Col N="123" /> business and is held responsible.  That would be the law and if there was a court case they would want to see that it is the person carrying on the business who would be held responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not complaining about the Minister having put down an amendment.  I welcome the fact that, after discussion, he has sought to clarify the position.  That is a welcome effort on his part to ensure clarification of a definition that might be misinterpreted.  I do not agree with the Minister's idea that the amendment from this side of the House&mdash;&ldquo;directs and authorises&rdquo;&mdash; could relate to a person other than the person who has ultimate responsibility for the packaging plant.  I appreciate that there are intermediate people who have authority to direct employees but ultimately responsibility for any breach of this Bill when it becomes an Act must rest with the person who owns the premises or carries on the business.  The intermediary, the person down the line of authority, will himself be an employee, so by no stretch of imagination could he be held responsible.  This Bill purports to make the &ldquo;packer&rdquo; in the broader sense responsible.  It is the owner of the packing plant who is responsible and not a foreman or assistant in the normal running of the plant.  The Minister must admit that in no way could he be held responsible because he himself would be an employee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1c:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), lines 38 and 39, to delete paragraph (e).</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what is the reason for the provision for payment of fees to the Minister?  The inspectors who will be carrying out the inspections will be employees of the Department.  I am talking about section 3 (2) (e), providing for the payment to the Minister of prescribed fees as regards such inspection, testing and certification, even before there is any hint or suspicion of a breach.</P>
      <P>It is bad enough to have to pay in the form of a fine if a person is found in breach of any section but having to pay for the privilege of being inspected, I suggest, is going a little too far.  Could the Minister say why this subsection is included?  Is it normal practice in such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite normal in regard to weights and measures.  I think the Deputy was discussing paragraph (e) which the amendment proposes to delete.  That paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>provide for the payment to the Minister of prescribed fees as regards such inspection, testing and certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the paragraph is to enable the Minister to prescribe fees for the inspection, testing and certification of equipment used in making up or checking packages.  Most of the equipment which will be so used will already have been certified and stamped under the Weights and Measures Act and it is not proposed to charge a further fee for testing this Bill.  Under the power conferred by paragraph (h) of section 3 (2), however, it is proposed to make regulations permitting certain types of equipment to be used in making up and/or checking packages without verification and stamping.  In such cases it is considered equitable that a fee similar to <Col N="125" /> that which would be chargeable under the Weights and Measures Acts for verification and stamping should be charged for inspection and verification under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The level of fees to be set has not yet been decided.  It will be in accordance with section 3 (1), which requires the consent of the Minister for Finance, where it will be comparable with the levels set out in the Weights and Measures (Verification and Stamping Fees) Order, 1978.  It will not impose any undue burden on packers as they are already accustomed to the payment of verification and stamping fees.  This is all tied up with what is happening under the weights and measures legislation. Therefore the amendment is not acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said&mdash;that such fees are chargeable at the moment by inspectors for services rendered in the checking of a varying number of items for which we already have regulations.  One of the problems with consumer legislation is that unless such legislation is approached very carefully it will add to the price of goods being sold, thereby defeating to some degree the objective it sets itself, which is the protection of consumers. There is little point in providing regulations if they add to the cost of the goods.  On the one hand we are providing the consumer with a certain degree of protection, while at the same time we are asking him to pay for it.  If this kind of approach were applied across the board by any Government, anything could be implemented as long as the great unwashed pay for it.  Therefore, the benefits accruing to the public at large by the implementation of such charges are cut and become less attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it has been the tradition that under regulations people are charged a fee for inspections of this type. I appreciate that, but that is no reason why the Minister, who is breaking new ground in introducing this Bill, should not break new ground in this area of inspection and provide it free of charge. <Col N="126" /> We are talking about people who are in the employment of the public service.  I do not know what kind of revenue would accrue to the State from charges of this type, but overall I would say it would be minimal.  It would be a great gesture to the consumers who appreciate what the Minister was doing if he allowed such inspections to take place without a charge, thereby obviating the necessity for the producers and packers to increase their charges to cover themselves, because ultimately, whatever expense is involved by the packer or producer, that cost will be passed to the person at the end of the queue&mdash;the consumer.</P>
    <P>That is one of the traps into which consumer legislation falls too easily and regularly.  This trap has been fallen into now.  The Minister has broken new ground in introducing this Bill as a result of EEC directives; I ask him to go further and provide this service free of charge, to show his goodwill to the consumers, the producers and the packers. Because of competition the person paying this fee must stand the loss.  This amendment ought to be looked at very seriously in the light of what I said and, hopefully, it might be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the inspection system, testing, certificate of equipment, and so on.  He said extra money was being charged and that the consumer would have to pay.  This Bill allows packers to pack to average using much more sophisticated, bigger, newer machines which are very time saving. Thus the packers are not at a loss even though they have to pay for the inspection. We all know that for any Bill to be effective there must be an inspectorate, people who will carry out inspections and see that the rules and regulations are adhered to and that the goods are in order. There is nothing unreasonable in this legislation, because once we have an inspectorate somebody has to pay, either the packer or the consumer and, as a rule, the consumer means the taxpayer. Under the new system the packers will save money.  As I said, this Bill is being introduced because of EEC directives to <Col N="127" /> allow for high-powered packing systems using newer and more sophisticated machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument does not hold water.  He mentioned the sophisticated methods of packaging which will mean faster operations, but we are talking about competition.  If I, as a packer, avail of sophisticated methods and the Minister, as my competitor, avails of the same method, we are both fishing in the same pool and competing with one another.  Therefore, competition will level off any advantage that might accrue from new-fangled up-to-date packaging ideas.  That argument does not hold up because if everybody avails of new technology in packaging, the benefit that might accrue to one person using that is gone because of competition; if his neighbour is going to avail of the same thing there is no benefit to anybody, because they are all starting from scratch.  My point is that if, at the end of the day, they are going to be charged for inspection and certification and so on, that fee will be passed on to the consumer at the end of the line, thereby increasing the cost of the commodity. That is the main argument which Deputy Enright made in proposing the amendment.  The Minister's argument does not stand up to any deep scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is going to pay the inspectorate?  Will it be the taxpayer who may not be availing of some of the goods packed by these firms at all?  My claim is that, with the new methods which this Bill now allows, the packers will be much better off.  If the inspectorate are not paid at that level the taxpayer will have to pay since we both accept that there must be an inspectorate to make the Bill effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there <Col N="128" /> must be an inspectorate.  Of course the taxpayer has to pay the inspectorate who are already employees of the State. The point I make is that while revenue is accruing to the State as a result of charges by the inspectorate it may very well not end up accruing to the consumer. There is no direct link between moneys coming in under such heads to the revenue side and the disposal of same.  When that money is being dispensed again there is no guarantee that it will go to the people who are charged extra as a result of the inspection charge simply because it is impossible to direct money like that directly into the channels it came from originally.  The Minister knows that.  So, while the overall responsibility for payment of the inspectorate rests with the taxpayer because they are public employees, that same taxpayer is being asked to come up again and pay extra as a result of the charge imposed.  I doubt very much if the revenue accruing to the State from such charges will go to benefit the consumer in the long run.  It may indirectly in some very far out, peripheral way, but as a direct input into assistance for the consumer it may or may not and the latter is more likely than the former.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is quite important.  This matter is new as far as I am aware.  I would like the Minister to explain the full position.  It is unfair to ask companies to be responsible for the payment of fees imposed by the inspectorate. I would like to qualify that to some extent.  This is a new Bill.  While there have been occasions where fees have been demanded I feel that it is unfair on this occasion.  As far as I am aware the person carrying out inspections under this Bill is the person in charge of weights and measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the weights and measures inspectors called around and carried out inspections and, to my knowledge, they never charged fees.  That is why I say this is an innovation in regard to weights and measures.  Perhaps the Minister would explain whether weights and measures inspectors did in fact charge fees in the past.  I did not think they did <Col N="129" /> and therefore it seems unusual that they should be asked to do so now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, most of the equipment which will be used will already have been verified and stamped under the Weights and Measures Act and it is not proposed to charge a further fee for testing it under this Act.  The level of fees to be set has not been decided yet but it will be comparable to the levels set out in the Weights and Measures Verification and Stamping Fees Order, 1978 and will not impose any undue burden on packers as they are already accustomed to the payment of verification and stamping fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One example is bottling plants.  While I accept that there must be an inspectorate we are really discussing a system of payment, whether the packer or the taxpayer pays.  The Deputy accepts that there must be an inspectorate to see that the law is fulfilled and that must be done to help the consumer by seeing that goods measure up to quantity. The next question is who is going to pay that inspectorate?  It is wrong at this time to ask the taxpayer to bear the cost in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be the net position when this goes through.  The Minister says it should not <Col N="130" /> be paid by the taxpayer but when it all boils down that cost may be increased down along the line and the consumer will end up paying it.  I would ask the Minister if there is sufficient staff at the moment to do this job.  As far as I am aware the people in weights and measures used to make regular checks in regard to licensed premises, in regard to the quality of drink being sold.  This was standard practice, and a good and wise practice.  As far as I am aware, in certain instances a weights and measures inspector has not called for 12 years.  This used to be done on a regular basis.  Under this Bill the weights and measures inspectors will be asked to do additional work and the Minister will charge a fee for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law there will be an inspectorate.  That is quite clear.  I will not mention numbers. Consumers want to be safeguarded.  It is as simple as that.  It is then a case of who pays for the inspectorate.  We said in the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill that it will help the home packers to compete with foreign packers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have proposed that this section be deleted.  I want the Minister to consider this point carefully.  The packer is asked to pay the prescribed fee for inspection, testing and certification.  I understand the Minister is setting up an inspectorate to carry out this work.  If the Minister charges for this work, the consumer will have to bear the cost.  We will reach a stage where the consumer will be asked to pay whatever small cost may be incurred, and eventually the cost will be expanded.  The result will be that the consumer will be asked to pay far more for the items than would otherwise be the case.  That is not what the Minister desires.  Therefore, it is incumbent on him to ensure that this section is deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has seen examples where costs of this nature have been levied on companies.  They do not suffer a loss. They transfer the cost to the consumer. Therefore, the item purchased will cost far more than would be the case if the <Col N="131" /> costs were met by the Central Exchequer. I know the Minister is flexible.  He is trying to present arguments against the amendment.  If he examines my argument carefully he will see the logic of what I am saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It all boils down to who pays.  As I said before, there is no fairy godmother.  Somebody has to pay.  The cost will not be very significant.  I guarantee that the cost of the inspectorate for a whole year will not be significant. It would be much more equitable for the producer to bear the cost than to spread it out over the taxpayers in general.  Does Deputy Enright want the taxpayers to meet the cost?  That is what the amendment really says.  The system we propose is more equitable.  The packer should pay.  The consumer and the packer will have protection.  The packer will be more competitive.  The advantage will be with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the cost will not be significant.  Perhaps he could supply figures.  I do not want to pin him down on this, but I should like him to tell me what type of figure he has in mind.  Are we talking about £100,000, or £250,000, or £500,000?  Could we know the cost of administering the scheme and employing the staff?  How many staff will be employed?  Are we talking about 100 people employed in the administration of the scheme, or ten, or fewer?  Will it be necessary to set up a separate Government Department or a special section in a Government Department to administer the scheme?  I hope the Minister will look into this matter and come back and provide me with some information on the actual figures he has in mind.  Does the Minister envisage a separate inspectorate with a secretariat?  If so, I should be obliged if he would let us know&mdash;if he would elaborate on that point when we resume the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to amend section 33 (2), of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, to provide that where a member of a planning authority has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in the zoning, acquisition or disposal of land by the authority the member of the authority shall attend the meeting of the authority and shall disclose the nature of his or her interest and shall then withdraw from the meeting for so long as the matter is being discussed or considered, and further calls on the Minister for the Environment to introduce amending legislation to ensure that any member of a planning authority who wishes to make any proposal relating to the zoning of any lands which are the subject of periodic review under draft development plans shall be obliged to give 14 days notice of motion in relation to any such proposed changes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the motion is to seek to extend the current statutory obligation on local authority members to declare their interests during their deliberations, on draft development plans in particular. We have tabled the motion because it has become evident to us, and I am quite sure to a number of Members on all sides of the House, that when a member of a local authority or a group of members acting together may determine, or may be determined to effect undesirable changes in draft development plans, they may in certain circumstances succeed in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our motion is designed to close a loophole in the procedure of local authority deliberations.  This House will recall that in 1974-75 one of the most important and effective Acts in the history of local government in Ireland was piloted through the Oireachtas by <Col N="133" /> Deputy Tully, then Minister for Local Government.  The importance of that Act, since enacted in 1976, has been underestimated consistently.</P>
    <P>The motion is quite specific in its import, and in moving it I want to assure the House, and the Minister of State particularly, that I do not in any way wish to cast aspersions on the vast majority of the 1,500 elected local authority members who throughout the country, in one way or another, determine the development plans for their areas.  It has been my personal experience in 25 years as a political activist, before I went into public life, as a trade union official, and since 1974 as a member of one of the largest local authorities in the country, that the overwhelming majority of local authority members give dedicated service to their local communities and in doing so display, in my personal experience, the highest degree of personal integrity.</P>
    <P>In a debate of this nature which could be controversial&mdash;I have no desire that it should&mdash;it is necessary at the outset to dispel some of the public misapprehensions and misconceptions which can surround the zoning or re-zoning of land.  It is not a criminal act for local authority members to re-zone land from agricultural to residential use.  There have been numerous instances when the pressures of economic and social development, demands for new roads, for public and private housing, for amenity areas, for new institutional structures within local authorities, clearly have warranted changes of zoning during development plan discussions. I would even say there have been occasions when after adoption of such plans it has happened that there has been clear need, after due notice, for statutory contravention of such plans after the adoption of the plans.  Sometimes these decisions may become extremely controversial. They can be very unpopular, but we as members of local authorities are elected by the people to take these decisions in the common good.  It is our function to ensure the proper planning and development of our own areas, and in <Col N="134" /> doing this we may have to take decisions to re-zone land even subsequent to the adoption of development plans.</P>
    <P>This motion is not so much concerned with that situation as with circumstances where a member or members of a local authority have a clear direct, or indeed as under the Act they may have, an indirect pecuniary or beneficial interest in the zoning or re-zoning of land or property within the local authority area they represent, and our motion is concerned with the democratic procedures that should be followed in the letter and the spirit of the law.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to outline the provisions of the 1974 Act.  The provision regarding declaration of interest is well known.  We know that all members of local authorities must register their interest in land holdings and property companies and in certain shareholdings following their election to a local authority.  In the event of a matter concerning such an interest of a member coming before a local authority meeting, he or she is obliged to declare his or her interest provided that he or she is present at such a meeting.  The member concerned, as we know under the Act, must leave the council meeting while the matter is under discussion and decision. There is no statutory obligation on any member to be actually present or to declare his or her interest at the meeting. Furthermore, there is no statutory obligation on the member to notify the chairman of the meeting in advance of his or her interest and there is no obligation in certain circumstances to table a motion of intention on the part of other members of a local authority in advance of the meeting.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that there is not, at this stage of our legislative development, any statutory obligations on members of local authorities in relation to their discussions on draft development plans to give advance notice of motions where they intend to propose such at local authority meetings. I hope all local authorities, including the one of which I am a member, Dublin County Council, will amend their <Col N="135" /> standing orders in that regard so that there will be an obligation to give advance notice, where such impending changes are intended, on the part of any member.</P>
    <P>During the debate in 1974-75 on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill there was an extensive contribution from the present Taoiseach. I consider his views to be of fundamental importance because they set the tone.  At that time they set the tone of a number of attitudes adopted by some back benchers on this issue and they may well be of importance today.  During the past week I read the Dáil debates on that Bill and it is not an unfair summing up to say that, at the time, the Bill was enacted despite some of the most obstructive delaying tactics by some members of Fianna Fáil's front bench particularly on the sections we are due to discuss tonight, namely, the question of declaration of interest.  My admiration for the tenacity and integrity of the former Minister, Deputy Tully, in the course of those debates increased on re-reading them because he was subjected to extremes of obstruction and abuse.  As one reads the debates in the calmness of one's home and tries to see what was in people's minds at the time this is quite evident.</P>
    <P>I referred to the views of the present Taoiseach in such matters.  At column 149 of the Official Report of 14 January 1975 he said during the Committee Stage of the Bill:</P>
    <P>Mark you, I am not a great believer in the value of planning at all.  I have very serious doubts about whether in totality planning is a good thing or a bad thing.  That is something that could be very validly argued.</P>
    <P>At column 164 he said:</P>
    <P>Briefly, I shall refer back now to what I said about planning in general. I am still not convinced that planning is on the whole worthwhile and beneficial to the community, judging by the way in which it has worked out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> When I read the debates those statements left me speechless and people from Cork are usually anything but speechless.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of declaration of interest Deputy Tully, the then Minister, said on 27 November 1974 at column 419:</P>
    <P>... the reason they are asked to make the declarations which they will be asked to make when this is finished is because of the allegations which are being made fairly widely, rightly or wrongly, that members of local authorities can and have rezoned areas so that the land within those areas would be of greater value and that they or their friends were able to enrich themselves as a result.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully, who usually deals with things in a trenchant form, said on 25 June 1975 at column 1819:</P>
    <P>The reason I introduced this amendment at the time it was introduced is because in the national newspapers and magazines allegations were made against elected representatives. I defended the elected representatives in this House but no action was taken by anybody against the newspapers involved.  Allegations were made week after week about land deals.  I, in this House and outside, defended the elected representatives and said I was not prepared to accept that, but they were published and republished.  There is only one way to stop that kind of thing and that is by putting it into the Bill so that everybody will know that there is no involvement.</P>
    <P>It is of importance to stress that the original enactments of 1974-75, by the Coalition Government, were introduced in the face of protracted opposition from Fianna Fáil.  It is necessary to give the background to the proposals we are suggesting for consideration to the Minister tonight.  We hope there will be a consensus within the House on this matter by and large.</P>
    <P>In 1975, Deputy Molloy, the then Fianna Fáil front bench spokesman on <Col N="137" /> local government, the immediately former Minister, said on 25 June at column 1806:</P>
    <P>We objected to the amendments as drafted by the Minister because they are aimed solely at one section of the community, a section who have given their service free to the community as members of local authorities.  The section as worded by the Minister is derogatory and disrespectful to them and casts a suspicion on any person who is a member of a local authority dealing with planning matters.  We object to the Minister's attempt to single out, for this special restriction, only those members of our community who serve as elected members on our local authorities.  These people have had a great slight cast upon their character, their integrity and their honesty, by the Minister in the terms of his amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy went on to state the following:</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, the number of changes that have been made by members of local authorities in the zoning of development plans has been very minor.  The number of local authorities who have made any basic change in a development plan that went before the public over the past four to five years is very slight. Their primary function was in the adoption and in deciding the wording and the scope of the original development plan.  After that their involvement is very slight.</P>
    <P>The views of the Deputy on that fundamental issue were of great interest and five years afterwards the occasion of that debate comes vividly to mind. Recently when I was going through the debates what surprised me more than anything else were the influential interventions that came from no less a person than the present Taoiseach.  In the light of the quotations I shall mention now, I ask if it is any wonder that recent events occurred in one local authority in particular? I should like to quote from columns 1825, 1826, 1827, 1828, 1829 <Col N="138" /> and 1830 of the Official Report of 25 June 1975 when the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, made the following observations:</P>
    <P>I support very strongly the objection to legislating separately and solely for elected members of local authorities, as is being done in these amendments.  Indeed I would nearly go so far as to say that the last section of the community on whom these constraints and obligations should be placed are the elected members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I feel perfectly free to speak frankly and openly on this question because I am not a member of a local authority and, hopefully, never will be. Therefore, I feel I can speak on this question without having any vested interest of any sort whatsoever.  I wish to underline the importance of the fact that we expect elected members of local authorities to give their services voluntarily and gratuitously to the community.  Also, in this regard we should be concerned with procuring the highest possible calibre and quality of elected representatives on local authorities.  We should be very reluctant indeed to enact anything by way of legislation which would inhibit anybody from going forward for election to these local authorities.  I have a very strong doubt about the wisdom of these proposals <i>ab initio.</i>  I have a particularly strong objection to the Minister bringing in these amendments to deal with one section of the community in this way, in this very restricted area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach at column 1827 of the Official Report of the same date said:</P>
    <P>It is coincidental only that this Bill happened to be before the Dáil and the Minister availed of that opportunity to insert these particular proposals concerning local authorities.  They are the last people in this country who should be singled out in this way, suspicion cast upon them, because no matter what protestations of goodwill towards local authority <Col N="139" /> members the Minister makes, there is no doubt that these proposals do point the finger of suspicion at members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>At column 1828 of the Official Report he stated:</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to visualise the type of individual who would have an interest in public affairs, who would wish to offer himself for election but who, because of his business interests, could not consider, not for any secret or illegitimate reasons but for genuine business reasons, disclosing in a public register all his business and property interests not because he would wish to do anything furtive or secret in the confines of the local authority to promote his own self-interests but simply because it would disclose information to business rivals which competitors and he could not face up to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey was not a front bench spokesman on Local Government but he took an enormous interest in the passage of this Bill.  He stated:</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any situation in this country which has developed to a stage where we should depart from the old, well-established procedures that if you are a member of a local authority or indeed any body, a member of a private organisation, a member of the board of directors of a company, where the old principle applies, if something affects your own interests you must disclose that before you participate in the discussion or vote on a proposal.  If you are not honourable enough to do that I think that the normal democratic processes of public opinion, ultimately expressed through the ballot box, will take care of this situation.</P>
    <P>He continued at column 1829 as follows:</P>
    <P>After all if there is somebody who is devious and who seeks to manipulate the local authority in his own self-interest&mdash;I think that it is a very difficult thing to do because of the way <Col N="140" /> local authorities are constituted and with the balance that is maintained between the managerial system and elected representatives&mdash;then I think he will succeed in doing this, no matter what legislation the Minister passes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that ruling. I consider the quotations of extraordinary interest.  I should like to conclude with a short quotation from a speech by Deputy Molloy.  He was totally jaundiced about the effectiveness of the proposed provision.  In his speech he said:</P>
      <P>His amendment only precludes a person from voting as a member of a local authority where the matter for decision is one in which he has some beneficial interest.  There is no obligation on him to abstain from voting if, in the Minister's words, &ldquo;his friends&rdquo;&mdash;I put that in inverted commas&mdash; want something done and he is prepared to vote for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I use these quotations because it is self evident that a member of a local authority may assert strenuously that since his interests are already a matter of public record there should not be any obligation on him to attend such meetings or to notify the chairman in advance of his interests.  Therefore, it is possible for a member under existing legislation, either wittingly or otherwise, to appear to perpetrate a deception.  That is why our motion seeks to impress on the Minister the need for a change in the law.  This is the fundamental purpose of <Col N="141" /> this proposal.  The point is that there is not any obligation on a member to attend a meeting and that if one is not present at a meeting there is not any declaration required there and then.  One could have a situation in which some other councillor would move a seemingly innocuous resolution or he might move an entirely controversial resolution without giving any advance notice particularly where a development plan was being discussed.  The net outcome of such a situation could be one of dramatic pecuniary benefit literally overnight to the member concerned.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that in the light of recent events the Government have not acted yet to close off that possibility.  One would have thought that firm action would have been taken by now in this regard.  I would draw a very clear precedent here which I think would be of some help to the Government.  This is because the Taoiseach, as Deputy Haughey, was the person who brought in a particular change in relation to the members of An Bord Pleanála.  I would submit that what is sauce for the Bord Pleanála goose should be sauce also for the Bord Pleanála gander.  In 1974 Deputy Haughey moved an amendment to section 9 of the Bill going through the House.  This amendment was to add after the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo; the words &ldquo;when so interested shall inform the Chairman of the Board in writing accordingly&rdquo;.  In support of his amendment he went on to say that we were concerned with the situation of persons who would be members of the new board.  Deputy Haughey said he wished to make it clear that he was discussing only the activities and the disclosure of certain matters by members who would be appointed to the new board.  He then went on to read section 9 which provided that no member should vote or act otherwise as a member of the board in relation to any matter in respect of which the person had a material, financial, or other beneficial interest.  The Deputy then suggested and I quote:</P>
    <P>What we are all after in the Bill is to try to bring the maximum amount of objectivity and impartiality to the <Col N="142" /> deciding of planning matters, and in this respect it is important that there be the maximum amount not just of disclosure but a record of disclosure. As it stands, the section could become quite ineffective as time goes on.  It simply provides that a member shall not act or vote as a member of the board in relation to any matter in regard to which he had a financial or beneficial interest.</P>
    <P>Then the Deputy moved the amendment and it was accepted by the then Minister, Deputy Tully.  It represented a major change in relation to the activities of members of An Bord Pleanála. Therefore, the precedent is set for a member notifying the chairman in relation to any matter in which that member had an interest.  In view of the significant contribution made to the legislation at that time by the Taoiseach, that experience should now be extended to members of local authorities.  At that time in 1974 Deputy Haughey was very unhappy with the situation of the members. Both he and Deputy Molloy were obsessed about who were to be the members of the board in question.  They posed the question of whether these members were to be a shower of Coalition hacks, for instance, and the then Deputy Haughey was determined to copperfasten the provision of a declaration of interest.  Therefore, having regard to the record of the House the Taoiseach would hardly object now to an extension of what was provided for in his amendment in 1974 to members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Our submission this evening is that in a situation where a member of a local authority might be tempted to take advantage of that privileged position, it is of the utmost importance that the law relating to that position should be amended decisively.  I am saying this in the light of my experience on local authorities.  It has been the experience not only of myself but of my family before me, who served also on local authorities, that 99.9 per cent of members conduct their business in public and with absolute integrity, going into committee <Col N="143" /> where that was necessary but increasingly that is becoming less necessary.  These members take decisions that are both popular and unpopular. They are men who serve well the local communities that they represent as well as serving the political parties to which they belong if they are so affiliated.</P>
    <P>In that context it is of profound regret to me that I should have to raise this matter in the House in the manner in which I have been constrained in regard to raising it.  Therefore, I wish to put my view very clearly.  Members of local authorities are easy targets for all types of pressure groups, for developers and for investigative media persons as well as for any individual who wishes to object to anything at any point.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a local authority with very considerable personal experience in local government, an experience which I regard as being deceptively effective.  The Minister has far more experience than he would admit to at times.  Between ourselves this evening, as mature parliamentarians, it is my view that we could reach a consensus on this motion, taking a sharp look at the legislation with a view to its amendment if it is found to be wanting.  I do not presume to be a parliamentary draftsman.  Our motion is fairly general. It would necessarily have to be examined by the parliamentary draftsman, by the staff of the Department of the Environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to deal with the <Col N="144" /> terms of this motion.  The amendment of the law which the motion seeks is in two parts.  The first relates to the attendance at some meeting of the planning authority.  The motion does not say what meeting.  Perhaps I should say that the meeting in question is one to decide on zoning, acquisition or disposal of land in which the member has a beneficial interest. If this interpretation is correct the proposal would require the member to withdraw from that particular meeting. But it is strangely silent as to what happens if a decision is not reached and the matter has to be considered further at a subsequent meeting.</P>
      <P>Another matter requiring clarification is the reference to zoning in both parts of the motion.  I cannot recall any use of this term in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.  In an Irish planning context it is commonly used in relation to land use zoning but equally it could refer to density zoning. Perhaps it means both.</P>
      <P>The second part of the motion refers to any proposal relating to the zoning of lands.  That could cover a proposal not to have any zoning of the lands in question. I am more than doubtful that the first part of the motion would cover such a proposal.  Yet a decision not to zone is potentially beneficial to the relevant landowner since it implies no zoning restriction.  Of course it can be suggested that these are drafting points only, of no great consequence.  Given the background and experience of the two Deputies sponsoring the motion I am not so sure and I have to assume that the motion means what it says.  Consequently, I am concerned at the restrictive effect which the proposed amendment of section 33 (2) would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are numerous ways in which the provisions of a development plan may affect the value of interests in land&mdash;the establishment of a public right of way, the route of a new road, the widening of an existing road on one side rather than the other, the preservation of land for particular purposes, such as open space or refuse tip, are a few examples. Accordingly section 33 (2) is drawn <Col N="145" /> in the widest terms and the performance by the planning authority of every function under the Planning Act is covered. Perhaps I should mention in particular resolutions under section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, directing the manager to deal with particular applications for permission for development in a specified way.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate my concern that this situation should not be altered. The motion before the House calls for the amendment of section 33(2) in specific terms.  It does not ask for an addition to it and I cannot read it that way because of the inconsistency of what is proposed in regard to attendance.  It seems to me that the amendment sought can only be interpreted as a substitution of the provisions indicated for those existing at present.  This would seriously reduce the value of the section because it would reduce considerably the scope of its application.  I am not unwilling to consider any amendment of planning legislation which would help to make effective or to improve procedures where such appear necessary or desirable.  The legislation is extremely complex and, while the 1976 Act effected considerable improvements, I doubt if it will be the last word on this matter.  I would be prepared to examine any reasonable suggestions but I do not think that hastily concocted proposals fall into that category.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed in the motion would make mandatory the attendance of elected members of planning authorities at certain meetings.  Assume for the moment that the type of meeting in question is one at which a matter relating to zoning, acquisition or disposal of land by an authority may arise, there must be a great many such meetings.  How is a member to know in advance that such a matter will arise and that it will be a matter in which he has a pecuniary or other interest?</P>
    <P>A draft development plan has many interlinked provisions.  Normally it is prepared by officials and is then considered by the council.  Their members are not there to rubber stamp what is <Col N="146" /> placed before them; they are the elected representatives of the people and it is their right to make changes before formally adopting any draft plan.  Because the interlinking and alteration may require consequential changes a provision requiring 14 days notice of every change would lengthen an already protracted procedure.  What the motion proposes is that such notice be given only in respect of proposals relating to the zoning of lands which are the subject of periodic review under draft development plans.  It says nothing of other matters and nothing about the development plan itself, which is the instrument for zoning land.  How, then, is a member to know when it is necessary for him to attend any particular meeting?  Assuming the difficulty can be overcome, the question arises as to how to deal with the situation where a member is ill or out of the country.  Is he to be prosecuted in such circumstances and disqualified from membership of the authority?  The number and variety of valid reasons why a member would not, or could not, attend any particular meeting would make it difficult to legislate for exceptions and the enforcement of such a provision in the courts would seem fraught with difficulties.</P>
    <P>I want to review briefly the existing relevant legislative provisions.  The provisions included in the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1976, in relation to the declaration of interest by members and officials of the planning authorities and members of and employees of An Bord Pleanála are wide-ranging and stringent and include serious penalties on conviction for noncompliance. The provisions were the subject of lengthy debate and were amended in the progress of the legislation through the Dáil.  These provisions require every member of the planning authority to make a written declaration of a certain interest which would be relevant to the functions under the Planning Acts and to keep the declaration up to date.  The requirement applies to interest in land situated in the area of the authority, any business, or dealings in, or developing land in which the person is <Col N="147" /> engaged or employed, and any such business carried on by a Company or other body of which he or his nominee is a member, any profession, business or occupation in which the member is engaged and which relates to the dealing in or development of land.  That is a very wide field dealing with a member's interest. That applies to most draftsmen, architects, auctioneers, estate agents and anyone who may be involved in leasing, or have any interest in land development.</P>
    <P>The declarations are required to be recorded in a register which is available at the offices of the planning authority for public inspection during office hours. The entries remain in the register for five years after the member has ceased to be subject to the provisions of the Act.  In addition to the making of a declaration, a member of a planning authority is precluded from seeking to influence the planning authority in relation to any matter in which he has an interest. Where a planning authority or a committee of the authority is to discuss a matter relating to its functions under the planning Acts, or in relation to the acquisition or disposal of any land, any member of the authority or committee present at the meeting who has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in the matter must declare his interest, withdrew from the meeting and take no part in the discussions or voting on the matter.</P>
    <P>These provisions of the 1976 Planning Act are extremely stringent in regard to the obligations put on elected public representatives to disclose in a register open to the public their personal and business interest.  Not alone are they obliged to give this information and to keep it up to date, but if they fail to do so they are liable to prosecution and, on conviction, to a fine or imprisonment or both, and to disqualification from being a member of a local authority.  That goes a long way.  These are serious penalties to impose on a public representative who gives freely, and without remuneration, his time and energies to the service of his fellow citizens.  Deputy Desmond is an <Col N="148" /> active member of the Dublin County Council and is aware of the demands put on him by such membership.</P>
    <P>The making of a draft development plan is a reserved function.  It is a matter solely for the elected members to decide what its provisions should be.  They would be wise to take expert advice and ensure that no variation is made in an existing plan without due consideration. They might also order their business so as to ensure that, having considered the various matters in detail, they would still be free to review any decision when they come to adopt the draft plan as a whole. They can, if necessary, alter their standing orders, but it is their job to devise a plan which will ensure the proper planning and development of their area.  They do not need the consent of the Minister or anyone else to their draft proposals.  The elected members must know that at the end of the day what they produce is merely a draft and that they will be judged on what it contains.</P>
    <P>The making of the draft must be publicised by notices in the press and the draft must be placed on public display for a period of at least three months.  A copy must also be sent to each of the prescribed authorities.  These include An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Bord Fáilte Éireann, An Taisce and The National Monuments Advisory Council.  They also include the Minister for the Environment and various other Ministers and local authorities.  Each of these authorities and every member of the public are free to make objections or representations to the planning authority.  All of these must be considered before the development plan is adopted.  It is not unusual for a considerable number of submissions to be received.  Changes can be made at that stage.  Section 37 of the 1976 Act makes specific statutory provisions in this matter.</P>
    <P>When the development plan is finally adopted copies must be sent to the prescribed authorities.  At that stage the Minister may require the development plan to be varied in respect of matters <Col N="149" /> and in a manner specified by him.  The fact that no Minister has found it necessary to invoke this power since the 1963 Act came into operation suggests that the elected members of the planning authority have acted responsibly in discharging their plan-making functions. All local authorities, and all members that I know on these authorities, have carried out their duties in a very competent way.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the statutory provisions and procedures which I have outlined provide substantial safeguards. The press, the prescribed authorities and the public have access to the register of elected members' interests.  Members are prohibited from influencing, or seeking to influence, a decision on any matter in which they have a pecuniary or other beneficial interest.  Any question of a development decision can be brought to light and will be capable of remedy, if that is needed.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority, a county council, for many years but am not now a member.  I just want to make that clear.  In my county, when the draft plan came before my county council, I made a number of amendments to that plan.  These were not in regard to re-zoning but were technical amendments.  I served notice on the council and on the members of the council.  I spelled out, in a notice of motion, what I was going to do.  Every member received that.  They were of a very technical nature, such as road frontage, density and other technical matters.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the operation of the Planning act of 1963.  The 1976 Act introduced amendments which, as I have said, were improvements.  There is, however, only very limited experience of the operation of this Act, especially in relation to the provisions which we are discussing in this motion.</P>
    <P>A planning authority do not review a draft plan except at long intervals.  This has the effect that the procedures of the Act dealing with the declaration of interest have not had to stand the test of practical application to any extent.  The <Col N="150" /> 1976 Act provisions may well need amendment.  I have an open mind on this matter.  In the light of what has been said, I am prepared to look into the question. As I have already indicated, I see technical problems in the precise terms of the amendment proposed in the motion. This is not to say that I accept altogether that the 1976 Act is perfect and could not be improved.  I will look at the matter without any delay and if I find that a revision of the provisions referred to is justified I will bring forward draft proposals in due course.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This is one of the most important motions that has come before the House in Private Members' Time for a very considerable time.  I say that because it is a proposal which is intended obviously to tighten up the procedures to be adopted by local authorities, which are also planning authorities, in relation to meetings at which it is proposed to dispose of, to purchase or to re-zone land.  Without in any way casting any reflection, good, bad or indifferent on the Minister of State who came in here to represent the Minister for the Environment, it is regrettable, to say the least of it, that the senior Minister in this Department did not signify to the House the importance which he and the Government attach to this motion, and to the events which obviously led up to it, by coming into the House and personally dealing with this motion.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I want to join with Deputy Barry Desmond in saying that as far as I am concerned I do not intend that any reflection at all should be cast on the vast majority of local representatives who are representing their areas, and those who have gone who represented their areas since local government was introduced here.  They are a fine body of men who discharge their duties conscientiously. There is always the exception to the rule; there is the person who is prepared to play unfairly.  I want to make it clear that in no way am I making an attack on local representatives.  I hope they will long continue to serve their areas well.</P>
      <P>Accusations have been made against local representatives and against Members of the House from time to time, but never until 1976, when the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act was passed, were any steps taken to protect the general body of local representatives from the few who might be tempted to play the game unfairly.  In that Act two provisions were made.  It was enacted that on election a local representative who was elected to a local authority which was also a planning authority was obliged to make a declaration of his interests in land and so forth within the area to which he was elected. It was provided that that register would be kept by the local authority and would be brought up-to-date.  It was also provided in that Act that a person who had an interest, beneficial or pecuniary, in property that was being dealt with at a meeting of a local authority should withdraw from that meeting and should not take part in the proceedings until the matter concerned had been concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a big step forward which it was hoped would demonstrate that the game was played fairly by local representatives and that it should be seen <Col N="152" /> to be played fairly.  It was thought at that time that the proposals in the 1976 Act would be wide enough to cover all possible cases of abuse or apparent abuse. These resolutions, so far as they applied to local representatives, were, as Deputy Desmond said, violently resisted by Fianna Fáil.  The Bill was introduced in 1974 and was so obstructed that it did not become law for a couple of years.</P>
    <P>It often appears when an Act has been on the Statute Book for some time that there are loopholes and that it needs to be extensively amended.  This motion calls for a change in the law to provide that a member of a planning authority who has an interest in land which is to be dealt with in any way at a meeting of that authority, should attend that meeting and having informed the chairman of his interest he should then withdraw.  The motion also says that if any member of a local authority proposes to propose a resolution at a meeting of that authority relating to the zoning of any land which is the subject of periodic review, he should give at least 14 days' notice to the county secretary or assistant manager.  Applying my layman's commonsense to that motion, that is what it proposes so I was surprised to find the Minister of State spending half the time available to him dealing with technicalities, niceties and drafting points in this motion.  It is up to the Government to convert that motion into a statutory instrument and get it passed.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to pose the question&mdash;how does this motion come before us?  I do not intend to indulge in personalities or in making accusations, but this motion comes before us because of a meeting of Dublin County Council held not so long ago at which land was re-zoned with great ease and informality. As a result of that re-zoning the value of the land increased from £5,000 or £6,000 an acre to about £50,000 or £60,000 an acre.  Part of that land is the property of a member of the local authority.  That is what brought this resolution into Private Members' Time this evening.  The country in general was <Col N="153" /> shocked with the apparent informality and ease, amounting almost to secrecy, with which the initial step in re-zoning this land was taken in the teeth of the advice of the professional advisers of the authority.  If I did not say that there would be an air of unreality about this debate.</P>
    <P>Apparently Dublin County Council's by-laws do not require that a note should be sent to the members of the council informing them that it is proposed to consider rezoning of land.  It comes up, as far as I am aware, in an informal, haphazard way at a meeting without notice to members of the council.  The Minister shakes his head to suggest that that is not the position.  I hope it is not, but as I understand it, it is not necessary that an agenda with a notice that it is proposed at a specific meeting to consider the rezoning of land from agricultural use to development use be sent to members.  Unless that provision is in the by-laws of all county councils it is a public disgrace and the sooner it is changed the better.</P>
    <P>It was laid down in the Planning and Development Act, 1976 that a member of a council should declare his interest in lands by way of declaration, the declaration to be filed as long as he is a member of the council and that he should bring it up to date.  It was also laid down that the member could not vote or take part in any meeting dealing with property in which he had an interest.  It is obvious that that is not enough.  The resolution calls on the member concerned to attend the meeting, declare his interest and withdraw.  The Minister says that it might not be possible for the member to declare his interest.  I would be satisfied if there was an onus on somebody, be it the county secretary or the city manager as the case may be, to refer to the register and before the meeting inform the meeting that according to the register kept under section 32 of the Planning and Development Act, 1976 Councillor A has a beneficial interest in the land now being considered.</P>
    <P>There will always be an executive to do that and, I would be satisfied with <Col N="154" /> that, but it should not be just made by a declaration which it has been proved now that members of a council may not read and which was made four years before this land was to be considered. That is not sufficient.  Either the member involved who has the pecuniary interest should himself bring to the notice of the council that he has a beneficial interest in this land as the Labour Party have suggested or, as an alternative, the county secretary or the assistant county manager should do it.  That would satisfy me.  That is the first thing that must be done and it must be done immediately.</P>
    <P>Even worse, such information as I have would disclose that this initial step&mdash;and it was only an initial step because we know that notices must be published and objections invited, then it must go back to the council again&mdash;was serious.  The ease with which this initial step was taken by Dublin County Council to re-zone this land was nothing short of amazing.  The meeting was called without any notice to each of the 36 members of the county council that it was proposed to consider re-zoning 150 acres of land some place in the Lucan district.  That should have been done. From now on this House should take steps to see that the by-laws are changed so as to ensure that in future meetings will be convened properly and there will be a proper agenda sent out from which it will be perfectly clear to the most uninitiated councillor who can read that it is proposed to deal with the land in a way that may alter its value substantially.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that the Minister finished up by saying that he would look into this and make any changes that were necessary.  I am glad that he said it, but he said it in two or three sentences in the end.  Up to that he seemed to be a bit annoyed with the Labour Party and the Opposition for bringing this resolution before the House.  That is the impression I got.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> He should not be.  Let us not shadow-box all the time.  I have put <Col N="155" /> on the record of this House how we come to be discussing this resolution. The Fianna Fáil Party are having second thoughts about it and they have said now that they will rescind this resolution. That shows that they must be satisfied that the resolution should not have been passed in the first place, or at least not passed in the way it was.  I am glad to see that the Fine Gael members of Dublin County Council have put down a notice of motion for discussion at the county council which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>That special standing orders be immediately adopted for all future meetings of this council concerned with the draft Dublin County development plan and that the said orders provide that all motions proposing the re-zoning of land be lodged in the office of this council not later than 10 days prior to the meeting called to discuss the draft development plan as it relates to the area affected by such motion, and that any such motion be circulated to all members of this council to be received by them not later than four full days after the lodgment of the motion and no less than four full days prior to the relevant council meeting.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that that was elementary, my dear Watson.  I would not have thought that should have been necessary, but I am glad at this stage that that will be done.  Public men at whatever level, ministerial, Minister of State, parliamentary or local, undertake onerous and very thankless jobs.  Certainly they are not remunerated with gratitude for what they try to do, but it is essential that they should not be exposed to the sort of thing that this performance of Dublin County Council has exposed the entire local representatives of the country to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to talk simply for the sake of talking.  I conclude by saying that I am glad that this resolution was introduced. If the Labour Party had not introduced it, the Fine Gael Party would <Col N="156" /> have introduced it.  I join with the Labour Party in urging it on the Minister.  I am not concerned with how you do what but I am concerned with getting it done.  I am concerned with getting the position changed so that a business of this sort will never be transacted again in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister of State in relation to this motion.  He dealt adequately with the basis of the motion and I welcome his concluding remarks that he was prepared to look into this whole matter. It has serious implications for all members of local authorities.  A member of a local authority myself, I was keenly aware of the situation when the declaration of interest came up in 1976.  At that time I felt that it was so serious that I was in communication with the then Minister for Local Government&mdash;as the Department was known then&mdash;Deputy Tully.  Deputy Quinn, who is not here today, would be aware of the implications the Act had for people who were engaged professionally outside their own county councils.  That would entail auctioneers, architects, engineers, solicitors, barristers and such like.  When this section came up I felt it appropriate that clarification should be received and obtained from the Minister at the time because any person acting in a professional capacity and as a member of a county council would have to be very careful about how he or she dealt with any application that came before the council for the development, sale or purchase of land or, as we are dealing with the development plan, the question of the zoning of land in different towns throughout a county.  Many counties have planning committees who have no real power as such to instruct the manager to grant an application, but in the public mind the implication may be that they have this power.  Therefore, this motion, referring as it does to the situation of declaration of interests and the need for a member to attend a meeting, is important.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising this most important matter tonight, especially as I was deeply disappointed that I was denied the opportunity of ventilating this and many other issues in the debate for the Estimate for the Environment last Friday owing to the strange procedure and the absurd time limit employed on that occasion. I express the ardent hope that what happened then will never happen again because I think it posed a very serious threat to the rights of elected Members to speak on fundamental issues affecting the lives of their constituents on important Estimates.</P>
      <P>I am dealing tonight with a question which appeared on the Order Paper on Tuesday, 6 May 1980, addressed to the Minister for the Environment as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment if he will outline the programme for new house building submitted to his Department from each of the following local authorities: (i) Clonmel Borough Council, (ii) Carrick-on-Suir UDC, (iii) Tipperary UDC, (iv) Cashel UDC, (v) Waterford County Council,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" />&mdash;an area for which I expect to have some responsibility and one to which I look forward after the next general election&mdash;</P>
    <P>(vi) Tipperary S.R. County Council; the date of submission and the number of houses in respect of each scheme, the cost per scheme, when sanction will issue in each case and the reason for the delay in providing the necessary money.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
    <P>On 15 February 1980, all housing authorities were asked to furnish particulars of their capital requirements in 1980 for (a) housing schemes&mdash;not already included in existing commitments&mdash;which have been advertised for tender or which will be so advertised by 30 April 1980; (b) rural cottages&mdash;not already included in existing commitments&mdash;on which it is proposed to start work by 31 July 1980, and (c) demountable dwellings&mdash;not already included in existing commitments&mdash;for which it is proposed to give firm orders by 31 July 1980.</P>
    <P>In reply the authorities mentioned in the Deputy's question furnished the following details and their estimates of expenditure in 1980.</P>

    <P>The Minister's final statement is relevant:</P>
    <P>These applications are being considered in conjunction with similar applications received from other housing authorities and I will make my decision on them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The purpose of raising this matter tonight is to bring to the notice of the Minister the fact that these houses are urgently required and that the local authorities are anxiously awaiting sanction to embark upon their erection immediately. The early commencement of these schemes is vital to hundreds, if not thousands, of families who are at present living in appalling housing circumstances, in overcrowded and insanitary conditions, in dingy flats and hovels in an environment which is a threat to their health and happiness.  I am appealing to the Minister to ensure that the necessary moneys are made available without any further delay.  Surely he will not condemn these people to a further long purgatory of waiting.  To do so would be an act of utter irresponsibility and callousness.  The delay is unprecedented and can have tragic consequences.</P>
    <P>The homeless in my constituency are anxiously waiting for the Minister's answer tonight.  What is it going to be?  Is it yes or no?  We want to know when this money will be provided, how much is being provided and when.  There should be no ambiguity.  This is a matter of fundamental importance not merely to the homeless for whom I speak tonight but also to the building industry in my constituency. It affects the future of that industry and, in large measure, jobs.  If these schemes are abandoned, what is to become of the building industry and the workers who depend on that industry for their livelihood?  Such a move will dislocate the building industry.  Many smaller firms may not recover from this recession and serious unemployment will result.</P>
    <P>There are millions of pounds worth of work involved in these housing schemes and to withhold the money would be an act of social and economic irresponsibility and cause chaos in our local authorities.  The Minister will never be <Col N="161" /> forgiven if he embarks on this retrograde step of withholding the money this year.</P>
    <P>One of the great features of house building in my constituency was the expansion of the co-operative scheme. Many people housed under this scheme either resided in council houses or were on the local authority approved waiting list.  Having come together on a co-operative basis they were able to build their own homes.</P>
    <P>In south Tipperary co-operative groups have successful house building schemes in the following areas&mdash;Clonmel, Cahir, Fethard, Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir.  For all these schemes the local authority provided the sites on a 30-35 year repayment scheme.  This allowed the couples concerned the full use of the SDA loans and the Department grant to build houses.  In the last increase in the SDA and low rise mortgage loans the Minister in his circular made it quite clear that the maximum loan available in future by way of finance from local authorities, including the cost of the site, is £12,000.  This effectively will make home ownership for all incomes up to £5,500 impossible.</P>
    <P>This means in effect that if the council were to develop sites and dispose of them at say £4,000 repayable over 30 years, the maximum loan which could be advanced for the building of a house would be £8,000.  This will affect the council's programme of co-operative building at Ballingarrane and Fethard. The only way the applicant will be allocated his £12,000 loan for the erection of a house would be that he pay cash down for the site.  I do not believe the Minister realised the serious implications of precluding local authorities from making these special site loans available.</P>

      <P>The local authorities to which I have referred have very proud records of house building and have made great progress in recent years.  I am a member of the South Tipperary County Council and Clonmel Corporation which also have proud records in house building. Great achievements took place especially under the dynamic leadership of the then Minister, Deputy Tully.</P>
      <P>It will be a stunning blow to all local authority members, irrespective of their party politics, when they realise they will get no money this year for new house starts.  That is the only construction one can put on the Minister's attitude, especially his statement here last Friday.  I quote from the Minister's speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will paraphrase what he said.  He asked housing authorities to carry out a fresh assessment of housing needs in their areas to cover the period up to 31 March 1985.  He said he would analyse the assessments with a view to up-dating housing policy to meet the needs of the eighties.  I believe there is no need for an assessment of this kind.  The local authorities, the members, the managers, the officials and the homeless know their needs.  I believe this is a cover-up for bankruptcy on the part of the Department.  This is a gigantic stalling device which deceives no one.  This fresh assessment is a nonsense.  The Minister must be honest with the House, with the people and with me and say if these moneys are available.  There should be no ambiguity about this.  The thought of waiting until the end of the year for an allocation of money for housing schemes for 1980 is an absurdity which we cannot accept.</P>
      <P>This House will adjourn in June or early July and will not reconvene until October, as is usual.  Is it seriously suggested that the local authorities to whom I referred and for whom I speak tonight will get no allocation of money until this mock assessment is carried out?  What is to happen in the meantime? In the meantime our housing programme will grind to a halt.  We are witnessing the strangulation of our local authorities and we are, moreover, witnessing the virtual collapse of local government here.  I want the Minister to come clean and say precisely what allocation of money he is making available to the authorities and when that money is going to be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this.  The position is that my Department made an allocation available to local authorities on 14 March.  In regard to the other areas that Deputy Treacy has mentioned they must be taken in line with the needs of the whole country.</P>
      <P>I want to say some very interesting things.  For example, on 13 September 1979 Clonmel needed 58 houses which were completed on 31 December 1979. On 31 January 1980 it was estimated that eight houses were needed in Clonmel. We have got to get our facts right. My Department and I have a responsibility in regard to all local authority and private housing.  The record will show that we have taken positive steps to improve the lot of all the families here. Last year we completed 26,000 houses.  I am satisfied that this year local authorities will complete over 6,000 houses.  For the first quarter of this year new house grant applications are up by almost a quarter.  Deputy Treacy comes in and sheds crocodile tears in regard to housing.  At present our targets are spot on.  Let me be straight and honest with the House.  I have not got a pocket full of money without any bottom to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We spelled out at the beginning of the year that in various Departments there were certain allocations of money available.  There are lots of things we as a Government would like to do but financial restraint make this sometimes impossible.  Let us deal with the situation as I see it now in regard to all housing.  Let us take the improvements we have made in regard to all housing loans and other incentives to people building houses today.  It comes a long way from the Coalition days when the income limit was £2,300; that was paupers' wages and that was only less than three years ago.  People on the dole could not get a loan to build a house. The loan then was £4,500 and that would not build a decent hen house.  Let <Col N="165" /> us be fair about the situation.  We have brought it a long way since then.  I can assure Tipperary County Council, Waterford County Council and all the other county councils that they will be notified in due course of new allocations of money.</P>

The directive bans the use of tris in certain textile articles and the use of dangerous fluids in certain ornamental <Col N="44" /> lamps and ash trays.

As her means, as assessed, exceeded the statutory limit, her pension was terminated with effect from 11 January 1980.</P>
      <P>The widow has appealed against this decision and the case has been referred to an appeals officer who has been requested to issue his decision at an early date.</P>

      <P>Article 169 of the Treaty provides that the Commission may, if it considers that a member state has failed to fulfil a Treaty obligation, take the matter before the Court of Justice after the member state has had an opportunity to submit its observations and if the member state concerned fails to comply with a Commission reasoned opinion within the period laid down by the Commission.</P>
      <P>On the basis of a preliminary check, which is all that has been possible in the time available, it would appear that there has been no ruling of the Court of Justice that Ireland has failed to implement a directive.</P>
      <P>In regard to regulations, the position following a preliminary check is that in a judgment on 16 February 1978, in the case, The Commission of the European Communities <i>v.</i> Ireland, the Court of Justice held, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Irish fishery conservation measures were in breach of Regulation (EEC) No. 101/76.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Industrial Development Authority that the new pharmaceutical project for Kinsale which is being promoted by the US firm, Eli Lilley, is expected to commence operations later this year and is expected to provide employment for 600 people at full production.  A further US project, Diamond Aerosols Ltd., also plans to locate in Kinsale and will employ 60 people at full production.  The Authority have applied for planning permission for a 10,000 square feet factory for this project, and also for a 24,000 square feet factory for a project which is currently under negotiation.  The Authority also have a 13-acre site in the town which it is promoting for suitable projects.</P>
      <P>The IDA have recently completed construction of a 10,000 square feet advance factory in Bandon and has approved a grant for a small industry to locate there.</P>
      <P>In Clonakilty the IDA are promoting for suitable industry a 4-acre site which is owned by the urban council.</P>
      <P>The IDA have completed a 15,000 square feet cluster of five factory units in Dunmanway.  Three of the units have already been occupied by small industries and negotiations are proceeding with promoters interested in locating a project in the remaining two units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA are at an advanced stage of negotiation with an overseas company which is considering the location of a project at Skibbereen.  The Authority have applied for planning permission for the construction of a 27,000 square feet factory for this project, which will be in substitution for the 7,000 square feet advance <Col N="52" /> factory originally planned for the town.  The IDA have 17 acres remaining for industrial development in the town.</P>
    <P>The IDA are continuing their efforts to acquire an industrial site in Bantry and plans for the construction of a 12,000 square feet cluster of factory units will proceed as soon as a suitable site has been acquired.</P>
    <P>The IDA have approved grant assistance to a fish-processing project which will locate in a factory currently under construction at Dinish Island, Castletownbere.  It is expected that construction will be completed by the Autumn of this year and that the project will employ 140 people when it reaches full production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the upward revision of rents for local authority houses which is causing grave hardship to people on fixed incomes, and the steps he proposes to take to alleviate the position, with particular reference to County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that grave hardship is being caused to local authority tenants on fixed incomes in County Donegal or indeed in any other local authority area following the introduction of the revised national rents scheme for local authority houses.  Under the scheme, differential rent is assessed at a fraction, varying from one-twentieth to one-seventh of assessable income and I have made substantial increases in the amounts of assessable incomes to which the rent fractions apply in order to avoid hardship, particularly in the lower income groups, resulting from the assessment in full of all basic income.</P>
      <P>For example, the lowest fraction of income hitherto assessed for rent purposes was one-twelfth of incomes up to £19 a week.  Under the 1980 scheme. incomes of up to £36 a week will be assessed at only one-twentieth and the upper limit of one-seventh rent fraction will apply only where the assessable income exceeds £55, as against £39 a week in the 1979 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases in rent resulting from the revision of maximum rents of houses in the differential rent scheme are being limited to a maximum of £1.50 per week and this will only apply where the tenant's assessable income justifies such an increase.  While fixed rents are being increased by 30p a week, tenants of <Col N="59" /> houses on fixed rents may opt for differential renting where it is to their advantage to do so.</P>
    <P>I should stress that the scheme as revised is fair and equitable to all categories of tenants and is designed in such a way that increases in rent will apply only in cases in which income warrants such increases.</P>
    <P>I may add that in cases of genuine hardship, it is open to local authorities to accept from a tenant for a specified period a lesser sum for rent than that required under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The final date for the receipt of applications for new house grants under the old scheme was 30 December 1977. This date is prescribed by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, which was debated and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and I have no power to extend it.  The final date was extended twice in 1977, on both of which occasions public notice of the terminal date was given.  I am satisfied that sufficient time and notice to make application was given to persons who had entered into a contract to purchase a house or whose dwelling was commenced before 27 May 1977, the date when the £1,000 new house grant scheme came into operation.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit from 11 April 1980.  Pending completion of inquiries regarding the circumstances of the injury, he received interim payment of disability benefit, the first payment of which issued on 1 May 1980.</P>
      <P>The inquiries regarding his injury were subsequently completed and he has now received all payment of injury benefit up to 12 May 1980, the date of the latest certificate received.</P>
      <P>His entitlement to pay-related benefit is based on his reckonable earnings in the 1978-79 tax year.  As details of his earnings were not available to my Department under the revenue number quoted by the claimant he was requested to furnish evidence of his earnings in that year.  On receipt of the necessary information on 15 May 1980 in my Department a cheque paying arrears of pay-related benefit to 12 May 1980 was issued to him.</P>

Exceptional arrangements for the provision of one of the extra seven lines sought at the organisation's Crumlin address are, however, in train and if it is possible to provide more in advance of the cabling scheme this will be done.</P>
