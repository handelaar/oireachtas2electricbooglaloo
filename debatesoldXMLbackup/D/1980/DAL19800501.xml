      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we must oppose the Fifth Stage of this Bill.  We feel very strongly that land bonds which were initiated in the 19th century as a means of compensating landlords, such as Lord Lansdowne and Lord Palmerston, for their estates when they were taken from them in order that they could be given as tenant proprietors to the small farmers of Ireland is not now relevant as a means of compensating small farmers who find themselves having their land taken from them compulsorily by the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because we believe that land bonds are intrinsically wrong, have argued that they are unconstitutional and should not be used as a means of purchasing land that regrettably we must oppose a Bill which seeks to provide for a greater issue of land bonds for the purchase of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who hates land bonds and who has said so in this House time and again I have heard from the far side of the House&mdash;and I have complained myself&mdash;about the Land Commission not acquiring lands at present. Does anybody on the far side of the House suggest that the Land Commission could pay for all the land coming on the market at present?  If they do let them say so.  Perhaps we cauld get money from the EEC.  We want to continue that division of land and I think that has been agreed also on the far side of the House.  We have no option.  Opposing this Bill is acting inconsistently at present because there is no way in which the Land Commission could pay for land at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, if the Chair does not allow me.  I might just ask a question of the Opposition with regard to their inconsistency.  None of us likes land bonds, I hate them, but we have no option if land is to continue to be acquired for the relief of congestion. Deputy Fitzpatrick knows this.  We want to continue acquiring land for the relief of congestion particularly in the west and I see no alternative to this Bill.  For that reason I cannot understand why the Opposition are opposing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This Bill seeks to provide a further £25 million worth of land bonds for the acquisition of land.  Like Deputy Bruton and indeed Deputy Callanan I deplore the acquisition of land in exchange for land bonds because it is an unjust system of paying for land.  Land bonds fall in value.  If we had today's papers here we would see some £100 worth standing at about £50 and others issued comparatively recently, bearing interest as high as 16 per cent, now standing at less than £100.  That system of paying for land is particularly unfair and unjust in an inflationary situation in which they fall in value very rapidly.</P>
      <P>The Minister has expressed grave urgency about this Bill.  The last issue of land bonds was effected early this year. Apparently the position is that the Land Commission have now no bonds whatever with which to pay for lands. They are actually waiting with their hands out for the enactment of this Bill so that they can carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned with what is in this Bill also for another reason.  The amount in nominal value of land bonds being sought is £25 million.  The Minister tells us that that amount of bonds will enable the Land Commission to carry on for two years.  As far as I can ascertain that means that, in the next two years, the Land Commission will pay for about 20,000 acres of land with these bonds. The Minister of State knows as well as I do that a normal year's work for the Land Commission is the acquisition of approximately 34,000 or 35,000 acres of land.  Therefore I see in this Bill clear evidence that the operations of the Land <Col N="401" /> Commission are coming to a standstill. Deputy Callanan must know as well as I do that since Fianna Fáil resumed office the Land Commission have ground to a halt.  Likewise Deputy Callanan knows that the first step in the acquisition of land by the Land Commission is the service of a section 40 notice.  I got on the record of this House the fact that in six months of 1977 approximately 200 of these notices were served, that in approximately six months of 1978 approximately 198 such notices were served, but over a similar six month period last year 22 notices only were served.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I employed 20 additional inspectors in the Land Commission to fill vacancies created by a Minister from the west who was there before me.  I filled 20 vacancies for out-door inspectors which were let run down by Fianna Fáil before I came into office.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Deputy can put that in his pipe and smoke it.  Every year of my term of office up to 35,000 acres of land were acquired for our small farmers.  If Deputy Leyden wants to know it&mdash;and Deputy Callanan will not deny this&mdash;during my term as Minister for Lands commonage in the west was divided for the first time in years, if not for the first time ever.</P>

There is no way that this £25 million will pay for 40,000 acres of land that is already in the machine requiring to be paid for. This Bill here will not buy one additional acre of land that the Land Commission have not already taken steps to acquire. <Col N="403" /> This is a closing down sale by the Land Commission.  It is an operation to pay for the work that they have on hand but it will not enable the Land Commission to acquire one additional acre of land for the small farmers of Deputy Leyden's constituency and the small farmers of Deputy Callanan's constituency.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I have come into this House several times since the change of Government because I have seen the heavy hand of the Department of Finance crushing the Land Commission out of existence; the Fianna Fáil Deputies from the west are being codded about this and they are helpless to do anything.  Nothing short of another rebellion within Fianna Fáil will save the small farmers of Ireland from being pushed off the land.  It is a disgrace to see a decent Deputy like the Minister of State here, from a congested area, presiding over the extinction of small farmers and the winding up of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the opposition of Fine Gael to this Bill.  I am appalled by the hypocrisy of it.  I am appalled that they are opposing this very important legislation which will enable <Col N="404" /> the Land Commission to carry on their good work.  During the Coalition period of office they used the land bond system. It has been used by this State since its foundation.  Whether we like it or not it is one system which has operated successfully over the years, and when Fine Gael were in the Coalition Government they took no steps whatsoever to change the system.  Yet they come in here today and oppose this legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil enabling the Land Commission to carry on their good work.  I am surprised at their opposition to this legislation and I appeal to them to assist in its passage to ensure that the Land Commission will be given the necessary funds because I am anxious to see many small holdings being acquired in my area.</P>

      <P>In parts of Roscommon and in parts of north-east Galway which are part of my constituency there is quite a lot of congestion and there is quite a lot of land available for purchase by the Land Commission.  But Fine Gael are holding up the passage of this Bill and preventing the purchase of land in those areas.  I will be preaching this message at every church gate when I get an opportunity. I will let the people know of the hypocrisy of Fine Gael who are opposing the landless men on their small congested holdings in the west by their opposition to this legislation which Fianna Fáil have put forward.  I am more than amazed at this opposition.  I would like to see £50 million in land bonds for the purchase of land and I would urge the Government to increase the amount that they are seeking here today because we need more land, so that the Land Commission will continue for the moment at least.  They are doing tremendous work in helping to relieve congestion in rural Ireland and, in particular, the west.  I appeal to the Opposition to cut out this nonsense and assist the Government in the passage of this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear at this stage that we have flushed out Fianna Fáil and we can now see exactly what they believe in.  In the past there were expressions of dismay from that party at the continuance of the land bond system. One of the present Ministers of the Government referred to it as a fraud a few years ago.  We now have a backbencher from Fianna Fáil coming in here and, in the heat of the moment, clearly laying it on the line where they stand.  This Government have shown themselves to be clearly in favour of this obnoxious system, and to suggest to this House that we in Fine Gael should withdraw our opposition to this Bill on different grounds is totally confusing the issue.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael are in favour of the acquisition of unused and under-utilised holdings and their distribution among the small farmers here.  But common decency and common justice demand that the acquisition of such lands should be paid for at market value in cash.  The last speaker asks what can be done to alleviate the problems of the small farmers and sheds a tear for the small farmers of his own area.  Yet, at the same time, he forgets that a lot of the land that is acquired by the Land Commission comes from small farmers.  We have to balance the situation by ensuring that there is a programme of acquisition of land which is not being used or is under-utilised for distribution to small farmers. At the same time it is clear that the person from whom that land is acquired must be paid and should be paid in cash and that is a clear point that has to be put on the record here.  The land bond system is an obnoxious one and an unfair one and the result is that many people who have been paid bonds in the past are now suffering a huge loss as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a reference to the performance of the Coalition in this regard and it is no harm to again put on the record of this House that the Coalition provided more cash for land purchase than was ever provided by Fianna Fáil. Furthermore the land bonds issued by the Coalition were worth more than par <Col N="406" /> and in fact went above the 100 per cent for a long period as opposed to the bonds issued by Fianna Fáil which dropped to less than half their value in many cases.  There is no point in any Deputy from the Government side trying to confuse the issue.  We have this situation and we are all agreed that there should be acquisition powers so that land can be obtained and distributed to the small farmers. I can imagine Deputy Leyden preaching at the Church gate and trying, in typical Fianna Fáil fashion, to spread the lie about Fine Gael's views on this matter.  Our views are clear and I challenge Deputy Leyden to examine his own conscience before he goes around spreading lies about that.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Callanan's viewpoint and I appreciate his concern.  I would ask him also to have concern for those people from whom the land is acquired.  In 1923 there was not a tremendous lot of sympathy for huge absentee landlords.  The situation is different today.  The situation is that land is being acquired in small lots from the ordinary, decent individuals who are entitled to be treated in an ordinary, decent way.</P>

      <P>I will not be long more. If we are talking about the people from whom we are acquiring land we are talking about the manner in which they are to be paid.  This is the true relationship.  If the Minister and the Government are adamant in continuing this obnoxious system they should provide some safeguards for the unfortunate individual who may find that what he is getting for his land is worth half the amount in five years' time.</P>
      <P>There are two major problems.  The first is in regard to inflation, getting a fixed sum which over a period of time is eroded and eaten away by inflation.  It would be difficult to tackle that problem unless there was some kind of indexed bond issued.  That is something the Minister might well shy away from.  The second point is the fall in value in the bond when it goes well below par.  I know there are redemptions every now and then and by chance its number may come up and the bond may be redeemed at full value.  If the lands bond system is to continue why should there not be a system where, over a relatively short period of time, there would be a guaranteed redemption at full value?  If the bond falls below par and is held for a certain period of time the loss in value below par would be made up to the original holder by the Government which issued the bond.  This is not the ideal solution but would alleviate the situation of those upon whom the Government intend to foist these land bonds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny categorically Deputy Fitzpatrick's statement that this is a run down sale of the Land Commission.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The position is that legislation is being prepared at present by the Government to restructure the Land Commission, and I assure the House that whatever restructuring takes place the Land Commission, or whatever authority may be set up as a result of restructuring, has a very important <Col N="408" /> role to play in the re-allocation, purchase and restructuring of land.</P>
      <P>As I stated on Second Stage and yesterday on Committee Stage the £25 million which we are seeking under the Bill is necessary to complete the sales of the 40,000 acres which we already have in the machinery at various stages of acquisition. We know that it will not be possible to purchase all the 40,000 acres and some will fall by the wayside.  We will be able to purchase some new land. It is not true to say that the £25 million being made available is for the purpose of paying for the 40,000 acres.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, I am satisfied that this will be sufficient for two years and at the end of that time the new land authority will be set up and be in operation. It is a question for the Government as to how the new land authority will be financed.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at the opposition of Fine Gael to the Bill because during their term of office they did nothing to change the situation and know full well that if one had not land bonds one could not find the massive capital requirement for the purchase of additional land by the Land Commission.  That is the one thing that would grind the activities of the Land Commission to a halt.  That is what Fine Gael are trying to do this morning. If we look at the figures of land acquired during the past four or five years and paid for in bonds, in 1973-74 6,000 acres were acquired; in nine months of 1974, 12,000 acres; 1975, 11,000 acres; 1976, 17,000 acres; 1977, 15,000 acres; 1978, 12,000 acres; 1979, 10,000 acres.  It is quite obvious that during those three years that the Coalition were in power the acreage of land acquired and paid for under bonds increased substantially. If those bonds are so wrong this morning and if they are so wrong under the legislation why did Deputy Fitzpatrick and his Government at that time not try to do something about it? The acreage during Deputy Fitzpatrick's term of office increased.  I fail to understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words here.  This section includes the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;variety&rdquo; in relation to plants includes any clone, line, hybrid or genetic variant of any plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> Perhaps the Minister could explain the meanings of those terms and the definitions. There is also a question here of what is reproductive material.  I notice that the section includes &ldquo;whole plants as well as parts of such plants, where such whole plants or parts may be used as reproductive material.&rdquo;  I do not know that much about reproduction in the context of plant life, but there would appear to be a possibility that this definition could include, in addition to the prohibitions as to sale, items which are not intended for reproduction at all, but merely for sale&mdash;for instance, for consumption. The legislation could conceivably be interpreted as including a wider range of items.  Is the Minister satisfied that the definition is clear enough?  I do not know anything about plant reproduction, or whether it is possible that some items sold for consumption purposes could also be used for reproductive purposes and that prohibition might extend wider than intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the point of sale, one does not necessarily know what it is intended to be used for and it is used for a particular purpose after it is sold.  I am wondering is it possible that one could use a cutting from a plant for two purposes, either, for instance, as a decoration for the house in a flower pot or as a means of reproducing plants of a similar character?  You are selling these cuttings from plants which have this dual use, either ornamental or reproductive, and the prohibition applies in so far as they are intended for reproductive use but at the time of sale you do not necessarily know how they are going to be used. This is an academic point to a great extent, in that it is hardly likely that the Department are going to go around prosecuting people who are selling things as the intention would be clear as to what they are selling them for.  At the same time, if a dispute were to arise and people were to introduce the defence that <Col N="413" /> they were intending to sell the items only for ornamental purposes and the section was drawn as widely as it is, there might be a possible area of legal uncertainly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case where I am selling parts of plants which have two possible uses in that those parts are capable of being used either to reproduce plants or for consumption, for ornament, for food or something like that.

The question whether they are being used for reproductive purposes can be determined only after they have been sold.  The breeder may take an action against the seller but he can claim innocence that he does not know whether they will be used for ornamental or reproductive purposes.  The seller is not commiting an offence because he is selling them innocently.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5) deals with the question of discovery of a plant variety.  I want to question the purpose of including reference to the discovery of a plant variety.  I understand that basically this Bill is to provide plant breeders' rights to somebody who breeds a special plant.  For instance, if somebody discovers a variety of plant in New Guinea and brings it back here, can he obtain plant breeders' rights in respect of that discovery?  This is an important point.  The basis on which this Bill has been promoted is that if somebody goes to the trouble of breeding a new variety he should have patent protection for that variety but if it is a question of somebody discovering a wild variety, perhaps in a Third World country, I think it is questionable whether plant breeders' rights should be given to him merely because he registered that discovery.  I could envisage a situation where the woods, forests and mountains of Third World countries would be combed by western countries who are members of the international body UPOV and where the wild varieties could be registered with rights following registration of the discovery. Are we going to give plant breeders' rights to people who do that kind of thing?  I would not approve of providing protection in that area.</P>

      <P>The position is that to apply for plant breeders' rights a person would have to be in a position to submit a quantity of the reproductive material, anything from one to five kilos depending on the species.  If rights were granted in respect of a wild plant, propagating material previously not available would be on sale to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we then in a position that the Minister wants to give plant breeder's rights to somebody who has not actually bred a plant but who has found it in the wilds merely on condition he can prove it is distinct and that he can produce a sufficient quantity?  I question whether we should be party to any such arrangement.  I have some fundamental reservations about this Bill but I can see the point regàrding the protection of some of our people here and our institutions who go to the expense and trouble of developing a new variety but in the case of a person who discovers a variety abroad I do not see any justification for giving him an exclusive patent on such a discovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if a person applies for and is subsequently granted plant breeders' rights in respect of a wild plant, all it means is that the person has rights in respect of its commercial propagation.  It does not mean that others can no longer enjoy the plant.  They can continue to take samples with the view to propagating it.  The only thing they cannot do is to propagate it commercially.  That is the important point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we give exclusive rights to somebody just because he is the first to register it?  The people living in the area where the plant was discovered know about it already and use it.  We may have a situation that those people may end up having to pay for the right to continue using the plant in the years afterwards.  I would ask the <Col N="416" /> Minister to examine this point before Report Stage.  There does not seem to be justification for the inclusion of rights in the case I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How much difficulty will the person have to register it, apart from getting a sufficient quantity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing the person has to do is to apply for registration and he has to prove that the plant is distinct, stable and uniform.  Then he has to try to get people to buy it.  In that process he will be involved in a considerable amount of expense and it will be some years before it is of any commercial value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have it registered and he will have a monopoly created before he gets somebody to buy it but that is not an argument for saying he has to go to great difficulty before registering it.  Frankly, I am not happy with the idea that it is correct to create a monopoly of something that is naturally occurring in the wilds.  As Deputy O'Keeffe rightly said, this has probably been discovered thousands of times before by other people living in the area but because they are not aware of the address of the controller of plant breeders' rights and possibly cannot read, they are not capable of acquiring an international monopoly in the matter but somebody from the western world, who is well up on plant breeders' law can come along and do no more than the local people have done as far as discovering is concerned&mdash;indeed the people resident in the Third World <Col N="417" /> may know a lot more about the qualities of the plant than somebody coming in from another culture&mdash;but this person coming from another culture simply uplifts it, takes it away and has it registered in one of the UPOV countries which are the major trading countries in the world and he then has protection.  If the person in the Third World wants to propagate that plant and sell it within the UPOV countries he will be prevented from doing so because of the monopoly acquired by the other person.</P>
      <P>Possibly where material is discovered in the wilds, even though it may have no immediate use, I imagine that such shrewd people would apply for a monopoly and get it straight away in a whole range of plants which they may have no immediate intention of using so that they will be covered against any eventuality.  If the particular plant becomes useful subsequently they will have the monopoly.  I know the Minister will say that if they are not using it somebody can apply for a compulsory licence but the experience has been that these licences are not used.  I have some reservations about the idea of wild plants being subject to a monopoly.  Could the Minister tell us if we have to allow wild plants specifically to be capable of becoming a monopoly in order to comply with the terms of the UPOV Convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that rights granted also carry with them duties.  If rights are abused the Bill provides protection in the public interest in the form of compulsory licences so that if somebody has been granted a plant breeder's licence, certain conditions are laid down.  He has to prove that the plant is distinct and uniform.  I think there are sufficient provisions there to protect everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that has to be solved.  Are we really saying in this Bill that in regard to any variety of any type of seed, that once somebody decides to develop that seed&mdash;take <Col N="418" /> Midas barley&mdash;and decides to work on that and produces a very perfect sample and puts it on the market, that prevents somebody else, even within the State, from doing the same thing?  That would be a very dangerous situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the position is that the first person Deputy Hegarty mentioned has gone to the trouble of getting plant breeders' rights and has taken on the responsibility of producing that particular variety.  Then nobody else can get those rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This could lend itself to some complications in the future.  Take green peas.  It may well be that in the south of Ireland we may be endeavouring to do something to prevent mildew. You might have somebody in France working on the same variety but with altogether different ideas, breeding towards a larger pea output and better tonnages.  Suppose our institute or a private company is spending a great deal of money to produce a product, a new product, something we have been working on in our cereal stations, a completely new product but bred for a purpose, for the control of mildew which is the big problem in the coastal areas.  The man in France is working on exactly the same material but with a different aim.  He does not care about mildew which does not affect him.  Does it mean that if he is out before us with his product we are prevented from putting ours on the market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the person who is producing the pea abroad is producing the same type of pea as the Deputy's friend in Cork, the man who is in first gets the rights.  That is established patents law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>That could have very serious consequences for people involved in that type of operation in Ireland.  Take feeding barley.  We had some French experts here and they are breeding varieties that have not proved at all successful here.  Even over the winter they have caused all sorts of <Col N="419" /> problems with disease and so on.  It now seems as if our breeders of winter barley in future will have to go on different lines from their colleagues in France.  I am talking of new winter varieties which have been disastrous to date.  Does this mean that in the case of Powers of Waterford and people who are now prepared to spend millions of pounds literally in producing something for the Irish market, for our foggy winters and so on, if the other people are on the market before them all their work is in vain?  In other words, we may not breed to meet a certain type of situation.  If this is the case I would oppose the Bill.  The effect would be disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as it is different from what is already promoted in France there is nothing to stop us from going ahead.  It has to be distinct.  That is the important point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in thinking that the answer to this problem is to be found in the First Schedule to the Bill where distinctness is defined?  The question really is whether it can be established that the variety Deputy Hegarty is concerned about is distinct <Col N="420" /> within the terms of this Schedule which says:</P>
      <P>1.  (1) The plant variety to which the application relates must be clearly distinguishable by one or more morphological, physiological or other important characteristics from any other plant variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge at the time when the application is made. The distinguishing characteristics must in all cases be capable both of precise description and of recognition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question really is whether breeding winter barley for mildew resistance, for instance, would give more clearly distinguishable morphological, physiological or other important characteristics.  The terms &ldquo;morphological&rdquo; and &ldquo;physiological&rdquo; relate to the texture of the plant and they might be the same.  The question is whether disease resistance would be in the category of other important characteristics on which one could base a claim that this is a distinct variety.  The point that Deputy Hegarty has raised is of such importance that the Minister should give us a clear indication whether what he has in mind comes within the criteria of distinctness set out in the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We could use the French variety to breed a new variety.  Section 4(7) of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>(7)  The permission of a holder shall not be required for the use of the relevant plant variety either as an initial source of variation for the creation of new plant varieties or for the sole purpose of producing a crop for human or animal consumption.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we have anything to worry about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would.  The question of whether a variety is separate or distinct would be taken by the controller on technical opinion.  He would have an opportunity of deciding whether that variety is distinct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making the law. The controller will be bound by the law. He can have any technical opinion he likes but the law determines his decision. If the law is not clear enough to say that this characteristic would be covered he might have a problem.  If, for instance, it had been presumed that this is so but others in the interpretation of the words &ldquo;other important characteristics&rdquo; did not allow disease resistance to be one of the things to be covered, he would have great difficulty if we did not examine it in order to get over the problem.  We should get something into the Bill to cover this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows well that we are talking here about people who are about to spend a lot of money. We could be talking about millions of pounds literally in some cases.  Nobody in the commercial game, semi-State or otherwise, is going to attempt anything unless it is quite clear at the end of the day that the product is going to be saleable and even then the game is a gamble.  People could spend a lot of money and still end up with nothing.  It is a risky operation for commercial people to undertake and we should not put anything in their way.  They have plenty of problems already.  I can say from my small experience of growing some new varieties that they have been frustrated because the thing turned out to be so hopeless and they spent a lot of money. <Col N="422" /> We should not cause any problem to them.  Everything we do today while this Bill is in the House should be to help the genuine operator to produce the right article. Anything we do should not be of any hindrance to these operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself very confused by some of the issues that have been raised here and Deputy Hegarty as a working farmer has put his finger on the very serious aspects from the agricultural point of view.  Many other aspects in this Bill give rise to a lot of concern on the part of many people and it is clear that the Bill itself is very complex. Even the definition referred to in the First Schedule, &ldquo;morphological, physiological or other important characteristics&rdquo; is difficult for somebody who is not a botanist or a scientist to understand and I find it difficult to understand what is there.  Would the Minister consider as a solid, constructive suggestion that this Bill on Committee Stage would be referred to a select committee of this House and that select Committee could examine and tease out all these issues and could call before them experts of different viewpoints who have an interest in this Bill and examine on it?  I am suggesting seriously to the Minister that unless we take that step, now we will be letting through this house complex legislation which will not be understood fully by all Members of this House, which will not be tested fully and which we will regret in the years to come.  This is an unusual suggestion which I am making to the Minister, but this is an unusual Bill.  I am asking him to think it over and to consult with his colleagues. We have been sitting here for the last three-quarters of an hour trying to tease out words, get explanations and solve the problems.  Without following this suggestion we could be here till Kingdom come and not have the matter solved.  I am making the suggestion to the House and to the Minister that the Government establish a select committee to examine this Bill closely in Committee and that they would have the power to call before them witnesses or anybody else interested <Col N="423" /> in the Bill so that it could be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the European Council of Heads of State or of Government and of Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg on Sunday and Monday last, 27 and 28 April.  At the meeting I was accompanied by Deputy Lenihan, Minister for Foreign Affairs. As Deputies will be aware, meetings of the Agriculture Ministers of the Nine were taking place concurrently in Luxembourg, and Deputy MacSharry, Minister for Agriculture, attended.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the Council was:</P>
      <P>(1)  (a) economic and social issues; (b) energy; (c) the Report of the Committee of Three on the functioning of the Community institutions; (d) pollution of the sea;</P>
      <P>(2)  (a) convergence and budgetary questions; (b) monetary and financial co-operation;</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(3)  Political co-operation items including Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agenda does not convey the number and complexity of the problems confronting the Community before the Luxembourg meeting.  These include, in particular, the difficulties over the British contribution to the Community budget, a number of extremely important items relating to agriculture, the rapidity with which Community expenditure is moving towards the 1 per cent VAT limit, an increase in the amount of the regional fund and the blocking of the non-quota section, the failure of the Community to establish a credible and viable energy policy and differences over sheepmeat, fisheries and other matters.  I am not listing these items for their own sake but <Col N="424" /> to illustrate the range, importance and diversity of subjects on which deep differences now exist within the Community. However important any one of these subjects is to the Community or any grouping of countries within the Community, it cannot be the main concern. That must now be the proper functioning of the Community and the role of Europe in the world&mdash;how we can co-operate and act, at the political level, in the maintenance of world peace. The real issue now is whether we can maintain and increase the cohesiveness and solidarity of the Community so that in an increasingly dangerous world it can exercise its great influence in the interests of moderation.</P>
    <P>The Community cannot be complacent or negative in its approach.  And, above all, members should not seek solutions separately or nationally&mdash;as might have been possible before.  This is the era of the super-powers and small or even medium sized states have little influences unless they can co-ordinate their policies to achieve what must always be the principal objective&mdash;world peace and stability.  It is for us in Europe to find methods to improve the procedures which will enable us to co-ordinate our policies in the interests of prosperity, progress and peace.</P>
    <P>While economic policies are important for the attainment of these objectives, they cannot be the only consideration. While national objectives obviously can never be far from our minds, they, in the reality of today's conditions, can never be the final motivation.  To my mind, Europe and its peoples depend on each other now in a way which is without precedent in history.</P>
    <P>That is why I regard the outcome of the Luxembourg Council with such disappointment. We were faced with problems in a number of areas, each of which was, and still is, difficult but each of which was, and still is, capable of resolution, given an understanding and acceptance of the purpose and principles of the Community.  Differences might have remained in a number of these areas, as happens on most occasions <Col N="425" /> when councils meet.  Each country would have gained something and each would have given away something but, in total, the Community and the people of Europe would have gained.  I do not think that anyone gained from what happened in Luxembourg on this occasion.</P>
    <P>There was real and serious damage done to the morale of the Community and to the effectiveness of its institutions. That is the main comment I would like to make in this House on the outcome of the council; and that is the main problem we must face in our deliberations in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>I outlined our attitude and approach in a meeting I had with the President of the Council, the Italian Prime Minister, Signor Cossiga, on Sunday morning last and in my contributions in the meeting itself.  I stressed that we were particularly anxious to see a solution to the British problem but that any settlement must be set within a wider framework of convergence. I referred to the inadequate progress achieved so far in narrowing the disparities between member states' economies and the need for a sustained Community effort to this end.  I underlined our strongly held view that any solution to the immediate issue before us should not underline the achievements of the Community or the fundamental principles on which its dynamic development depends.  There must be no resort to <i>juste retour</i> or retreat from basic principles of the CAP such as financial solidarity and common organisation of markets.  At the same time, if it is to be true to its essential nature, the Community must show itself ready to help resolve exceptional difficulties facing any member state.</P>
    <P>There is strong resistance to the idea of discussing the problem of the UK contribution to the Community Budget at a European Council once again; but the problem remains and must be tackled, with the other problems facing Europe, if the Community is to function properly.  We will support any Presidency initiative towards this and would certainly favour concentrated discussions <Col N="426" /> at ministerial level.  An early meeting of Foreign Ministers might indeed evoke the beginning of an understanding.</P>
    <P>The Council in Luxembourg did discuss and come to conclusions on a number of issues, which are detailed in a Presidency document which I will be laying before the House.  I apologise to the House for the delay in putting this document before the House.  I assure Deputies that this is through no fault of the Government but is due to unavoidable delay in getting the document prepared in the Community and having clarification of different aspects of it.</P>
    <P>The discussion on the British budgetary contribution took place, mainly, on the second day.  It was long and detailed.  What emerged was an acceptance by the Council that the British contribution should be frozen, in 1980, at the average of its amount for the preceding two years.  This meant that the British would have secured a reduction of almost 1.2 billion EUAs in their net contribution to the Budget in 1980.  Of course, this figure is not final.  It is based on many estimates.  There were difficulties over the method to be used to calculate the contribution in 1981 and 1982.  I do not think that it is necessary to go, here, into details of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is sufficient to say that the calculations would have been based on the figure of 538 million EUAs contributed, on average, by the UK to the budget in 1978 and 1979 and would have been influenced by the development of the budget, in total, in 1981 and 1982.  This of course would have been constrained under the existing 1 per cent VAT ceiling. In the end the difference was calculated to be equivalent to a figure of approximately £100 million or less&mdash; though, of course, it is impossible in a situation like this, where there are so many imponderables, to be precise.  It was on this issue of amount and the duration of the solution, basically, though perhaps also on a number of the other items I have mentioned, that the meeting failed to reach agreement.  I <Col N="427" /> think that the real tragedy is that, having got so near to a solution, it failed in the end.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is of fundamental importance to Ireland and to a large section of the population of the Community.  Policy in the sector has political and social as well as economic implications.  I personally feel that it is particularly unwise now, in the present state of the world, even to begin thinking of policies which, by undermining the Common Agricultural Policy&mdash;a cornerstone of the Community&mdash;could threaten the production in Europe of the food which man needs for his very survival.  Surely we have learned from the hard experience of oil the dangers of permitting dependence on external sources for vital commodities to grow excessively?  The confidence of farmers must be maintained and agriculture must be given the support which other industries get, in other ways, from the balance and mechanisms of the common market.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in an effort to secure a settlement of the interlinked problems facing the Community, the Presidency took the unprecedented step of convening the Agricultural Council in parallel with the meeting of the European Council. Following an informal session, an intensive round of bilateral discussions and a meeting of the Council into the early hours of Monday morning, all the delegations were agreed on the elements of the package, though this was subject to a general reservation by the UK.  It was not possible to reach agreement on the inclusion in the draft conclusions of certain words relating to the responsibility of producers for the cost of disposal of milk surpluses.  The Minister for Agriculture and I stood firm against conceding, even for future years, the principle of a super-levy on farmers who increase production and when the agriculture item came before the European Council the members, with two exceptions, accepted our approach.</P>
    <P>Had we been able to bridge the gap in respect of the British budgetary contribution <Col N="428" /> I have no doubt that there would have been full agreement on a satisfactory package with price increases in the range of 4 to 5 per cent for the main products of Irish interest, agreement on the main features of a Community policy for sheepmeat and adoption of the special structures programme for the West of Ireland together with the dropping of the unacceptable elements in the market balance proposals of the Commission.  In the event the whole subject was referred back to the Agriculture Council.</P>
    <P>There was a similar outcome to the discussion in the European Council on fisheries where it was not possible for the UK to accept one aspect of the proposals put before the Council.</P>
    <P>On the economic and social situation, there was a consensus that for 1980, largely as a consequence of the further large increase in oil prices, the growth rate for the Community as a whole would fall, unemployment would rise and inflation could reach over 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>There was also agreement with the Commission's view that the current stance of policy should be broadly unchanged. In the course of the discussion our own budget was noted as an example of the type of policy response appropriate to the current circumstances.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the high level of interest rates.  As the Minister for Finance recently said in the House, the level of rates in Ireland cannot be isolated from the realities of the international markets or of our own rate of inflation and external payments deficit.  Nevertheless, none of us wants rates to be even one point higher than they have to be or maintained at current levels for a moment longer than is inescapably necessary.  I am, therefore, glad to tell the House that, largely at our instance, the Conclusions of the Council invite the Council of Finance Ministers and the Committee of Central Bank Governors to maintain close co-ordination of their interest rate policies with a view to a reduction in the current high rates as soon as the necessary conditions are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> There was considerable emphasis in our discussion on the problems created for the world economy by the huge increase in the balance of payments surplus of the oil-exporting countries and the corresponding drain on the assets of other countries, especially the developing countries which are not petroleum producers.  The OPEC current surplus, having fallen to $5 billion in 1978, rose to about $68 billion last year and is expected to rise to $115 billion in 1980. The combined deficits of the non-oil developing countries may reach $68 billion this year and $78 billion in 1981. The financing of these deficits which has been effected largely through private credits could cause problems of major dimensions.</P>
    <P>I was one of a number of Heads of State or Government in Luxembourg who raised the question of intensifying efforts at international level to developing suitable channels for recycling these funds.  While there were some differences of view of the best approach&mdash;for example, as to the extent to which the ECU should be promoted and developed as a genuine international reserve asset&mdash;the Conclusions of the meeting endorsed the call to step up action on this subject and asked the Finance Council to give the matter particular attention.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the review we undertook of progress with the European Monetary System.  There was general agreement and considerable satisfaction that the exchange rate system has worked well.  The Council confirmed our commitment to monetary integration and asked the Community bodies concerned to push on with their work which is designed to prepared the way for the institutional phase, embracing the definition of the role of the European Currency Unit and the establishment of the European Monetary Fund.  While there are differences of view as to the pace at which progress can be made, the commitment to the objectives set at previous meetings remains strong, and such caution as has been manifested is motivated purely by the wish to ensure <Col N="430" /> that the development of the system is founded on such sure foundations that it will be both successful and irreversible.</P>
    <P>Europe's pattern of energy demand and supply is now a major danger to our future and a major constraint on progress.  There was agreement that every effort must be made to reduce dependence on oil and increase recourse to other forms of energy.</P>
    <P>Under the political co-operation heading the European Council discussed Afghanistan emphasising that the objective was not an imposed neutrality but a free decision of the Afghan people.</P>
    <P>On Iran our main points were to indicate solidarity with the United States in their efforts to secure the release of the hostages by political and diplomatic means and to re-affirm the decisions of the Foreign Ministers of 22 April.  We also wished to encourage the UN Secretary General in his effort to play a useful role in the present crisis.</P>
    <P>On the Middle East, the Nine reiterated our belief that only a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement can bring true peace to that region.  The European Council were conscious that Europe may in due course have a constructive role to play to that end and we therefore asked the Foreign Ministers to prepare a report so that we could consider the problem fully on the occasion of our next session in Venice in six weeks' time.</P>
    <P>The European Council denounced the acts of violence committed in Southern Lebanon against members of UNIFIL and demanded that they cease immediately and that the force be permitted to carry out in full its mandate from the United Nations Security Council. Throughout we stressed the need for positive efforts to maintain world peace through dialogue at the present time.</P>
    <P>I was glad to have the opportunity, while in Luxembourg, of having a brief private meeting with the British Prime Minister.  It is not customary to say, in detail, what is discussed at meetings of this nature.  Deputies will, however, wish to be aware that we agreed on a substantive <Col N="431" /> meeting to be held in a matter of weeks for a discussion of a number of issues of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that, apart from the outcome, the arrangements for this most disappointing and protracted of Councils were excellent and to congratulate Mr. Cossiga, in his capacity as President of the Council, on the hard work, patience and tenacity which he put into seeking a solution.  I am sure that we are all conscious of the magnitude of the difficulties he faced and deeply appreciative of his efforts, personally and through his Ministers and officials to overcome them, in the common interest of the peoples of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to apologise to the House and to the Taoiseach for being a minute or so late.  I was in the Dáil Library at about three minutes to 12 o'clock when copies of the Conclusions of the Presidency arrived from the Taoiseach's office.  The Taoiseach has apologised to the House for this.  I have to say the position is unsatisfactory. We on our side of the House were happy to allow several days to elapse before this debate took place, knowing the difficulty, when you come back from a meeting which ends in the early hours of the morning, of putting all the threads together.  We felt it would be more valuable to hear from the Taoiseach when he had an opportunity to put the pieces together, especially in view of the visit of the German President.</P>
      <P>Having waited for two-and-a-half days, that we should not have the advantage of having the Conclusions of the Presidency until three minutes before this debate is not acceptable, and I do not understand the Taoiseach's explanation. In the text I have, the type used throughout would appear to me, in all the pages up to the last two, to be the type used always in EEC documents.  It was not produced in Brussels.  From my experience of these meetings, these documents are available at the time and one brings them back with one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> In the last two pages there is reference to foreign policy and, except for three lines typed in a different type face, the material is that which was typed in Brussels and which normally the delegation bring back with them.  I really do not understand why it should have taken so long.  The last two pages were in the newspapers this morning&mdash;not the complete text but quotations from them.  If they were available to the press last night, I cannot see why they could not have been available to this House earlier than at three minutes to 12 o'clock today. While nothing the Taoiseach's apology, I feel the position is unsatisfactory. I had to try to read through this lengthy document while listening to the Taoiseach's speech simultaneously.  I have to say it is over-straining my mental resources to try to absorb both of these at once.</P>
    <P>So far as this European Council meeting is concerned, it is fair to say the Taoiseach in a sense was flung in at the deep end.  There can have been few European Councils as difficult and complex as this one and in which the interests of the Community were so much at stake, and consequently Irish interests.  It must have been difficult for him&mdash;this was the first occasion on which he attended such a meeting&mdash;that it should have been one of such complexity, both at the level of internal EEC policies and in respect of foreign policy issues.</P>
    <P>The economic section of the Conclusions of the Presidency, in so far as I have been able to read them while listening to the Taoiseach, appear to consist of what I can only describe as the usual economic waffle which has been in every communique of every European Council meeting since the first such meeting in 1975.  The Taoiseach has told us that the average inflation rate is expected to be 11 per cent.  I do not think that is in the Statement of the Presidency.  It is of interest to note that, given that our inflation rate is now going to be almost double that&mdash;in the range of 20 per cent, plus or minus the fraction of a percentage as far as one can work out.</P>
    <P>I note what the Taoiseach said about <Col N="433" /> interest rates and the Central Bank being asked to look at the interest rate situation. Undoubtedly it was a constructive initiative on the part of the Taoiseach to raise that, but he must face the fact that the problem of interest rates is not just an international one.  There are member countries with interests rates of half ours.  The interest rate situation in this country is primarily domestic rather than related to the international interest rate position.</P>
    <P>I want to deal for a few minutes with the question of the British contribution.  I am concerned that in the Taoiseach's statement there are no details of the proposed solution to the British problem. The statement of the Presidency has nothing to say about it at all.  There is an obscure reference by the Taoiseach, relating only to the contributions by the UK to the budget, which is very hard to interpret and which does not say anything about any other arrangements, despite press reports that the total amount by which the UK was to benefit, under certain proposals, would be up to £800 million which is about three times the figure mentioned by the Taoiseach in his speech, presumably because of arrangements to make certain payments to Britain in respect of certain activities in Britain as part of the proposed deal.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Taoiseach to give us any information about that or any indication as to whether we also would benefit from proposals to increase EEC expenditure in the UK is something which we should deplore.  We are in an extraordinary position in that we do not know what was proposed except for fragmented press reports which are obscure.  None of those press reports that I have seen makes it clear whether the position we have taken up previously, and which is entirely consistent with the realities of the position, that any aid given to Britain on the basis of its special position as the third poorest country would be given <i>a fortiori</i> to the second poorest country, Italy and to the poorest country, Ireland still prevails. There is no reference to that and I have <Col N="434" /> no means of knowing whether the proposed solution included benefits for the two poorer countries or whether they were confined to Britain.  Nor is it clear, nor is there the slightest indication as to who was to make up to shortfall in the British contribution and who was going to pay for the extra investment in Britain.  Were we, the poorest country, expected to and agreeing to contribute towards the £800 million or were we going to be exempt from contributing or get any benefits?  It is remarkable that the House should be given an address by the Taoiseach on this subject in which nothing was said on the most crucial points for Ireland.  We are left in total ignorance as to whether and to what extent we are to pay for what is proposed or to benefit from what is proposed.  I would have thought that would have been the first thing the Taoiseach would have dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the figures are clear but I should like to make it clear that a decision was not arrived at.  It did not get to the stage in our consultations or discussions of the matters the Deputy is dealing with.  There were no conclusions about them or proposals in regard to them.  We were stuck at the actual amount of the British contribution.  The consequential matters arising out of that were not discussed, were not on the table and had not been dealt with.  I should like to reiterate what was proposed.  A number of different proposals were put forward from different quarters of the table but the main proposal which we finally finished on was a Joint German-French proposal to the effect that the British contribution for 1980 would be frozen at 538 million Units of Account, the average for 1978-1979.  How Britain was to be repaid the difference between her normal budgetary contribution and <Col N="435" /> the frozen amount was not arrived at. There was general agreement that it would probably be a combination of the Dublin mechanism and additional Community expenditures in the UK.  We did not get to that stage in the discussions. As far as 1980 was concerned that was accepted by the UK and we proceeded to talk about 1981 and further years and that is where the Council broke down. At that point all the proposals were withdrawn from the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That has helped to clarify the point of breakdown but it has not answered the question I was raising. If the British contribution was to be frozen at 538 million UAs somebody would have to make up the difference and my question was: who would?  Were we all involved in this, including us, the poorest country?  Were we to help out Britain with a GDP nearly half as large as our again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not discussed in any substantative way but the general implication was that all the countries would contribute in the normal way in their proportion as to the existing budget.  We did not get to substantively discussing those aspects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is rather confusing and it is extremely important that we should clear the air on the point.  As I understand from the Taoiseach's statement in reply to Deputy FitzGerald he said that a French-German proposal was made to the British and the UK accepted that proposal as far as 1980 was concerned. Surely we would have to know whether that was going to cost us money or not before we could indicate our position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would have been the next step in the discussions.  If the discussions had settled the amounts then the manner in which the amounts would be contributed would have been the next step.  As the original matter was not decided we did not get to that point.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to impose on the Chair but the Taoiseach, recognising the importance of this, replied to the original statement of Deputy FitzGerald.  I am seeking a further point of clarification.  The Taoiseach stated in reply to Deputy FitzGerald that it had been generally accepted that all the countries would contribute to some extent.  That clearly indicates that that included Ireland and that it would cost us something.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair's difficulty but any clarification on a matter as complex as this is helpful to the House.  I am grateful to the Taoiseach. for having at this stage sought to bring it a bit further, though it still leaves considerable obscurity about the situation.  I am not clear as to whether the question of additional Community aid to the United Kingdom is incorporated in this formula and if so if it is to the UK only. Are we in the position of having to contribute to the finances of a country about one-third or one-half better off than we are with that country getting substantial additional investment from the Community which is not going to come to us in any equivalent form?  A solution of that kind, and with all due goodwill to the UK Government, seems a strange one for an <Col N="437" /> Irish Government to contemplate.  I can understand our concern to be helpful in this matter.  It is right that we should seek to be helpful but there are limits as to how far we should be reasonably expected to go in that respect.  I will not drag that matter out any further but I hope that one way or another we will get more information as to what is proposed because we must remember that this is not the end of the matter.  It will come up again at some point, hopefully soon, to be settled, We are entitled to know the sacrifices that will be required from us in terms of financial contribution towards the difficulties of the UK with its huge balance of payments surplus, compared to our deficit, and its greater GDP per head and whether if additional Community expenditure is to take place there we can or cannot hope for some equivalent given that we are a much less well-off country.  Those are reasonable questions to raise and I do not think the House should be left in total obscurity because they will be up for negotiation again.  Any fresh negotiation will, presumably, start somewhere around what is proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of the net UK contribution raises great difficulties.  The fact is&mdash;this is not clearly understood by British opinion&mdash;that the UK net contribution is along the lines envisaged when she joined the Community.  There was never the slightest doubt about the form and character of the method of financing the Community, all levies and duties from outside the Community belong to the Community, not to the State through whose ports or airports they happen to enter or across whose frontiers they passed, often destined for other States.  Up to 1 per cent of VAT was provided for specifically so as to supplement this.  We all knew this when we joined and we are still within this percentage though the limits may soon be reached.  If the British complaints had been limited to the question of high spending on agriculture due to surpluses they could be understood although on this issue, obviously, our interests, those of the whole island of Ireland and those <Col N="438" /> of the island of Britain, diverge. However, this is not apparently the issue that is being raised although it is a British complaint on that point.  What the British were looking for went far beyond some restraint in agricultural spending.</P>
    <P>If the question had been that Britain had a balance of payments difficulty, then the complaint and difficulty could be understood.  Indeed, in Dublin in 1975 there was the first renegotiation in respect of Britain, when special provision was made for an alleviation of Britain's financial relationship with the Community in that event.  But Britain has a balance of payments surplus.  If Britain had made the case that the economically weaker members of the Community should be aided specially, this too we could understand and indeed support; but, on that basis our needs and those of Italy would take precedence over those of Britain.  That is not Britain's position; she is the third poorest, not the poorest, member of the Community.</P>
    <P>When one comes down to it the fact is that there is no logical basis for the British complaint, which is based on a reluctance to carry out the obligations accepted when membership was undertaken, when it was known that membership economically, in terms of contributions to the budget, would be likely to cost Britain money but when Britain decided to join because by joining she secured two important benefits; (1) access to the industrial markets of these countries without any duties or quota restrictions, which was a very important potential benefit for British industry, had it been able to take advantage of it; and (2)  membership of a Community through which Britain could exercise much more influence, as we can ourselves, than as an individual country outside it.  Britain decided to join and to pay the known costs by a known method. Nothing has changed since then in terms of the method of payment and Britain has had the benefits, even if she has not made full use of them, as might have been hoped and as I had hoped on her behalf.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Having said that about the lack of a logical basis for the British case, nevertheless the Community and its members always recognise the political difficulties of member states.  For example, when the present Government got into difficulty in the EMS negotiations they were helped out by special contributions from countries like France and Germany for the two years 1979 and 1980, all of which has since been dissipated in paying for budget deficits instead of being invested in infrastructure, as was then indicated to this House.  But the result of the sympathy shown by the EEC to Britain's political difficulties, despite the absence of any actual logical British case, has turned out to be somewhat perverse.  It seems now that the very willingness of the Community to help the British Government with their political difficulties&mdash;largely of their own creation because their propaganda campaign has brought to light anti-Community forces within Britain, and they have created a monster which they find it hard now to control&mdash;has been to encourage a British belief that there is a logical basis for a massive reduction in her contribution.</P>
    <P>This has now gone to the point where even an offer of an enormous reduction for the next couple of years, which as far as I can calculate would involve reducing Britain's net contribution by something like two-thirds for 1980, with provision for a review and continuance of that for several following years, has been rejected by Britain without any apparent recognition, judging by what has been said since then in Britain, of the effort involved to the Community in making this offer and the effort involved for countries like ourselves with enormous balance of payments deficits&mdash;admittedly largely of our own creation as a result of this Government's policies &mdash;and with a much lower level of gross domestic product per head in going along with special treatment for the wealthier United Kingdom with their substantial balance of payments surplus, all of this involving on our part very considerable sacrifices.  It is disturbing, to <Col N="440" /> say the least, that, having being offered such substantial aid when there was no logical case made for it, Britain should end up merely with a grievance against everybody who has been trying to help and with no evident recognition in anything said on the part of the British Government, political parties, or indeed the British media, of the extent to which the Community has gone, far beyond anything that could normally be expected and indeed moved away from some of its own principles in order to help Britain.</P>
    <P>Having said that&mdash;and I think it had to be said &mdash;I accept that it is clearly important that we in this country try to help the United Kingdom out of the situation into which they have got themselves. It is right that we should go to some lengths in this respect even at the expense of our short-term national interest in material terms in view of the importance of the Anglo-Irish relationship, more especially at present when a British initiative on the North is under consideration. I would accept it is not a moment for our Government to give undue public expression to the feelings that British tactics have aroused among all Community partners.  Instead we must be as patient and helpful as we can without prejudicing our long-term national interests in the CAP and in the Community financing system generally.</P>
    <P>One thing that concerns me about developments that have taken place recently has been the rumours&mdash;to which the Taoiseach has not referred, perhaps understandably&mdash;of a developing French attitude that if Britain presses this issue the Community should return effectively to the idea of the <i>juste rétour,</i> that one gets back what one puts in, which is basically what the British are seeking.  If the French Government changed their stance in regard to basic Community policies and moved to that position out of irritation with the British attitude this could be absolutely fatal for us in this country as the biggest single net beneficiary of EEC membership, with something like 8 per cent or 9 per cent of our current budget year after year coming from that source quite apart <Col N="441" /> from the benefits to agriculture of the CAP and price structure.  But, having said that, we must try to be helpful to Britain even though hitherto our efforts and those of other countries seem to have only fuelled the fires of xenophobia in that country.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there must be very widespread concern if Britain attempts to hold the Community to ransom by refusing agreement to the agricultural package being proposed because she is not satisfied with the exceptional arrangements proposed to her in respect of her own political difficulties.  This agricultural package is one which does take account of the need to reduce surpluses and involves consequent cuts in real farm prices by one means or another, whether by holding down prices or proposing levies.  It gives farmers a small increase at least in current money terms&mdash;the Taoiseach mentioned 4 per cent or 5 per cent&mdash;in a year of 20 per cent inflation.  If Britain were to try to prevent that happening, then from our point of view it would be a very serious matter indeed for our balance of payments and, above all of course, for our farming community.  We would have to consider very seriously what action we would take in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not refer to reports that the French President has committed himself at some point in the not too distant future to introducing these farm price increases even if they are not agreed within the Community.  We must surely consider the implications of that attitude of the French President for our policy.  If that happened, what action would we take?  Would we follow suit, or would we try to keep the action of the French Government and our own within the framework of the Community system?  How can the Community react effectively if Britain sets out to prevent the Community decision-making system from operating in retaliation for not being satisfied with the offer made to her?  I feel we must consult with our partners on this matter if it appears that British action is likely to disrupt the normal <Col N="442" /> working of the CAP which would create a crisis situation for us on the agricultural front.</P>
    <P>I hope that by some means at the Venice European Council a solution to these problems can be found.  We cannot afford to let the crisis drag on.  We cannot afford to allow the CAP be undermined to the point of danger.  But part of the solution may lie in somewhat more effective attempts by the Commission and member states to communicate with British public opinion.  The total failure to comprehend what is at stake and the obviously deep-rooted belief that there is justice in their case which has been spread in Britain so sedulously by politicians and the media has made a solution much more difficult.  I do not feel the British public has been helped to understand the real issues by the anti-EEC presentation of the case in the British media which, instead of subjecting the actions of their politicians to critical scrutiny which one expects from the press, has largely succumbed to paroxysms of xenophobia in support of the politicians in question.  It is tragic that all this should have preoccupied them when there were so many other items to discuss.  One of these referred to in the communique was the North-South dialogue.</P>
    <P>The Brandt report was discussed.  I suspect from my knowledge of how these councils work that it was not in fact discussed but these three paragraph were prepared and one of the paragraphs states that the position worked out by the European Community in the preparatory phase of the overall negotiations within the United Nations was very much in line with some of the proposals contained in the Brandt report.  This report appears to be taken into consideration in the drafting of the European position in the context of North-South relations.  I would not regard that as a very strong commitment.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that the Government are inhibited in questioning this issue in view of the totally unacceptable decision to cut development aid in real terms and to cut bilateral aid in money <Col N="443" /> terms this year and this has destroyed our moral position in the matter, I must express concern that the Brandt report is dismissed so summarily.  It is tragic that that important issue does not appear to have been adequately discussed because of the preoccupation of heads of government with the British issue and I would judge that the heads of government did not have sufficient time either to discuss adequately crucial world issues, in particular, the crises in Iran and in Afghanistan and in the Lebanon and the related problem of US-Europe relations. These are referred to in the last two pages of the communique in very different and almost illegible typing because the photocopying, unfortunately, is defective, making it difficult to read.  This has the air of having been drafted in advance, apart from the three lines added in a different typescript stating that the Nine declare their full support for the steps which the United Nations intend to take to secure the release of the hostages in relation to Iran.  These are issues to which this meeting of the European Council should have given its full attention. It should not have been so distracted by an internal issue and, indeed, given that the issue was discussed not to a conclusion but without success, it is particularly tragic that time was wasted on that when it could have been used to discuss these other matters.</P>
    <P>The whole question of US-Europe relations, which is of vital importance to all of us whatever our status, whether members of NATO or not, is one which at the moment is preoccupying people throughout western Europe in all the countries, including the countries that are formally neutral, those that are members of NATO and those that are not members of NATO and those that are in in between positions.  This relationship of the United States and Europe has always been subject to some tension.  We had the problem created in 1973 by the then Secretary of State's unilateral proposal for a &ldquo;Year of Europe&rdquo; which led to deep misunderstandings.  We had the total failure to consult over the 1973 war and the use, for example, of German territory <Col N="444" /> to transport arms to Israel without the knowledge of the German Government. We had the attempts to improve consultations between Europe and the United States.  But all these efforts to improve that relationship are now threatened because of the events of this year including, of course, the irrationalities that arise from this being an election year in the United States and the consequent dangers that arise from that for us all.</P>
    <P>Looking at what the EEC countries have done, ourselves included, I can understand the <i>rationale</i> of what has been attempted.  The Community would appear to have been attempting to prevent an over-reaction by the United States on the Iranian issue and attempting to preserve the US-Europe relationship against domestic tensions in the United States.  We should co-operate in this effort in the interests of peace and security. Whatever qualms we may have about the concept of sanctions, their feasibility, practicality, effectiveness or the likely reaction to them on the part of the government and/or people of Iran, in so far as co-operation with the EEC countries in the measures taken was designed with the hope and expectation that it would prevent the United States acting unilaterally, I can understand the motivation behind it.</P>
    <P>I would like to add here, because I think there is a lot of confusion on this issue here, that no conceivable concept of neutrality should deter us from co-operation in efforts of this kind relating to world peace.  There are those here who argue allegedly for neutrality.  They are not in fact arguing for neutrality as it exists as a concept in the real world; they are in fact arguing for isolationism of a unique kind in the name of neutrality. People who argue that we should play no part in contributing, through our membership of the Community, to the reduction of tensions in the world and who express such fears about our neutrality arising from this would appear to be completely unaware, for example, of the extent of the co-operation that took place between countries like Sweden, Austria and Switzerland with the EEC in <Col N="445" /> the preparation of the Helsinki Agreement securing a common position between all western European countries on a whole range of issues in negotiating with the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries.  From things that are said here at times one would think that we are required to adopt a form of neutrality which would go so far beyond that of Sweden, Austria and Switzerland as to represent total isolationism.  Some of the proposals put forward would involve swinging the balance in the other direction, towards the Soviet Union, and that balance has already, in the military sense, swung far in that direction.  We cannot put ourselves into political purdah by adopting isolationist positions that ignore the reality of the East-West crisis and the need to work constructively to moderate tensions.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Taoiseach will, I think, be conscious of the fact that there is concern that moving with the other EEC countries in relation to sanctions in Iran with the object obviously&mdash;which was so stated informally at the time&mdash;of preventing over-reaction by the United Stated to that situation has not proved totally successful.  One can only hope that further diplomatic efforts will secure a more balanced reaction to this and that in the whole process relations between the United States and Europe will be maintained.  I would add that it was unfortunate that the European countries, ourselves included&mdash;though primary responsibility does not lie with us&mdash;did not react more effectively and in a more consolidated manner to the invasion of Afganistan.  If we had shown more solidarity then, not just with the United States but with the non-aligned countries in the Muslim world who all are involved emotionally in this affair, then the tensions which have arisen between Europe and the United States about Iran would not perhaps have been as great.  But when Europe seemed to be unhelpful to the non-aligned and Muslim world in regard to the issue of Afghanistan as well as to the United States that certainly aggravated the US tensions in relation to Iran which we have been working with <Col N="446" /> our partners to reduce and which I hope can be reduced.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to refer to the Taoiseach's reference to his meeting with the British Prime Minister.  I do not of course expect him to divulge what was said on that occasion.  I do not expect that very much was said because, knowing the pressures on these occasions, there is not really an opportunity to say very much especially at a meeting of this kind when the British Prime Minister was so deeply involved in her own concerns. But I am glad that, at any rate, the discussions have led to a decision that in a matter of weeks there will be a meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  I presume this will take place before the British initiative on Northern Ireland.  I understand that the Taoiseach at that meeting will be seeking to contribute to a positive result to that initiative, as we all have been doing in our own way.  Already there has been a meeting here between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and both myself and the Leader of the Labour Party have had meetings with the Secretary of State.  All of us have been seeking to contribute to a British initiative which could have some prospect of success.  I would hope that the meeting the Taoiseach will have with the British Prime Minister will take place before that initiative and that he will have the opportunity also to contribute further towards a good outcome.  A lot depends for this country on that.  Any effort any of us can make to ensure that the British initiative is sufficiently imaginative and delicately balanced to secure even reluctant acceptance from the various parties we must make in that respect.</P>
    <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his statement but I am concerned about the failure to get the documentation to us in advance.  Something should be done to prevent this happening in future.  It makes any serious discussion very difficult when one has not the opportunity to read what actually has been said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his statement to the House on the failure of the recent Community summit. While noting the Taoiseach's apology to the House regarding the unavailability of the President's conclusions, I would point out that while this party sought from the Taoiseach the continuance of the procedure where a statement would be made to the House on summit meetings, we did not specify any particular time or day.  The Taoiseach nominated this morning and we accepted it but we naturally assumed that all relevant documentation would have been available to us to allow us to discuss the matter in a more informed way than is possible under these circumstances.  I contemplated asking the Taoiseach this morning to postpone the statement in order to ensure that in the interests of the people we represent full relevant documentation would be made available to us.  It is important that on future occasions that would be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess I have some sympathy with the eight leaders who were confronted with the latest example of British intransigence on a whole range of important policy matters.  Every reasonable effort was made and indeed effort I would regard as unreasonable.  That only became public this morning with the Taoiseach's reply to questions put by me.  The Taoiseach on behalf of the country agreed, at least in principle, that we who are poorer than Britain in the Community, would contribute voluntarily to finding a solution to the British problem.  That, to me, while I recognise the desirability of finding a solution, is an effort by the Taoiseach to find a solution which is unreasonable and not in our best interests.  It is contrary to the stated policy of the Government with regard to British budgetary problems in which they have maintained up to now the principle that any solution that was to be found would not be at the expense of other countries, namely, ourselves and Italy, who are in fact poorer than Britain.  It is not an agreement that I would have made if I had been in the same position as the Taoiseach.  Fully accepting the desirability of finding a <Col N="448" /> solution, I think that went a little too far against our interests and those of the country.</P>
    <P>The British attitude now holds out the prospect of a deliberate attempt on their part to block all progress within the Community.  While it is obvious that the Community is making little or no progress at the present time there is now a real likelihood of total paralysis.  Given the scale of the economic and social problems facing the people of the Nine such a situation would be unacceptable and tragic.  Every effort must be made to restore some element of momentum.  If the Community ceases to move forward in the general interest of its people it will soon cease to have any meaning or value for its citizens.  Having said that, I must state once again that the value of frequent summit meetings of this kind is highly questionable.  The European Council has no foundation in the treaties but has been grafted artificially onto the structure of the Community.  I believe that far too many decisions are being pushed up to the level of meetings of Heads of Government from Ministerial Councils and that this procedure is damaging the operational efficiency of the Community's institutions.  In addition, the fact that these European summits increasingly end in disarray and disharmony is damaging the credibility of the Community among the European electorate.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I believe they should take place less frequently and that the conduct of the Community's affairs should in the main be carried through by the Ministerial and other institutions. This approach would be more efficient, in my view, and would avoid unnecessarily heightening the real differences of opinion on major policy issues which frequently occur among European political leaders.  The fact that the UK budget issue was not solved at this summit leaves many other important matters in abeyance.  The agriculture package has been held up.  Irish agriculture is already suffering from a serious loss of confidence arising from the inept domestic policies of the <Col N="449" /> Government here.  It certainly does not need, in addition, a further long drawnout saga of farm-price bargaining in Europe.  Agricultural prices, and the fishing and lamb market issues, are matters which should be dealt with without further delay.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support given by the member states for the UNIFIL forces in the Lebanon.  All civilised political authorities must be at one in backing the peacekeeping activities of the UN and in condemning both those who attack the peacekeepers and those who arm and finance the attackers for their own purposes.</P>
    <P>I agree also with the general tone of the statement made on the Iran crisis.  In particular I welcome the emphasis in the statement on the role of the UN in seeking to secure liberation of the hostages. But I must come back again in this connection to a point which I raised after one or two recent meetings of the European Council.  I am seriously concerned about some of the implications of the process of European political co-operation which we have witnessed in the recent period.  There is a danger that this process will lead this country into a situation of quasi-alliance with other nations or power blocs whereas, in fact, our stance should reflect a totally independent line.</P>
    <P>What took place at Luxembourg was not, whatever some commentators may assert, a &ldquo;Western&rdquo; Summit.  Still less was it a meeting of America's allies.  We, in this country, are no-one's ally.  This is a neutral country and our neutrality must be asserted in the most positive and unequivocal fashion.  I am not satisfied that the Government affirm our neutrality unequivocally in the context of European discussions on political co-operation. Indeed, I detect a worrying erosion of our traditional stance in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Our neutral role in the world must not be eroded.  This is a matter <Col N="450" /> of fundamental importance which requires serious debate in this House.  I would like to see the Joint Oireachtas Committee on EEC affairs prepare a report on the subject for early consideration by both Members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>It is all too easy for the fundamental aspects of neutrality to be lost sight of in the complexity of high Community politics.  It is flattering to be among the great powers as they ponder the great issues.  But it is precisely in such circumstances that the greatest opportunity exists for the true application of the principles of neutrality.  This country has a unique role within the Community because we have no entanglements with armed alliances.  Only a country which is free of such alliances can play a really worthwhile role in the continuing struggle for a new and better international order.</P>
      <P>So, what is the net outcome of the Summit?  Nothing on the budget, on agriculture and fishing.  There were worthy sentiments on Iran and Lebanon but with associated danger of damage to our neutrality; a working group only on energy&mdash;in short, a setback for the Community.  In some respects all of these matters were being debated and argued while the real issues were ignored.  I believe that Chancellor Schmidt was correct in pointing to that fact.</P>
      <P>The Community must address itself to a number of great issues or else cease to be taken seriously.  First, there is an economic crisis which is causing 6½ million people to be out of work and which will claim two million more victims in the next two years unless there is an end to Tory policies, whether implemented by Mrs. Thatcher or by others nearer home.</P>
      <P>Second, there is an energy crisis which is central to the whole future shape of the world's economic and social system and which calls for imaginative planning and concerted action.  Where is the Community response in this vital area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> Third, there is the continuing problem of Europe's poor and deprived minorities and marginal groups.  Poverty exists throughout the Community and remains as the inevitable result of an economic system which exists to benefit the rich minority instead of the needy millions.</P>
    <P>Fourth, there is the problem of world development which is so dramatically described in the report of the Brandt Commission.  Where, in a period of cut-backs in aid and reneged programmes of technical assistance, is the Community's answer to this challenge?</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg Summit has failed to face up to any of these grave issues in a realistic manner.  It has called the whole purpose of the Community into question.  We must not have a repeat of this performance in Venice in June.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to discussions he has had with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, and indicated that an early meeting, in the next few weeks, will be held to discuss matters of mutual interest.  I appeal to the Taoiseach at least to let the people of the country know what is his policy on Northern Ireland.  I do not say this to score a political point, but honestly I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>I had discussions over a period of two days in Belfast with various political leaders, trade unions and people involved in the social services, and I found that universally nobody in Northern Ireland knows what the Taoiseach's precise policy is on Northern Ireland or on a solution of that problem.  I was able to tell them in all sincerity that as far as I and the people on this side of the Border are concerned, they are not at any disadvantage because neither do we know.</P>
    <P>If a meeting is to take place in the next few weeks between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher on matters of mutual interest, one of the major issues that should be discussed is the question of Northern Ireland.  Is it not an incredible situation when the elected representatives in this House, including members of the Taoiseach's party, and the general public do not know what the Taoiseach, <Col N="452" /> the man who will represent us at the discussions, has as a precise policy on Northern Ireland?  I ask him in the interests of the country clearly to spell out what his policy is in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I noticed before progress was reported that the Taoiseach was interested in the points being made.  Because of the great complexity of this Bill and the points so far raised on Committee Stage, it seems clear that the Bill should go to a Special Committee of the House so that every aspect of it could be teased out with the committee members being able to get a full and informed opinion on its terms.  I will be making suggestions to the Minister that the Bill be sent to such a committee who could examine all its implications and who could call before them people who could give their expert advice and opinions on the effects of the Bill.  Many people outside have indicated much concern about the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy O'Keeffe's difficulties with the Bill.  This is, indeed, a complex piece of legislation but I suggest that it is no more complex than many other Bills brought into the House during the Opposition time in Government.  There is nothing in this Bill which is not already included in the legislation enacted by the other 12 UPOV countries.  The Bill attempts, as I outlined in my speech on Second Stage, to set up an organisation which, while granting rights to breeders, will ensure that those rights are not abused and that breeders granted rights do not act against the public interest.  While the Bill itself may appear complex, the work which it sets out to do is relatively simple. What we are doing here is adding a further dimension to our patent law&mdash;a dimension, I might add, which exists in most developed countries.</P>
      <P>Even though there might be difficulties in sorting out some of the technical details of the Bill, with a little bit of patience we can overcome any problems that might arise and deal with them satisfactorily here in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <P>I accept the Minister's decision but express some disappointment with it.  There are very broad implications to this Bill, apart from the technical angles.  Outside advice would be helpful from those involved in the plant breeding field, farmers, and those involved in the Third World situation, many of whom could offer very informed views on the Bill and the different provisions in it.  Such advice would be very helpful to us in coming to a final decision on it.  I must express my disappointment that the Minister has not accepted my suggestion.  One should bear in mind that, not just in this country but in the other countries in UPOV, similar <Col N="454" /> discussions did take place.  There were people in the United States Department of Agriculture who expressed reservations on the Bill and there was a strong lobby in Canada on a similar type Bill before the House.  Not to carry on this point much longer, it perhaps goes beyond the terms of this Bill and indicates that the whole procedure of the House on legislation is becoming more complex and might need to be looked at from the point of view of having more informed legislation.</P>

      <P>I understand that we are now beyond the stage of referring this back to anybody, and must forge ahead with this Bill.  Certainly, it would not be my idea to hold up this legislation.  It is long overdue.  If we are to encourage plant breeders into the game of experimentation and into spending a lot of money, this Bill is a matter of extreme urgency.  The Minister has not had time to look at a few questions raised. However, he might clarify an aspect with which I am not happy.  We might be doing something here, with an idea in mind, with a genus or species and someone else in another country might, unknown to us, be doing exactly the same thing with a different end in view.  We might find that our product could not be marketed. There is that bit of uncertainty about the Bill.  If two independent authorities in their own different ways were to work on a new variety, if one person comes out with his variety at 5 p.m. on Friday evening and the other at 9 a.m. on Monday morning, all the work of the second person is in vain.  That seems to be an aspect of the Bill.  I see no reason why both groups of people, if they produce a first-class article, cannot both be entitled to breeders' rights.</P>

      <P>Again, we are working under the rules of UPOV.  There is nothing in this Bill which is contrary to <Col N="455" /> these regulations.  We are merely complying with the regulations laid down under this convention which has been adopted by the other European countries which are members of UPOV.  There is nothing to worry about.</P>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Hegarty is saying, that it will be hard luck on somebody whose variety comes out a little later than sombody else's and who does not get plant rights, but we are in an international convention.  Naturally enough, there will be competition for our Irish breeders; that has to be accepted. As far as I can see from my study of the Bill, there is no real danger at all to Irish breeders.  We can accept this convention. In fact it will be an advantage to the country in the long term and an advantage to our plant breeders to have this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer some questions that he was asked earlier, including some of mine.  I asked him to explain the meaning of the terms in the definition of a variety.  I asked him if the extension of the protection of the legislation to varieties of plants discovered in the wild is necessary under the UPOV convention.  I also asked him, as did Deputy Hegarty, to make it quite clear that breeding a plant, which in every other respect was similar, to resist a particular disease, would be creating a new and distinct variety within the meaning of the legislation and that that would be seen as giving protection to that new development, not preventing it from being marketed by virtue of the fact that a previous person had a patent for a variety of seed which was in every other respect similar but did not have the disease-resistant characteristics of the new plant.  In fairness to the House, the Minister should answer these questions specifically at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here is perhaps with the definition of the word &ldquo;distinct&rdquo;.  Indeed, I would have no objection to widening the definition, if it makes it easier to understand.  Deputy Hegarty was concerned about the <Col N="456" /> variety Midas which might be more disease-resistant than another variety. The position here is that if anybody can produce a variety which is more disease-resistant than, say, a variety which has been produced in France, that variety will certainly have different characteristics and will be deemed to be a new variety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and using different methods, our variety, having emerged as a new and wonderful barley which is now disease free will be recognised as such?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no problem at all about that.  If you can produce a variety which is disease resistant, it will certainly be distinct.  We do not have to mention Midas or any other variety. That is just one.  There are about 200 EEC varieties, I believe.  There are about 23 different varieties of barley, on our national catalogue, perhaps six on a short list which are recommended as the principal varieties.  That is the position.  If Deputy Hegarty, or anybody else for that matter, can produce a variety which is disease-resistant, that is acceptable.</P>
      <P>Regarding plants discovered in the wild, this legislation is necessary under UPOV.  What we are doing here is merely complying with regulations laid down.  It is not a very important matter but may be of benefit to the country commercially if somebody takes up a variety from the wilds and develops it.  It could be very useful.  We are merely trying to comply with UPOV regulations in doing this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand how the Minister can argue that we are required by the UPOV convention to include protection for plants grown in the wilds and which have been growing in the wilds for some years, and which are discovered by someone who patents them.  They may have been discovered many thousands of times before by someone who did not patent them.  The only new element is the fact that somebody who has discovered the plants has patented them.  I find it difficult to accept the Minister's contention that we are required under UPOV convention to extend this protection to wild plants.  I have the convention here.  It is entitled &ldquo;International convention for the protection of new varieties of plants&rdquo;.  A wild plant that has been in existence is not a new plant.  The convention does not say it is for the protection of plants, merely for the protection of new varieties of plants.  Article 1 of the convention states:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Convention is to recognise and to ensure to the breeder of a new plant variety or to his successors in title, both hereinafter referred to as the breeder, a right under the conditions hereinafter defined.</P>
      <P>The convention specifies that what is involved is a new variety of plant and protection is given to the breeder.  Discovering a plant in the wild is not breeding.  I cannot see how the protection of the UPOV convention can be extended to wild plants within the understanding of the terms of the relevant article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody gets a plant breeder's rights in respect of a variety of plant that has been discovered in the wild, that could be, and I am sure it would be, of commercial value to the country at some stage.  In order to get those rights the breeder would have to have spent a considerable amount of money on the undertaking and he would have had to satisfy certain conditions laid down by the controller.  The plant must be distinct from any other variety in existence.  Unless the person can fulfil the necessary conditions he cannot get <Col N="458" /> plant breeder's rights.  This is the practice in other countries who have adopted the UPOV convention and generally the reason we are trying to do it under this legislation is to be in line with those other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be difficult about this.  Probably there is a reasonable explanation for what the Minister is proposing but it should be put on record.  My reading of the convention is that it is concerned with new varieties of plants and giving protection to breeders.  Discovering a plant in the wild does not mean that it is a new variety and the person who discovers it is not a breeder.  If the Minister is contending that protection for wild plants must be included in the Bill because of the UPOV Convention, I do not think he has a sound basis for so doing.  On the face of it the UPOV Convention does not extend to wild plants.  If the Minister is arguing that we need to give protection to people who discover wild plants, that is a different ball game.  Perhaps he has a case, but it should be argued separately.</P>

      <P>There is also the possibility that useful varieties long used by people in the country of origin may be registered here, possibly by a multi-national company, without any compensation to people in the area who may even have discovered the plants themselves and who have been using them. There might be the situation that ultimately the plants would be re-exported on the basis of royalty payments to the countries of origin.  While we are concerned with protecting our own people here, at the same time we must not exploit a Third World country where the plant originated.  If there is no requirement in the UPOV Convention to provide protection for discovered varieties, I do not think the Minister should provide such protection here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is proposing the inclusion of wild plants, apparently on the grounds that that is necessary to comply with the UPOV Convention.  It is up to him to justify the inclusion of wild plants.  It is not for us to advocate either the removal or the inclusion of the provision. The Minister has not yet given us in my view an adequate justification.  He has not established that it is necessary for compliance with UPOV.  The only reference to the actual text of the UPOV Convention has been made by myself and it would seem to suggest that it is not necessary.  The Minister has not said yes it is, or no it is not necessary.  If he does not know I am surprised that he has not got categoric advice on the subject. He should have such advice.  I believe it is not right to enable people to get a monopoly in something growing wild, which the Lord gave us, just because the person who allegedly discovered it knows how to get a patent while the people who have been using it for years do not know.  Suddenly the &ldquo;discoverer&rdquo; has a monopoly and is charging a royalty for propagating the plant if people need to buy the plant from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that subsection (5) not only says &ldquo;a plant variety growing in the wild or occurring as a genetic variant, whether such variant is artificially induced or not&rdquo;.  Presumably that means whether it is in the wild or not, so that in fact this means that if there is any plant growing anywhere that has not yet had a patent granted under this legislation, it is possible to apply for a patent for it.  It does not even have to be a wild plant because of the alternative &ldquo;wild or occurring as a genetic variant&rdquo;.  That is <Col N="461" /> really going too far and if the Minister proposes to go that far he should be able to justify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if you do not include this in the Bill you are depriving your own nationals of rights that the other UPOV countries have. This is covered by UPOV in their definition of distinct.  On page 44, article 6, section (a) states:</P>
      <P>Whatever may be the origin, artificial or natural of the initial variation from which it has resulted the variety must be clearly distinguishable by one or more important characteristics from any other variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge at the time when protection is applied for.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say that the breeders shall benefit from the protection provided for in this convention when the following conditions are satisfied, and it sets out those conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is in respect of its origin.  The wild plant does not have an origin: it is extant already.  What the Minister has read applies to some new varieties developed from wild plants.  We would all accept that protection should be given to new varieties developed from and having their origin in wild plants but we object to giving protection to something that is already there before the discoverer or developer comes along, such as wild plants or plants already in use but not patented in respect of which the discoverer does no breeding.</P>

      <P>This leads to another aspect of the matter, that those who have not scientific qualifications find difficulty in knowing exactly the scope of some of these provisions and indeed of the convention. It is important that we know the terms of reference in dealing with this Bill.  Could the Minister explain the distinction or difference between the <Col N="462" /> various items mentioned under the definition of variety?  What is the distinction between a clone, a line, a hybrid and a genetic variant?  Could the Minister clarify that definition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the answer the Minister has given about the inclusion of wild plants in subsection (5).  The provision seems to go too far. The Minister says it is necessary to give the protection to Irish people that other people abroad have, presumably implying that it is not necessary within the terms of UPOV.  Nothing that he has read from the UPOV Convention so far proves that it is necessary to protect people who discover wild plants.  Is the Minister suggesting that people might discover wild plants here and want to patent them or that Irish people might discover wild plants abroad and want to patent them?  Is it that which makes this necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if you do not have it you can deprive your own nationals of a right that other UPOV members have. They certainly can patent those plants if they find them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best thing is to say that I intend to put down an amendment for Report Stage to remove this provision.  Perhaps between now and then the Minister will investigate the matter further.  I should like him to consider particularly the danger that this sort of provision might be used to pick up material in Third World countries, occurring in the wilds where people do not have the legal knowledge or the legal instruments to get a monopoly although they have been using these plants for years.  Irish people could avail of this section to get protection not only in Ireland but in all UPOV countries for that wild variety which really was not <Col N="463" /> new in anything beyond the legal sense determined by legislation.  In that way Irish companies could be involved in exploitation of people in the Third World.  I should like the Minister to investigate that to see if he could give us an assurance that such is not the case.  That would be our main consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister also to consider that it is highly unlikely, almost improbable, that any Irish person here would seek that kind of protection, that any person in this country would bring back a plant from New Guinea or anywhere in the Third World and seek protection here.  The likelihood is that it is the major multi-nationals who are gaining more and more control in the world of plant varieties and who are the people to whom we are gratuitously offering protection, a protection apparently which we do not even have to offer under the UPOV Convention.  I should strongly urge the Minister to look into that further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this allows the Minister to agree to conventions of all sorts, not just the UPOV Convention.  I wonder at the wisdom of giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister to adhere to any international convention or agreement for the protection of plant varieties or plant breeders' rights.  Would it not be more appropriate, if there is a new convention, to come back here with the legislation?  It would probably be a very brief Bill, considering that all the basic work has been done in this Bill, saying &ldquo;We further ratify and incorporate into our legislation the following provisions arising from the new convention&rdquo;. This would be preferable to giving the Minister this right by use of an order under subsection (5) to adhere to a convention. The US Senate guard very jealously their treaty-making power in the US <Col N="464" /> Constitution.  So far as the making of treaties is concerned here, we in the Dáil should protect our rights and not delegate them to any executive member to bring into our substantive law as well as simply to ratify the provisions of international treaties.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could make one point.  I do not accept personally a view which has been represented to me as held by some people concerned with the Third World, that rather than adhere to the UPOV Convention, which is a multi-national one, where we need varieties from some country and cannot get them because the people in that country will not let them in here because they will not have protection, we should enter into some sort of bilateral agreement with those countries to give that protection to them without getting involved in the entire mechanism of UPOV where people can come in and evade our legislation.  Whether it is in our interest that we should do so, it has been suggested that the Minister has powers under this legislation to enter into bilateral arrangements with individual countries rather than get into UPOV. Has the Minister considered this possibility?  Probably he is right to ratify UPOV, nonetheless people concerned about this other option should have an answer from him.</P>

      <P>Yes, the House can be assured that no treaties and so forth will be entered into lightly.  It would be impracticable to take up the time of the House on all such occasions.  The proposal would make implementation of the legislation increasingly restrictive. We have worked on this arrangement before when we did not have the legislation proposed here today.

      <P>The answer to my objection might be to change the procedure here whereby the orders may be made. At the moment if the Minister is proposing to adhere to a particular convention he is not required to have it discussed in the House under the Bill.  All he is required to do is lay the order before the House and, unless some Deputy decides to put down a motion to annul the order which contains the ratification and implementation of the treaty, it is never discussed. Perhaps the appropriate way of meeting this case which I am making, where we are entering into an international agreement, would be to amend section 26 to require that the orders must be approved positively by the House before they take effect.  I ask the Minister to consider that matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that every little order being made would not require this.  It might not be appropriate to have every order made under the Bill requiring this positive approval, but where we are entering into an international agreement&mdash;we will not be doing this very often and UPOV has been amended only once or twice&mdash;the orders we would be proposing to have approved in this way would not be frequent, perhaps one in ten years.  It would not be any harm to let the House affirmatively agree to them.  In giving occasion for debates in the House it would also provide an opportunity for Deputies to review this legislation and see how it has worked in practice and whether it has turned out as well as was hoped.</P>

But if it is a full-time job it would be more appropriate to appoint a qualified person through open competition. Where it is intended to hold an open competition it is usually specified in legislation that the post will be filled from an open competition.  I remember having a long argument in respect of the post of Director of Consumer Affairs and at that time Deputy O'Malley was pressing from these benches that the post be filled from an open competition.

      <P>This section is in a sense the nub of the Bill.  It not only gives the person who gets protection under the Bill the right to demand royalties from anyone who uses the variety but it goes much further.  It gives him exclusive rights to market it himself.  There is a strong case for saying this is going too far.</P>
      <P>I can understand that a person should be able to get some financial return for the tremendous financial investment put into developing the new variety.  The concept which allows a person simply to get royalties, but not to have the further right of saying that he alone shall have a monopoly for using it, is known as the inventor's certificate.  Under the inventor's certificate system, which is used in a number of countries, the inventor of a new plant variety or some mechanical contrivance is entitled to get royalties on any sales of the item, but he is not entitled to be the only person who can market the invention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I see, under this section the holder of the invention will have the exclusive right to produce the seeds in <Col N="471" /> question, or to sell, or offer for sale, or to export or import the material.  Even on paying generous royalties to the person in question, on one would have the right to sell, or offer for sale, or export the item unless he gets permission.  I can see very readily why it is necessary to have some provision so that the inventor can get some financial return for the development of the item.  I do not quite see why it is necessary to confer a total monopoly in respect of not only the royalties but also the use of the item.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past when somebody had the patent rights of a particularly good spray and one importer retained to himself the marketing of that spray, the price went out of all proportion. When an importer of sprays got a monopoly of a particular spray which was vital to the farming economy, he could charge the earth for it.  I see no justification for that situation arising here.  Some clever importer could be working hand in hand with a person who might be a plant breeder from overseas. He could get hold of the rights and because the variety of barley, or what have you, was capable of yielding that bit extra, he could charge the limit.</P>
      <P>This year some of us who are obliged to grow basic seeds find that we have to pay £450 per ton for seed as against £220, which would be the normal price. That is fair enough.  That is something we have to accept because of the difficulty in producing the seed at first.  If a person is growing basic seed, and probably does not get a whole lot more for his product, and is prepared to pay that amount to stay in a particular line of farming, he could be charged the earth if there were not that bit of competition to which Deputy Bruton referred.</P>

      <P>So far as I can see, the granting of exclusive protection is required under the UPOV Convention.  To that degree my criticisms are directed not solely at the Bill but perhaps at the terms of the convention which may go too far in granting protection.  At the same time, we are being asked as a <Col N="472" /> sovereign state to consider this for the first time and it is only right that we should ask that question.  I note from the relevant article of the UPOV Convention, Article 5, that the right which the breeder must be granted shall be the right that his prior authorisation will be required for production purposes of commercial marketing, offering for sale, or the marketing of the reproductive or vegetable propagating material.  It goes on to say that a member state may, if it wishes, in its law grant more extensive rights than those.</P>
      <P>The provisions in our legislation go somewhat beyond the provisions in the UPOV Convention in one respect.  Subsection (5) (c) provides that, in the case of a plant variety which is an ornamental plant variety, the prior authorisation of the holder of the right shall be necessary to propagate the variety in the course of commercially producing ornamental plants or cut flowers.  I wonder whether that prior authorisation is necessary.  I understand that right is not required in respect of other than ornamental plants and that people are entitled to propagate a variety without prior permission.  That may be so.  I am wondering why it is necessary to insert subsection (5) (c) as it does not seem to be contained in the UPOV Convention.</P>

      <P>Section 4 is a major section whose main provisions empower the controller to grant proprietary rights called plant breeders' rights in respect of any botanic species prescribed by regulations.  It is the intention, initially, to apply the Act to the principal agricultural crop species used in Ireland&mdash;wheat, oats, barley, rye, grass, potatoes, white clover&mdash;and to extend these species as far as possible over the years as required by the convention.</P>
      <P>There is a time limit on the rights granted.  Generally the duration of the rights is such as to be just about sufficient to give the breeder a fair and reasonable return for his work.  We know that some varieties have a relatively short life.  This is mainly what is involved here.</P>

      <P>We very much appreciate this.  The precise purpose of the Bill is that the breeder should get remuneration for his investment.  The problem I see is that he should not be allowed to deal with one customer, as it were, in a particular country.  If he decides, as has happened in the past in the case of sprays, to deal with one customer exclusively, an abuse can arise. That customer, in turn, can charge the limit.  If the breeder were obliged to supply the trade here, then one would have the obvious element of competition.</P>

      <P>The safeguard is the compulsory licence.  If the breeder abuses his privilege in any way, the controller has the option of issuing a compulsory licence and laying down the conditions. I do not think any plant breeder would like to see that happen.  It certainly would not be in his best interests. It is a very safe weapon to have.  If he is not fulfilling his obligations, the controller has this option of issuing the compulsory licence to someone else.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a few points on this crucial section.  In the granting of plant breeders' rights referred to in subsection (1), what is the position in regard to rights which have been granted in other countries to a particular variety?  When we set up a register here, will all the rights granted in other countries be automatically recognised here or will the breeders need to reapply here? Will anybody who wants to apply here to register a variety, perhaps a home breeder, be stopped from getting the protection of this legislation if there is a prior registration in any other country which is a signatory to the UPOV Convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <P>Does this indicate that there is some kind of international register?  Would an Irish breeder who developed a type of potato be stopped <Col N="474" /> from getting rights under this legislation if somebody in Holland had already registered that variety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to cover the possibility of piracy.  There does not seem to be any requirement under this Bill or under the UPOV Convention that somebody should prove that he or she developed that variety.  Say somebody in Ireland produced a special variety of potato, if somebody in Holland pirated that variety and registered it there, will the Irish breeder be stopped from registering it here and getting protection? I am raising an international question. Do we have to recognise all varieties which have been registered in other countries who are signatories to the UPOV Convention and who have ratified it and set up their own registers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer here is common knowledge.  If it is new as far as common knowledge is concerned, then it is a new variety and could be given rights, but if it is registered it cannot be given rights here.</P>

      <P>One of the many purposes of the Bill is to protect the genuine operator from the fly-by-night.  If the Bill does not do that, then we are wasting our time.  The major genuine Irish breeders are crying out for this Bill.  The Minister might let me know if this is correct.  I believe the genuine people in the business make known to the relevant agricultural authorities what they are doing. They tell their agricultural authorities the type of varieties they are using if they are introducing a new hybrid, and the various Departments of Agriculture are in close contact with each other on these matters.  As far as the genuine breeder is concerned, there is no danger of anybody stealing another person's seed potatoes and trying to persuade all and sundry that he produced them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was chairman of the Sugar Beet Growers Association we were taken on a visit to Sweden and freely shown their seeds.  We could have filled our pockets with seeds if we wanted to, for all the good that would have done.  I <Col N="476" /> believe there is a very strict code between reputable seed breeders.

      <P>We are trying to protect the genuine producers.  That is the purpose of this legislation.  At the moment we have certain rights under UPOV because they realise we are putting this legislation through the Houses and we have consulted with them.  We have certain rights but we have no firm control over what might happen to our breeders and this legislation is intended to give us that control.  We have no interest in the fly-by-nights.  Consultation has taken place on this subject with the other UPOV countries and we are merely trying to dovetail the legislation into the type of legislation in existence in those other countries and which they are allowing us to be party to until such time as we have our own legislation.</P>

      <P>What Deputy O'Keeffe seems to be concerned about is the type of situation in which an Irish person may be working on the development of a plant but where, by fair means or foul, somebody else manages to get a sample of that plant and rushes off to another country, say, South Africa, to have it registered.  Subsequently, if the Irish person who had been developing the plant, wished to have it registered in South Africa, would be not be prevented from doing so by reason of the fact that it had been registered already by somebody else?  Deputy Hegarty made the point about there being a kind of informal code of practice between these countries but there is the possibility that there will be people who will not adhere to any code of practice which does not have the force of law.  Would it be possible to provide that somebody who is developing a plant could apply after four or five years for protection by way of giving formal notice to the controller that the plant was in the process of development? Such procedure might prevent somebody else from getting ahead of him.  So far as I can ascertain from reading the Schedule the relevant constraint is previous commercialisation, that one cannot get protection for something which has been sold either in the State or in a country or territory other than the State.  I am sure somebody has thought of this point before.  We are not all that original but we should have answers, if possible, to the questions I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister is thinking about that I should like to refer back to the question I asked at the outset.  This was whether we should not have agreed simply to a system of inventors' certificates whereby all the inventor is entitled to are royalties and not necessarily the exclusive right to market the product, a <Col N="478" /> system which leads to abuse in the area of pricing.  If we are bound to ratify the convention we should ask simultaneously the Restrictive Practices Commission, under the 1972 Act, to investigate the operation of this legislation in order to ensure that the exclusive right granted under the legislation is not used in any case to charge higher prices for a product than would be charged if the exclusive right had not been granted.</P>
    <P>One of my regrets is that during my term as Parliamentary Secretary in the then Department of Industry and Commerce, I did not ask the Restrictive Practices Commission to examine the whole corpus of patent legislation in order to ascertain whether it was being used to charge prices greater than the prices which would be charged if there were not the monopoly, exclusive rights situation but merely a right-to-royalties situation. I would ask the Minister to right that situation now and to request the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out such an investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy Bruton are covered mainly in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of section 5 which provide that the application must satisfy the following conditions:</P>
      <P>(a)  that the applicant is the person who bred or discovered the plant variety to which the application relates, or the successor in title of such person, or a person to whom the right to make an application under this section as regards such plant variety has been duly assigned.</P>
      <P>(b)  that the plant variety to which the application relates satisfies each of the conditions contained in the First Schedule to this Act and is named in accordance with regulations under section 12 of this Act which are for the time being in force.</P>
      <P>In short, in order for a breeder to have his product registered in, say, South Africa, he would have to satisfy the controller that he himself had bred the plant.</P>

One is creating a monopoly situation and leaving the situation open.  We are specifying a minimum term of years for such a monopoly but not specifying any maximum term.  It seems dangerous to have the protection period so open-ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot fix a maximum period so easily because certain plant varieties will need different periods as applies at present in UPOV countries. It would not be safe for us to lay down any specified maximum period in the Bill.  When that is fixed by regulation I am sure each case will be dealt with on its merits as it arises.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister <Col N="481" /> about inventors' certificates, rather than exclusive rights, as a possibility and I should be obliged if he would deal with that matter.  I am aware that the UPOV Convention is based on the idea of exclusive rights and that we could not have inventors certificates and still adhere to that Convention but the Minister should tell us why it is necessary to go as far as giving the person who develops a plant the exclusive right to market it, sell it and not just have the right to royalties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurs to me that in respect of an application there should be some requirement on the applicant&mdash;perhaps I am missing it; it may be included in some of the Schedules&mdash;to produce evidence of the costings involved to him of developing a particular variety.  This would be of great relevance from a number of points of view.  It would be of relevance in the context of the length of the protection period which the controller should allow because, if the costing is very small, it would seem that a lengthy protection period would not be justified.  This is of particular relevance to the agricultural sector who, over a lengthy period, might be paying royalties to somebody who did not spend a whole lot on the development <Col N="483" /> of that particular variety. Therefore details of the costings would be a relevant factor which should be produced on application to the controller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure such figures can be furnished.  An even more important factor is that there be some discipline on the plant breeder, from the time the initial stock leaves his cereal station or whatever, to ensure that reputable people only be allowed grow the basic stock, and the second and third varieties of seed before it is propagated.  I wonder is the Minister satisfied that there is sufficient discipline.  I know the Department of Agriculture did tremendous work on that type of operation in the past.  So far, by and large&mdash;and I say this with some reservation&mdash;we have partially controlled the spread of wild oats in cases where there was a lot of laxity in the past, when UK seed in particular found its way into this country, probably again from fly-by-night plant breeders and when we found ourselves literally sowing wild oats, causing real problems on our farms, to the extent that some of these farmers have since been ruled out for all time as growers of seed at considerable loss to themselves.  One has only to visit the United Kingdom at present to see the problems they encounter with wild oats in their sugar beet crops and so on.  In the follow through from the plant breeder I wonder if we have sufficient safeguards to ensure that reputable people only be allowed to grow the seed for the eventual grower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the conditions the applicant must meet in order to get his rights.  It does not state that he must submit his costings.  It states merely that the variety must meet the requirements as to distinctness, novelty, uniformity and stability.  Those are the stipulations.  It would be very difficult to verify costings submitted by an applicant. In ordinary circumstances the controller would not be involved in setting the level of royalties unless the level of royalties was so high as to bring about <Col N="484" /> an application for a compulsory licence.</P>
      <P>Deputies will see the difficulties involved in trying to include costings in the conditions.  A plant breeder might be working on hundreds of different varieties and might get rights for one variety only, when it would very difficult for him to itemise the costing of that particular variety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Then on what basis would the controller exercise discretion in regard to the protection period?  There are minimum periods, as was clarified a moment ago.  The Minister may set a maximum period or periods.  The controller then will grant it either at the minimum or for some higher number of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the whole purpose of the Act is to provide protection, encouragement and return for plant breeders.  The question of costings must therefore be relevant, as to what period of time a breeder will have that protection and monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference here between what is being sought by Deputy O'Keeffe and by Deputy Hegarty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might interrupt the Minister, I am less concerned about the whole question of costings.  I fully appreciate the problem of the plant breeder who might very well produce 25 or 30 varieties that might prove abortive after three or four years on the ground.  I would be less concerned about that because that variety will have to stand its ground price-wise and yield-wise with a lot of other varieties and there would be no compulsion on anybody to grow the particular variety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect in all of this, which is not generally known, that once one produces a variety that is not the end of it; one must rejuvenate that variety every so often and revert to the variety markets; it is an on-going process.  I am growing one this year, one <Col N="485" /> that has come straight from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Scotland.  It is an on-going process to keep the variety fresh and vigorous.  I am concerned that the controller or Department be obliged to maintain discipline.  I would be afraid the plant breeder might be able to short-circuit the Department in any new legislation.  I should like to see the Department having the same control it has had down the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Hegarty is saying is correct because practically all agricultural crop seeds must be certified and therefore must meet certain standards laid down in EEC directives. Otherwise they cannot be marketed. Therefore we have and will have control.</P>

      <P>Just a point of information, this section relates to the details to be furnished by an applicant.  The applicant must satisfy the controller that the conditions set out in the First Schedule are satisfied.  Therefore, is it at this stage that we deal with the First Schedule, or do we treat that as a separate item?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the controller should have some way of monitoring royalties which are being charged in respect of varieties for which protection is being granted to prevent abuse and excessive charges.  Under the legislation it does not seem that there is any duty on the controller to monitor this.  I would ask the Minister to consider bringing in amending legislation to ensure that someone does keep an eye on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position here is that this is a commercial transaction and the controller would have no say in the setting of royalties unless the plant breeder was charging fees so high that he was completely out of bounds.  In that <Col N="486" /> even the controller has the option of issuing a compulsory licence or threatening to issue a compulsory licence.  That is the only safeguard he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The main safeguard is the one referred to by Deputy Hegarty, that a variety is going to be competing with other varieties and anyone who is charging too high a royalty will price himself out of the market.  It is possible that someone could develop something which was unique.  The question then of whether someone else could develop a competing product depends entirely on whether he could develop something based on the research already done by the first party but which still meets the criteria of being distinct within the terms of the Act.  There should be some mechanism for having an on-going look at this legislation to ensure that there are no monopoly profits being obtained by people over and above what is really just in the market place.  I would ask the Minister to consider some means such as I have suggested, to involve the Restrictive Practices Commission in an on-going investigation of the working of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can have that considered. I am sure that it would be in all our interests and in the interests of both breeders and the controllers and everybody else concerned to have a review of the situation from time to time. I do not know how this could be done. Perhaps when regulations are laid before the House it will give an opportunity to the House to discuss the situation and if any changes are necessary they can be made at that time or if there is anything happening that is not in accordance with our wishes or is not in the best interests of the country perhaps a change can be made at that stage.  It is something I would be sympathetic towards.</P>

If two cereal stations were operating along the same lines, the chances are that they would call whatever they produced by a different name anyway.  It would be very difficult for anybody to say at the end of the day that the product was identical even by looking at it.

      <P>This is going back to a point we raised earlier and which is appropriate to this Bill, because from what Deputy Hegarty says from his own experience in this field, it seems that what we thought was a remote possibility is more than a possibility and is something that would have to be safeguarded against and provided for.  The point that concerns me is that within this country there can be a priority organised and arranged.  But what is the situation in regard to plant varieties developed in other countries that have already been registered there or are in the course of being registered there and for which applications have been lodged or are being lodged?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of specific details I would be unable to state whether imported paints are being used in State-sponsored projects even though such paints may be produced more cheaply by Irish manufacturers and are available on the Irish market.  However, an important element in the three-year programme to promote the sale on the home market of Irish-made goods is the active involvement of all State bodies in promoting the objectives of the programme not only through their purchasing decisions but through their influence on individuals and on firms in their various spheres of activity.  Furthermore, comprehensive information on Irish manufacturers is readily available. Consequently, I would expect that where a suitable Irish product is available, this rather than a more expensive imported product, would be used.</P>

      <P>The most popular size of LPG cylinder is the 11.343 kilogram standard domestic cylinder marketed by Calor Gas (Ireland) Ltd.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism the present level of tourist bookings compared with the level at this date in 1979, 1978 and 1977 and the likely prospects for Irish tourism in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the term tourist bookings involves a wide number of providers of facilities and services such as carriers, tour operators, hotels, guesthouses, and so forth.  Statistics in respect of this variety of activities in the periods in question are not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is too early to begin to gauge and interpret trends for 1980, preliminary indications would suggest <Col N="493" /> that traffic from the Continent will be up on last year while British traffic will be about the same as last year.  The US market is more uncertain for a number of reasons including the overall political situation, currency variations and the recent introduction of credit restrictions in the US.  The expectation is that US travel to Europe generally may be down somewhat this year as a result and this would affect the level of Irish business.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are satisfied that the industry is capable of registering positive results this year but it will require the full commitment of the entire industry.  Bord Fáilte are monitoring the situation in consultation with the carriers and individual sectors of the industry and are adjusting their marketing tactics to the developing situation in the different markets.</P>

There are rumours of war and what one thinks may happen one month may not measure up in another month.  Bord Fáilte were never trying to promote Ireland harder.  Competition is very keen.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by Bord Fáilte that they have not had any indications that tourism is affected any differently than other sectors.  The accommodation sector is of course in receipt of specific Bord Fáilte grants for the construction and upgrading of hotel-guesthouse bedrooms as well as being able to avail of 100 per cent capital depreciation allowances, which constitute a particular benefit to the tourist accommodation sector.</P>
      <P>I do not, therefore, propose to take any action at present along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  However, I can mention for the information of the House that a NESC study on the implications of tourism for the economy is due to be published in the next couple of months.  This report may provide a basis for a general review of tourism policy including policy in regard to incentives for the accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>Traffic and parking by-laws are made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochana with the consent of the Minister for the Environment.  By-laws have been made down through the years and, at present, there are separate by-laws for 92 towns and cities.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is proposed to have a single set of by-laws for the whole of County Cork which, <i>inter alia,</i> will replace the existing by-laws for various places in the county, that it is hoped that those by-laws can be made within a short period and that it is envisaged that they will be followed by similar by-laws for other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, I understand that a development which has contributed to delaying the making of the County Cork by-laws is a High Court action challenging <Col N="498" /> the constitutionality of a provision in the existing Cork City by-laws, since the decision in that case could have a bearing on some provisions in the proposed County Cork by-laws.</P>

I do appreciate that there can be frustration, and more than frustration, if things are not getting off the ground as quickly as they could.  Unfortunately, the delay in getting this scheme under way is as a result of a court action taken by a person, within his rights of course, to contest the by-laws as they are at present.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement on the social impact of the increase in the numbers of special exemption orders under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, and if his attention has been drawn to widespread concern in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed by some persons about special exemption orders. However, as I have said on previous occasions, I cannot undertake to give, by way of a reply to partiamentary questions, my views on the merits or demerits of any particular legal provision on which a Deputy might decide to seek comment.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, I have received many proposals for the amendment of the intoxicating liquor laws which I am having examined. Because of the very complex nature of these laws, a detailed study will, of necessity, take quite some time.  If, as a result of this examination, I decide to recommend any changes in the licensing laws, an announcement will be made at the appropriate time.  I think I might say that any meaningful statement on the social impact of special exemption orders would amount to something in the nature of a sociological essay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister has no objection to sociological essays.  Could I ask him, in this review, if consideration has been given to various aspects of the relevant legislation?  Am I right in concluding that this particular element of the exemption orders is under consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy, the House and the general public that I am, indeed, very gravely concerned at the number of such exemption orders issued in the last year for which I have figures&mdash;1979.  In actual fact, there was an almost 100 per cent increase over the figure of five years before that.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from the chairman of Togher Community Association about the criminal activities of certain youths in the area.</P>
      <P>A Garda representative from the area attended a meeting of the association in January last, at which the situation in the area was discussed at length.  The Garda representative also suggested certain ways in which the residents themselves could help to alleviate the problem. Following the meeting, more patrols were concentrated in the troublesome area.  The policing needs of Togher are being kept under review and additional measures as may be necessary will be taken, having regard to the overall demands on manpower and resources.</P>

      <P>The association have published a document entitled &ldquo;Discussion paper on proposals by the association to combat crime in Ireland&rdquo;. The document was published as recently as 21 April and the proposal mentioned in the Deputy's question is only one of several that are contained in it.  I intend to give due consideration to the various proposals in the document but, without finally committing myself on the point, I think it is highly improbable that I would regard the appointment of a commission as a useful contribution to the objective of improving the organisation of the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will establish a police authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of a police authority that is separate from and independent of, on the one hand, the national police force itself and, on the other hand, the Government or the responsible Minister, is unknown in continental Europe and is clearly one <Col N="511" /> borrowed from Britain where the police structures are fundamentally different in that there is no national police force in Britain but regional police forces with local authority imvolvement.  Even in Britain, however, the police authority for the London Metropolitan Police is the Home Secretary.</P>
      <P>The concept of an independent police authority was extended to the North for obvious reasons connected with problems about the acceptability of the RUC among some sectors of the community.</P>
      <P>The setting up of such a police authority here was agreed to by the then Government in 1973 as part of the Sunningdale Agreement.  It is common knowledge that that provision was included solely because it was considered necessary that the agreement should have parallel provisions on matters of this kind as between the North and this State, as otherwise the agreement would have the appearance of being unbalanced. When, for reasons I need not go into, the Sunningdale Agreement ceased to have any relevance, the then Government did not proceed with the idea of a police authority, obviously believing that, outside the context of the agreement, it was not justified.</P>
      <P>The central issue involved is whether the Government of the day, or the Minister for Justice on their behalf, is or is not to have broad public accountability to the Dáil and to the electorate, for the Garda Síochána.  As far as I am concerned, there can be no question of the Government abdicating their responsibilities in this respect.  I repeat that any comparison with Britain is invalid, as their policing structure is based on regional forces with local authority involvement, and that our system here is similar to that operating throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must accept, as most other people have, that there is great disquiet in the Garda about outside interference.  By that I mean opinions being offered by the Minister's Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Opinions are being offered by the Minister's office and by the Department of Justice which are not always the opinions held by the police force.  Would it not be in the interests of all concerned to take the Garda out of the realm of politics and leave them the right to run themselves, with greater autonomy and control over their own affairs? They are the professional people engaged in combating crime, and should the Minister not acknowledge this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the answer to the supplementary is contained in the reply to the question tabled by Deputy Horgan.  The basic issue here is whether the Government, or the Minister for Justice on their behalf, is to have public accountability to the Oireachtas or whether it should be left to the Garda Síochána.  I do not attach any great relevance to the remainder of the Deputy's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that, apart from anything that may arise from the next question, there has been a long history of tension between the Garda and the Department of Justice because the Garda do not have the degree of autonomy in practice which they must have in theory, without constant interference in a detailed manner from the Department of Justice, which is undermining the authority of the Garda Commissioner?  It is a problem of long standing but the evidence is that it has become more acute and has become a source of difficulty to police morale in recent times.  Is this not a strong argument for the establishment of a police authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is tension, as described by Deputy FitzGerald, between the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.  They both have an important role to play.  I at all times, like my predecessors in the Department of Justice, have been very careful to see that the Department of <Col N="513" /> Justice will act on behalf of the Minister for Justice and the Government, and the functions of the Department are laid down statutorily.  It is easy to make accusations of interference by a Department or a Minister, but the Minister for Justice has a role as far as the Garda are concerned, and that role is being exercised according to statutorily defined practice, and no more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is evidence on the record, going back to the Conroy Commission, of the degree of detailed interference. For instance, the Commissioner could not even determine the design of a garda overcoat without first of all having it cleared with the Department. That has been established publicly by the Conroy Commission.  That is the kind of detailed interference I have been talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I take responsibility.  The Secretary of the Department of Justice is also the Accounting Officer to the Comptroller and Auditor General for any or all moneys spent under that Vote.  The Garda Síochána Vote is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, and therefore the secretary is the person responsible for accounting to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We could discuss this&mdash;we are not arguing&mdash;for a long time back and forth.  There is the question of the cost of whatever may be produced at the time.  I am not making excuses but the cost factor is the responsibility of the Government and there must be accountability for the Garda Síochána Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of accountability as between the Minister, the Department and the Garda Síochána <Col N="514" /> may be a high principle more attached to tradition than to the actual position, but will the Minister not accept that in modern conditions the Garda need to have complete control over themselves if they are to be successful in their efforts to combat crime?  Will the Minister not agree that his emphasis is being directed more at retaining traditions than at helping the Garda to fight crime?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not even hear it&mdash;the Deputy struck fresh air.  There is not interference with the Garda doing their police work, which is at all times left to the Garda.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

If any Deputy wishes to study the Order Papers, perhaps not for this Dáil, he will see how much the Minister for Justice is responsible and accountable for to the House as far as the Garda and policing are concerned.  The Deputy would do well to remember that.  It was not I who <Col N="515" /> started it.  I just mentioned this as something that Deputies would do well to remember.  I am quite satisfied that it is in the national interest that the responsibility of the Garda Síochána should be directly to the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>There is another matter I should like to raise by way of supplementary in relation to this.  The Minister in his public statements on this matter has seemed to imply that the political allegations are confined to cases where gardaí made representations through public representatives or others on behalf of&mdash;whatever it might be, transfers or promotions&mdash;I do not know. He seemed to go out of his way to suggest that these were the only allegations <Col N="517" /> made.  Is he aware that there is public concern on other aspects of alleged political interference involving suggestions that there may have been attempts to ensure that certain areas were not policed in the interests of particular parties or alternatively that cases were not proceeded with through pressure being put on the Garda Síochána.  The Minister's own statements so far have not implied recognition that there is concern on these issues as well as on the particular question to which he addressed himself of representations made on behalf of individual gardaí or by them to or through public representatives.</P>

      <P>Again in the interests of clarity, I should like to assure the House and the Deputy that I did not have a copy of the speech made by the president of the association at the opening of the conference that morning.  I had only what other Members here had, what was said in the evening papers and what was said in those headlines.  As I said in reply to the question, quite a number of statements were made.  As regards the two that Deputy FitzGerald has now selected for supplementary question, the matter of the great concern that should and would be felt by any sector of the community at the lack of policing in any particular area, especially in regard to border areas&mdash;that is probably what the Deputy is referring to; am I right in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to the recent report that St. Patrick's Institution, Dublin is overcrowded, and, if so, the action he intends to take on the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The release of offenders from the prisons and places of detention prior to their normal release dates is not a new phenomenon.  It is an accepted fact that many offenders have a better chance of keeping out of conflict with the law on their return to the community if they have spent the later part of their sentence on temporary release under the supervision of a welfare officer.  With this in mind, but of course with due regard to the wider public interest as well, an extensive scheme of temporary release is operated in all our institutions.  Almost <Col N="519" /> all long-term prisoners benefit from this with reasonably good results.</P>
    <P>That apart, the practice has been not to permit prisons and places of detention to become so crowded as to create serious difficulties for staff and inmates. Thus, in order to maintain the population of St. Patrick's Institution at a manageable level, it has been necessary from time to time, in addition to the normal practice of releasing offenders under the supervision of the welfare service, to release some short-term offenders without supervision.  These offenders have been chosen with due regard to a number of factors including the safety of the general public.  This procedure has been necessary at various times over the years, certainly at various times since the early seventies.</P>
    <P>The newspaper report of 16 April 1980, however, is inaccurate.  The report refers specifically to the two-week period prior to the date of the report and says that 12 offenders from one North Dublin suburb were released prematurely in that period.  In fact no young offender was released without supervision from St. Patricks in the period in question.</P>
    <P>Lest the reference was intended to be to a two-month period I think I might mention that in the period 1 February to 1 April 1980, 43 offenders were released without supervision prior to their normal release dates.  Of these, 12 were from the north side of Dublin City, 19 from the south side of Dublin City and the remainder were from widely scattered country areas.  Of the offenders from the north city area, three came from each of two very large suburban areas.  The remainder were from different suburban areas.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in the period referred to no offender was released under supervision before the normal end of his sentence who would not have been released even if there had been no accommodation difficulties.</P>
    <P>The alternatives to early release are doubling-up in cells or building new prisons.  Doubling-up is common in many countries since the steep growth in crime and the length of time it takes to <Col N="520" /> expand prison accommodation present major problems internationally.  There, are, however, problems about doubling-up which make it something to be avoided for as long as we can.  Some of them are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Single cells were designed to accommodate one person and it is undesirable to force two people to share the restricted space for more than a night or two;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Most prisoners are helped by having a certain amount of privacy and accommodation singly in cells meets this need;</P>
    <P>(iii)  Doubling-up obviously is designed to allow for an increase in the population of a prison and if it is adopted to any significant extent the sheer weight of numbers with attendant clamour, and demands on basic facilities, can make management and control very difficult; the burden falls mainly on the custodial staff;</P>
    <P>(iv)  Extra numbers strain facilities&mdash;visiting, work, recreation, education, work/training and also strain the welfare and medical services.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>All this being said it is of course possible that, at some stage, we will have to follow the example of some other countries and accommodate more offenders than our institutions are intended to hold.  The only real answer to the problem of the increase in the number of persons being committed to custody by the courts is the provision of additional prisons or places of detention.  This, of course, is both very costly and slow.  It is a long-term solution which does not give any immediate relief.  Nevertheless, Deputies by now are well aware that I have accepted this challenge and have decided to proceed with the provision of some new institutions, among them two new places of detention to replace St. Patricks which between them will cater for over 200 young offenders.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 23 inclusive together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Third Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons was presented <Col N="523" /> in November 1978 and was published in January 1980.  It contains wide-ranging proposals which, if implemented, would involve very substantial changes in law and practice and would have serious financial implications.</P>
    <P>The report is available in the Library and may be purchased from the Government Publications Office.  I might point out that so far the only observations received in my Department have been from other Departments and from some members of the judiciary who were specifically consulted.</P>
    <P>I would welcome any comments that the Deputy, any Deputy or anyone, may wish to make in regard to the report and the draft Bill which is attached to it but I would like to have his considered views in writing.  This is not a matter on which it would be right to ask the Government to take decisions without as full an examination as possible of all the implications of the proposals including the financial implications.</P>
    <P>Currently, new high security custodial accommodation on lands adjoining Portlaoise Prison is being planned and consideration is being given to the possibility of including accommodation in this new development which, with proper staffing, could appropriately be designated as a special unit, as envisaged in the report, for persons with violent personality disorders. The professional advice available to me is to the effect that violent personality disorders which are described as psychopathic or sociopathic are not known to be susceptible to psychiatric treatment.</P>
    <P>The report also envisages that offenders found to be suffering from mental disorder will be treated in psychiatric centres designated for the purpose by the Minister for Health.</P>

A formal announcement was made by me on the plans of the Government and the Department of Justice for two centres which are being built out on the Wheatfield <Col N="525" /> Farm.  As the Deputy knows, a prison to accommodate up to 60 women and a centre for 120 male juveniles are being built.  These are the buildings.  As the Deputy probably knows, I had a long meeting, three-and-a-half to four hours, with the residents from the area in the month of January last.  I explained to them what I was doing, what I had to do and I asked them to convey to those whom they represented the points of view offered by me.  I know for certain that during the course of that meeting I did everything that a person could humanly possibly do to allay genuine but mistaken fears that they had with regard to what is going ahead in that area.  I felt that I had got through to the deputation and explained everything in great detail to them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to refer to the arrangements for the treatment of persons in custody who may be suffering from mental illness.</P>
      <P>If such a person requires in-patient psychiatric treatment he is transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, or to another mental hospital to receive it.  Some persons in custody require psychiatric attention short of in-patient hospital treatment, and this is provided by visiting consultant psychiatrists. Visiting psychiatrists have sessions in the larger institutions on a regular basis and, in the smaller ones as required.</P>
      <P>It is part of the duty of prison officers to observe the behaviour of persons in custody and to bring to the notice of the governor or medical officer any abnormal behaviour in a prisoner.  Prison officers are briefed during their induction training course on the importance of close observation to identify behaviour which may call for attention.  The briefing is provided by the training officers with the assistance, normally, of a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small number of prison officers, called hospital orderlies, are given the special task of caring for prisoners who are unwell.  As far as possible, prison officers with previous training or experience <Col N="527" /> in general or psychiatric nursing are appointed as hospital orderlies. The Eastern Health Board conducted a special briefing course in 1976 for a number of prison hospital orderlies designed to make them more aware of general medical and psychiatric problems they were likely to encounter in a prison setting.  It is planned to request the Eastern Health Board to repeat the course for a number of new entrants to the hospital orderly corps.</P>

One matter specifically mentioned in that reply was projected legislation relating to the jurisdiction of various courts which, of course, would be relevant to any legal proceedings arising from marital disputes or breakdown.</P>
      <P>As regards nullity, which involves a finding by the Court that what appeared to be a marriage never existed, I would refer to the Minister's reply of 17 July last to a Question by Deputy O'Keeffe, (column 2592), and to the additional comments that he made in reply to supplementary questions, including one by Deputy Keating.  In the course of those comments, he specifically pointed out that the issues involved in relation to nullity had been referred to the Law Reform Commission precisely because they had proved to be so complex that Deputy Kelly, when Attorney General, decided that this was necessary, a decision endorsed by the present Attorney General on the change of Government.</P>
      <P>In the non-legislative field, the Minister recently announced the introduction of a civil legal aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> These are intended to be no more than a few specific comments and of course they are all on the record of the House already.  The general subject of marriage breakdown, both as to its causes and its consequences, is clearly far too complex a matter to be dealt with, even at the most superficial level, at Question Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if cases brought under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, will be excluded under the new civil legal aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention, speaking in general terms, is that cases under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, should be eligible for consideration under the civil legal aid scheme on the same basis as other cases.  If what the Deputy is referring to is the exclusion from the scheme of disputes concerning rights and interests over land, I can say that the exclusion was not intended to relate to family home cases and if the Legal Aid Board are in any difficulty on that score, which I have no reason to anticipate, the matter can be cleared up readily and without difficulty.</P>
      <P>This does not mean that every possible type of action that could arise under the 1976 Act must qualify.  It may be, for instance, that an application to a court for permission to sell a house without the consent of a spouse would be considered by the Board to be a type of action that is excluded under the scheme as a conveyancing matter.  Until such time as the board have fully considered such a case, I would not wish to express any view beyond saying that I am not at present satisfied that any change should be made to provide that it is covered.  On the other hand, there should be no question about the right of the spouse whose interests are being challenged by such an application to be given legal aid, if otherwise eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In brief, therefore, cases under the Act will, generally speaking, be covered but there may be some that will not or ought not to be.  If it transpires that there are some marginal type cases that ought to <Col N="532" /> be covered, and which the board decide are not covered by the scheme as it stands, the board will no doubt bring the matter to my attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fairly widespread reservations which have already been expressed about some exclusions from this scheme, surely the least that could be expected now is that the general applicability of the scheme to the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, would be supported by clear criteria as to what would be appropriate and what would not be appropriate for civil legal aid.  In other words, rather than waiting to see how it works&mdash;which is what I assume the Minister's reply intended&mdash;would the Minister state, not necessarily today or now but for the benefit of everybody, precisely what kind of actions would be entitled to such legal aid, instead of expressing a general hope that most actions would be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the job of the board to implement the scheme primarily and, in the course of that, to advise?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister informed the House on 27 March, at column 928 of the Official Report, that he expected to be introducing fairly shortly, and certainly before the end of the year, a Bill dealing with the jurisdiction of the various courts.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as the second of these questions relates to the protection of the occupiers of rented accommodation other than those to whom the relevant legislation has applied down the years, the position is as the Minister indicated in reply to a Dáil question on 13 November last.  On that occasion he said that the Minister for the Environment expected shortly to be in a position to make a submission to the Government in regard to the várious issues arising in relation to private rented accommodation including the working of the Rent Restrictions Acts, 1960 and 1967.  I am not in a position to add anything to that statement at this stage and it may be that any further statement in that regard will be made by the Minister for the Environment rather than by me.</P>
      <P>In so far as the second question relates to accommodation which has been the subject of statutory control, it covers the same ground as the question asked by Deputy O'Brien.  The position in this regard is, as Deputies are aware, that the High Court recently decided that certain provisions of the Rent Restrictions Acts are unconstitutional.  I understand that the question of an appeal to the Supreme Court is under consideration. In the circumstances, I cannot make any further statement in the matter except to say that Deputies will no doubt appreciate that, when the question of the constitutionality of an Act of the Oireachtas is involved in this way, it would clearly be inappropriate to discuss the question of amending legislation until such time as a final judgment&mdash;be that a High Court judgment or a Supreme Court judgment on appeal&mdash;has become available and has been fully considered.</P>

    <P>Following established practice a comprehensive leaflet has been prepared giving details of all allowances, deductions, reliefs and rates of tax for 1980-81 and is being printed.  Supplies are expected next month.  This leaflet will be available on request at all tax offices.  The customary <Col N="537" /> note drawing attention to its availability will appear on the revised notices of tax-free allowances for 1980-81, the issue of which will commence during next month.  It is felt that these arrangements provide sufficient sources of information to ensure that taxpayers will be fully aware of their entitlement to relief.</P>

      <P>The rates of return to the investor and the conditions governing savings certificates, national instalment saving and the Post Office savings bank are kept under review in the light of changes in interest rates generally.  As I announced in my budget statement, the rates of interest in the Post Office savings bank and the trustee savings banks were increased by 1 per cent in March. Also the maximum amounts which a person may invest in savings certificates and in the national instalment saving schemes were doubled.  The effect of the recent increases in the associated banks' interest rates on small savings is being examined.</P>

The improvement of bog roads is already covered by the local improvements scheme and, in addition, <Col N="538" /> the Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment have approved a grant of £600,000 from the employment gurantee fund for this purpose.

As the Deputy has implied, the matter is one in the first instance for the local authorities and, of course, for the Department of the Environment in respect of which I understand that about £2 million is being provided in 1980.

      <P>The Minister tells us that money is available to the local authorities by way of the local improvements scheme.  Would the Minister accept that the savage cut-back in these funds this year render it impossible for local authorities to make any money available for the development of bog roads?

      <P>I do not accept that there have been cut-backs of the nature suggested by the Deputy.  I would accept, though, that there have been curbs on the growth of public expenditure.  If one wishes to think in terms of cut-backs one must think of them in the context of what has happened in the past number of years.  The allocations this year do not rank as cut-backs especially when one thinks of those which were made, say, about four years ago.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The pay elements of the national understanding have been implemented in full by the Government.  As regards the non-pay elements, some of the terms of the understanding are in specific form and the extent of progress in implementing them can be established fairly readily.  Others, in the words of the understanding, &ldquo;include statements of the board objectives to be pursued over a period of years and the specific steps to be taken during the coming months as the first phase of the longer-term programme&rdquo;.  As far as such broad objectives are concerned, it would be too soon at this stage to speak of their being fulfilled or not fulfilled.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate a table for inclusion in the Official Report showing the commitments made by the Government in the understanding with a note on each commitment giving the up-to-date position. It is the Government's intention to meet their commitments under the national understanding.  It is to be borne in mind in this connection that the success of the understanding depends on parallel contributions from all three parties involved.</P>

      <P>In 1978, the Department of Economic Planning and Development commissioned the Department of Town and County Planning, Queen's University, Belfast, to carry out a study of small towns and villages in County Roscommon and to produce recommendations to assist the development process.  The results of the study have been made available to the agencies with statutory responsibility for planning and development in County Roscommon.

      <P>For the information of the House I should like to state that within the last week I attended meetings of the Finance Ministers of the EEC and of the IMF and in each case the represented countries, individually and collectively, acknowledged that it was not possible to forecast the inflation rate over the next six or 12 months.  If the collective wisdom of the House demands that we should be able to do what the international experts indicate we cannot do that is where the clash occurs between this House and those experts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

It is a matter which is there to indicate what the trends are and if trends of this nature continue it may be a certain figure.

      <P>The Government are already providing significant exchange risk cover for industry through the ICC and the ACC.  As I indicated in the House on Wednesday, 16 April, I am not prepared to go further and provide what would be, in effect, a subsidy.  Any such arrangement would lead to demands for similar treatment by agriculture, tourism, and other sectors of importance to the economy, so that the application of the scheme would become generalised.  The Exchequer is not in a position to entertain such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out also that under a general arrangement there would be no assurance that projects qualifying for cover would be economically worth-while. Under the schemes operated by <Col N="556" /> the ICC and the ACC, to which I have referred already, the process of evaluation and follow-up gives some prospect that the benefits of foreign borrowing and State exchange risk cover will go to projects likely to yield a lasting return in terms of output, employment and impact on the balance of payments.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that all Deputies have received representations from trade unionists employed in certain factories, and the CII, in relation to this proposal?  The CII have repeatedly called for this type of proposal which, obviously, has the support of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  Will the Minister indicate if there will be a change in Government policy?  If so is it not reasonable to assume from what has been published that there is conflict within the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has put his views on the record of the House.  If the Deputy refers to the contribution of that Minister during the course of the debate on interest rates here he will find that it is different from the proposals that are referred to and the proposals of the CII.  Therefore, it is incorrect to say that those proposals have his support.</P>

      <P>A survey of the portion of the Erne catchment situated entirely within the State was carried out between 1958 and 1961.

      <P>As has been widely reported already the immediate cause of the temporary suspension of operations on this project by Alumina Contractors Limited was an unofficial strike, by 47 steel fixers, which began on Tuesday last.  This unofficial strike was supported by other workers on the site.  As the main body of workers refused to pass the pickets work came to a complete standstill.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the situation, posing as it does grave dangers for the country, the whole of the trade union movement and the workers themselves. As I stated yesterday I propose to meet the company and officers of the ICTU at the earliest possible opportunity to establish the full facts involved in the dispute.  I would hope that the parties directly concerned will immediately consider what actions they can undertake to achieve an early settlement of the various issues which have led to the present difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will be doing that.  I have already conveyed some of that.  The Deputy makes a very valid point when he refers to the parties involved in the dispute.  It is obvious from Deputy Cluskey's comments in this House this morning that he shares my concern about the sensitivity and about the delicacy of the situation.  But one must also ask the question as to whether further debate on this matter at this time in this House is helpful.  I have no doubt that all parties in this House share the concern about the serious consequences that could arise.</P>
      <P>Particular attention has been given to this site because of its magnitude by our standards.  The approximate work force at the moment numbers about 1,500. There are about 10 different contracting firms.  There are particular working methods, work technologies.  There are bonus payments and there are site allowances.  These all make it a fairly difficult and complicated site.  Conscious of that, on a request from me, the Labour Court provided the services of a special person to keep in touch with all the developments on the site and this has been going on and will continue.  In addition the trade union movement, also conscious of the necessity for such, have created a full-time presence on the site from Government bodies, from congress and from some of the affiliated unions. These are steps that have been taken with a consciousness of the problems. We must be aware that what led to this problem was an unofficial stoppage and one might ask why this did not come to notice earlier.  This is something that we must all be concerned about for the sake of the parties involved as well as the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in a written reply to a question on 6 December 1979, Article 7 of the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states <Col N="641" /> concerning the lead content of petrol provides that petrol with a lead content not exceeding 0.64 grammes per litre may be placed on the market in Ireland for a period of five years from 1 January 1981, whereas in the other member states the maximum permitted lead content of petrol placed on the market from 1 January 1981 will be 0.40 grammes per litre.  The derogation in favour of Ireland was sought because the large investment which would have been required to enable the Whitegate refinery to produce petrol with a lead content conforming with the directive would have placed the continued operation of the refinery in jeopardy.  In addition, imports of crude oil would have had to be increased to produce petrol with a lower lead content and there would also be an increase in petrol consumption, estimated at 10 per cent.  The petrol refined at Whitegate represented about 55 per cent of the total consumption of petrol in Ireland in 1978.  The remaining 45 per cent was imported from the other member states which are obliged to comply fully with the directive.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied as a result of the monitoring of levels of atmosphere lead at three stations in the Dublin area that the derogation which Ireland obtained from the terms of the directive will not result in levels of atmospheric lead above the two microgram per cubic metre level proposed in the draft EEC directive on air quality standards for lead which is accepted as a level below which human health and the environment are not adversely affected.</P>
      <P>Levels of atmospheric lead are kept under continuous review by my Department in association with Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>Given the vital importance of energy, the question of the restoration of the North-South electricity interconnector has been frequently discussed in the context of the North-South discussions which take place on economic co-operation. Despite several attempts at its restoration the interconnector has now been out of commission since 1975 when it was maliciously damaged by an explosion. <Col N="644" /> Those who are responsible for this action should know that the interconnector is of significant mutual benefit North and South.  Putting it out of commission results in a serious loss to the electricity utilities North and South by denying them increased efficiency and greater capability in ensuring continuity in supply.</P>
      <P>In view of the continuing and growing importance of the interconnector for both here and Northern Ireland steps had been put in hands in the last few months to restore the link.  I have been dismayed to learn that recently electricity workers involved in the restoration of the interconnector on the northern side of the Border have been subjected to intimidation and it has been suggested that if they continued with the work their lives would be in peril.  I understand that the workforce on the ground were physically threatened by the IRA on 23 March 1980 and Deputies will be aware of further references by spokesmen for the IRA over the Easter weekend to their determination to stop the electricity board in Northern Ireland from restoring the interconnector. I condemn this intimidation and I hope it will not jeopardise the installation of the interconnector which is of significant mutual benefit North and South and which the authorities in both Dublin and Belfast have agreed should be restored at the earliest possible opportunity, and maintained thereafter.</P>
