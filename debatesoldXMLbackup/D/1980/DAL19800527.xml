      <P>When I contacted one of the Departments last week I was told by an official that he was politely reminded that any inquiries in future from Deputies would have to go to and through the Minister's office.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what the Deputy is referring to but there is no Government directive.  Each Minister is responsible for his own Department for replying to representations and for the manner in which representations to his Department are dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for each Minister to decide how such things should be dealt with in the confines of their own Departments.  It would be my general desire that the normal established procedure should be adhered to.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I respectfully suggest that the Taoiseach check up on this matter.  I am confident he will find that the position <Col N="647" /> is as I have outlined, particularly since the additional Ministers of State were appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like an assurance from the Taoiseach that when I telephone or send a letter personally to a civil servant who is in charge of a section or a deputy head of a Department, or the Secretary of a Department, that official will reply to me.  I want an assurance that I will have freedom to contact Departments without being told that my inquiries and representations in future must go through the Minister's office. The officials may not have been given a directive in this regard but they have been politely reminded that this is the proper thing to do from now on.  Will the Taoiseach make the Government's position clear on this point?</P>

The question is addressed to me and I am telling the House that as far as my Department is concerned the procedure which has always existed there will be adhered to. If the Deputy wishes to raise this matter with other Ministers I suggest that he table a question to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual refit of the <i>Lough Beltra</i> is more extensive this year, so that it will commence operations rather later than has hitherto been the case.  Some unforeseen mechanical problems have also delayed further the vessel's commissioning.  It is hoped that it will be fully operational in June.</P>
      <P>It is planned to undertake surveys on the structure of coastal marine sediments, on the effects of sea dumping on the environment, on the interaction between the environment and those marine species which are the basis of food chains and on the determination of the best site for deploying a meteorological and oceanographic buoy.</P>

There have been some delays in different parts of the country because some solicitors were slow in submitting bills or claims.

      <P>There are no grants available from my Department to householders for energy conservation in existing houses.  However, obligatory standards of insulation are laid down for <Col N="667" /> new grant-aided houses.  The latest information to hand in my Department on the forms of assistance available in other EEC countries is that grants for retrofitting as an energy saving measure in dwellings are available in Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  Incentives in the form of tax credits are also given in Denmark and Germany and in the form of subsidies in Belgium.  Information is not available in my Department as to the method by which these aids are allocated, except in the case of the United Kingdom where the payment of grants is governed by the provisions of the Home Insulation Act, 1978, under which local authorities may make grants towards the cost of the insulation of roof space and of the water supply in existing dwellings.  The maximum grant is limited to 66 per cent of the cost of the work or £50, whichever is the lesser amount, and expenditure incurred by local authorities is reimbursed by the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented number of applications for house improvement and solid fuel grants received subsequent to the announcement on 21 January 1980 of the termination of these grants created an abnormal work-load in addition to the very large number of new house, solid fuel and house improvement applications already being processed at that time.  The acknowledgement, recording, indexing and filing of these new applications resulted in delays in the processing of all applications, including the making of payments.</P>
      <P>Payments of grants are made after inspection has established that work has been satisfactorily completed and payment is in order.  Every effort is being made to speed up inspections but in view of the number of applications on hands, some delay in the inspection of work and payment of grants is unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept there is bound to be a certain amount of delay but we were anxious to know the extent of the delay and the consequent stress on many applicants who were forced to go to the banks for bridging loans at very high interest rates.  Will the Minister undertake to ensure that these grants will be paid forthwith, or is it the position that there is no money in the Department to pay them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very satisfactory.  Is the Minister aware that when Deputies or public representatives make inquiries about grants they are told by the Department that the file in question is with the inspector and in many instances the file seems to remain with him for a long time?  Have the Department any redress in a case like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases there is delay and that is mainly due to the fact that when the inspector calls there is nobody in the house.  I have asked that, where requested, the inspector will send a card to the owner of the house stating that he will inspect the house on a certain date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>I am happy to leave it until later.  During the Second Stage debate various observations were made, particularly in relation to this section, about the proportion of the members of the board who will be direct Government or ministerial appointees.  I accepted the argument in principle that as it is a national institute there should be a substantial proportion and perhaps even a majority, although I am not necessarily holding that view, who would be direct ministerial and Government appointees. In view of the fact that 15 of the 25 members of the board are to be direct Government appointees would the Minister not undertake, between now and Report Stage, to have a look at the rather heavy representation he is allocating to himself to see whether or not the mathematics might be adjusted silghtly in an attempt to give a more reasonable voice to local community representation?</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins said he wanted to protest at the structure of the governing body.  Any fair-minded person, having a look at the range and the interests covered in section 5, subsections (4) and (5), would agree that the whole area with which a National Institute for Higher Education are involved is covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan mentioned the preponderance of ministerial appointees and asked if I would have a look on Repport Stage at the possibility of reallocating the members.  This par-ticular section on the governing body was given very deep thought and consideration. The numbers allocated to the individual interests were discussed and changed a number of times.  I believe that <Col N="732" /> the blend, as incorporated in section 5, is good and sound and one which will stand up to examination.  There is no area which would feel neglected.  I would like to recommend to the House adherence to the structure outlined in section 5.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3), lines 27 and 28, to delete &ldquo;unless the Governing Body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6 deals with the functions of the governing body.  My amendment relates to that.  I believe that where a committee are established by the governing body under the section there is an obligation on the governing body to take full responsibility for the work, deliberations and decisions of any such committee. Subsection (3) says: &ldquo;The acts of a committee established under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the Governing Body unless the Governing Body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation.&rdquo;  It is unwise in principle and also legally for the institute to have such a provision in this Bill.  I believe it would be better in principle and legally if all the work, deliberations and decisions of the committees appointed by the Governing body were subject to confirmation by the Governing body. That would remove the possibility of something illegal being done without the governing body being able to rectify it or be in a position to see that something was amiss.  That is the reason why I asked for the deletion of the words &ldquo;unless the Governing Body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation&rdquo;. In principle it would be good that the deliberations of all such committees would be subject to confirmation by the governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, the section provides that the governing body will be the controlling authority of the institute, <Col N="733" /> having full authority in the institute and managing the affairs of the institute.  The point made by Deputy Collins is that the governing body should not have the power to dispense with the necessity of confirmation of the acts of the sub-committee. Inherent in that amendment is a restriction on the powers of the governing body but the section is very explicit on that point, that is, that they shall have the full authority in the national institute.  There is no danger to the governing body, since they have the power, if they so wish, to dispense or not to dispense with the necessity of confirmation as they wish.  In other words, any committee or sub-committee that will be set up will have to report back and get sanction and so on from the governing body if the governing body so decide. There will not be any other body having the same knowledge of their own committees.</P>
      <P>Their having this power will free the governing body to a certain extent from dealing with much of the trivia that they would have to deal with if we accepted the Deputy's amendment.  It is presumed that the committees established by the governing body will be responsible committees. Consequently, we would expect their activities to be in accordance with what the governing body consider they should be but if the governing body so decide, the Committees should be at liberty not to have to report back.  The powers in the Bill are such as to enable the governing body freedom to deal with committees and this is power that we can repose in them with confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be misinterpreted.  Of course I have full confidence in the institute and in the governing body but I am merely saying that if the governing body dispense with the need to confirm actions of a committee, an unusual situation might arise.  A committee might do something that would be in conflict with the legislation, perhaps something that would not be legal, and for that reason I am suggesting that there be the need always for the committees to report back to the governing body and for the governing body to confirm <Col N="734" /> the committee's activities.  I am not pursuing the matter as a political point. It is not at all political.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I should like to discuss the question of the management and control of the affairs and property of the institute.  Subsection (1) of the section provides that the Governing body shall manage and con-trol all the affairs and property of the institute. In this context I would refer back to section 4, subsection (1) which was amended by the Minister to provide for the approval of the Minister in relation to buying, acquiring, maintaining, managing, administering and investing all the property, money and assets of the institute.  Having regard to the general responsibility of the institute as provided for in subsection (1) of section 6, that provision in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 4 is very restrictive.  If the institute buy property they must maintain and manage that property.  Leaving aside major questions of expansion or extension or of matters that would require ministerial sanction or indeed sanction through the HEA, by and large the question of the day-to-day managing and maintenance of property should be left to the good sense of the members of the governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unnecessary to have such a restriction included because it would mean that the Minister would have to approve of all matters relating to maintenance and general administration of the property concerned.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 4, as amended with a view to changing the words &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo;, to some such formula as, &ldquo;subject to the general guidance of the Minister or to conditions that may be laid down by him from time to time, the governing body shall manage and maintain their property.&rdquo;  That would be the proper approach to the matter.  It is a <Col N="735" /> technical approach but the need for approval of the Minister in respect of the ordinary maintenance and management of the property is unnecessary in the context of a higher education institute. Indeed, we might omit paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 4 and allow subsection (1) of section 6 to be the controlling provision in relation to the management and maintenance of the institute's property.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer back to paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 4 and to point out that the very important words, &ldquo;after consultation with an tÚdarás um Ard Oideachais&rdquo; are included there to indicate the kind of approval that is in mind.  For example, if the university are developing an engineering school, an túdarás would do a great deal of the assessment of actual physical areas and of the capital equipment that would be required.  It is not envisaged that the Minister will be poking his nose into such affairs in any context other than in the context of dealing with the authority who were set up for that purpose and who would be examining the property to be purchased and any developments that might be necessary in the institute.  For that reason I do not think that paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 4 is in any way inimical to section 6, that is to say, where it provides that the governing body shall manage and control all the affairs and property of the institute and shall perform all the functions conferred on the institute by this legislation.</P>

      <P>Again, I do not wish that the Minister would misconstrue what I say.  I should be happy that paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 4 would stand if here the words, &ldquo;maintain, manage, administer and so on&rdquo; were omitted.  I am satisfied about the Minister's sanction in relation to the buying of properties and in relation to the investment of the assets of the institute. The only matter to which I am referring relates to the ordinary day-to-day <Col N="736" /> maintenance and management of the property.</P>
      <P>I do not see the need for the Minister's sanction always to be present.  Surely section 6 (1) is sufficient to allow the governing body to manage and control all the affairs and the property?  The important words are &ldquo;to manage and control.&rdquo;  I am not at all referring to the question of purchase or investment, I am merely talking about the general day to day management and maintenance of the property.  I do not honestly feel that it is necessary to have this strict ministerial presence.</P>

A <i>modus operandi</i> has been developed since the establishment of An t-Údarás which has in no way interfered with the day to day management and maintenance of any of the designated institutions.

      <P>I should be happier to discuss this amendment on the Schedule, but there is a problem here in relation to the very wide power given to the Minister.  I do not propose to withdraw the amendment at this stage, but should be glad to hear what the Minister will say in relation to possible precedents that may exist in this area.  For example, is there a precedent in relation to the appointment of a director to the National Council for Education Awards, in which not just the conditions applying to the appointment of the director but the actual person of the director should be subject to approval by the Government?  If there is any precedent in this area, my wording or that suggested by Deputy Collins would be more appropriate.</P>

      <P>The wording of section 7 is not satisfactory.  There is no need for ministerial approval in this case.  We are here creating a very important senior post of director.  The post is there and, when vacated, there is a need to have it filled expeditiously.  There is no need for the Minister to be involved in the post as created.  This is a permanent post protected by statute.  It should simply be the duty of the governing body, acting on behalf of the institute, to properly advertise the post, properly assess the candidates forthcoming and make the proper appointment.  That is as it should be in a third level educational institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> That the approval of the Minister should be sought to appoint a director is unnecessary in the extreme.  Certainly, in relation to the wording of section 7 (1), I am not happy with this at all.  I suggested deleting the words &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo;.  I am not even happy with my wording and would prefer Deputy Horgan's amendment which simply deletes the words &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo;.  We take it that the governing body are men of repute, as I am sure they will be, and surely there is no need for this bureaucracy to creep in in relation to this appointment?</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins talked about three names coming up to the Minister being the procedure.  Of course, that is not true at all.  The practice has not been of three names coming to the Minister, in making appointments to the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick.  The procedure is that vacancies are advertised and a short list of candidates then interviewed by a selection board.  As far as the Minister is concerned, his function of approval is exercised by ensuring that the vacancy is authorised, that it has been properly advertised and that the selected candidate is appropriately qualified.  At times to get the best people one has to put in a statement that the salary may be higher than <Col N="739" /> the minimum of the scale and the Minister has to approve the particular rate for the position.  In no way can it be said that those functions of the Minister are oligarchic; in fact, they are more than democratic.  The Minister is, in fact, exercising his office as someone responsible for public expenditure.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Collins that the post is a very important senior post.  It is for that reason that the Minister should have the functions that I have outlined, which are not unduly interfering in the appointment to this very important post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said, the Minister's information to the House is valuable.  There is only one point upon which we might differ, which is the question of the Minister's approving of the qualifications of the person concerned.  If the appointment system is set up and goes through all its phases and a name is suggested to the Minister, or put up to the Minister, as the person whom the governing body wish to appoint, it is surely an extraordinary waste, at the very least, of time and money for the Minister to decide at that stage that the person's academic qualifications are such that the Minister cannot have confidence in recommending his approval for his appointment to the post concerned.  In order to ensure that this kind of situation does not arise, would it not be far more beneficial if, for example, in this situation the Minister could indicate in advance to the governing body that all the persons on the short list are suitably academically qualified so that the Minister does not leave himself open to the accusation of having done somebody down for reasons that might not be entirely praiseworthy and does not put the governing body to the trouble and expense of going back and starting from scratch in appointing a director?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of what the Minister said, the qualification is important. If the Minister feels that he should advise the governing body as to what the <Col N="740" /> proper qualification would be, then so be it.  If that is the case my amendment certainly seems to be the correct <i>modus operandi.</i>  The amendment states &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo;.  That allows him to lay down the conditions, qualifications and so on before the governing body undertake the advertising and assessing of candidates for the post.  It would seem a far more logical way forward than for the governing body to advertise, assess, draw up a short list and make an appointment which has then to go to the Minister and the Minister may say that the qualifications are not right.  Then you have to go right back down the line and start all over again.  In logic and in good management that should be avoided.  If the Minister wishes to have a presence in relation to the appointment of a director I would be of the opinion that his presence should be felt before the post is advertised rather than after.  For that reason I would be keen to have my amendment considered by the Minister rather than to accept the present section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage the procedure as being one where, for example as I mentioned, a formal advertisement would appear.  In 99 cases out of a 100 the activity would be purely formal.  The Minister would examine the advertisement to see whether the person chosen had the qualifications corresponding to the advertisement. The Minister, and an tÚdarás no doubt in this case, would be consulted about this and I see no ministerial interference at all in the procedure.  The Deputies know that on occasion at third level&mdash;we have talked about this being very much in the third level sphere&mdash;appointments at times take very strange turnings and the powers of approval, which are mild powers of approval incorporated in this section, do not interfere in any way with the selection&mdash;in fact they guarantee the selection&mdash;of the proper person for this very important post of director.  I fail to see any of the weaknesses or dangers that have been mentioned by the spokesmen opposite.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 8, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1)  The Governing Body shall, subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, from time to time appoint in a whole-time capacity a person to be referred to as &ldquo;The Registrar&rdquo; and who is in this Act referred to as the Registrar.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Registrar shall act as registrar and secretary of the Institute.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new section to establish a protected office to be known as &ldquo;registrar&rdquo; and this registrar shall act both as registrar and secretary of the institute.  I went over this ground some time ago with the Minister on the NCEA Bill and did not get anywhere then with that gentleman.  On this occasion there is a difference in that we are dealing now with a third level institution which will have the same status as a university.  It is the practice in university colleges to have a statutorily protected office to be known as &ldquo;registrar&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose is quite obvious, that decisions and opinions of the governing body should be properly minuted and recorded and that an award made by the institute, through the NCEA in this case, would also be minuted and recorded properly and kept for posterity.  It is only proper in an institution such as the NIHE, Limerick, and Dublin when we come to consider that, that there should be a protected office to be known as &ldquo;registrar&rdquo;.  There should be a registrar. There is need for one.  I am not inserting <Col N="742" /> this into the Bill to satisfy an intellectual whim on my part.  I am putting it there because I feel there is a need for it in the Bill and there is a need for such an office and such a person in the institute which is a third level institute dealing with academic awards up to degree level and post-degree level.  Because of that and comparing this situation with the situation in comparable colleges and other institutes, there is an obvious need for the position of registrar to be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the House on a number of occasions, I envisaged the NIHE, Limerick, and NIHE, Dublin, later on, to develop and grow, particularly in size.  As I have stated time and time again, I envisage a technological university there very strong numerically and qualitatively by the end of this century.  The National College of Art and Design have a statutory post of registrar to act as registrar and secretary of the college &ldquo;and shall keep the accounts of An Bord&rdquo; are the words in the Act.  But the National College of Art and Design are very small compared with what the NIHE, Limerick, eventually will be and it would not be possible for a person to have the kind of duties that are envisaged for the registrar and secretary, bursar and so on in the National College of Art and Design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my contention that section 9, which follows where Deputy Collins wishes to insert his amendment, gives flexibility, providing that the institute may appoint such and so many persons as it from time to time thinks proper. That includes any of the officers mentioned. This section covers all posts of the institute except that of director and authorised posts are permanent and pensionable and the incumbents are very much protected.  They have the same kind of protection as the public sector employees have.  There is no need for statutory protection.  We think that it would be inadvisable to tie the institute to specific posts and that it would be better if it has freedom.  Understandably, one specific post, that of director, must be specified.  The wording of the Bill <Col N="743" /> gives maximum freedom as regards the remainder to the National Institute to appoint its own officers and, of course, among them the registrar and assistant registrar.  I think the point is adequately covered and that there are adequate safeguards in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is not well advised on this, but that is his business.  I shall not pursue the matter at great length except to reiterate that I believe there is need for a statutory protective office of registrar and secretary who would deal, if you like, with the day-to-day organisation of records and minutes and also possibly deal with students on a number of issues such as occupation of buildings and things like that and who will take legal steps where necessary to protect property and also deal with the ordinary milieu of decisions and awards. Therefore, I hope under section 9 the institute in its wisdom will see the necessity to make such an appointment and that the Minister will be able to get around the Minister for Finance to sanction it.</P>

      <P>As the National Institute will be dealing at this level, the academic level, with a highly sophisticated area, I think it is only correct that the academic council should consist of the people who are teaching in the institute, who are on the academic staff.  No doubt the students would have a good deal to offer by way of suggestion to the academic council and I cannot imagine any academic council so obtuse as to refuse to listen to submissions from their students; but as it is an academic council I think its membership should be confined to the academic staff.  The students are represented, as the House knows.  Provision is made in the Bill for student representation on the governing body but in this particular area the students <Col N="745" /> may make submissions to the academic council.  I do not think it appropriate for them to have membership of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister, I think we are talking at cross purposes.  First, I think the implication in the Minister's initial reply that students are not capable of a sophisticated approach to this or that topic would hardly be borne out by his own experience, not alone by mine.  As regards the wider issue, my point was that the governing body should make some provision for the representation of students on the academic council and, somewhat to my horror, the Minister has now gone on record as saying not only that he is not prepared to put in a requirement that they should appoint students but that he does not even think they should.</P>
      <P>The section as it stands does not prevent the governing body from appointing a student but the Minister is now on record as marking their cards well in advance and saying they should not do anything of the sort whether they want to or not.  I draw attention to one of the sophisticated exercises that the academic council would be involved in under (d), that is to make recommendations to the governing body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students. It is altogether essential that any arrangements made under these headings should be based on the broad consent of the governed.  I would regard student representation on the academic council as a very reasonable way of ensuring at least the possibility of such consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the academic council would be dealing at a very highly sophisticated level in so far as the <i>materia academica</i> is concerned, as regards what is being taught and developed.  I was not saying that the students were not capable of a sophisticated approach in the matter&mdash;far from it.  We must keep our eye on the section and section, 8 as amended, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Governing body shall appoint a body of persons which shall be <Col N="746" /> known as and is in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the Academic Council&rdquo; to assist the Governing Body in the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the Institute.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Governing Body may by regulations made under this section provide for the membership and terms of office of the Academic Council established pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say what the functions of the academic council will be and sub-section(1) says the governing body must appoint the body of persons known as the council.  It is envisaged that it will be representative of the academic staff and responsible to the governing body.  The final powers of decision in regard to this are quite plainly stated in subsection (1) and it is not my intention to interfere with their rights as so stated.  I can assure the Deputy on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taken aback by the Minister's medieval attitude in rela-tion to possible student participation in the academic council.  I am not a classical scholar, far from it, but there was a school in Athens where students elected the teachers and professors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and had the power to fire them.  That was a radical way of doing things but they did not have such things as pension schemes to look after.  I see the presence of student representation as a benefit to the academic council.  In my capacity as a member of the board of management of the Waterford Regional Technical College, I would like to see students on the board and on all academic councils. They have their problems in their pursuit of knowledge and they have problems which they would like to see expressed at a number of levels, and the academic council would be one of the places where students' problems could be mentioned, discussed and considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> I was surprised that the Minister took the attitude that this was a high academic body.  In my view students have a right to give their views on how they see the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the work of the institute.  Their presence would be a benefit rather than a hindrance.  I hope the governing body will not take into account what the Minister said today but rather that they will use their good sense to ensure that here would be a student presence on the academic council.</P>

      <P>Section 8 (1) clearly gives the governing body power to appoint the academic council.  There is nothing in the Bill which restricts that power.  If the governing body in their wisdom decide on a format for the academic council, nobody can interfere with their decision. On student representation, there is no reason why there should not be communication between the students and the academic council.  We are dealing with third level, technological and commercial studies, with emphasis on the technological, and students' views are very important.  In the ordinary way any academic council worth the name would listen carefully to students and there is no restriction on the governing body from appointing a students if they see fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I was making is that the main burden of the obligation of the section will fall on the academic council, which is a very important council.  In doing their duty they will have to take in the international levels required by the discipline on which they are advising the governing body and world developments in that sphere.  There are many areas which students, fully occupied in the study of their disciplines, might not have the time to research.  Where the activities of the academic council impinge onthe students themselves, naturally one would expect the academic council to take cognisance of their views and, if the governing body in appointing the academic council see fit or think it necessary for the specific functions of <Col N="748" /> the council to have a student representative on the academic council there is nothing in the legislation which can restrict them from so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have come some distance, although not far enough, in this argument.  The Minister expressed an opinion, which was not sought, as to what he thought the governing body should do in relation to their powers to appoint to the academic council.  He made it clear that he would not attempt to interfere with them if they decided to appoint students representatives to the academic council.  We might even get an admission from him that he would not lose any sleep if this were done.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that we must always favour and encourage communication between students and an organisation like the academic council in matters which concern the students, as most of the matters the academic council will be discussing will do.  But the Minister will agree that there is a tendency, despite the sanctity of governing bodies or academic councils on the one hand or the innate good sense and desire to pass their exams on the part of the student body on the other, for communications between students and the different arms of the institutions in which they are studying to be conducted at the level of the megaphone rather than by simple face to face communication of the kind which will iron out difficulties.  The Minister must also accept that this tendency will be magnified if students are denied reasonable and appropriate representation on bodies which discuss matters which are in their interest.  I appeal to him to have another look at this between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed that the Minister gave his opinion that students should not be represented on the academic council.  That was an unnecessary opinion.  It should have been left to the good sense and wisdom of the governing body to make their own appointments. I reiterate my support for these amendments and am of the opinion <Col N="749" /> that the presence of students on governing bodies, boards of management and academic councils is of benefit to the college or institute in question.  Successive Ministers for Education have taken a narrow view in relation to the presence of students on boards of management, governing bodies and so on.  We need to take a giant step forward in this area.</P>
      <P>We must accept that the presence of students is good and necessary for the full and proper understanding by students of the functions of colleges and institutes. If they were present, certainly in this case, it would lead to harmony and would be of benefit rather than of negative value as the Minister sees it. This is the second Bill I have dealt with in this House where this has occurred.  It occurred on the NCEA Bill.  For some reason there is something against students in the Department.  We need to have a change of mind.  We must take this giant step forward which has as a principle the participation of students and not the exclusion of students.</P>

      <P>I would like to reiterate what I said about section 8.  Amendment No. 28 by Deputy Horgan asks for the insertion of the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>In appointing the Academic Board the Governing Body shall ensure appropriate representation of the student body among its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the amendment under discussion at the moment.  It is an amendment with a very good objective in mind.  But it is not one that is necessary within the terms of section 8 (1) because what it is actually doing is restricting the powers of the governing body.  I agree with the Deputies when they say that the students' input is important but one does not expect them to put a programme together which is beyond their years or their experience or the degree of expertise reached by them at student level. That is not to say that they have not a contribution to make on what is put before them by the academic council by older and more experienced minds.  As <Col N="750" /> the Bill is drafted the governing body can do what Deputy Horgan wants to make compulsory on them to do and I do not think this is necessary.  The governing body, being on the scene, knowing the situation, is in the best position to make decisions like that and include students if it so wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I make only one further point in support of my amendment which the Minister appears to try to present in the light that I want to tie the governing body or the academic council hand and foot.  It is a very odd criticism coming from the Minister, given the original format of this Bill.  If we look at subsection (4) (a) of the section we will see that the academic council may</P>
      <P>establish such and so many committees, either consisting wholly or partly of persons who are not members of the Institute, as it thinks proper to assist the Academic Board in the performance of its functions under this Act,</P>
      <P>We have a situation in which the Minister is rejecting a modest proposal to require a minimum of one student&mdash;if the governing body thought that to be the appropriate number&mdash;to be appointed to the academic council in a section which is conferring on the same academic council the right to set up subcommittees which will include not only people who are not students but people who are not even members of the institute at all.  In these circumstances my amendment is really very reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a final point.  It seems to me that Deputy Horgan has not much confidence in the governing body.  I have no reason to believe that the governing body of the NIHE in Limerick will be less liberal in their views than Deputy Horgan or this House and, for that reason, imposing an obligation on them, as seems to be what he wants to do by his amendment, simply derogates from their authority and also shows a lack of confidence in the ability of the governing body to see, in the round, the best position for the <Col N="751" /> academic council.  That is as I interpret it.  It is quite clear that this is the implication.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) The provisions of the Third Schedule to this Act shall apply to the Academic Council.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to establish a Third Schedule to the Act to deal specifically with the academic council.  The structure of section 8 (3) is such as to warrant its transfer to a separate Schedule.  The general activities of the governing body are dealt with in the First Schedule while the Second Schedule deals with the position of a director.  It is because this is a third level institute for education that there is a need to set out precisely in a schedule the position in relation to the academic council.  It is a neater and tidier way of approaching this question.  Amendment No. 85 is related to this.  It lays down the format of the new schedule, sets out the functions of the academic council and changes, to some extent, the wording in the Bill.  The amendment does not add anything but seeks to transfer subsection (3) to a Third Schedule, a neater method of dealing with the academic council from the point of view of legislation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is seeking to transfer the statement of the functions of the council to a new schedule.  The first and second schedules are concerned mainly with procedural matters.  The section referred to deals with the functions of the council.  The academic council is the important council in the institute from the educational or academic point of view and it is felt fitting that it should <Col N="754" /> be in the body of the Bill.  There is that distinction between the two existing schedules and the new one proposed by Deputy Collins.  After consultation with the parliamentary draftsman I feel the functions of the council should be dealt with in this section.</P>

      <P>I do not have any quibble with the Minister's amendment <Col N="755" /> except that the governing body may dispense with the necessity for confirmation of acts done by the committee established by the academic council.  That is unfortunate.  Surely a committee established under this section should have its deliberations confirmed by the academic council in the first instance rather than by the governing body?  If the academic council in its wisdom sees fit to establish a committee that committee is there to assist the academic council in its deliberations.  Surely it is proper that the body who should confirm the deliberations of the committee should be the academic council responsible for establishing the committee in the first instance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The governing body appoints the academic council and the academic council then goes on to appoint its own committees.  That is a very sound type of chain of command or administration. The governing body has certain power unless it dispenses with it. It is in full control and may dispense in its wisdom.  The power rests with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into a confrontation with the Minister on this matter but section 8 (4) states that the academic board, with the approval of the governing body, may establish a certain number of committees and may determine the functions of such committees. Surely where the committee is established primarily by the academic council for the purpose of assisting that council in its own deliberations, then the deliberations, decisions and recommendations of the committee should be confirmed by the academic council?  If necessary the minute of the academic council confirming the committee's work should subsequently be confirmed by the governing body.  It seems logical in the chain of events that the committee established by the academic council should report to that council in the first instance. The academic council should confirm its deliberations, and, if necessary, send them on to the governing <Col N="756" /> body for further confirmation possibly with a recommendation.  The sequence in the section is not logical.  It misses out on the fact that it was the academic council who, in the first in-stance, established these committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this in amendment No. 23 the Deputy wanted to delete &ldquo;unless the Governing Body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation&rdquo;. I fail to see, when the Deputy urged that acts of the committee established under this subsection should be subject to confirmation by the governing body without giving the governing body any liberty of action at all how he can apply the direct opposite principle.  The governing body establishes the academic council and the academic council then goes on to establish committees.  It seems to me that the originating authority is the correct one to have power to confirm or dispense with confirmation.  That seems logical to me and is what I am recommending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has dealt with this in a petty fashion.  When I first spoke to this amendment I stated that I had reservations about the principle of dispensing with the necessity for such confirmation.  I entered a reservation where that had arisen and I entered the same caveat in relation to this Ministerial amendment.  The Minister should not try to misinterpret me.  I dealt with the Minister's amendment on its merits and merely pointed out that the committee we are talking about is established by the academic council and acting on behalf of it.  It would seem a logical sequence to me that it should confirm its deliberations and, possibly with a recommendation, submit it to the governing body for further confirmation. That was my logic in the approach to the amendment.  It is not perhaps significant but the Minister should not try to misinterpret me or deal with my submission in a petty fashion.</P>

      <P>In relation to the appointment of the academic council the structure of the membership should be specified to a greater extent than is done in the Bill.  On Second Stage I referred to the University College, Galway, charter and article 9 of that on page 456 states that there shall be an academic council which shall consist of the president and professors of the college with such lecturers of the college and may be co-opted by the president and professors.  That sets out the structure and level.  Obviously it is not fully comparable with this Bill but I would prefer to see some positive statement in the Bill as to the kind of structure the Minister would like to see in the academic council.  It would have been possible to do so and include the students, on which matter we have just had a division.</P>

      <P>There seems in the train of thought of Deputy Collins an effort to impinge on the realm or bailiwick of the governing body.  That is not proper to the Bill.  The governing body should have the maximum freedom in relation to the structure of the academic council within the expansive terms of reference they get in the section&mdash;the whole area Deputy Collins proposes to have consigned to a new schedule three.</P>
      <P>I hold the directly opposite view to Deputy Collins: we should not be more specific and the structure of the academic council should be left to the governing body.  The governing body knows its own see and is in the best position to structure its own academic council. Our division was simply on whether there should be an instruction to have students on the academic council, that it should be stipulated and be statutory and was not on the principle of the contribution that the students could make.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 33, to delete &ldquo;such and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One could make an argument in relation to the director of a post of such national importance that the Minister should be the repository of some kind of final democratic sanction for the actual appointment of the actual person.  It seems unduly restrictive to apply the same kind of conditions in relation to any or every person the institute proposes to appoint. If the section was amended as I suggest it would read:</P>
      <P>The Institute may appoint so many persons to be its officers and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
      <P>I have an objection to including the phrase &ldquo;such and&rdquo; because that implies the Minister would have to give personal sanction to every individual who was to be appointed at any time by the institute to perform any of the tasks of officer or servant.  The terminology &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo; has a somewhat nineteenth century ring about it.  While I accept it may have some functional use it has a certain amount of the gentleman players about it.  I should like to ask the Minister if there is substance in my objection, which I believe there is.</P>

As the Deputy knows, legal people always are very sensitive to the usage of such words and the association of such words with certain provisions in legislation.  I do not think what Deputy Horgan suggested would at all be the result of their usage and I am informed that they are necessary for tight draftsmanship.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Horgan in regard to the other terms he mentioned.  I agree also that there are some overtones of gentlemen and players but that is not my particular game.  We did examine the 1930 Education Act and the usage is fairly general.  While we examined the possibility of some other terminology, for the purpose of convenience we decided on balance it was better to use that but without any philosophic overtones or undertones.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes the deletion of subsection (3).  The effect of my amendment, I hope, is not to disempower the institute from disciplinary or regulatory actions of the kind mentioned in the subsection but to mean that it should not necessarily have to apply to the Minister for his consent to do any of these things.</P>
      <P>There is a problem here&mdash;and while I am not satisfied that my amendment deals with it adequately, but it does open a discussion in the general area.  The problem is: should we, when we are setting up institutes like this, also set up disciplinary and regulatory procedures and structures whereby persons who are suspended or removed from office have the right of appeal, or should we simply allow the person concerned to have recourse to the other institutions set up by other Acts of the Oireachtas and perhaps operating under the aegis of different Ministers?  We seem here to be adopting a middle course, certainly in the subsection I am seeking to delete, in that it is stated that the institute has power to remove or suspend any of its officers from office.  But it is stated in a negative fashion because it is subject to a condition, so that a positive statement is made in a negative way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What appears to be the situation here is that in contrast, for example, with a situation in which the director&mdash;let us say, for the purpose of argument&mdash;is removed from office by the institute and, in the absence of any other provision, has the right of going to the Unfair Dismissals Tribunals or some other such structure, there is effectively a one man court of appeal residing in the Minister. It is unclear what would happen, to put it mildly, if the Minister found himself unable to concur with the decision of the institute in relation to the suspension or removal from office of the director.  The Minister might very well find himself in a situation of&mdash;in order to safeguard the position of the director&mdash;having to sack <Col N="761" /> the member of the governing body, or at least those members of it whom he appoints directly, which is hardly a consummation he would welcome.</P>
    <P>In general terms it would seem to me that persons who are subject to this kind of disciplinary or regulatory action should have the right of recourse to the other institutions of the State, such as those set up under the Department of Labour.  The Minister might agree with me that the regulatory mechanisms set up under the Vocational Education Act&mdash;which provide for the holding of inquiries, tribunals and so on&mdash;have really not redounded to the credit of many of the participants in many of the situations in which they have been evoked and are perhaps redolent of a different age when the kind of institutions I have talked about under the aegis of the Department of Labour simply were not available.</P>
    <P>While not believing that the terms of my amendment meet all of the problems I have raised, I would be glad to have the Minister's observations on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In my amendment, No. 41, I too propose the deletion of subsection (3) whose provisions are stated in a very negative way.  My amendment makes it positive that the institute may remove or suspend any of its officers, including the director, from office. The legality of removal or suspension is there to be questioned.  We have Labour Court procedures.  No doubt contracts will be entered into, certainly with the officers.  We have the Unfair Dismissals Act.  All of these exist to deal with such matters as wrongful dismissals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is necessary because I disagree fundamentally with the Minister in his approach to the Bill.  We are here setting up a third level educational institute, which is really only a branch of the Department.  This subsection typifies what I mean.  Here the institute is being tied hand and foot in relation to the removal or suspension of its officers without the consent of the Minister.  I do not think that is necessary.  The institute <Col N="762" /> must be given freedom; we must have trust in them.  This subsection as well as many others&mdash;where the Minister's presence is spelled out&mdash;does not move me at all.  I am left quite cold by the approach. Deputy Horgan's amendment seeks merely the deletion of the subsection. Mine proposes its deletion and its substitution by something positive.</P>
    <P>There is another drafting question I should like to raise with the Minister. The subsection says that &ldquo;the institute shall not remove&rdquo; and so on.  Surely what should be stated there is that &ldquo;the institute, through the agency of the governing body&rdquo; and so on.  In other words it will in effect be that while the institute itself is a body corporate, it is the governing body that will take the decision to remove or suspend.</P>
    <P>That is not spelled out in subsection (3).  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this aspect of the subsection.  I do not like this trend that the institute shall not do things, or shall do things, only with the consent of the Minister. That approach goes right through the Bill.  We have made very little headway to remove it from the Bill.  We made certain concessions on section 4.  The Bill, as it stands, is not satisfactory and this subsection of section 9 is not satisfactory. It does not place trust in the governing body of the institute.  It expresses distrust in their ability to handle the question of employment.  That is unfortunate and unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the subsection is to protect the staff.  It is a very serious business to dismiss the director or a member of the staff of the institute.  I agree that, as Deputy Horgan said, the Unfair Dismissals Act is relevant and agreement between unions and management are also relevant.  This was put in simply as a measure of added <Col N="763" /> protection for the staff of the institute. The governing body will be employing staff.  There is no need to put in power for them to remove or suspend, because they have that as employers.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Horgan put it, it looks rather raw, that the Minister, by virtue of subsection (3) of section 9, is establishing himself as a one-man court of appeal.  The Minister has available to him a body of advisers, many of whom have considerable experience in industrial relations and staff-management relations.  It is not as stark as a one-man court of appeal.  The Minister has to make the decision.  I should like to emphasise that there is a considerable body of expertise, advice and experience available to him, and he would hardly be worthy of his office if he did not avail of all those facilities.</P>
      <P>I concede, as Deputy Horgan said, that there has been developed a mode of procedure in other cases which, to a certain extent, have proved unwieldy.  I agree that there has been a considerable advance in this type of legislation in recent years.  I still maintain that the subsection was introduced as a measure of protection for people at a very high level. It is very important that, in an institution, the authority and position of staff should be clearly known and clearly protected.  For that reason, the section is not criticising a potential governing body.  It is simply one more piece of protection for the staff of the institute. For that reason section 9 (3) should stand as it is.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased the Minister has decided to delete subsections (6) and (7).  As they stood in the Bill they were obnoxious.  Our whole attitude to participation in public life and especially in the Oireachtas and the European Parliament should be to encourage it rather than to discourage it. For Members of either House who hold academic posts in the universities or university colleges an arrangement is made <Col N="765" /> about the salary received and the time off required.  That is as it should be.  In my amendment No. 46 I propose that when an officer or servant in the employment of the institute is elected to either House of the Oireachtas or the Assembly of the European Communities he shall be allowed such leave of absence and on such conditions and terms as laid down by the institute.</P>
      <P>I was merely specifying that it is up to the institute to make the arrangements necessary with its officer or servant who is elected to either Parliament.  I support the Minister's amendment but would ask him if he is satisfied that section 9, as amended, deals adequately with this matter.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (5), line 5 after &ldquo;determine&rdquo; to add &ldquo;, subject to the approval of the Higher Education Authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 43, which has been ruled out of order, was to remove the presence of the Minister for Education and the Minister for the Public Service and this amendment proposes to insert &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Higher Education Authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my contention that the institute will be under the general guidance of the HEA, that planning, co-ordination and so forth will go through the HEA.  It is the same in regard to conditions of employment and salaries and it is only proper that salary levels should be established <Col N="766" /> with the approval of the HEA. If salaries and other conditions of em-ployment have to go through the Minister and receive the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service we may become caught up in a position in which the Minister may be trying to control salaries in one sector of higher education and inadvertently we may have the unfortunate position that an increase in salaries may not be allowed in the Limerick institute.  That would be a disturbing and unfortunate state of affairs.</P>
    <P>If I am not mistaken, there is an unfortunate level of salary for the Director of the National College of Art and Design.  That is a specific example.  The level being offered to the new director there is substantially lower than the salaries of people in comparable positions elsewhere simply because it has been established at civil service level. Here we are dealing with an institute of higher education and we may end up with salary levels that will not compare favourably with those prevailing outside the civil service.  That may be and will be to the detriment of the institute in Limerick.  Therefore, I want to have deleted the presence of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is need to monitor salary levels throughout the third level education sector but this monitoring and control should be done by the HEA.  For that reason, subsection (5) in its present form is entirely unfortunate and unsuitable for the Limerick institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  We had a discussion earlier in more philosophical terms dealing with the position of such institutes in relation to their administration by the Department of the Public Service or of Finance, as the case may be.  It is generally accepted that in semi-State bodies there should be an overseeing by the Department of the Public Service of conditions of employment, salaries and so on.  This is in pursuit of the responsibility that rests with that Department for public funds, and such institutions are almost totally <Col N="767" /> funded from the public purse, Therefore, it is only right and natural that we would expect the Minister to be concerned in this regard.</P>
      <P>We would all like to get rid of the shackles of the Department of Finance on the Department of the Public Service but we have a responsibility to the public in regard to the expenditure of public funds.  The HEA have not got any determining function in the matter of pay. They discuss with the designated institutes current and capital needs and they advise the Department of Education. They give their findings and the Department of Education must go to the Department of Finance for the necessary money.  The HEA are an advisory body and as such cannot be regarded as a body with responsibility in regard to the expenditure of public funds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that the provisions here are the same as in the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979.  The procedure will be as it exists in regard to other universities: claims will be submitted by the HEA in regard to the existing designated institutes and the recommendations of the HEA weigh very heavily with the Minister for Education in these matters. However, there is a need for sanction from the Minister for the Public Service who has the overall responsibility for pay in the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that the wording is similar to that used in the NCEA Act of 1979 where we had a similar situation with existing staff and the question of their being transferred. The director is the chief officer of the institute, as a reading of the Bill shows, and his duties as described in article 1 of the Second Schedule are to &ldquo;...control and direct the activities of the Institute....&rdquo; and &ldquo;...control and direct the staff of the Institute in the implementation of such activities&rdquo;.  Because of the specific words used, I think the director is the appropriate person to exercise the functions as described in the subsection. The inclusion of the name of the director in the subsection is appropriate for the reason I have given and I do not think I could accept exclusion of the words &ldquo;or the Director&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 9, the conditions of service are firmly the responsibility of the institute through the governing body.  I am merely continuing that concept in section 10 in relation to transferred staff.  That is the logical sequence of events rather than introducing the director at this point. From a legislative point of view it is better that the governing body deal with conditions of service and so on and that applies also to new staff.  It is no reflection on the director.  Section 9 is quite specific about the duties of the governing body in this regard while section 10 deals with transferred staff.  It is only logical that the governing body should deal with this matter in the first instance.</P>

      <P>Article 1 of the Second Schedule states that he shall control and direct the staff of the institute.  It is appropriate to include the director in this subsection.  As the House will understand, there are details of control and direction that are the responsibility of the director and it is only right and proper that this should be stated in the statute.

      <P>The provision in the Second Schedule states that &ldquo;the Director shall, subject to the directions of the Governing Body ...control and direct the activities of the Institute....&rdquo;  That is logical and acceptable.  However, section 9 clearly establishes that the institute, through the governing body, will be responsible for employing officers and servants and laying down conditions of employment.  Logically that should also be the position with regard to transferred staff.  It is my contention that we should adhere to that principle.</P>

      <P>There is no conflict.  It is easy to see how the director would need that kind of authority in the ordinary day-to-day running of the institute.  For instance, there might be two lecturers in mechanical engineering who could not agree on the hall they use.  The director should be in a position to say that John Browne will go to one hall and John Smith will go to another hall for the purpose of giving their lectures.  The governing body cannot be summoned for every detail of direction and control in the running of an institute like this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 17 to 29, to delete subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is because on my reading of the subsection there seems to be conflict between the two parts of the section and there seems to be a potential injustice for members of the staff.  If the Minister can persuade me that there <Col N="771" /> is no conflict and no serious potential injustice I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.  The conflict arises between subsections (4) (a) and (2) (b) of section 10.  In subsection (2) (b) we note that the conditions of service, restrictions, requirements and obligations to which a member of the institute's transferred staff was subject by virtue of such membership immediately before his transfer to the service of the institute may not be varied other than by agreement, whereas subsection (4) (a), which my amendment seeks to delete, states that the institute may redistribute or rearrange the duties to be performed by members of the institute's transferred staff only after consultation with any recognised staff associations or trade unions concerned. This may involve an injustice to members of the staff, and surely the requirement for agreement which exists in the earlier paragraph might be more reasonably written in here.  Alternatively, subsection (4) (a) is really unnecessary because most if not all the matters which might be covered are covered in subsection (2) (b) and with much greater fairness to the employee concerned.</P>
    <P>In subsection (4) (a) there is a reference to recognised staff associations or trade unions.  There are situations in which employees of any institution may be members of a trade union which is not recognised by the institution as a social partner.  The rights of the employee in this situation may be further circumscribed by the fact that the institute may not deal with his representative association.  I would be grateful for the Minister's comments on those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If we deleted subsection (4) (a) and (b) there could be a doubt as to whether the institute could make any redistribution of duties of the staff.  It would also leave open the question as to whether a member of the transferred staff had to perform the duties when they were allocated to him.  There is an inferred obligation of consulting with staff associations or trade unions before any such redistribution should be made.  It <Col N="772" /> was felt that it was better to have this covered so that it would be quite clear that a staff association had a right to be heard in this matter.  I do not envisage any trouble in this area but it was felt that doubt or controversy about the rights of management or staff would do harm and cause serious disruption when the transfer was taking place.  It is simply a safeguard for the staff for the right of unions and staff associations to be heard and the purpose of this is to make the transfer as efficient and as smooth as possible.</P>

      <P>I can now probe the Minister's mind further on the relationship between subsection (2) (b) and subsection (4) (a).  They both seem to apply to staff, to duties, to conditions of service and so on.  Subsection (2) (b) requires agreement of a member of the institute staff to any change in his situation, whereas subsection (4) (a) requires only that the institute should consult with any organisation to which he may belong which may wish to represent him. We should guard against any lack of clarity.  I could not agree more with the Minister about this.  A lack of clarity may lead the institute or the director of the institute, particularly the institute at (4) (a), to assume that all they have to do is consult with the trade union and then do what they like.</P>
      <P>Section 10 has two effects.  Subsection (4) (a) insists that the institute be consulted, and that is admirable, but in contrast subsection (2) (b) implies that the institute may do what they like after going through a consultation process that may be extremely formal.</P>

    <P>(b)  The conditions of service, <Col N="773" /> restrictions, requirements and obligations to which a member of the Institute's transferred staff was subject by virtue of such membership immediately before his transfer to the service of the Institute shall, unless they are varied by agreement, continue to apply to him and may be exercised or imposed by the Institute or the Director, as may be appropriate, while he is in the service of the Institute.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) (b) refers to the question of redistribution or rearrangement and the best method for having a redistribution or rearrangement is through consultations. Deputy Horgan has sufficient knowledge and experience of the terminology used with regard to negotiations between management, staff associations and trade unions to know that &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; is a very strong word.  Any management which would in cavalier fashion say &ldquo;I will consult with the staff association or trade union and then do what I like&rdquo; would hardly be qualified to manage a duckhouse in the modern industrial climate.  There is an obligation on the institute arising from the words of the Bill, if redistribution or rearrangement of duties take place, to consult and come to agreement with the staff association or trade union.  That is clearly implied there.  In the universal discourse of industrial relations that is what is meant by this subsection.  For that reason it is a very important subsection and I am sure the House and the Deputy will agree that it should stand.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 56:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> In page 9, subsection (1), line 16, after &ldquo;year&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am merely asking in this amendment that the report be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I believe that is normal. This is really a drafting amendment. I feel the report of the institute for an academic year, having been submitted to the Minister, should also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I imagine the Minister, as a Deputy of this House, would be in agreement with the principle of laying such annual reports before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for this detailed annual report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  As the Deputy knows, in section 14 the annual accounts of the institute will be tabled.  The provisions in the Bill are the same as those which apply to the universities and that should be sufficient.  It is a third-level institution. Just as the requirement for the universities is that the accounts are presented but the annual report is not, so in the case of the NIHE, Limerick, we should have the accounts tabled.  But it is not necessary to table the detailed report of the proceedings which is really for the educational world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that in the case of all annual reports of institutes and colleges which receive funding from the Department or through the HEA there is an obligation under the principle of public accountability to publish comprehensive reports annually and to allow the public, and in this case Members of the Oireachtas, to see and examine them. It is not any great defence for the Minister to say that the present position does not apply to universities.  I suggest that he takes steps to ensure that the annual reports of universities and university colleges be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It is an important principle of public accountability that that should be the case.  I am disappointed to see the Minister defending the situation <Col N="775" /> where annual reports of universities, university colleges and the NIHE in Limerick should not be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is rather disturbing.</P>

      <P>I would like to reiterate what I said, that in the normal context of the words &ldquo;public accountability&rdquo; we think of accountability for moneys funded through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I stated, in section 14 of the Bill account is taken of that and the accounts have to be tabled.  That, to my mind, is sufficient evidence of my concern for public accountability.  Deputy Collins wants the detailed educational reports of the national institute to be tabled.  I do not believe there is any need for that.  This is available to the Minister for Education and to anybody else who wants to buy it and read it just the same as are the annual reports of the universities in the country.</P>

This is an important matter. While the governing body have the responsibility for charging fees, the Minister's approval is necessary.  To what extent will the Minister dictate to the NIHE, Limerick, in this matter?  Will he treat it on an equal basis to university fees?

      <P>We are entitled to discuss on this amendment what Deputy Collins is looking for: the relationship between action by the Minister, action by the institute and the overall funding of third-level institutes of education.  What is odd about the way in which this is phrased is that it is phrased as a permissive section in that it provides that the institute may charge admission charges of such amounts as may from time to time be determined by the governing body with the approval of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To anybody who would normally be reading legislation, this implies that the Minister is there holding them in check, that his sole function in this regard is to prevent them from fleecing the public; but we all know that the reality is something totally different.  What happens is that the Minister says to the institute in effect that if they want to keep their doors open they must charge fees of a certain magnitude because he will not give them enough money to run their <Col N="777" /> courses without putting them in the situation of having to charge fees at a certain level in order to make up the difference between what he gives them and what they need to keep their doors open.</P>
    <P>In defence of the sense of what is happening and of the politics of what is happening, the Minister is attempting to disguise a mechanism by which he forces certain bodies to charge fees of certain levels and is permitting them to charge fees only subject to his eternal vigilance. However, he is not the first Minister to attempt something of this nature.</P>

      <P>I know that the Deputy would like to be kindly towards me but the fact is that for a designated institution the Higher Education Authority consult with the institution and with the Minister for Education, but the level of the fees is not decided either by the Minister or by the Department.  I do not think we are entitled to enlarge the debate but with regard to the particular institute in question, that is, the NIHE at Limerick, the level of funding both capital and current has been extremely high from the beginning and the Government are committed to continue a high level of funding there in accordance with the importance they attach to that institute. As has been said here during the <Col N="778" /> Second Stage debate, that institute is something unique, something of our very own that has been developed recently. For that reason the Government intend to continue funding that institute, and also the Dublin youngster as it develops, to the limit of available funds.  The fees situation will be fitted in by the institute itself into that context.  Generally in our third-level institutions the fees are extremely low compared with fees charged by similar institutions in other countries while our standards and our achievements do not suffer as a result of this situation.</P>

      <P>We know how far the limited funds available to the Minister will go this year in relation to UCD and Trinity College, for example.  The grant payable to NIHE, Limerick, and which will be determined by the Minister through the good agency of the HEA, will determine the level of the quality of the services to be provided and the fees that will have to be charged by the governing body to maintain those services. In the past two years we have seen a positive policy on the part of the Government to force colleges and institutions to increase their fees for third-level education.  The Minister may put whatever cloak he wishes on that but the fact remains that, for instance, in respect of the RTCs, which provide our basic technological education, the Minister last year tried to force on them a 25 per cent fee increase.  We await anxiously his recommendations and regulations in this respect this year.  Now he is going to insist on last year's Estimate increase being incorporated with the current year's allocation.</P>

      <P>So far as the NIHE, Limerick, is concerned, I have serious reservations about the section.  The approval of the Minister means, in effect, at the direction of the Minister.  In the context of the Green Paper which was published two or three years ago, and of the White Paper on the economy which was published also a couple of years ago by a man who has now departed from he Front Bench, there is definitely a policy in relation to increasing radically NIHE fees.  In the next few months that policy will be obvious.  The funds available to the Minister are more limited this year than they were last year.  We have all read reports in the newspapers of the higher education institutions expressing reservations about the quality of services they can provide.  The NIHE, Limerick, will be short of funds within the next year or so.  Therefore, if the Minister is serious about funding such colleges he should reconsider the section.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has drawn in extraneous matter.  I reiterate that if you want a classic example of commitment in funding and expenditure to a higher educational institute in this country, you should go to Limerick.  This institute has been heavily funded from the beginning, and properly so.  That heavy funding is continuing and the funding will be such that there will not be high fees in the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick or Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has introduced this amendment. There was a duplication with relation to the definitions of a body corporate with perpetual succession and so on.  Section 2 refers to it initially and then we come to the First Schedule where the governing body is also a body corporate.  That was an undesirable duplication.  I am glad also that the Minister has moved out of the Bill, as I suggested, the term &ldquo;institute body&rdquo; of which I did not know the legal significance, and that the word &ldquo;institute&rdquo; now is the legal vehicle, so to speak, for acts done.  That is an improvement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 67:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 10, Article 2 (1), lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.&rdquo;  and substitute &ldquo;by a decision of the Governing Body passed with at least a two-thirds majority of <Col N="786" /> the members present and voting, and confirmed by the Government.  A chairman shall hold office for a period of five years and shall not hold office for more than ten years.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to delete the circumstances in relation to the removal from office of the chairman of the governing body.  Article 2 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Governing Body ... may be removed from office by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to change that by substituting that the chairman may be removed from office &ldquo;by a decision of the Governing Body passed with at least a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting, and confirmed by the Government.  A Chairman shall hold office for a period of five years and shall not hold office for more than ten years&rdquo;. Therefore, in this amendment I am seeking also to put a time limit on how long a chairman may serve as chairman of the governing body.  I am stating that a chairman when he is first appointed shall hold office for five years, apart of course from the first chairman, who will be in office for one year, and he may not hold office for more than ten years.  All these things are reasonable.</P>
    <P>It is not right that the Government may remove from office at their whim on the recommendation of the Minister the chairman of a governing body.  There may be political problems here.  There may be a change of Government.  There may be a personal clash between any Minister and the chairman, and the chairman may be removed in mid-term simply on political grounds which may not be justified.  I am seeking not to allow that.  I understand that the chairman would be appointed for a term of five years and whatever Government are in office will have their say, I suppose.  That is in the nature of political life, but I do not like the structure of this section which allows the Government on the recommendation of the Minister to remove the chairman from office at their will and pleasure.  That is wrong.  It <Col N="787" /> would be wrong to remove him save in very exceptional circumstances, such as a chairperson becoming extremely ill or so forth.  That can be dealt with by the governing body themselves.  I have serious reservations about the wording of Article 2 and I ask the Minister to accede to my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not acceptable in that it would seem to be the logical course that the appointing agency should also be the agency capable of removing the appointee from office.  A two-thirds majority sounds quite impressive; but the reality is that, if a meeting is attended by the bare quorum, six votes could remove the chairman from office.  Therefore, there is double aspect to it.  There is the aspect of he who appoints may also remove and the aspect that a very small number of people could establish themselves as a power to remove a chairman from office, both of which I would like to avoid and both of which eventualities are covered by the Schedule as drafted.</P>

      <P>This amendment must be supported fully by the House.  It is within living memory that the young <Col N="788" /> people of this country were told to make it &ldquo;your kind of country&rdquo; with the aid of T-shirts, pop music and goodness knows what else.  We are now asked by the Minister for Education, who no doubt employed these visual aids in his own constituency in 1977, to enact into law a situation which will allow people to serve on the governing body up to the age of 70 years.  I do not yield to anybody in my belief that in general the abilities and talents of the older members of society are under-used by our society and by its structures and various systems that it employs.  But equally we must ensure that there is a reasonable turnover of appointments on bodies like this and we should guard against any tendency to appoint people to such institutions as a kind of honorary retirement.  The Schedule, as it stands is a massive vote of no confidence in the ability of the under-65 age group to supply an adequate replacement for those of its members who have reached the 65-year age barrier.  There is certainly a need for this society to harness the undoubted energy and ability of people over 65 but that does not mean that we should accept the Schedule in the terms in which the Minister has outlined it to us.  I fully support the very reasonable amendment to reduce it to the age of 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that has escaped Deputies is that there is an upper age limit but there is no indication that the Minister would refuse to appoint somebody who is 20 years of age.  There is simply an upper age limit of 70 mentioned in the Bill.  As Deputy Horgan interpreted it, one would think that I was in the business of establishing a gerontocracy. I am saying that anybody from 18 to 70 may be appointed, any person from the youngest to age 70 may hold this office.  I cannot understand how anybody can see that as an indication that the Minister will appoint somebody who is unable to do this very important job.  I cannot see that there is a bias in favour of the latter period of the 18-70 range rather than the earlier period.  I do not think anything in the Bill gives any grounds for that interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> This is a position that will require a great deal of time.  It is not a position from which a person may make a living; it is a part-time position, a position where experience in handling people, knowledge of public affairs and of matters educational is important.  It is a position where familiarity with the technological and commercial range covered by the institute, which will be changing like Proteus before our very eyes, where acquaintance with that world is very important.  It is difficult to find somebody at the beginning of his career with that kind of time and that kind of experience.  So, we left the upper limit at 70 so that if an experienced, active and vigorous person should be available he should be allowed to act up to that age.  It is no lack of confidence in our young people; in fact it is the reverse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
      <P>In page 10, Article 3 (1), line 40, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to add &ldquo;only on the grounds of dereliction of duty as a member.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates again to the removal from office by the Government of an ordinary member of the governing body.  The Government on the recommendation of the Minister has the facility of removing from office any member it sees fit on the <Col N="790" /> whim of the Government.  I think that is wrong in principle.  A person who has been appointed to be a member of the governing body for, say, a period of five years should except in a very certain and positive circumstances have the right to serve that five year period.  I am seeking to ensure that by specifying that the ordinary member can only be removed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister on the ground of dereliction of duty as a member.  That is very important qualification in regard to the removal of a member.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to note in this Schedule that the Government, on the recommendation of the Minister, are taking to themselves wide and sweeping powers in relation to the appointing to and removing from office of the chairman and members of the governing body.  That is unfortunate and unnecessary.  There should be a principle whereby a person appointed for five years should be allowed to serve out the term for which he was appointed except in very exceptional circumstances.  I am trying to reinforce that principle in my amendment.  I believe that section 3 (1) as it now stands is wrong in principle and needs amendment. I recommend my amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Governments do not have whims.  The Government will not take any action which would not be soundly based and dereliction of duty would be one and probably the most important reason for the removal from office of a member of a governing body. Something that has come to the notice of the Government very often is that people accept membership of bodies and then are not very good attenders.  The Government should be free, if they see that a person is not attending, to remove that person.  I do not know whether you would call that dereliction of duty or not&mdash;I am sure it is.  I cannot see any other reason for removal except dereliction of duty.  The dereliction might not be intentional; it could result from ill-health or other inhibiting factors such as residence factors and so on.  It is my contention that the power should rest with <Col N="791" /> the Government to remove somebody from office when satisfied that person was no longer a fit member for the governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly take the point that there should be powers of removal but my contention is that these powers must be specific and confined to certain circumstances.  Section 3 (1) as it now stands is not satisfactory and is open to abuse.  I do not say that the present Minister or Government would do any obnoxious thing but as the Schedule now stands it is open-ended and it does allow a Government at its will and pleasure to appoint or remove ordinary members of the governing body.  That is not satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the increased postal, telephone and telex charges which will give rise to increased costs in business and industry and a general rise in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>These charges follow swiftly on increases brought in last autumn.  As early as 1 August 1979 we had increases in postal rates and as late as 1 October 1979 we had increases in telephone rates.  We regard these charges as being too great and unnecessary, particularly as the services are not operated properly by the governing body, that is the Government, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without protesting that these increases were not presented to the National Prices Commission for scrutiny and for a report, as is normal in such cases.  I would like the Minister to explain specifically why the National Prices Commission were not asked to comment, to report and to <Col N="792" /> sanction the increases in question.  Increases introduced by the Coalition and previous Governments had to be scrutinised by the commission.  I understand they were not even informed that these increases were being imposed, other than by the information which we and the public received last February when the Minister for Finance made his Financial Statement.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to move that legislation be brought in to make it obligatory that such price increases be vetted by the commission and that there will be no side-stepping of the issues involved.  It appears that this procedure was adopted because of the probability of severe criticism for the way these services are being managed.  In recent years we heard criticism of the way these services have deteriorated while costs have risen sharply. It is time a halt was called to the continuing price rises and that the public get an improved service.  These two factors are a cause of great concern.</P>
    <P>We read of major losses by the postal and telephone services in recent years where previously a reasonable financial position was attained.  What was the cause of these major losses?  We can only pass the blame back to the Minister who has overall responsibility for the operation of those services.</P>
    <P>Why do the Department not submit annual accounts to let us know where and why the losses are being incurred. As spokesman for Fine Gael I have never seen a statement of account from that Department.  I do not have a break down of the losses in question.  On what services are these losses incurred?  As the ultimate body, in terms of responsibility, we should be entitled to that information. Again, I ask the Minister to tell us why annual accounts are not furnished by his Department.  How can we examine the weak factors in the Department, or how can we pinpoint the loss-making areas if accounts are not presented?</P>
    <P>Every semi-State body are obliged to print their annual accounts, although some of them are quite slow in doing so. We hear objections about these delays <Col N="793" /> from time to time and in one case we had a delay in excess of a year.  Despite this, at least their reports are published.  If an annual report of the Department were published, we would be familiar with the activities and the loss-making areas in the Department.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that when a business is losing money, it can be put down to the management and operation of the firm, rather than any other reason, such as a basic non-profitability venture.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be a profit-making concern.  Our commercial banks are reputed to have a licence for printing money but the Department operate three very potentially profit-making operations&mdash;the post office, the telephone service and the telex system.</P>
    <P>These are all potential money markers.  Why are they losing so much and why are the losses increasing annually? As late as 1977 the postal service was making a profit.  The prediction for 1980 is that losses will be heavy.  The estimate given by some sources in the Department is that it will be around £14 million.  The loss in 1979 was given as £12 million.  It was an extraordinary change from 1977 when the postal service made a profit to the loss making situation in 1979 where there was a loss of £12 million.  I am aware that 1979 was a difficult year.  The difficulties were extreme in that we had a protracted and very unnecessary postal strike.  But that is not the whole story because, according to the information given out here during Question Time, the strike cost the Post Office a total of £13 million in revenue but the savings as a result of the strike due to non-payment of wages and salaries amounted to £10 million.  So the nett loss appears to be £3 million but the loss was actually £12 million.</P>
    <P>The losses have a predictable trend.  In relation to the whole telecommunications system, together with the postal service, the losses ranged from £19 million in 1978 to £29 million in 1979 and it is estimated that the loss will be as high as £33 million in 1980.  According to a recent report from the Government Information <Col N="794" /> Services, losses are expected to continue at a higher rate in 1981 unless increases such as those at present proposed by the Minister are introduced. In relation to that point there is one thing which irks me and other Members on this side of the House although it may seem petty; that is that this press release was issued last Friday week, 16 May, and it was not at any stage on that date or since made available to Opposition Deputies.  It is the least the Minister might do, as a matter of courtesy, to let us have the relevant press release immediately it is made available to the press, especially when it concerns an area in which we are spokesmen.</P>
    <P>We condemn these increases for the reasons that I have outlined.  We fail to see why services which were profit-making three years ago when we were in Government have now become heavy loss makers.  We have had nothing during the past three years from successive Fiannna Fáil Ministers except promises that the service is going to be improved, that we are in for a new era in the posts and telegraphs sector.  These promises have not been fulfilled.  The telephone and postal service are in a worse state today than they have been at any time during the past three years.  As late as last Saturday, 24 May, we read headlines such as &ldquo;Post Office Workers Morale at Lowest Ebb&rdquo;, in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, and &ldquo;Morale in Post Office Lowest Ever&rdquo;, in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  The outgoing president of the Post Office Staffs Association, Mr. G.W. Biddulph, at their annual conference in Wexford said that last year's Post Office strike was the inevitable result of unrealistic industrial relations in a public service which has been brought to a point of collapse by uncaring people in positions of authority. That statement is very pertinent.  He said also that this reflected an attitude of political rigidity by the responsible Government Ministers of the time towards pay in the Public Sector.  He said that the terms under which the dispute had been settled had done little to redress the sense of grievance and hostility nurtured by the strikers during the 19 weeks of the dispute.  That statement, <Col N="795" /> while it may appear to be very strong, sums up the problem within the Department in a succinct manner.  It is probably the underlying reason why the loss making situation within the Depart-ment which has increased over the past two years, would, were it not for these enormous increases of 20 and 25 per cent, continue to increase more and more as the years go on.  Have we any guarantees that with these increases the losses will not continue at a greater rate than has been the case over the past three years?</P>
    <P>There is an alarming trend which was brought home to us here last week at Question Time and that trend is the reducton in revenue within the Post Office. That reduction in revenue could very well be due to the increases which were brought in in recent years, the latest on 1 August and on 1 October last.  Is there consumer resistance to the charges being made by the Post Office?  That may well be the case.  In reply to a Dáil Question here last week we were told that the revenue from the sale of stamps in 1978 was £40.5 million and that that had been reduced in 1979 to £30.6 million, a decrease of £10 million.  I know there was a strike but, with increased rates in the Post Office and the subpost offices not being directly involved, we would have felt that the decrease in revenue from stamps sales would not have been of that magnitude, 33? per cent.  Is there a tendency for the public to use the postal services here at a lesser rate than was previously the case? It may well be that that is correct and if it is it is an alarming situation because up to a couple of years ago we were proud to have the best postal service in the world.  But, as was admitted in recent weeks by Mr. F. Quinn, the man who was put in charge of the interim board, An Bord Phoist, to look into the operations of the postal service, the public have lost confidence in the postal service.</P>
    <P>The drastic delays which have been evident since the postal strike have given rise to a loss of confidence and consequent <Col N="796" /> reduction in the usage of these services by the public.  This is a very sad situation which has arisen because of inefficiency at the top and a lack of leadership and motivation.  The Minister must heed the public who are saying more and more loudly that all we have had from this Minister and his predecessor are promises.  There has been no improvement in the postal, telephone and telex services and the greatest deterioration has been in the telephone sector.</P>
    <P>I am not dealing with fools and idiots and I will not insult their intelligence by describing how bad the telephone service is.  We all know it is chronic.  We wish the Minister to make a clear statement of his intentions with regard to improvements and to live up to that statement.  Since the manifesto was published more than three years ago we have had nothing but promises of major improvements, but the reality is that the service has gone from bad to worse.  As spokesman in this area for the Fine Gael Party I receive an ever-increasing number of complaints about the poor quality of service or the complete lack of service.  If the Minister looks at today's Order Paper he will see a series of questions from Deputies representing a large number of constituencies regarding unsatisfactory telephone services, inconvenience being caused to industry and the public, and business being disrupted because of the poor quality of the telephone service. Some of these questions have been put down by Deputies from the Minister's side of the House.</P>
    <P>There is no sign of an end to the deterioration which has been occurring. The Minister should state how he intends to arrest that deterioration and improve services.  We are fed up hearing about the £650 million to which the Minister refers in his amendment.  We have not seen any evidence of that money being spent.  People working in the Minister's Department say that they have not adequate stores and cannot even get ordinary cabling wire used to connect a telephone to an exchange.  They cannot even get telephone instruments.  In many <Col N="797" /> cases there are delays of up to six months and then they may not receive goods they have ordered.  There seems to be a work-to-rule within certain sections of the Department which further accentuates these delays.  The Minister must step in and improve morale and provide the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Killilea, told me last week in the course of replies to a number of questions that in one small rural area there was a waiting list of 440.  In reply to another question we were told that the average waiting time was two years.</P>

      <P>The essence of the matter is that the public object to paying increases of 20 per cent for postal services and 25 per cent for telephone services while the service is still inferior.  I do not believe people would be so irate and so reluctant to pay increases of this magnitude if the services were adequate. Quite obviously they are totally inadequate. If one picks up a telephone in Leinster House and endeavours to make a call there is a reasonable chance that one will find oneself listening in to a conversation between two other people. When dialling an outside number in a provincial exchange the chances are that the engaged tone will be heard before the dialling is complete.  In country areas where there is a manual exchange it could take 20 or 30 minutes to get through to the operator.  These inadequacies are absolutely infuriating and it is not surprising that there are complaints and condemnations of increases in charges.  The public are reasonable and anybody in business knows that they will respond when a good effort is made.  However, telephone subscribers have reached the end of their patience with the telephone service being provided.  It is obvious that insufficient money is being spent on that service to <Col N="798" /> allay their fears that things will not improve.</P>
      <P>We do not have to back on Mr. Biddulph's statement in Wexford on Satur-day to know that the morale in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is extremely low.  The leadership must come from the Minister.  From my experience those employed in the Department are a fine cross section of the Irish public and to get the best returns in terms of effort and productivity they must be treated properly.  It is obvious that the staff relations section within the Department leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister make it his business to see that staff relations are improved. He should also see to it that working conditions are improved and that people with qualifications in the Department are properly paid.  There is continuous objection from technicians and qualified people in the clerical section of the Department that they are not being paid at a rate comparable to those in other parts of the public sector.  Until those injustices are rectified I do not think it will be possible to get a proper response from the personnel in the Department.  The Minister has a duty to see to it that such people are properly looked after.  He is not doing so at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the losses of the Department and the projected figures for 1980 and 1981.  The Minister should tell the House what he expects the increased charges to yield in a full financial year. He should also tell us whether he expects to break even, make a profit or suffer a loss in 1981, the first full financial year when the increases will operate. The Minister has told us that the increases in the usage of telephones is expected to rise annually by 12 per cent. With such a growth rate one would expect that with proper organisation, a good state of morale and good staff relations that section would at least break even.  We have given our support to the report of the review body which investigated the state of the post and telegraphs system here.  We believe that report moves in the right direction and I <Col N="799" /> understand that people in the Post Office are also happy with it.  It suggests that two separate boards be established in the Department and that an element from the private sector be introduced so that those sections can be established on a proper business footing.  That is what we fully support.</P>
    <P>Some of the increases are unnecessarily great and I am afraid that they will represent an inhibiting factor in the growth of business in the postal service. The raising of the price of the ordinary stamp from 12p to 15p is drastic and the decision to increase the charge for parcel postage by 25 per cent is more drastic still.  The increases in telephone charges are higher again.  A local call will now cost 10p instead of 5p, an increase of 100 per cent.  The Minister stated that the reason for this was they had found for technical reasons that it would not be possible to introduce a rate between 5p and 10p.  That sounds peculiar particularly when one considers that up to now coin boxes were capable of taking 1p and 2p pieces.  The Minister should give us a rational explanation as to why there are technical reasons which will prohibit any rate other than 10p.</P>
    <P>I dislike the decision to increase the connection charge for telephones from £60 to £100, a pretty hefty charge which is well in excess of an increase of 60 per cent.  The new connection charge represents a big sum for most people to pay at one time.  I find it particularly objectionable in regard to the telephone subsidy scheme.  Those who can pay the connection charge and who are eligible for that scheme get a subsidy towards the rental of the telephone but how many old age pensioners living alone will be able to find £100?  From my experience this represents a great set back to that scheme.  It will be almost impossible for these people to raise that amount of money.  The Minister should have exempted such people and I implore him to have a rethink about that increase in relation to those who qualify for the rental subsidy.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and <Col N="800" /> Telegraphs are antiquated.  For that reason I look forward to the setting up of the new boards.  I ask the Minister to bring the telephone section of the Department out to meet the public face to face. I made that plea to the Minister some months ago and he made reference to it recently.  How can the public operate, complain about or deal with a service that does not work satisfactorily if it is not possible for them to meet those who manage that service face to face?  Commercial banks face their customers and so also do those involved in the postal service.  Anybody anxious to make a complaint about the telephone service must make a telephone call and after hanging on for about 20 minutes one can expect a most impersonal reaction to that complaint.  It is time that complaints about the telephone service were dealt with in the same way as other parts of the public sector.  The Minister should establish telephone offices in the main towns where subscribers and potential subscribers, can communicate with the managers for the area.  It is not satisfactory that people should be obliged to deal with such complaints by telephone or by post.  Recently the Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, told the House that in one quarter alone there were 72,000 queries in his Department.  The Minister of State is shaking his head.  I should like to refer him to an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 24 April where he stated that of 72,000 queries received some 15,000  to disputed meter call charges.</P>
    <P>It is time a more personal relationship was formed between the Minister's Department, especially in the telephone sector, and the public.  We would not be bringing in this motion if a satisfactory service was provided.  It is not being provided and therefore we condemn any increased charges when we have an inadequate system.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" />&ldquo;takes note of the commitment of the Government to spend £650 million on telephone development over the next 5 years and of the decision to increase postal and telecommunication charges from 1 July 1980, so that consistent with the principle accepted by successive Governments the services will be self-supporting and the burden of making good a deficit on the operation of the services will not have to be borne by the taxpayer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Deasy and at times I wondered whether he was trying to condem the increased charges or not because it was noticeable that quite a substantial amount of the time he used was in an attempt to criticise the telecommunications service, postal service, the staff who work under difficult conditions.</P>

      <P>He should do what I did when I took over as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs: go down to the central telephone exchange in Dublin and in other areas, go into the sorting offices and post offices and see at first hand the difficult working conditions that exist and try and familiarise himself with the telecommunications service and its problems.  I do not deny there are problems but if the Deputy took the opportunity to familiarise himself with them he would not make many of the statements he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> I can understand his approach to it because the working of the amendment I moved, except where we are spending £650 million over the next five years, is exactly the same as the amendment put down by his colleague, Deputy Ryan, former Minister for Finance when he introduced increased charges of a much larger proportion during their term in office. During the four-year period of the Coalition Government, post office charges were revised four times.  That was an average of one a year.  The present motion by Fine Gael would not appear to be consistent with the decisions of that Government, of which they were the dominant party, in regard to post office charges.</P>
    <P>The principle has been accepted by successive Governments that post office services should pay their way and not place a burden on taxpayers.  In practice, this principle has not been strictly observed each year but it has been accepted as reasonable that in the long run, taking one year with another, the principle should be maintained.  It is only in the last decade that the Exchequer has subsidised the use of post office services to any substantial extent.  The subsidisation which has occurred has simply been due to the effects of rapid inflation and Departmental costs.</P>
    <P>The higher charges which are to come into effect on 1 July have been criticised on the grounds that they are too big and come too soon after last year's increases. I will deal later with the justification for them but this is only the second increase since the Coalition Government left of-fice three years ago.</P>

      <P>One would naturally expect that higher increases would be needed if there was a longer interval between revisions than there was during the period of Coalition Government when charges were revised once a year on average.  How does this Government's increase compare with the last two of the previous Government?  Last year we had increases averaging 20 per cent in postal and telecommunications charges.  This year they average 25 per cent for postal and 20 per cent for telecommunications.  On the other hand postal charges were increased by 30 per cent and telecommunications by 35 per cent from 1 January 1976.  There were further increases of 13 per cent for postal and 25 per cent for telecommunications as and from 1 April 1977. These figures speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy can find a magic formula for that for heaven's sake present it and stop the interruptions. This motion criticises the new charges because it claims they will give rise to increased costs in business and industry and a general rise in the cost of living.  I regret that they will lead to some increases in the costs of business and industry. Their effect, however, will be much less than that of the bigger increases which applied from 1 January 1976 under the previous Government. All users will be affected by the new charges but not to the same extent. Moreover, for the great majority of businesses post office charges account for a very small part of their costs.  I could not agree that the new charges will cause hardship to the poor or less well off sections.  I am informed that the postal increases will add 0.06 per cent to the consumer price index and the telecommunications increases 0.10, making a total addition of 0.16 or one-sixth of 1 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deasy raised the question why these charges were not referred to the National Prices Commission. As they have often pointed out, price increases are the symptom of inflation not the cause of it.  Higher post office increases are necessary because inflation has already increased the Department's costs to such an extent that the present charges for the services it provides are uneconomic.  If this happened to a business firm it would either have to increase its charges to an economic level or cease the loss-making <Col N="805" /> service.  We all have a fair idea of the answer we would get from firms in the private sector were we to suggest that they should continue charging uneconomic prices because any increase would give rise to increased costs in business and industry and a general rise in the cost of living.  Yet the supporters of this motion should realise that this is what happened.  This is what happened when those people opposite put them up through the ceiling during their period in office.  Indeed, they seem to forget that we are living in the world of the eighties. I do not know what world those Deputies opposite are living in.</P>
      <P>In the press release concerning the new charges it was explained that the postal increases were needed mainly because of pay increases but that the telephone increases were required to cover pay increases and higher interest and depreciation costs.  The press release pointed out also that the accelerated telephone development programme approved last July would cost £650 million over five years and that this would give rise to heavier interest and depreciation costs estimated at £67 million in 1980 and £85 million in 1981 as against £41 million in 1978.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy raised the question of his being furnished with a copy of the press release beforehand.  I understand that it has not been normal practice in the House but I will be only too glad to oblige him in the future.</P>

      <P>At the same time. Well, I shall be only too glad to oblige him in the future.  As recently as 14 May 1980 Deputy John Kelly, speaking on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, criticised the targets of this programme as set out in the White Paper.  He considered the proposed rate of progress much too slow.  He would prefer a concrete promise from the responsible Minister that all outstanding telephone applications would be met by the end of this year.  To quote from what he said, at <Col N="806" /> column 1637, Volume 320, No. 10 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I am not asking for two months or six weeks.  I want the outstanding ones dealt with, and I want them dealt with now.</P>
      <P>Here I should like to refer to the background of the Government's decision to improve the accelerated telephone development programme.  I want to emphasise the statement of policy which I delivered to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis last February.</P>

For the very first time in this Department I set up a planning unit, a unit that is monitoring the progress not alone of the huge building programme but of the equipment and telephone installations.

      <P>The cost of this accelerated programme was estimated at £650 million, at 1979 costs, and the review group's view was that about five years was the shortest time for carrying it out.  That view was accepted.</P>
      <P>Part of the functions of the new telecommunications body will be to develop appropriate financing arrangements for the accelerated programme. But, in the meantime, the Exchequer this year has made available £100 million&mdash;and somebody said there was no money being put into the telephone service this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on telephone development because I cannot let Fine Gael get away with the idea that, on the one hand, they can condemn increases in charges needed to enable the telephone service to pay its way and, on the other hand, argue that the Government should press on at an even faster <Col N="810" /> pace with telephone development which is one of the heaviest users of capital in the State.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is a very important part of our national economic infrastructure, particularly from the point of view of industrial development and foreign trade.  It is vital, therefore, that its development should not be hindered by increasing financial deficits.  Let me be clear on this.  No Minister for Finance could reasonably be expected to provide the very large sums now needed from the Exchequer to develop the telephone service if it did not pay its way.  In recent years a substantial amount has been borrowed from the European Investment Bank, and grants have been obtained also from the European Regional Development Fund for telephone projects. In future we could not rely on these sources of funds unless we took steps to avoid the substantial deficits which are now facing us.</P>
    <P>In my view it is vital that there should be no let up in our efforts to improve and extend our telecommunications service. Therefore, it is important that charges be increased to a level which will bring income for that service into line with expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will realise that 1978 and 1979 were abnormal years for the Department because of industrial disputes.  These disputes inflated the overall deficits in both years, by about £7 million in 1978 and about £4 million in 1979.  The fact remains, <Col N="811" /> however, that there was an overall deficit of about £19 million in 1978, of which all but £3 million was on the telecommunications side.  The overall deficit for 1979 is estimated at about £29 million, including a deficit of about £17 million on telecommunications.</P>
      <P>The increases of 20 per cent in charges, which applied from 1 August 1979 in the case of postal services and from 1 October 1979 in the case of telecommunications, were interim increases. When it was decided to bring them in, it was realised that they would not be high enough to wipe out the deficits that were forecast for 1979 and 1980, but the Government were reluctant to introduce higher increases at that time while the services being provided for the public were still suffering from the effects of the industrial disputes.</P>
      <P>Since then costs have continued to rise with the result that in the early part of this year it became apparent that, on the basis of existing pay and other costs, the overall deficit for 1980 would be about £33 million, of which £14 million would be on the postal side and the balance on telecommunications.  It was clear that the overall deficit for 1981 would be still higher if no increases in pay were granted in the meantime.  In the circumstances it was decided that increases, averaging 25 per cent for postal services and 20 per cent for telecommunications services, should be introduced. The original intention was that the revised postal charges should apply from 1 May and other charges from 1 July but, as the standard of service on the postal side still left much to be desired, it was decided to defer introduction of the revised postal charges until 1 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the postal service is concerned, the hard financial fact is that it faces very high deficits both this year and next year.  The last year in which a surplus on the postal service was recorded was 1977, when it amounted to £1.2 million. In 1978, there was a deficit of £2.9 million.  For last year the provisional <Col N="812" /> figures we have indicate that income fell short of expenditure by £11.8 million. Without allowing for any further wage increases, the forecast deficit for the current year was about £14 million, or slighly over 25 per cent of expected postal revenue at the existing charges. The outlook for 1981 was even worse. Clearly, this seriously deteriorating trend could not be allowed to continue.  I want to make it clear that we are not attempting to recover past deficits.  Even with the higher charges there will be a substantial postal deficit this year, and next year the deficit is likely to be sizeable, though I hope by much reduced proportions.</P>
    <P>I could not agree that these deficits should be borne by the taxpayer.  As I said at the outset, it has been accepted policy over the years that the cost of Post Office services should be met by users of these services.  This policy seems to be to be very well founded.  I can see no justification for asking taxpayers at large, who use the Post Office services in varying degrees, to accept the additional burden of meeting the loss on either the postal services or the telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>Moreover, if services were provided below cost, the demand for them would be distorted, stimulated by the maintenance of artificially low charges.  Apart from the general case for pricing on a realistic basis, there is the serious objection to artificially low prices, that they cause a diversion of capital and labour resources to meet an artificial demand. In the case of the telecommunications services particularly this would be very serious because of the huge amounts of capital involved.  It is hard enough to find the capital required to meet the general needs for telecommunications services and it would be an entirely unjustifiable waste if scarce moneys were to be diverted to meeting artificially stimulated demands.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, in a situation in which there is serious difficulty in meeting the demand for telephones it would be impossible to justify encouraging further demand by offering services <Col N="813" /> well below cost.  The argument does not apply with the same force to the postal services, but it cannot be realistic to abandon commercial principles in a business where over 70 per cent of demand comes from the business and administrative sectors.</P>
    <P>As every Deputy knows, preparations are being pressed ahead to set up the postal and telecommunications services as separate organisations outside the civil service, as recommended by the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group. The new State-sponsored bodies must be set up on a basis which gives them a fair chance of success.  This requires that charges for the postal and telecommunications services should be fixed at levels which enable these services to pay their way.</P>
    <P>When we look at the charge of 15p for the ordinary letter here with what is charged by some of our partners in the EEC we compare very favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>When we consider that our population is so sparse, so diverse and so scattered is it unreasonable to charge 15p to post a letter in Kerry tonight and have it delivered in Donegal tomorrow?  That is good value in relation to 16p for a Kitkat or 20p for a daily newspaper.  It is time we began to be realistic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the business we are in.  Deputy Deasy referred to the Postal and Telecommunications Board. We cannot start them off on a wrong footing.  It is my duty and responsibility to ensure that they are set up on a proper commercial basis.  Deputies opposite should be realistic.  They should come clean with the public and they will be seen as a party of reality, not a party of unreality and inconsistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that increases in postal charges could be <Col N="814" /> avoided by economising in expenditure.  I am satisfied there is no scope for the scale of savings which would be needed to bring deficits down to manageable proportions unless drastic reductions in services were made.  I do not believe the public or the business community in particular, would stand for the type of service reductions which would be needed to make a sizeable impression on the deficits now facing the postal service. The importance of an efficient postal service to industry, tourism and the export trade was underlined by last year's postal strike.  Reductions in services of the order needed to produce substantial savings would materially curtail facilities for the user and they could not be made quickly because of the detailed re-organisation work which would be in-volved. Moreover, it would be essential to lay off large numbers of employees.  Is that what Deputies are advocating here tonight?</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of saving expenditure where this can be done reasonably.  Considering the financial difficulties of the postal services, commonsense dictates that there should be a strong emphasis on making them as cost-effective as possible.  The savings that are possible on this basis can be secured only in the long term.  As one example, I may mention our motorisation policy with regard to rural delivery services, started in 1963, which is now producing economies in the order of £1 million a year.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the people opposite are not seriously suggesting that we can keep charges at the levels they have been.  They have asked me to provide leadership in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I am providing that leadership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

      <P>I will continue to provide that leadership.  Deputies over there have said that during their term in office these services paid their way.  I refer Deputy Deasy to a little white booklet and if he cares to look it up he <Col N="815" /> will find that money was lost during the four years of the Coalition Government. I will not give the figures because I do not want to embarrass them.  They put up the charges 100 per cent but they still lost money.  My business is to get the service back to normal.  That is what the public want.  I am providing the leadership.  I will provide the capital.  I am getting the response from the staff. Let Deputies opposite not try to drag the staff into the mud.

      <P>It is the usual practice that a Deputy who has not been interrupting will not be interrupted.  Nobody more than I wishes the Department of Posts and Telegraphs more luck in their efforts to get on the straight and narrow. However, always during debates here on matters affecting that Department we seem to get into a political muddle and instead of trying seriously to debate the matters which affect the Department we <Col N="816" /> finish up trying to score political points against each other.  This having been begun by other speakers tonight, I am afraid there is not any way in which the debate can be continued without certain comments already made being referred to.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister came here and while the Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, was in the other House, many matters were discussed here, and because the party those two Deputies represent were on this side then, it is a pity they were not here to hear the things that were said when increased charges were proposed.  If they had been here then they would be a bit more careful with quotations in the House.</P>
      <P>As far as these increases are concerned, one of the things I cannot accept is that the Minister left it so long after the budget to announce the increases.  I am quite satisfied that during the debate in Cabinet on the budget the prospect of these increases came up for discussion. It must have been well known on budget day that it was proposed to introduce this mini-budget at a later stage which would cause gasps of astonishment from people when they read in the newspapers that these increases were being imposed. I will not criticise the staff.  I do not believe the staff should be criticised, and I want to be fair to my colleague on this side and say that I do not agree that Deputy Deasy said what the Minister alleged he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to increases imposed by the previous Government.  As Fianna Fáil speakers so frequently say when they refer to increases imposed in previous years, the Minister spoke as if increases imposed in previous years had been wiped out by Fianna Fáil.  I should like to point out that the increases now imposed are on top of anything imposed in previous years.  That should be remembered because people try to gloss it over.  The big trouble in this country as far as I know&mdash;I have been a long time in the House and I have been watching Department of Posts and Telegraphs debates here&mdash;is that there was not enough money made available to Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs for many years under Fianna Fáil administration.  During the four years of the Coalition Government substantial increases in finance were given to the Department <Col N="818" /> but they were not nearly enough to bring the Department back on an even keel.</P>
      <P>If I have time I always view on television the political parties at their Ard Fheiseanna.  Sometimes I am impressed by what they do and say&mdash;sometimes I am amazed by what they say.  Without being disrespectful to the Minister, the figures he has been using remind me of having gone to a bingo session once&mdash;I do not like bingo&mdash;where somebody was picking up a ball and calling out a number. The Minister has been doing that.  He used a series of numbers at the Ard Fheis and again tonight which did not bear any relation to what production in this country will be.  If we are all alive we can debate this matter again at the end of the year and see whether the Minister is right or I am right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that at the end of the year there will be 60,000 additional phones, all of them working. Perhaps the Minister does not know but he should know it, that apart from the vandalised phones throughout towns and cities and in rural areas many telephones have never worked from the day they were installed.  Perhaps to the surprise of some Deputies, I read the <i>Evening Press.</i>  In that newspaper we get numerous complaints every evening and at least two or three of them are about telephones.  The people who make those complaints must have cause for making them.  Such complaints have been made about four times in the past fortnight. The telephones had never worked.  There is something wrong with the telephones or with the persons who instal them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come to the phones that have been installed during the years. Reference was made this evening to the telephones in Leinster House.  In the room which I occupy with other Deputies the number has to be dialled ten times to get calls, even local calls.  As I have said, I have nothing against the people who make the repairs, but this is where the catch comes in.  We have in-stalled phones&mdash;Fianna Fáil did it and <Col N="819" /> we did it&mdash;but there has not been service because the necessary equipment was not there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be there shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be there.  The Minister spoke about providing an extra 60,000 telephones but the necessary equipment is not available to service them.  If a person using a private telephone dials a number he is entitled to get that number and to carry on a conversation without being interrupted.  As I said earlier, it is very common to find a conversation going on when one dials a number or else to have some other person come in on the line.  Worse than that, it is not unusual to hear somebody clicking in on the line; it could be somebody who wants to hear a conversation, it could be accidental or it could be a tap on the line.  The Minister need not wave his hands at me because I know what I am talking about.  At one time I was in a section where I learned enough about telephones to know when somebody is trying to be smart.  An effort is being made to overhear telephone conversations and that should not be allowed to continue.  Complaints were made recently and, as a result, a telephone that was subject to those interruptions is now quite clear.  The Minister can work that out for himself.</P>
      <P>People are paying for a service and they are entitled to it.  As of now they are not getting that service.  In my opinion telephone operators are subjected to a lot of abuse.  I accept that people may lose their temper if they are cut off when making a telephone call or if they have to wait a long time but it is unfair to abuse telephone operators who are doing their best.  The responsibility lies with the present Government and the previous Government because they did not supply the equipment yet here we are talking about additional lines while we are not providing a service for the people who have telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that complaints from people about delay in providing a service were holding up the <Col N="820" /> provision of such a service.  I agree with him.  However, can we blame a person who has waited seven years for a telephone if he asks a public representative to find out what is happening?  I cannot understand when it is said to people in certain areas that phones cannot be provided.  I know of one case which I brought to the notice of the Department where a number of people could not get telephones but neighbours who had not even moved into their new houses got telephones installed before they took up occupation.  Within a few months phones were provided for practically everybody in the area but I do not think it is right that this kind of thing should happen.  It is a grand idea to say that we must make the telephone service pay but the cost to industry in particular and also to private individuals will be great.  I do not think it right that the increases should be imposed until such time as the Minister provides a decent service.  That has not been the case.</P>
    <P>I ran an office for a considerable period and I found that when postal charges increased by one or two pennies in the old currency, after a very short time I noticed a considerable difference in costings.  On one occasion, as a public representative I was asked to make representations to the then Fianna Fáil Minister on behalf of a charitable organisation who found that their expenses had risen very considerably.  Here we have what can be described as a substantial increase in the postal charges. The Minister spoke about posting a letter in Dublin today and having it delivered tomorrow in Donegal.  I can give him an instance of letters posted last Wednesday in Navan that were delivered yesterday to their destination six miles away. The postal service is not perfect&mdash;there is a lot of work to be done yet.  I understand the Minister drives around the country posting letters to himself and I am sure the exercise does him good.</P>
    <P>When the British were put out of the country we took over the postal service where the employees were a contented group.  However, they dropped behind in wages and conditions and last year the <Col N="821" /> Minister's predecessor, a personal friend of mine, allowed a situation to develop that should not have happened.  He allowed a strike to take place that caused untold misery throughout the country and at the end he offered the people concerned terms that would have prevented the strike taking place if they had been offered originally to the employees. However, he let the strike drag on.  It is all right for the Taoiseach to talk about the former Government as though he had nothing to do with them.  They were still a Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister was told by the Government to keep his fist in the hole, like the boy at the dyke.  He was told that if he allowed increases for the postal service there would be a wave of increases throughout the country.  Eventually such increases <Col N="822" /> were claimed and the postal service came in last.  As a result, there was a breakdown in trust on the part of the employees in the postal service and it will take a long time to build it up again.  I hope the Minister will make an effort to remedy this situation but it does not look as if that is happening.  As of now, the makings of a dispute are simmering. None of us wants to see this but it is likely to happen.  My colleagues on the left referred to the way industrial labour matters are dealt with in the Department.</P>

      <P>As I announced on 13 May, interested herdowners, on contacting their local district veterinary office, will be supplied with full details of the conditions attached to registration and an application form.  The herds of successful applicants will be required to comply with certain tests and movement controls.  This will involve an interval of at least three months between the date of acceptance and entry in the register.  Compared with the existing certified herds scheme the more stringent requirements for OBF registration are briefly as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  From date of application for registration no animal may be moved into the applicant's herd unless it comes from an OBF registered herd.</P>

    <P>The Committee are at present considering the implications of EEC Directive 77/504 on pure-bred animals of the bovine species for breeding.  They are also examining beef breeding practices in this country and various aspects of performance testing.</P>
    <P>The committee furnished advice on 22 November 1979 in regard to bull licensing and again on 11 January 1980 on the same subject.  The committee's advice was that bull licensing should continue for the time being and that there must be strict quality control of bulls used for breeding.  I have since met the committee for a discussion and I am considering the whole matter.  Meanwhile I have continued bull licensing for a further year.</P>

      <P>The Beef Management Committee have over the past few months reviewed the level of export refunds for live cattle and for beef.  This review resulted in significant increases being made in the refunds for beef, particularly for chilled and frozen carcases and for chilled boneless cuts.  The refund on live cattle was also increased.  In addition, the list of countries to which refunds apply was extended.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture why the response in Ireland to the EEC schemes for the private storage of beef was so poor in 1979; and, if the price for cattle paid to farmers in 1979 would have been significantly better if these schemes had been more fully availed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1979 a private storage scheme for forequarter beef was introduced and this was followed by a scheme for hindquarter beef in October 1979.  Under these schemes, 3,000 tonnes of forequarters and 2,880 tonnes of hindquarters were removed from the market in Ireland.  While the quantity of beef stored was not as great as had been expected, it is reasonable to assume that producers would have derived some benefit from both schemes.  In view of their restricted nature, however, it is inevitable that private storage schemes can only have a limited effect on prices of cattle.</P>

      <P>To combat the decline in our salmon stocks in recent years additional statutory salmon conservation measures were introduced in 1979. Those measures include an extension of the weekly close time by 24 hours which effectively reduced the salmon fishing period each week during the season from five days to four days.  I am satisfied that this reduction continues to be necessary for salmon conservation purposes.  Accordingly I am not prepared to extend by 12 hours each week the salmon fishing period in the Boyne Estuary.</P>
