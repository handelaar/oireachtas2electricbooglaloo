      <NameTxt>1. Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

      <P>My name appeared in the advertisements inserted by my Department in three Sunday newspapers on 10 February last in my capacity as Minister for Education. The purpose of the advertisements was to alert students to the opportunities available to them in the technological area.  The approximate cost of the advertisements is £10,850.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why he does not consider the services provided for the schools by guidance teachers adequate to supply the information contained in the advertisement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason is that <Col N="1664" /> the Government's policy to expand industry has been so successful that we have to look for people in the technological area to fill jobs requiring this type of expertise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his attention has been drawn to a recent press report (details supplied) stating that the new primary school at Abbeylands, Navan, County Meath has been delayed due to a shortage of money in the Office of Public Works, if he will make a statement on the accuracy of the report and when the building of the school will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the press statement of which details were supplied.  Provision for capital expenditure in primary school building is made from Subhead E of Vote 30: Primary Education.  Expenditure from this subhead is accounted for by my Department and not by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The contract for the building of a new national school at Abbeylands may be placed only after the necessary preliminary procedures in connection with the examination of tenders and acceptance of a suitable tender have been completed.  I am not in a position to state when building work will commence but I anticipate that it will be in the reasonably near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister passed this information to the party faithful yesterday, but when the necessary documents are ready in the next few months will he guarantee that the money will be made available to build the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give that guarantee. I am a little lost by what the Deputy means when he refers to &ldquo;the faithful&rdquo;.  I number Deputy Tully among my faithful.  We belong to the same model body, the National Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer the question I asked him?  Will he make the money available this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the preliminaries <Col N="1667" /> have been gone through and it is ready to start building the money will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the preliminaries which have to be gone through?  Will he state if any of those require action by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The normal preliminaries have to be gone through. In this case, as I said in my reply, the time span should not be very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the preliminaries that have to be gone through?  Presumably the Minister is aware of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he is fully aware of them.  The first and most important one is to examine the tenders and to accept a suitable tender.  As the Deputy knows from experience even in the acceptance of the tender there are certain preliminaries.  There are bonds and so on to be got by the builder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are all the tenders now in?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How long does the Minister expect the examination to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal length of time for such an operation.  As I said in my answer there will not be any undue delay.  Both Deputy Bruton and Deputy Tully are now satisfied.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any danger of that happening.  I would regret it very much if the two excellent schools in Dundrum were affected. Generally, as far as the Dublin city area is concerned, we want more places rather than the danger of one school emptying another.</P>

Arising out of the Deputy's suggestion I will have an inspector examine the school with a view to giving what help we can in the meantime. The Deputy will be aware that there was considerable difficulty in getting the site for this school.  The Deputy knows that a site was offered by a person who then went back on the offer and then the size of the school was changed.  It was thought at one stage that an eight-classroom school would be sufficient.  Now there is a decision for a 12-classroom school.  There was a good deal of delay because of that in regard to planning permission, changing of the site, the size of the school and so on.  The Department of Education are working with all possible speed and I will take up the suggestion of the Deputy with the Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if any analysis has been made of the value of the new curriculum in primary schools, if so, the results of this analysis and the plans, if any, to carry out a complete review of the curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>An analysis was made of the value of the new curriculum in primary schools by Dr. J. Kelleghan and Dr. Patricia Fontes of the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, in 1976. This analysis or evaluation was carried out by issuing to principal teachers a questionnaire relating to implementation of the curriculum and to changes in standards of attainment in schools during the preceding five years.  Replies to this questionnairs were intended to reflect the opinions of all members of school staffs in a representative sample of 489 schools.</P>
      <P>The findings of this evaluation indicate that the new curriculum has had considerable impact on the work of primary schools and that its effects on the attainments of pupils have been largely beneficial.  Particular improvements were noted in the standard of attainment in English, mathematical concepts and in Irish reading.  These findings also report a high degree of agreement with the basic concepts underlying the new curriculum.  A large majority of schools and of teachers were achieving a reasonably high level of implementation of the curriculum as reflected in the basic principles already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the curriculum unit was established in the Department itself, one of the first duties assigned to it was to undertake an on-going in-depth review of the curriculum itself.  The teaching of mathematics was examined in detail by special sub-committee assembled for this purpose.  Tests were administered to pupils in second and fourth classes and a report was published.  It stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that: <Col N="1674" /> the results of the tests show that number facts are well known and that the vast majority of the pupils tested have mastered basic computational skills.</P>
    <P>The second edition of this report will be published shortly.  Reports on the teaching of Irish and physical education have been compiled but as yet have not been published.  As part of the in-depth review of English, tests are currently being administered to pupils of fourth and fifth classes in a representative sample of schools.  A detailed report will issue in due course.</P>
    <P>Each curricular area is being closely studied and carefully evaluated and this process will continue as part of the on-going review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure that I understand the question but there are problems, as the Deputy knows, in a transfer from the child to the teacher centred institution.  It was for that reason that I established a transfers committee to find out how, specifically in reference to the subject matter taught, the transition from primary to post-primary could be done without educationally damaging pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>It is difficult to make comparisons.  Needless to say I can assure the Deputy that I am not satisfied with the amount of money available for anything; no educationalist ever is.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has received representations from the western region BLOE regarding the provision of a synthetic athletic track in the west of Ireland and if he will treat any request for funds for this purpose sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>There are no funds available to me at present from which assistance could be given to such a project.  No decision has been taken to provide such a track at State expense or to provide financial assistance for such a project from funds at my disposal for the general purposes of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is no track north of a line from Galway to Dublin?  If State funds are not available at the moment, will the Minister give this matter priority when State funds become available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of the Deputy that these facilities should be available in the west as they have been made available in other areas in the recent past.  On the other hand, I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the cost of a synthetic track at the moment is £300,000.  While that cost would not prevent me from proceeding with the provision of the facilities, one must have regard for other priorities.  The position at the moment is somewhat better than was the case when I took up office.  We have six synthetic tracks in the country but, of course, I would like if there were more.  I should like the formula which obtained in the matter of the provision of tracks at Cork and Dublin to appear also in the case of the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the part of my question which asked him if he had received representations from the western region BLOE regarding the provision of a synthetic track.  Will the Minister tell the House whether the difficulty in providing the track is purely economic&mdash;we might <Col N="1682" /> understand this given the circumstances&mdash;or whether there is not a mechanism whereby he could transmit money to the west for such a purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that representations have been received from many organisations and from all the public representatives in the west regarding the provision of this facility.  The last question raised by the Deputy had a certain naiveté.  The Deputy knows that what I said to Deputy Kenny still holds.  There are limited funds available and we are endeavouring to get maximum value for them.  At the moment a synthetic track in the west would not be rated by all the athletic interests as the most urgent priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope that day will be soon.  Will the Minister state if it is a question that he has not the statutory authority to make funds available or is it simply that he does not think this matter has a high priority?  His original reply gave the impression that he did not have the authority but now it appears that it is simply a question of priority rather than of authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a synthetic track at Tullamore, Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  When the Deputy held my office there was only one track.  The priority he gave the matter when in office was not as high as he is indicating now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

Nevertheless, it is my view that in the matter of provision of facilities nothing is too good for the west or for other parts of the country.  I would be glad to negotiate with the local authorities or other interests in the west with a view to having this facility provided in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would see it as part of my short-term proposals.  Having regard to the expenditure which has occurred and bearing in mind the investment that has been made and is being made in the provision of recreational and sporting <Col N="1684" /> activities, I would see all the more the need for a national sports stadium.</P>

      <P>At present we are working on the provision of a tartan track at Santry.  We have already spent money on what has been described as a rescue operation.  We are spending at present £450,000&mdash;that is Dublin County Council and Corporation and myself&mdash;in what I am hoping is stage one of the plan towards providing a national sports stadium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will outline his policy for further strengthening the sporting ties with organisations in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy in this area is to encourage dialogue at all levels in order to identify sources of mutual interest and implement agreed schemes of cooperation. <Col N="1685" /> The strengthening of sporting ties was one of an agenda of items which I discussed with Lord Melchett when I visited Northern Ireland in December 1978.</P>
      <P>In the current year I have set aside a sum of £22,000 to subsidise the expenses of youth and sport organisations whose members travel north to engage in sport activities outside their normal programmes.  The question of a common &ldquo;sport for all day&rdquo; is also being examined, at my request, by COSPOIR and the Northern Ireland Sports Council and in addition links between the Ulster way and walking routes in Donegal have been agreed.</P>
      <P>I have invited Lord Elton, the present Minister of State with responsibility for sport, to come to Dublin to discuss further initiatives with me in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any activity towards encouraging schools in the Twenty-six Counties to contact their counterparts in Northern Ireland with a view to strengthening those ties?  Has the Minister made any contact in regard to the provision of an all-Ireland soccer team?  Has he had any contact in regard to the problems which exist in the GAA situation in Crossmaglen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the schools proper, the Deputy will appreciate that I am responsible for dealing with out-of-school activities and my concentration to date has been on voluntary sporting and youth organisations.  I accept that it could also be advisable that this co-operation should exist at school level and I shall have discussions on that matter with the Minister for Education.  In respect of Crossmaglen, when I had discussions with Lord Melchett I indicated to him how unhappy I was with the circumstances obtaining in that area.  He reminded me of the difficulties he would have in the matter in that his responsibility did not extend to security but he assured me that he would do anything possible to have the problem resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to welcome the promise in relation to the Ulster way with which I was associated originally.  When will the actual linking take place and will it require expenditure on either side of the Border and, if so, by whom?

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <P>So far as the western area is concerned I have already taken steps to improve the incomes of farmers in that region by reintroducing the mountain lamb extension scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Following requests early in January for pre-fixation of export refunds on sizeable quantities of butter, particularly to the USSR, the EEC Commission decided to suspend, as from 2 February, refunds in respect of exports of bulk butter to the USSR and most other East European countries and to limit exports to these destinations to butter bought by tender from older intervention stock.  It is possible that the tendering arrangements will shortly be extended to butter in Community-aided private storage.  The first tendering procedure will not be completed until later this month and it is therefore, not possible to indicate the price or quantity involved.</P>
      <P>As only open market butter is available in any quantity for export from Ireland, these Commission decisions effectively rule out Irish butter exports to East Europe in the immediate future.  I have, accordingly, objected to the Commission decision and I am pressing for extension of the export arrangements to open market butter.</P>
      <P>The Community supplies substantial quantities of butter and butter oil to Third World countries in its annual food aid programmes.  Commercial third country markets for butter are very limited and there are more than adequate supplies available in the Community to meet all possible export orders.  All butter for export to destinations other than the USSR and certain East European countries is eligible for the Community export refund of £1,193 per tonne. Previously the same refund applied to all destinations but there is now no refund on exports of bulk butter to the USSR and most other East European countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that this, the first Bill which it is my privilege to introduce as Minister for Social Welfare, is one which will make significant improvements in our social welfare services and be of particular help to those genuinely in need of them.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to speak about the contents of the Bill, perhaps it might be as well if I were to explain to the House why this particular Social Welfare Bill may have an unfamiliar look.  It is bigger than usual and it contains some rather complex sections of a very technical nature.  The main reason for this is that the Bill has been designed to facilitate the consolidation of all social welfare legislation. As Deputies are aware, the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1976, is with the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills but four further statutes have been enacted since it was introduced in 1976.  Arrangements to have these Acts and the present Bill incorporated into the consolidating legislation are well advanced.  As soon as the revised text becomes available, I propose to withdraw the present consolidation Bill and to introduce the revised measure.  This should help the Standing Joint Committee to complete their work more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> The principal technical changes are concerned with the creation of a new Schedule&mdash;the Eighth Schedule&mdash;to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  This Schedule will set out the rates of social assistance payments on the same lines as the rates of social insurance payments are set out in the Third Schedule to that Act by section 15 of the Bill.  Future changes in rates of assistance will thus be possible by amending the Schedule without making changes in the main text of the Act. Before I leave this point, I should mention that none of the technical or structural changes in itself affects entitlements to payments under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Now to the new provisions of the Bill, the main purpose of which is to give effect to the increases in the rates of social welfare payments and other changes in the social welfare schemes announced in the budget.  The explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill sets these out clearly and includes tables which in previous years were incorporated in the text of the Bill itself.  I trust Deputies will have found the memorandum a help in their consideration of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of payment provided during last year were such that the Government's commitment to keep social welfare payments in line with increases in the cost of living was fulfilled and, in addition, real improvements were brought about in the value of these payments. The increases provided for in this Bill, 25 per cent on the long-term payments and 20 per cent on the short-term payments will continue this process.</P>
    <P>People on long-term payments, such as retirement pensioners, old age pensioners and widow pensioners, are generally regarded as requiring special attention in the social welfare context and the desirability of higher increases in their case will be readily conceded by all.</P>
    <P>These percentage increases are additional to the temporary increases provided in October of last year.  Under the terms of the national understanding, increases of the order of 6 per cent were <Col N="1750" /> awarded for the period 1 October 1979 to 31 March 1980.  It has been decided to continue these increases so that the annual rate of increase over the rates provided from April 1979 under last year's budget exceeds 31 per cent for long-term and 26 per cent for short-term payments.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the effect of the increases on individual payments. The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension is being raised by £4.20 to £21 for persons aged under 80 years.  It will go up to £22.50 for persons aged 80 years or over.  The reduced rates of pension payable where weekly means exceed £6 are also being increased.  Steps are again being taken to ease an anomaly which is due to the application, up to last year, of uniform percentage increases to all reduced rates of pension.  This resulted in a scale of means and pensions under which weekly pensions were reduced by £1.40 for every increase of £1 in means. Last year, the amount of the reduction for each £1 increase in means was lowered from £1.40 to £1.30.  The present Bill provides that, as a further step towards achieving a scale where pensions will not be reduced by more than £1 a week for each £1 increase in means, the stages between rates will be lowered to £1.20.  As a result the scale of means and pensions will be stretched to cover six additional rates of pension and reduced rates of pension will be payable up to a means limit of £23.  For a pensioner with qualified children of course, the means limit will be greater than £23.</P>
    <P>The maximum rate of payment in respect of an adult dependant under 66 years of age is being increased by £2.10 to £10.55.  The overall maximum payment for a pensioner with a dependant spouse will, therefore, go up to £31.55 and, where the pensioner is 80 years of age or over, to £33.05.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being raised to £11.75 and in the case of a pensioner living alone, the additional allowance is being increased to £1.65.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> The additions to pension payable to pensioners with qualified children are being raised to £5.70 a week for each of the first two children and to £4.40 a week for each other child.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that statistics and percentages may not be very meaningful to the pensioner who reckons his or her increases in pounds rather than in percentage points.  I am confident, however, that pensioners will consider the cash increases to be significant.  For example, in the case of a married old age pensioner under 80 years of age, the overall increase in pension will be £6.30 per week or £8.40 if his wife has attained age 66. It will be even greater if the pensioner is over 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>This year, in addition to the significant general increases in rates of payment and the adjustments on the scale of means and rates of pension, considerable progress has also been made in removing other anomalies in the social welfare system.  Two improvements being made affect the operation of the Old Age Pensions Acts as they relate to blind persons.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the reduction of the qualifying age from 21 to 18 years.  Generally speaking, children's allowances and increases of any basic pension, benefit, assistance or allowance for which the parents of blind children would qualify under the Acts, are payable only for children under the age of 18.  The reduction in the qualifying age will enable blind pension to be paid to blind persons between the ages of 18 and 21 thereby bridging the gap of three years during which no payment under the social welfare code was available for these persons.  As a corollary, these blind persons will not be treated as qualified children for any of the other schemes.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in Section 5 which will increase the amount of blind person's earnings which may be disregarded in assessing his or her means for pension purposes.  The concession is given in recognition of the special problems which blind persons face in the employment field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> Section 6 of the Bill provides for the increases in the general rates of unemployment assistance.  The increase in the personal weekly rate of assistance will bring the maximum to £17 in urban areas and to £16.45 in rural areas.  The rates for adult dependants are being increased to £12.25 and £11.95 respectively and the rates for dependent children to £5.30 for each of the first two and £4.10 for others.  Thus the rate of assistance for a married couple with two children is being increased to £39.85 in an urban area and to £39.00 in a rural area.</P>
    <P>In the case of smallholders in certain disadvantaged areas, means for unemployment assistance purposes may be assessed notionally by reference to land valuation, where the valuation is £20 or less.  In these cases, special rates of unemployment assistance are payable.  This is a concession having regard both to the present levels of farm incomes and the means test for unemployment assistance generally.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the special rates payable to smallholders who continue to avail of notional assessment will be maintained at the level payable from October 1979, pursuant to the national understanding.  The additional increase of 20 per cent will apply only to those smallholders on factual assessment.  Any smallholder whose means are assessed on a notional basis may have his means assessed on a factual basis if he thinks that this would be to his advantage. There are, in fact, some 3,000 smallholders whose means are assessed on a factual basis and who are receiving unemployment assistance at the rates generally applicable, which from April next will include the 20 per cent increase provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly as regards entitlement to an increase for an adult dependant which affects beneficiaries under the schemes of unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit, invalidity pension, injury benefit and supplementary welfare allowance.  This is being removed by sections 6, 14, 19 and 23 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> A beneficiary under these schemes who is single or widowed, or receiving deserted wife's benefit or allowance, may be paid an increase&mdash;known as a &ldquo;housekeeper's allowance&rdquo;&mdash;in respect of a woman who is wholly or mainly maintained by the beneficiary to have the care of at least one child.  A married man who is separated from his wife cannot receive the allowance, neither can a married woman who is separated from her husband and who, for one reason or another, is not in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or allowance.  The amendments provide for the payment of the &ldquo;housekeeper's allowance&rdquo; to married persons in such circumstances, under the same conditions as apply to any other person entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Two improvements in the unemployment assistance scheme being provided this year are dealt with in sections 7 and 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 increases the amount of yearly earnings from seasonal fishing which may be disregarded in assessing the means of persons for unemployment assistance purposes.  At present, one-half of the income which does not exceed £80 plus one-third of the income which exceeds £80 but does not exceed £200 is disregarded.  It is now proposed to increase these amounts by 50 per cent, making the maximum disregard £120 as against £80 at present.  Persons who are engaged in seasonal fishing earn most of their income in a relatively short period. In the nature of things, this income would largely be spent as it is earned and, accordingly, it is considered unfair to reckon it in full over the year for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
    <P>The six months' continuous residence requirement for unemployment assistance purposes is being removed by section 8. At present, an applicant who does not satisfy this residence test must rely on supplementary welfare allowance which is payable only at the rural rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 11 of the Bill provide for increases in all rates of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions. <Col N="1754" /> The maximum weekly personal rate of widows' (non-contributory) pension is being increased from £16.80 to £21.00 and the amount for each qualified child to £6.90 instead of £5.50. As in the case of non-contributory old age pension, provision is being made for uniform reductions of £1.20 in pension for each £1 increase in means and for additional rates of pension.  Increases in the prescribed relative allowance, &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; allowance, and &ldquo;over 80&rdquo; allowance in line with those payable with non-contributory old age pensions are also provided.  The improvements in widows' pensions will automatically apply to the social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>The social assistance allowance payable to single women aged between 58 and 66 is also being increased by 25 per cent in section 13, bringing the maximum to £18.30.</P>
    <P>The parity between the rates of supplementary welfare allowance and the rural rate of unemployment assistance is being maintained by a 20 per cent increase in the rates of supplementary welfare allowance which is dealt with in section 14.</P>
    <P>Section 10 will enable a woman qualified for a deserted wife's allowance who becomes widowed to qualify automatically for widow's non-contributory pension at the same rate as the deserted wife's allowance which was in payment to her.  Under present procedure, a woman in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance whose husband dies must, if she wishes to obtain a widow's non-contributory pension, apply specifically for it.  This means that her application must go to a social welfare officer for an investigation of means.  As the means test and the rates of payment are the same in both schemes, I consider that title to widow's non-contributory pension should immediately be conferred on such an applicant at the same rate as the deserted wife's allowance which was in payment to her.  While this conveys no monetary advantage, I know that the simplification of procedure will be <Col N="1755" /> welcomed.  If the widow considers that she is entitled to a higher rate of pension, it will, of course, be open to her to apply for it.</P>
    <P>At present, the definition of orphan for social welfare purposes includes a child whose parents are dead and who does not reside with a step-parent.  It also includes a child whose mother dies while deserted wife's allowance or deserted wife's benefit was payable to her and whose father does not wholly or mainly maintain him.  Cases have arisen where a woman who was deserted by her husband dies but, prior to her death, had not applied for, or had not qualified for, either deserted wife's allowance or deserted wife's benefit, leaving her children, as a result, with no rights to benefit.  A similar situation has arisen where it was the husband who was deserted by the wife and, on the husband's death, the children were left without rights to benefits.  To relieve hardship in such cases, it is proposed to expand the definition of &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; to include the child of a deceased parent, who had been deserted prior to death, where the other parent has abandoned the child.  This will enable orphan's non-contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance or orphan's pension under the occupational injuries scheme to be paid in respect of any such child.  The necessary provisions are contained in sections 12 and 22 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I now come to the increases in the rates of contributory benefits and pensions under the social insurance system which are set out in section 15 of the Bill. The personal rate of disability and unemployment benefit is increased from £17.05 to £20.45 and a married couple will now receive £33.70 instead of £28.10.  Allowances for children with these benefits are being increased to £5.95 for each of the first two children and to £4.90 for each other child.  Maternity allowance is also being increased to £20.45.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of invalidity pension, is being increased by 25 per cent to £22.05, with an addition of £14.30 for an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> The personal rates of contributory old age and retirement pensions for persons under age 80 go up to £24.50 and, for those over 80, to £26.25.  The addition to pension for an adult dependant is being raised to £15.65 where the adult dependant is under pensionable age and to £18.30 where the adult dependant is aged 66 or over.  Accordingly, a married couple both over pensionable age will get £42.80 as compared with £34.25 at present and, if the pensioner is aged 80, the new rate will be £44.55, an increase of £8.90 per week.</P>
    <P>The new personal rate of widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit, will be £22.50 and for those aged 80 or over £24.05.  The additions to widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit for qualified children are being raised to £7.50 for each child. A widow or deserted wife with three qualified children will now get £45.00, an increase of £9.00 per week.</P>
    <P>In the case of the other contributory pensions, the increased amounts for child dependants will be £6.40 for each of the first two children and £5.30 for each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>All the personal rates I have mentioned in connection with social insurance payments are the maximum rates, payable where the contribution conditions for the benefit concerned are fully satisfied.  Most people qualify for the maximum rates, but for those whose insurance records are deficient, reduced personal rates are payable.  As is normal, these rates will be increased by regulations. Of course, while the personal rates of benefit are reduced where there is a deficient record, the allowances for a dependant wife and children are not reduced.</P>
    <P>Criticisms are frequently directed at abuses of the social welfare system.  Any person who receives a social welfare payment to which he is not entitled creates an additional drain on the funds available and makes it that much more difficult for me as Minister for Social Welfare to meet my obligations to the needy.  In the control of the system, therefore, it is necessary for me from <Col N="1757" /> time to time, to take measures to ensure that the money allocated to social welfare goes only to those entitled to it.</P>
    <P>The disability benefit scheme has recently come in for some criticism on the grounds that it acts as an inducement to malingering.  In the year 1979 there were some 286,000 claims to disability benefit and the average number of persons paid each week was close to 71,000.  These persons received a total of almost £96 million made up of £82 million in disability benefit and £14 million in pay-related benefit.  Expenditure of this magnitude must be strictly controlled and all measures taken to eliminate the possibility of abuse.</P>
    <P>One of the abuses alleged in relation to disability benefit is that some workers claim benefit in respect of unnecessarily frequent short absences from work.  At present, a person is disqualified for payment of benefit for the first three days of illness unless those days fall within 13 weeks of a previous period of illness or unemployment.  A person can thus receive disability benefit from the first day of a sick absence occurring within three months of the end of the previous claim even though the second absence may be as short as three days.  In order to tighten control in this area, section 17 of the Bill will apply the three waiting days to every claim to disability benefit except in the case of a person who becomes ill while unemployed or who suffers a relapse within three days of returning to work.  The position in regard to waiting days for the purpose of unemployment benefit and injury benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme is not being changed.</P>
    <P>Under section 20, all rates of periodic benefit under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, including increases of benefit in respect of adult and child dependants, are being increased in line with the increases being applied under the general social insurance scheme.  Preferential rates of personal benefit under the occupational injuries scheme are thus being maintained. Moreover, this year for the first <Col N="1758" /> time disablement benefit is being treated as a long-term benefit and the 25 per cent increase is being applied to it.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for an increase of 25 per cent in the living alone allowance payable with death benefit pensions under the occupational injuries benefit scheme in line with the living alone increase under the general social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>This year again the rates of children's allowances are being substantially increased. Section 24 provides that the monthly allowance for the first child will be increased by £1 to £4.50 and by £1.50 to £7.00 for each subsequent child.  This will bring the monthly payment for families of three children up by £4 to £18.50 and up by £5.50 to £25.50 for families of four children.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances are an important source of income not only to lower income but also to middle income families and are paid directly to the mother.  The adjustment in the child income tax allowance announced in the budget statement will ensure that the full value of the increase in children's allowance is directed mainly towards families in the lower and middle income groups.  The increased rates will be effective from 1 of July 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for increases in the grants paid in respect of multiple births.  At present, these grants are of £100 in respect of triplets and £150 on the birth of quadruplets or any higher number.  It is proposed to increase these amounts to £300 and £400 respectively. The operative date will be 1 April 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 26 raises the earnings ceiling from £5,500 to £7,000 and the rates of pay-related social insurance contributions which will be required to meet the employer's and employee's share of the cost of the proposals under the social insurance schemes.  The overall increase in the current rate of contributions, 11.2 per cent, applicable to persons eligible for all benefits, will be 0.8 per cent of which the employer will bear 0.7 per cent and the employee 0.1 per cent.  Consequently, the new standard rate of contributions will be 12 per cent of which <Col N="1759" /> employers will pay 8.5 per cent and employees will pay 3.5 per cent.  Proportionate increases are being provided in the rates of voluntary contributions.  The increases will be effective from 6 April 1980.  The new rates and the increased earnings limit are expected to yield about £380 million in the current year, which includes £44 million additional contribution income.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that the section provides for the new rates of contribution by the substitution of &ldquo;3.5 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.2 per cent&rdquo; and &ldquo;8.5 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;7.5 per cent&rdquo; in section 6 (1) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  This would seem to indicate that the present rates of contributions are 3.2 per cent for employees and 7.5 per cent for employers which is not so.  These rates were, in fact, temporarily increased to 3.4 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively by virtue of section 5 (2) of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978, for the 12 months ending 5 April 1980.  This provision will then lapse leaving the original rates in section 6 (1) to be increased from 6 April 1980, by this Bill.  Various special or `modified' rates of contributions are payable in respect of certain employments, for example civil service, certain share fishermen and so on, which are not covered for all benefits of the social insurance system.  Any necessary increases to those modified rates will be made by regulation.</P>
    <P>The overall cost in 1980 of the rates increases and other changes being provided for in this Bill is £90.2 million. Of this amount, social assistance accounts for £57.3 million, all of which is borne by the Exchequer.  On the social insurance side, the total increase in cost is expected to be £77 million and this must be met out of the social insurance fund which is financed by contributions from employers and employees with an annual subvention from the Exchequer. The pay-related contributions for employers and employees will meet an estimated £44 million of this extra cost leaving £33 million to be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The changes in the Bill which I have <Col N="1760" /> outlined can be summarised as the increase of long-term payments such as pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, by 25 per cent; the increase of short-term payments such as disability and unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance by 20 per cent; the increase of children's allowances by an average of about 28 per cent; provisions to improve entitlements for various categories, for example blind persons, widows, orphans, seasonal fisherman and measures to prevent abuse of the disability benefit scheme.  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill will bring about a real improvement in the social welfare system, and I, therefore, recommend it to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of this Bill as they are long awaited by those who will benefit.  The Minister and most other public representatives have been under more and more pressure from the less well off sections who are finding it increasingly more difficult to exist at their political clinics and advice centres.  It was fortunate for most of those people, particularly those living in built-up areas, that we had a milder winter than that which we experienced last year.  Despite what appeared to be substantial increases in their allowances, social welfare recipients are finding it more difficult to exist.  There was a certain amount of gloating from the Fianna Fáil benches during budget week about these massive increases in social welfare allowances.  There was a lot of pressure from people finding it hard to live on allowances which were whittled away by budgets week after week.  Practically every day commodities needed just to live were increasing in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 25 per cent increases in allowances looked well when announced. It would be good if recipients received this increase during the month in which it was announced, but unfortunately they will have to wait until April and in some instances until 1 July before they actually receive the money.  The increases <Col N="1761" /> are continually being whittled away by soaring price increases.  For instance, in January 1978 an ordinary two pound sliced loaf cost 19½p and the non-contributory old age pension amounted to £10.75 while the contributory old age pension amounted to £12.75.  Two years later, in January, 1980, the same loaf costs 46½p whereas the increase in the contributory pension is from £12.75 to £19.60 and the non-contributory pension increased from £10.75 to £16.80.  Taking that example alone, apart from all the other commodities such as butter, tea and gas which have also increased in price, it is clear that social welfare recipients have a lot to bear.  Most of them cannot switch foods or heating systems readily and must continue to use the same commodities.  The price increases are catching up on the comforts of social welfare recipients and many of them must seek the help of relatives or some other source to maintain their standard of living or else they have to cut back on what they are eating or on the fuel for heating or cooking.</P>
    <P>The increases when announced got great publicity and raised the expectations of many people.  However by the time they get their allowances the benefits will be whittled away.  The increases announced in the budget should be given certainly within a month of the announcement, although even that is too long.  The system should be geared to give effect to the increases without delay. The increases in the price of cigarettes, beer, petrol and tobacco were given effect to within a few days.  The increase in the price of beer and petrol took effect overnight.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason why increases in social welfare benefits are not paid a lot sooner than is the position.  This time lag has existed for many years but in olden days it did not matter very much. At least those who were promised an increase of 4s. or 5s. per week felt the benefit of it when it was paid, but because of the time lag to-day an increase of £4 or £5 is eroded by price increases before it is paid.  The Minister should speed up the payment of increases <Col N="1762" /> creases granted in budgets.  I do not believe he will be responsible for this matter when the budget is introduced in 1981, but he should make every effort to shorten the period between the announcement of the increases and the date of payment.</P>
    <P>Many people who do not have medical cards but qualify for medical assistance towards the cost of medicines are finding it very difficult to pay for medicines because of the decision to insist on them paying the first £8 per month.  It is a crippling burden on such people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a matter for the Department of Health but the decision to amend the scheme is hitting social welfare recipients rather hard.  I am concerned about pensioners who are disqualified from holding a medical card because they have a small income.  They are eligible for assistance where medicines exceed £8 per month but that is providing a heavy burden on them.  The Minister should make an effort to help those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare recipients have had to meet huge bills for heating this winter. The Minister has not been long in office but there was an opportunity in the budget to ease the situation in regard to fuel for those people.  The Minister for Finance could have made provision to increase the free fuel subsidy.  The Minister's predecessor, within weeks of taking office, undertook to apply that scheme to the country as a whole rather than to the 17 built-up areas as heretofore.  He undertook on a number of occasions to introduce a new scheme under which pensioners, irrespective of the area they lived in, would qualify in some way for assistance towards the cost of heating their homes, but he left office without doing anything.  He made a feeble attempt to change that scheme by way of transferring the voucher for 1 cwt. of turf to a cash voucher for £1.50 <Col N="1763" /> to be used to purchase fuel of any description.  If the Minister does not alter this scheme the recipients will be worse off getting the £1.50 per week than they were when they were entitled to 1 cwt. of turf, because it will not be long until £1.50 will only purchase a half cwt. of turf.  The price of 1 cwt. of turf has changed drastically in one year and will increase next year also.  It was wrong to alter the scheme.  It was a stop gap measure.</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies attached to the existing scheme.  For instance, a pensioner living in County Dublin who decides to draw his or her pension at the local post office loses out on the free fuel scheme because post offices in the county do not issue the vouchers. However, a pensioner living next door who decides to opt to draw his or her pension in a city post office can collect the £1.50 voucher at that post office.  I mentioned this matter on many occasions. The Minister should re-organise that scheme and put it on a sound footing so that all pensioners have the same entitlements.  It costs the same amount of money to heat a home in County Dublin or in rural areas of any other part of the country as it costs to heat a home in any city.  It is time all the talk in relation to the scheme ceased and the Minister put his mind to introducing a country wide scheme.  I welcome the provisions of the Bill and the sooner the money is given to those entitled to it the better.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the increase in the pension for blind persons.  This improvement is long overdue and while it is not a great improvement, at least it is a step in the right direction.  However, I trust that the Minister will continue to pay attention to the anomalies that exist so far as pensions for the blind are concerned in order that those among us who are unfortunate enough to be sightless will be helped in every way possible.  We have not done nearly enough for these people, Indeed, we are way behind many of our EEC partners in so far as helping blind people is concerned.  I welcome generally the increases in social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the increases in social welfare benefits.  Having regard to our present circumstances we would be less than fair if we did not consider the proposed increases to be reasonable, though I am not sure that they are sufficient to enable the recipients to live in any sort of comfort. However, the Bill is an effort to bring the increases in line at least with the cost of living increases.</P>
      <P>Having said that there are some points I must make but these concern more what I consider should be in the Bill rather than what is contained in the Bill. Our first priority should be to provide for people who are not in a position to provide for themselves and there should not be any room for a niggardly attitude in this regard.  These lesser well-off sections of the community should be able to enjoy a standard of living that is equal to what is accepted as being the average standard of living of our people but we are a long way from achieving that situation.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to detract in any way from the increases being granted, I should point out that at this time people in receipt of social welfare benefits are receiving the same amounts as they were receiving in October last though we all know the huge price increases that have been imposed on foodstuffs and on fuel since then.  For instance, bread has increased by 5p a loaf, both milk and cheese have increased in price by 5 per cent while there have been massive increases in the price of gas, coal, turf and briquettes.  It is well known that proportionately people in the lower-income bracket spend much more on foodstuffs and on fuel than is the case where other groups are concerned.  Successive Governments have failed to ensure a standard of living for social welfare recipients that is in keeping with the standard of living generally, with the result that these people must continue to tolerate a standard of living that is lower than the average.  Instead of being ashamed of that situation we seem to be clapping ourselves on the back for the little we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> It is not my intention to delay for longer than is necessary the implementation of this legislation but there are some points that must be made in regard to it. One category of people who are being discriminated against in terms of social welfare are people who are never likely to work again and who are in receipt of monthly medical certificates.  In their case the social welfare payment is £5 per week less than is paid to a person in receipt of a disability pension.  I consider this situation to be a criminal injustice.</P>
    <P>Another category of people for whom not nearly enough has been done down through the years is widows.  Perhaps my childhood circumstances left me with much sympathy for widows because my mother was among that category and had to rear three of us at a time when there was little, if any, help from the State.  A widow who is rearing a family and who has no income other than what she may receive from the State must have great difficulty in providing the necessities of life for herself and her family.  Consequently, I see no reason for there not being extended to her the free electricity and travel schemes.  Such a person would be in greater need of this additional help than would a person who qualified for benefit in terms of these schemes on the basis of having reached the age of 66.  We seem to be afraid as a society to make it possible for such categories of persons to enjoy a decent standard of living.  Even if a widow with young children could find work she would not be able to avail of it in most cases because of having to look after her children.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to unmarried mothers is not anything to boast about either.  If a person in this category were to take up any work she would disqualify in terms of her social welfare allowance of £18 per week.  That is a miserable income, These people find themselves often in the unfortunate position of being looked down on by society. That is bad enough without their being discriminated against in terms of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>A major source of disappointment in <Col N="1766" /> regard to this Bill is the failure on the part of the Government to reduce the old age pension qualifying age by the one year that would bring it into line with the rest of Europe where these pensions are paid at 65.  But Fianna Fáil have a very bad record in this regard, because not once under a Fianna Fáil Government has the qualifying age been reduced.  The qualifying age for a retirement pension has not been reduced in years.  It is still 65 years.  That is to the discredit of the Minister, of the Minister for Finance and of this House.  If this were done it would encourage people to retire and make jobs available for younger people.</P>
    <P>I do not know what it would cost but we boast about being good Europeans and the first thing we should do is to bring the qualifying ages for old age pension and retirement pension into line with the rest of Europe.  When Fianna Fáil came into office the qualifying age for the old age pension was 66 years and they had to reduce it by only one year to bring it into line with the rest of Europe. During their long years in office they neglected this very important area. When the old age pension was introduced in the early part of the century under a British Act the qualifying age was 70 and when Fianna Fáil left office a few years ago it was still 70.  As I said, when the Coalition were in office it was reduced to 66 years.  Surely it would not break the coffers of this State to reduce the age to 65 years?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in glowing terms to the supplementary welfare allowances. These allowances are operated in my area by the health board, and I want to say something about that. A criminally Victorian attitude is being taken in connection with the operation of these allowances.  I said that at local meetings where the superintendent was present and I will say it anywhere in the country.  The Minister introduced a free fuel scheme, administered by the health boards.  When the county council administered a similar scheme in my area, old age pensioners living alone received an extra £1 a week.  Under the Minister's <Col N="1767" /> scheme they get £1.50 a week but the friendly social welfare officer took back the £1&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I attacked the operation of the supplementary allowance scheme in my constituency. We seem to have a Victorian attitude to the people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  We seem to think they are not entitled to the same standard of living as those who are working.  That is not my attitude.  It is wrong, unchristian and unjust.</P>
      <P>Before these people get the increases, and even before the budget was introduced, most of the increase was eroded by increases in the cost of bread, butter, cheese, gas, coal, turf, briquettes and so on.  Increases in these items do not affect ordinary working people as much as those in receipt of social welfare allowances, but many of these people are hungry because they are not getting corresponding increases in their allowances.  If Members understood the problems facing these people they would do something about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people in receipt of social welfare benefits approach the welfare officers they are told they cannot get any extra money because they are given what the Department allow.  That is my experience of the way the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered. That scheme was introduced <Col N="1768" /> by the previous Government but it was not operated in the spirit intended.  It was introduced to provide for supplementary benefit recipients a cushion against these kinds of increases, but it is not being administered that way today.  If the Minister looks at this area he will discover that what I am saying is true.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House that the administration of the Department has broken down completely.  I said that many times before and was given many reasons for the break down.  Up to recently the postal strike was given as the main reason, but that has been settled almost 12 months now.  Over the past 12 months the Department, like the Revenue Commissioners, might as well have closed down because nobody, even public representatives, can get an answer to any query within a reasonable period. People sending in certificates for disability benefits have to wait six, seven, eight and 12 weeks, even though they never claimed before and have years of contributions behind them.  I cannot understand this.  The administration of the Department has deteriorated rapidly over the last six months.  People entitled to social welfare beenfits do not seem to be getting them.  Against that background I say that many people who are entitled to increases will not receive them in June.</P>
    <P>The staff in the Department of Social Welfare will not answer telephones.  On the occasions when they do so, they go to check files and never come back.  The Department may be understaffed.  I find it an impossible Department with which to deal.  I feel particularly sorry for a person who is refused benefit and has to appeal because it takes such a long time for the appeal to be heard.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the non-contributory old age pension.  A farmer may transfer land by deed to a son or daughter and when the deed has been examined by the Department of Social Welfare the farmer will invariably receive a non-contributory old age pension. If none of the sons or daughters wants to continue farming because the holding is uneconomic or for other <Col N="1769" /> reasons, the farmer may sell the farm and help to provide housing for his or her sons and daughters, but this is not accepted by the Department.  The Minister should examine this matter.  By transferring a farm by deed a farmer may qualify for the non-contributory old age pension but will not qualify if a farm is sold and the money divided.  That is most unjust.  I know of a case where a man was anxious that his son should come home and work on the farm but his son refused.  The farmer had no option but to sell the farm because he could not carry on himself.  He provided houses for two of his sons but he did not qualify for the old age pension and received only £4 or £5 per week.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas about which I could talk.  Many improvements could be made at very little cost, but the Department and the Government have a Victorian attitude, as also have the health authorities.  For this reason we are not making all the progress possible even within the limits of the money available. I have mentioned several areas where improvements could be made at minimal cost.</P>
    <P>The greater proportion of the income of the unfortunate people on social welfare is spent on food and in recent times increases in food prices have been particularly high.  This is my experience, though it may not be admitted by all. First, there was the removal of food subsidies and this was followed by huge price increases which will be particularly heavy in rural areas because of the increase in the cost of petrol.  This will affect people in receipt of social welfare payments of all kinds.</P>
    <P>I do not hold the view that some people should have a great deal more than others or that a certain section of society should have a great deal less than those who enjoy the normal standard of living. How can people be expected to live on a disability benefit of £16 per week?  They almost need a sworn inquiry to establish their right to it in the first place. Recipients of social welfare payments in general have not enough to provide them <Col N="1770" /> with the normal standard of living in our society.  If we were the Christian society which we claim to be, this should be our aim.  It is within our capacity to produce enough to give people in receipt of social welfare payments sufficient to provide them with a normal standard of living without discriminating between various categories.  If we are not prepared to do that, then we do not want social justice and a Christian society.  I do not think anyone ever attempted to do this.  I have been asked what I did when in Government, but I want to make it quite clear that I have never been in Government.  I would ask Fianna Fáil not to ask what was done by people on this side of the House when in Government because they have been in power for about 34 of the last 40 years.  I want them to give the same standard of living to all our people and I believe that the present Bill will not bring that about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on introducing his first Bill as Minister for Social Welfare, particularly because of the increases which have been granted to social welfare recipients in the recent budget.  Never before in the history of the State were increases of such magnitude given in a budget.  The increases given to single or married persons who qualify for benefit have equalled the level of pensions of a few years ago.  For that reason I wish to record my sincere congratulations to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I welcome these increases particularly because we are dealing with people in the community who are not organised and have not the muscle we usually associate with other sectors.  They have to depend on the generosity of the Government if they are non-contributory, and if they are contributory they must depend on the contributions they made during their working lives and the amount the Exchequer can give by way of supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people did not expect the level of the increases granted this year, even though they badly needed more.  In their manifesto Fianna Fáil committed themselves to social welfare increases at least equal to and possibly more than increases <Col N="1771" /> in the cost of living index; but, as the Minister has said, if we take into account the increases given last October the total percentage increase this year has been 31.  In other words, the Minister this year has trebled what his predecessor gave in 1979, and the bigger increases have been given to the most needy, who have been given 25 per cent more in this Budget.  The most needy are, of course, those on long-term benefits, pensioners and so on.  The less needy, generally, have been given increases of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>I bring to the Minister's notice especially the situation of widows.  I should like to see widows' pensions brought into line with those of single persons who are on contributory retirement and old age pensions.  Single people on contributory retirement pensions at the moment are in receipt of £24.05 but a contributory widow's pension is £22.50.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham drew attention to some of the problems we come across when dealing with constituents' complaints in regard to delays in paying social welfare benefits.  In this respect I do not blame the Department's officers. Indeed, I compliment them, because at a time when income tax offices and housing grant offices in the Department of the Environment were shut down so as to enable staff to deal with a back-log of queries and complaints, the Department of Social Welfare offices were open throughout the country.  However, there have been delays and naturally these cause hardship.  People sometimes have to wait six to eight weeks to have their certificates considered in disability cases and to have their claims processed in regard to unemployment benefits.  These delays naturally cause hardships and the Minister should have a look at the system to ensure that the position will be improved.</P>
    <P>As I have said, people who suffer from delays in the payment of their just rights under the Social Welfare Acts can get supplementary allowances through the health boards.  But, as most of us are aware, they do not like to approach the welfare officers, who in the past used to <Col N="1772" /> be known as home assistance officers.  If people are eligible for social welfare benefits they should not have to suffer from delays.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House longer because I know the Minister is anxious to have the Bill passed as soon as possible to enable people entitled to the increased benefits to get them.  I wish again to congratulate the Minister and the Government for their concern for those people in receipt of social welfare benefits who are not organised to march or to demand their just rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister success in his two Departments.  He has an onerous job and I wish him well.  He will need all the assistance he can get.  In the social welfare area I hope he will show more social commitment than his predecessor, who in my opinion did not show much commitment.</P>
      <P>I welcome any increases in social welfare benefits that will alleviate the hardships of the elderly, the disabled, the generally less well off, but I question the Government's concern in this whole area.  It is not enough at budget time to introduce across the board increases. Although this is important from the point of view of the recipients, it does not show any real social policy or philosophy.  This Bill does not introduce any innovation in the matter of looking after the old, the sick and the poor. Deputy McMahon spoke about the free fuel scheme and about the alteration in the scheme under which the fuel vouchers which could be used only for turf can now be used to buy all types of fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that this fuel scheme should be written into the Bill every year so that all elderly people, irrespective of where they live, will qualify by right and not by chance.  Though this has been a very mild winter, a number of people have been found dead in their homes from the cold.  The trouble is that people do not know their entitlements in this respect&mdash;they must see a social welfare officer to find out.  I do not think that is good enough in this day and age.  If the <Col N="1773" /> Government are concerned about the elderly they must ensure that the necessary finance will be made available to provide heat for them.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Bill has not a section written into it that such people should receive extra money towards fuel. Deputy McMahon made a very valid point when he said that when those people received a bag of turf and the price of it went up to £2, £3 or £4 they got it.  Now, with the cost of fuel fluctuating, they do not even get that. Two weeks ago the price of bottled gas increased dramatically.  I awaited an announcement from the Department of Social Welfare saying that the pensions of those people would be increased or that the value of their vouchers would be substantially increased.  A lot of elderly people use bottled gas.  Those people have to suffer with inadequate heating in the winter weather.</P>
    <P>With regard to the supplementary rent benefits, elderly people who live in local authority housing or own their houses are reasonably well off.  If they live in local authority housing they have subsidised rents and if they own their own houses, apart from repairs, they are not too badly off.  People who have to depend on uncontrolled lettings for accommodation are exposed to the harsh wind of commercialism.  Sooner or later the Government will have to ensure that enderly people are insulated against this in a positive way and that they have not to go cap in hand looking for supplementary benefits.</P>
    <P>The home assistance payment was not very satisfactory and changes were made.  It was then called the supplementary welfare benefit scheme.  Everybody hoped that the whole attitude of the Department would change but the name is the only thing which has changed. Deputy Bermingham said that a Victorian attitude still looms over this social welfare allowance.  I urge the Minister to examine this matter and ensure that it is compassionate and that people have not literally to crawl to get it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> Children's allowances have risen. Deputy Bermingham mentioned the big increases which have taken place.  In the few years the Coalition Government were in power the increases given amounted to 148 per cent.  I do not like quoting percentages because they tend very often to hide the facts.  The Minister pointed out that children's allowances go to the wife.  It is very important that she should get this money.  When will we get a social commitment from the Government in relation to a supplementary welfare allowance for the wife who wants to stay at home and rear a family? If married women want to work it is their right to go to work.  Many women want to stay at home and rear their families but for economic reasons they cannot do this.</P>
    <P>We talk about the place of the family in the Constitution but I believe that this is only lip service.  The sooner we have a positive policy in relation to the married woman who wants to stay at home and rear a family, without having to worry about economic considerations, the sooner we will solve a lot of social problems which can arise when women are not around to look after their families.  I want to see in any Social Welfare Bill some concept in relation to updating our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government brought in the allowance for the single woman, which was an excellent innovation.  The age at which a woman could then get the allowance was 58 years, which has now been reduced to 57 years.  There is no real effort in this Bill to bring the age down.  A single person of 51 years or 52 years of age who has remained at home will not be able to get employment. Those people should be looked after in our social welfare code.  A person who has gone over 40 years of age is too old in many jobs.  We should be realistic in regard to the age for the single woman's allowance.</P>
    <P>The Government have no social commitment whatsoever.  I hope this Minister will see things in a different light.  During the past 12 months there were long queues of people outside social welfare <Col N="1775" /> offices.  Some of those were disabled and had to queue in inclement weather for their allowances.  There is no excuse for that.  I do not care what they say about the people in social welfare offices working around the clock.  I am not blaming them.  The blame lies with the Minister and not with the staff.  We hear about the computers and the way everything can be churned out without any problems. Yet we see the problems.  That is the problem with this Government.  They would be just as happy not to have to deal with social welfare problems at all. That is the kind of commitment they have.  A typical example is not reducing the qualifying age for the old age pension to 65 years.  This is their third opportunity to do so but they have made no effort to do it.  When the Coalition took office in 1973 the age was 70 years.  We brought it down by four years, to 66 years, during the time we were in office. Now the Government are on their third budget and it is still 66 years.  That is the lack of commitment that I am talking about.</P>
    <P>As I said last year, they just think of a figure and throw it out and that is their social welfare policy.  But that is not a policy.  I am critical, not of the increases which I welcome because in many ways they are generous, but that they are only keeping up with the very high cost of living. Furthermore, people will have to wait to get them so that they will feel the very severe and savage increases particularly on food and fuel.  In most households that is only a small percentage of the total income but, in the case of the elderly, it is a great percentage of their income.  People are nearly punch drunk from reading about the savage increases which have become as commonplace now and they will not receive their allowances for some time so it is a question of live horse and get grass.  That is not what this House should be about so far as the welfare, particularly of the elderly, is concerned.</P>
    <P>On the question of poverty, it seems to be a dirty word, not to be used.  We seem to be letting the side down if we use that word.  But poverty is with us, particularly <Col N="1776" /> urban poverty, whether it is the result of lack of finance or because of the social conditions which people are condemned to live in.  If the Government are serious about their welfare policy the whole question of poverty must be uppermost in their minds.  The word must not be eradicated from our minds but poverty, as we see it around us, must be eradicated as soon as possible.  Funds are made available for combating poverty.  But there is now a cloud hanging over those funds.  The committees that were set up to do projects on poverty in various areas may not be able to operate and this is very serious.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating any one committee. What I am advocating is that the Government commit themselves to ensuring that where poverty exists it is eradicated.  Many things are responsible for it but it is the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare to take this problem on.  It is left in glorious suspended animation as far as I can see. Possibly the Government would like to believe that it does not exist because they are in government and when they are in government there could not be poverty. That is a myth and they know it and the country knows it.  I would ask the Minister to make this his priority so that in future social welfare Bills positive steps will be taken to ensure that the eradication of poverty is the key note.  It is bland to say &ldquo;the poor we will always have with us&rdquo;.  That is a philosophy that should not be entertained or countenanced. That is a lazy man's approach to a problem.  I hope the present Minister will tackle this problem in a serious way.</P>
    <P>Another area related to the question of social welfare that should be looked at is unemployment benefit and unemployment generally.  There seems to be a shared responsibility here between the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare.  I am not sure that in that type of situation anybody takes responsibility.  I would like to see this whole question, particularly in relation to labour exchanges in large urban areas, tackled.  The whole concept of labour exchanges in urban areas should <Col N="1777" /> be changed.  We talk about unemployment benefit increases but that is not enough although they are welcome.  We should have manpower development offices where people who are not at present employed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If one has to talk about some sort of social welfare policy one may have to stray slightly away from the area.  What I am trying to say is that it is not good enough to herd people into labour exchanges and pay them social welfare benefits.  We should try to take positive steps to help them.  If somebody is unemployed for a long period he may become unemployable. This is a welfare problem because such a person will have to receive welfare benefit for a long time, perhaps forever. If we are serious about helping in this area, we should try to remove the stigma of labour exchanges and change the image. We may have to define who is employable and unemployable.  In the case of people who are unemployable, we should decide that they be put on social welfare benefits while the employable people should be transferred to the Department of Labour.  That would be a wise step because it would give the dignity of work to those who are employable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> Lack of information with regard to social welfare benefits is a matter of concern to many of us.  I should like to see the situation exist where people would be fully aware of their entitlements.  I know that the Department issue booklets on the matter but information does not seem to filter through to the public. Perhaps people from the Minister's Department would consider coming on television or on radio in order to give information and facts to the public.  When people do not know their entitlements they cannot claim them from the Department and that is not desirable.  It is all very well for the Department to issue glossy booklets on the matter&mdash;we get them every year&mdash;but if the public are not informed about their entitlements not much good is achieved.  Many people do not read much but if information with regard to social welfare benefits were publicised on television or on radio it would be of considerable help.  Perhaps the Minister would give some thought to this matter.</P>
    <P>While the allowances given in the budget are reasonable good, the severe and savage price increases are eroding them rapidly.  The Government may clap themselves on the back but really they have not done much for the less well off in our society.  That has been borne out even now.  There was much talk in the budget about discretionary spending&mdash;new phraseology introduced to cover the increases in the price of drink and cigarettes.  Many old age pensioners like to drink or smoke&mdash;they are entitled to when they reach that age&mdash;and they will not agree with the phrasology of the Minister foince.  In my view, a small whiskey for an old age pensioner could be regarded as medicine.  If the Minister puts on his other hat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  Many old age pensionsers think they need a small whiskey to keep body and soul together and that might be regarded as a matter of health.  Similarly, many old age pensioners would not regard the purchase of <Col N="1779" /> plug tobacco as discretionary spending. It is like saying to people if the price of a loaf of bread gets too expensive they can eat cake.  That is a kind of discretionary spending.  The phraseology is woolly and is typical of the thinking of the Government. When I talk about welfare, I think especially of the elderly and disabled who are very vulnerable.  Percentages do not mean anything to such people.  It is our job to ensure that they have the money to pay for the necessities of life. They have not got that.  The increase of 25 per cent announced in the budget appears generous but on examination of the facts it is obvious that we are not giving enough to the elderly.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter and to give them a generous increase during the year.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in the Department of Social Welfare.  He is a capable man and I am sure he will make a name for himself in his office.  I hope he will be moved by compassion and a sense of social justice to ensure that the areas I have talked about will be looked after in a proper way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This Bill will implement the provisions of the budget in so far as increases in social welfare benefits and allowances are concerned.  I welcome the increases granted and on that account I welcome the Bill but, at the same time, I do not think the allowances are any cause for jubilation or celebration.  The social welfare classes have fallen far behind and Deputies who have been dealing in the past 12 months with social welfare recipients must be conscious of how far the standard of living of these people has dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in the budget are a measure of the extent to which it is recognised that the standard of living of the social welfare people has dropped. We know that the Taoiseach estimates an inflation rate of 20 per cent this year and that other authorities put it higher. With that sort of inflation rate forecast we know that the end result is usually worse rather than better.  I do not know if the Minister has any provision in mind <Col N="1780" /> or in the Bill for a second increase in social welfare this year.  If he has not I believe that by the end of the year these people will again have fallen behind seriously.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill I shall avail of the opportunity, if possible, to raise a number of points.  Very recently it came to my attention that the living alone allowance payable to old age pensioners is not paid if the pensioner has even an invalid, a handicapped, or a totally disabled person living in the house.  That is wrong.  An old person or a person in need of care is worse off really than if that pensioner had nobody with him or her, I urge the Minister to reconsider this.</P>
    <P>Very recently I applied for an allowance for a person over 70 who is in receipt of a qualified pension from the Department of Justice I do not want to identify the person but the Minister will know what I mean.  This person has been refused a living alone allowance although the only other person living in the house has been on long-term disability benefit for several years.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>I must shortly leave the House to keep another appointment but I want to raise one other matter, the question of marreid couples who qualify for the old age pension. In the case where one spouse, usually the man, is in receipt of an income and the other spouse has no income whatever, that spouse is deprived of the old age pension because half the means of the other spouse is assessed against him or her.  That is fundamentally wrong.  Over the years women in this country have been treated badly&mdash;not all of them.  Many married women are given only enough by their husbands to keep body and soul together.  Yet, these women are deprived of the old age pension when they reach pensionable age because the husband's income is halved and half of the income assessed against the wife so that she gets no old age pension.  Many such women have lived many years of their lives in hardship and they are deprived and discriminated against in this way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> Has the Minister considered what effect the recent Supreme Court decision on the taxation code in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy will have on this regulation of the social welfare code?  In the Supreme Court it was held that for taxation purposes the income of the husband and the income of the wife must be treated separately, that it was unconstitutional to aggregrate the incomes of husband and wife and tax them as one.  I have little doubt that following that reasoning the Supreme Court would hold, if asked to consider the position under the Social Welfare Acts, that in deciding whether the wife is entitled to an old age pension regard can he had to her income only and that it is not right or fair or constitutional or in accordance with natural justice that the husband's income should be divided and half of it notionally transferred to the wife in order to debar her from an old age pension.</P>
    <P>If those two people were living in the same house as two single people and not as husband and wife no matter what amount of income the man had, so long as the applicant for the pension had no income in her own right she would be entitled to receive the old age pension.  Just because they are married and not two single people the Minister and his regulations state that such an applicant who has no income is to be discriminated against and deprived of the pension.</P>
    <P>I make that case because in the past month I was approached by a woman whose husband is disabled, having suffered a stroke.  Apparently, he never heard of inflation, does not appreciate that the cost of living has increased substantially, and gives her a miserable sum on which to run the house.  She is not entitled to the old age pension because half of his income is being taken into account although she does not receive enough to keep him properly let alone herself.  That is the state of the law administered by the Minister's Department.  I believe the Supreme Court decision in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy will have farreaching results in many Departments of State and I believe the first result is that <Col N="1782" /> the entitlement of a woman&mdash;or a man because many men are old and married to rich women who do not treat them very well&mdash;to a pension in the circumstances I have described will be established.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Murphy decision the entitlement of a spouse to the old age pension should be based on the income of that spouse and not on the income of the other spouse.  I want to know if the Minister has given any serious thought to that and, if he has, what he proposes to do.  At first sight this might be thought to be an argument just for the purpose of extending the decision in the Murphy case in order to entitle some people to old age pensions who are not now so entitled. I do not intend it that way.  In this decision I see an opportunity of doing away with discrimination against a spouse.  I see, in the Murphy decision, an opportunity of not penalising the people who live together as married couples rather than as single couples.  When replying I should like the Minister to deal with this in a serious manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and, while not wishing him a long stay in his portfolio, I hope it will be a happy one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister.  I should like to ask if he would consider something his predecessor did not find his way to doing something about, that is, to avail of the assistance available to this country from the EEC for the introduction of a scheme for the provision of free milk for schools.  As the Minister may be aware, 50 per cent of the cost of the provision of milk or milk products, either at free or at subsidised rates, is available to this country from the EEC.  I should have thought that most other Community countries had availed of this scheme, thereby not only assisting their children but also their balance of payments, in that they are in receipt of a net addition of money. Ireland has availed of this scheme to a very limited extent only, in that where a school meals scheme was already in operation, where milk was being <Col N="1783" /> provided already, the Department of Social Welfare used this scheme to reduce their expenditure but did not expand the scheme or indeed pass on to our children any of the benefits that they, as a Department, were obtaining by virtue of the fact that they were participating to that very limited extent in the scheme as it applies to certain city schools.</P>
      <P>I made some inquiries at the time the scheme was introduced which indicated to me that there were significant numbers of pupils&mdash;somewhere in the region of 4 per cent to 5 per cent; perhaps less in some schools and more in others&mdash;who, primarily because of family problems rather than absolute poverty, were coming to school in the morning without having had a breakfast. Obviously this meant that they were unable to concentrate on their lessons throughout the day.  It meant also that in many cases, having come to school without breakfast, they did not get anything to eat until perhaps 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon when they eventually went home.  If a school milk scheme was implemented&mdash;and we all know that milk is a balanced, nutritious food&mdash;those children would receive nutrition, putting them at a significant advantage in school, in that they would then be able to concentrate better, in turn deriving more benefit from their lessons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many children who fall behind significantly in school, well behind their intellectual capacity.  I would argue that in some of these cases it is because they simply have not had sufficient to eat before going to school, when their blood sugar is at such a low level they are unable to concentrate.  It is very disturbing that that should be the case.  Any scheme which would have the effect of allowing these children to be properly nourished should be availed of, and should probably be done on its merits anyway.  However, when somebody outside this country, namely the EEC, is prepared to pay 50 per cent of the milk costs involved in providing free or subsidised milk to our children, it <Col N="1784" /> is a matter of grave concern that we, as a country, have not seen our way to availing of it.  In a year in which very good increases have been given in social welfare benefits it is appropriate that sufficient money be found by the new Minister to provide for the introduction of a schools milk scheme.</P>
    <P>I should also like to have some information from the Minister on the position of pensioners.  I would ask him to take a special look at the problem of people receiving pensions from the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Security.  These pensioners receive their cheques drawn on Northern Ireland banks.  There is at present an industrial dispute in the Northern and Ulster Banks, resulting in these pensioners being unable to get any money for the cheques they receive from the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Security, a matter of great seriousness for them.  I shall read an excerpt from a letter I received from a constituent of mine.  I will not give the name and address of the person concerned.  The letter says:</P>
    <P>I was getting my retirement pension from Northern Ireland but since 17 December I got the cheques as usual but cannot get them changed anywhere.  Out of desperation I thought of you.  Could you tell me what to do?  I really have two cheques; they are monthly at £63.44 each.  I was so happy to get them but now I cannot cash them.</P>
    <P>That lady, since the middle of December last&mdash;because she cannot cash her cheques &mdash;has had nothing on which to live. I estimate that there are approximately 2,000 pensioners resident in the Republic drawing pensions from Northern Ireland.  I would urge the Minister to do two things about this problem: firstly, to ensure that, through the health boards, sufficient money is made available to ensure that no Northern Ireland pensioner&mdash;those now unable to cash their cheques&mdash;is placed in a position of hardship, of having insufficient money on which to live.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> I appeal to the Minister to intervene with the Irish Banks' Standing Committee which represents the banks here and those in Northern Ireland which are in dispute with their employees to ensure that pensioners, such as those in Northern Ireland, no matter what industrial dispute exists, are not deprived of the income they must have in order to survive.  It is a matter of great concern that old people should suffer in this way as a result of an industrial dispute.  I hope the Minister will be able to ensure by joint agreement with the pension authorities in Britain that where cheques are sent from one authority to clients resident in the other jurisdiction where the banking system, for one reason or another, is not able to provide the money, the Department step in and pay the money with a view to recouping it later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair's indulgence.  I should now like to deal with a matter which I regard as being of considerable importance, the decision by the Government not to allow any increase in the rates of unemployment assistance payable to people in the west of Ireland who are on a notional system of assessment.  In effect, that amounts to a freezing of farmers' dole which was announced in the budget.  There are a number of reasons why that decision is questionable.  Very few of the farmers concerned would be in a position to provide the type of evidence in the form of accounts which would be necessary to satisfy the authorities that their income is above or below the qualifying limit.  It is not an easy matter to ask them to transfer to an actual system of assessment. The notional system was introduced by the Government because it was more convenient to assess incomes of such farmers on an notional basis rather than on an actual basis.  Admittedly, the multiplier used did not keep <Col N="1786" /> pace with inflation but the principle that it should be open to people to have their income assessed on a notional basis, such as small farmers in the west of Ireland, is a sound one.  It is odd that, regardless of the circumstances of such people, they will not be paid any increase in their pension simply because they opt to have their means assessed on a notional basis rather than by the provision of actual accounts.</P>
      <P>That system of unemployment assistance is justifiable on the grounds that it is a payment to people to live in the west of Ireland.  The EEC are at present moving in the direction of paying money to farmers and others who live in remote parts of the Community to encourage them to continue to live there. That is being done on the grounds that if those people were to move to live in central regions of the Community they would cost the Exchequer more money because of the need to provide services and so on than they would cost if they remained in remote areas.  The Community are also preparing to give money to such people on the grounds that they are necessary for the regional distribution of population, for an evenly balanced population throughout the Community which is considered a valuable objective.  It is felt that people are needed in those areas for the protection of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is odd that at a time when the EEC are moving in the direction of direct income supports for farmers living in remote areas our Government, who have been providing such support, should now decide to restrict that aid by freezing the rates of unemployment assistance paid to farmers in the west of Ireland who draw what is known as the farmer's dole. When a change in this scheme was proposed in 1972&mdash;the present occupant of the Chair was involved in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;a number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers refused to vote with their Government&mdash;Deputy Chubb O'Connor was one of those Members.  It is odd that we have not heard any voice of condemnation this time from those who were so eloquent <Col N="1787" /> then, if not in words at least in deed, in condemnation of a similar measure.  If something had to be done about this scheme I would have thought that the appropriate way to do it was to alter the multiplier to make it more realistically reflect actual incomes.  To say to people that, regardless of their circumstances, once they opt for the notional system of assessment they will not get any increase is being indiscriminate in the way this proposal is being approached.</P>
    <P>Farmers in the west of Ireland who draw unemployment assistance will have to pay the extra costs brought about by the budget, whether it is for the various commodities which will be subject to an increase in VAT or the other inflationary consequences that will stem from it. Other social welfare beneficiaries will be allowed to recoup those increases by getting 20 or 25 per cent increases in their benefits.  That is a decision the Government may well have reason to regret as a most unwise one.  It is one which has not been given the publicity it deserved.  In fact, a commentator in one of our national newspapers congratulated the Government on giving an increase to farmers living in the west. That commentator was not aware that an increase had not been given, that this social welfare benefit had been singled out to be frozen.  That should be explained more fully.</P>
    <P>I should like to make inquiries about the eligibility for free television licences and free electricity for pensioners living alone.  I understand that extensions were made to this scheme recently but I should like to know if pensioners who are receiving pensions from outside Ireland and have an income of equivalent size will qualify for free electricity and free television licences.  The guiding criteria should not be the type of pension a person gets but the actual amount of income.  If a person is receiving a pension from the Government of Brazil and comes back to live here and his income from that pension is no greater than the income of an old age pensioner here, he or she should get exactly the same benefit in the form of free <Col N="1788" /> television, free light and free travel, as the Irish pensioner.  The Minister should ensure that in all such cases this principle applies.</P>
    <P>I raise, finally, a question in relation to the rates of increase in benefit.  The giving of a 25 per cent increase to people on long-term benefits is a very wise and creditable move, on which I congratulate the Minister.  It is a very good increase.  It is to be hoped, however, that the rate of inflation will not overtake this increase during the year.  There are some grounds for fear that this may be so.  Indeed, the Government's own budget has in some measure contributed to creating a situation in which this is possible. Would the Minister therefore consider later on in the year whether a second increase in social welfare benefits should be considered in the event that the rate of inflation appears to be running at a level as high as the rates of increase already given, so that the intention of the Government to ensure that a real increase in living standards for pensioners is allowed to take effect without being eroded by inflation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Bill and the Minister's Second Reading speech one thing leaps out of every line and every page and that is the perpetuation by Fianna Fáil as far as social welfare recipients are concerned of the hand-out philosophy.  They want to try to stamp on the recipients of social welfare&mdash;whether contributory or noncontributory&mdash;the idea that it is largesse of the Fianna Fáil Party, something which these people are receiving out of the goodness of the hearts of the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  Fianna Fáil have always had the same philosophy regarding social welfare recipients.  They want them to believe that it is a hand-out, that they are dependent, not upon the Government of this country, but on a political party for their payments.  The whole emphasis in any speech that has been made, and particularly any speech or utterance by the present Minister for Social Welfare, has been designed to reinforce that philosophy pursued by <Col N="1789" /> Fianna Fáil over the years.  It would be worth while to look at the proper role of a Department of Social Welfare in a parliamentary democracy.  First of all, it should be to continuously and constantly reinforce in people's minds that what they are receiving is as of right.  It is their right and they should be beholden to nobody&mdash;no Government, no political party&mdash;for receiving what is theirs as of right.  Also, their role should be not just to give obligatory increases at budget time but in between budgets, and indeed during a period of Government there should be a course of action, a planned programme to try to improve the existing social services available to our people and also to expand those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one would deny that there is a great deal of scope for both improvement and expansion as far as our social services are concerned.  A great deal of improvement is desirable in the field of social welfare.  It is only fair not to take this budget in isolation, but to look at what has happened in the Department of Social Welfare since June 1977, when the present Government took office and when the present Taoiseach was put in charge of that Department.  With one exception regarding availability of telephones, there has been no improvement and no extension in the services which existed there prior to June 1977. Not only has there been no extension or improvement in the services to social welfare recipients, but the Department almost came to a full stop.  Casting one's mind back to last September, October, November it was normal, not unusual, for people who had applied for pensions&mdash;old age pensions, widows' pensions and so on&mdash;to find that a period of seven to eight months had elapsed from the time of their application to the time, if they were fortunate, when they finally came in receipt of that pension.  The issue became so commonplace that one of the major points raised during the Cork by-election concerned the number of people in Cork city who were approaching the various candidates in the various parties participating in that election with detailed cases, with dates, of <Col N="1790" /> people who had applied for old age pensions, widows' pensions and so on and periods of months had elapsed before they could get what they were entitled to. Not only had there been no expansion or progress in the Department, but it had deteriorated rapidly over a two to two-and-a-half year period.  There is now some indication that at least people's pensions are being paid, not as speedily as one might like, but at least in a somewhat improved manner since last October, November.</P>
    <P>I want to compare what happened in that Department over approximately the last three years to what happened in the previous four years.  As I said, there has been no expansion of the services, no detailed assessment of the needs of that Department, no plan put forward, no indication given that any serious attempt is to be made to try to expand those services. To give a few instances of what happened, under the whole period of Fianna Fáil Government here the old age pension eligibility age here has never been reduced by one hour, one day, one week, one year.  In a four and a half year period of the last administeration the old age pension eligibility age was reduced from 70 to 66 years of age and it was quite clear that, had another budget been introduced by the last administration, it would have been down to 65 years of age, which would have been in line with most European countries.</P>
    <P>Under that administration a number of other developments and structural changes took place in the system and I am sure that the present Government did not welcome them and do not enjoy having to tolerate them now.  They are stuck with them, because in the area of social welfare once a progressive move is made, no matter how distasteful it may be to the people who inherit the changes, the political reality is that the clock cannot be turned back except in some marginal cases.  There is one case where you can turn back the clock and to which I will come back in a few minutes. The children's allowance being made payable to the mother, the supplementary <Col N="1791" /> welfare allowance&mdash;although the way it is being administered under the orders of the Minister would leave a lot to be desired, at least the principle is there and it can be improved&mdash;allowances for deserted wives, prisoners' dependants and unmarried mothers and pay-related benefits were changes introduced over those four and a half years.  It is difficult to recall all of them off the top of one's head but the record and progress are there.</P>
    <P>On a number of things there has been no progress although the work was done and was left on the desk of the incoming Minister.  An instance is the question of pay-related pensions.  A great deal of excellent, detailed work was produced by the staff of the Department.  One would have expected that a considerable amount of progress would have been made in respect of pay-related pensions over a three-year period, particularly when all the groundwork was there sitting on the desk of the incoming Minister.  Nobody has heard a word about pay-related pensions in that time and no serious attempt has been made to bring that concept into reality.  One wonders if it has been brushed aside or whether it is being held in order to be used, not for social advance and improvement but for electoral or political reasons.</P>
    <P>The one instance in which the clock has been turned back is the question of the National Committee to Combat Povety.  That committee were brought into being in 1974 and were sponsored and set up by the Government of the day.  In addition to the national input, proposals were put forward by the Irish delegation to the EEC Social Ministers which would elevate the scheme into an EEC project.  Apart from the financial gain of that, it also ensured that in each of the nine member states poverty committees were set up and various projects were undertaken by the national committees in the various states.  They benefited from our experience and endeavours here and we could get knowledge from their undertakings, experience and projects.  When this committee <Col N="1792" /> were set up there was ony one criteria for membership: that individual members required a reputation in the field of poverty and had to be people of independent mind.  No consideration whatsoever was given to what their political allegiance may have been.  They were given almost a totally free hand, and by that I mean that they had to submit expenditure over and above a certain figure to the Department for approval. That approval was invariably forthcoming very speedily because it was recognised that any holdup of the work of the committee would be detrimental to their progress.</P>
    <P>From the time that the present Taoiseach, the then Minister for Health and Social Welfare, went into that office the relationship between the Department and the committee deteriorated very rapidly.  As I said here in my speech on his nomination, to the office of Taoiseach, he impeded the work of that committee in every way possible short of coming into open conflict with them.  The only reason he was not prepared to come into conflict with them was that it would damage his personal political career and advancement, but the whole philosophy and purpose of that committee were anathema to the Taoiseach and to his Government.  I predicted then, and unfortunately have been proved correct, that at the first possible opportunity the Taoiseach and his Government would undermine seriously the work of that committee.  That has been done by a cutback of £140,000 approximately in the Government allocation and in the context of the money available to the committee that is a very serious cutback.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask one question of the Minister and the Government with regard to priorities and the concept of what the Department of Social Welfare are about in the whole area of social welfare.  What is their priority?  I sat here on budget day and I saw the Minister for Finance stand up and make his budget speech.  Somewhere in the course of that speech the Minister changed from English to Irish and in the course of speaking in Irish for seven or eight <Col N="1793" /> minutes he announced that the Government were making available to the GAA £100,000 to compensate them for VAT on hurley sticks.  I recognise the work of the GAA, who are a great national organisation.  Apart from the glory of Croke Park and the bigger matches, they do a considerable amount of work for young boys and girls, boys particularly, throughout the country and a lot of these boys come from deprived families.  I know personally some of the people engaged in that work and what time and effort they give to it.  Also they give some of their own money, which is spent in the furtherance of that work.  Taking all that for granted, I wonder how many members of the GAA, if they were asked which is their priority in a society which has 20 per cent to 25 per cent of its people recognised as living in poverty, would say that their priority would be to leave that £100,000 with the national committee engaged in the work of trying to find ways not only to alleviate poverty but to eradicate it.  Would they want that £100,000 to be given to them in order that they could be free from paying VAT on the purchase of hurling sticks?  I am confident that if this was put to the members of the GAA in those terms, they would undoubtedly opt for the money being left with the committee to combat poverty.  This Government recognised an unfortunate reality, that the Minister, speaking in Irish for seven or eight minutes on budget day and giving £100,000 to the GAA for hurling sticks, would get votes for Fianna Fáil and would reinforce the image of the great national party, the great republicans, the great commitment to our national games.  That was the only criterion that counted.  Once it gets across to the members of the GAA who are trying to promote our national games where the £100,000 came from, that it was transferred from the Committee to Combat Poverty to pay VAT on hurling sticks, they will feel the same sense of revulsion that I feel for a Government with that type of priority.  Once people recognise what was done, why it was done and how it was done, as far as vote catching is concerned, it will be counter-productive. <Col N="1794" /> The budget in its approach to social welfare is totally consistent with the whole political and life's philosophy of the Taoiseach and the Government. They have their values, but a growing number of people, particularly young people, have fortunately a different sense of values.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions some of which were very thoughtful and wideranging.  I am glad that most of the Deputies openly welcomed the increases involved in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMahon welcomed the Bill and pointed out we had had a milder winter this year and said that he was concerned about a number of questions, one of which was the whole question of home heating in relation to the future development of the free fuel allowance scheme.  The Deputy commented on the need for a national free fuel allowance scheme and the fact that my predecessor did not actually complete the work he undertook and into which he put a lot of effort.  My predecessor introduced a new principle in that he introduced a change in the scheme and introduced the principle of the voucher.  I hope to be able to build on this in going into the review for next autumn.  I will undertake a review so that next year's scheme will be suitable and improved.  There are of course anomalies because the scheme covers only certain designated areas, and I will be most concerned with this aspect. Any revisions are subject to the limitation of the financial resources, but I would assure the Deputy that we will review the situation, working from the principle established by my predecessor over last winter.  Deputy McMahon also referred to the refund scheme for drugs and referred particularly to pensioners on social assistance.  In relation to such people I will certainly consider the Deputy' point.</P>

All increases other than the children's allowances will come <Col N="1795" /> in in early April next, that is within a month, presuming that we get this Bill through the Dáil.  Deputy McMahon's contribution led to some confusion on Deputy Bermingham's part and I would inform him that all the increases will come in by 7 April, except for the children's allowance which as is normally the case will come in on 1 July. Deputy Bermingham welcomed the increases and mentioned the case of a widow with three children.  As an example Deputy Bermingham referred to his mother and the situation which arose in her case, she being a widow with three children.  It is to be welcomed that, in this budget, the weekly income of a widow with three children goes up by £9 to £45. In relation to old age pensions Deputy Bermingham raised the question of the qualifying age and it was subsequently taken up by other Deputies.  It was suggested that the age be reduced from 66 to 65 years.  As Minister for Social Welfare I would be glad in any year to do all the things listed by Deputies and by myself, but we have to make arrangements having regard to the resources available.  To reduce the age from 66 to 65 would cost a further £12.8 million.  I hope this can be looked at in future budgets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham raised the question of supplementary welfare allowance, as did a number of other Deputies. Deputy Bermingham said that there was a Victorian attitude towards the allowance and suggested that we seem to think that people are not as entitled to this supplementary income as people are to normal incomes.  One of the pleasing features of the budget is the fact that people benefiting from supplementary welfare allowances are fully recognised in terms of their right to an income level and their position is more than maintained in present circumstances.  This aspect will be monitored as it goes ahead.  In relation to the Victorian attitude, our instructions to the health boards, are to be as helpful as possible in the operation of the scheme.  I accept that the Deputy would like to see the scheme operated in a better way and I <Col N="1796" /> will give consideration to this.  Having been previously tied, as another Deputy mentioned, to the schemes and the home assistance concept, that attitude and concept tend to carry on.  I can assure the Deputy and also Deputy Cluskey that our instructions are that this scheme should be operated in a generous way accepting the fact that people in those circumstances are in temporary difficulty and therefore outside normal schemes for a temporary period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham referred to the administration of social welfare and questioned the payment of disability benefits.  He also said he could not get an answer to phone calls.  If he has any specific cases he can cite to me I will be only too glad to hear of them.</P>

      <P>Cases other than disability benefit often involve investigation of means.  There are usually delays in that instance as is the case with transfers of land and so on.  However, I accept the point that there are difficulties. I visited some of the centres, for example, Oisín House, operating the information service to ensure that the people who come in are treated in a cordial and helpful way.  I have had meetings with the staff who meet the people and we discussed the delays and the attitude which we want to see in such centres.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nolan raised a number of questions and also welcomed the increases. He asked that the widow's contributory pension should be kept in line with the single person's retirement pension. This will be considered in connection with the national income-related pension scheme which is being reviewed and to which I am giving any urgency I can.  He also complimented the staff in the Department of Social Welfare, and in that differed from the attitude of other Deputies.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is wise.  The staff kept their offices open during a very difficult period and made extra arrangements for the payment of benefits during that time.  There are delays but we will do our best with them. In some areas there are no delays.</P>
      <P>The postal dispute caused tremendous difficulties for the staff.  They had to do a great deal of overtime and made alternative arrangements to get money out to people.  For this they were criticised.  My predecessor put a lot of effort into ensuring that as far as possible the money went out.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Brien stated that he found no social welfare philosophy in the Bill.  Deputy Cluskey saw nothing big in the Bill.  As far as philosophy is concerned, the first one is a commitment of £90.2 million to people in that sector as a right.  It is there for them.  It is part of keeping them in touch with developments and an effort to keep ahead of the rate of inflation and the consumer price index in this area.  There is a good deal of money philosophy in the first instance.  I welcome that and it is important.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a discussion with the Deputy anywhere or any time about any of these aspects.  There have been numerous structural changes in applying this philosophy.  There were 14 changes which improved various aspects of the scheme.  For example, blind persons will receive benefits from 18 years of age instead of 21 years of age. These changes are in the Bill and Deputies should be aware of them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien also referred to people dying of cold and to the elderly found dead in their homes.  I know of one case which was highlighted in the media.  It is unfair in relation to local agencies, both voluntary and health boards, to be critical of the situation.  A great deal is done in these cases and it is not always the fault of the Government or the agencies if people do not accept the assistance given.  If one goes into the detail of cases one will often find that certain parts of the assistance are accepted but that people value their own privacy and insist on it.  There are more to the headlines than reach the newspapers.</P>
      <P>As regards the fuel scheme I shall be reviewing it before the autumn.  Deputy O'Brien mentioned having to go cap in hand for supplementary welfare.  One should not have to do this and I should like to see the allowances there as a right.  He also mentioned children's allowances and the increases that occurred during the Coalition period. There are 1.2 million children who benefit under this scheme.  I have a table which shows the real increases during the Coalition period.  In 1974 the real increase in children's allowances was &mdash; 7.4 per cent; in 1975 &mdash;15.27 per cent; in 1976 &mdash;6.19 per cent; in 1977 &mdash;10.46 per cent; in 1978 &mdash;7.12 per cent; in 1979 +11.95 per cent.  There has now been a further very substantial real increase during the period of Fianna Fáil. We ought to stick to the factual situation when we are talking about the relevant periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" /> Deputy O'Brien also raised the question of the postal dispute and the difficulties in the payment of social welfare during that time.  He made an interesting point about the manpower service but he is not aware of what has been done to date.  He tried to point out that Labour and Social Welfare are involved in this area of unemployment and that consequently there should be some relationship between the two.  The position is that there is now a manpower officer at each of the major employment exchanges and it is the intention to extend this service to all employment exchanges. The idea is good and the Deputy's point is very relevant.</P>
    <P>The second point raised by Deputy O'Brien concerned the general question of information and publicity.  In this regard there are in the course of preparation some additional booklets which I trust will be of benefit especially to widows and to the elderly.  These booklets will give details of all the benefits and the rights for these people, but this will be done by way of a separate booklet for each category instead of having merely the one booklet dealing with all the services.  For instance, there will be one booklet in respect of benefits for the elderly, one in respect of benefits for the unmarried mother and so on.  We are hoping to have some output soon from this exercise.</P>
    <P>In regard to making use of the media to give publicity to the various benefits and rights, all I can say to the Deputy is that we shall do our best.  The Deputy spoke about the benefit of the small whiskey so far as old age pensioners are concerned.  Without wishing to become involved in the health aspect of that argument.  I assure the Deputy that in general my observations would tend to agree with those expressed by him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised a number of points and asked whether there may be further increases in October.  We will monitor the situation as the year progresses and shall see what may be necessary at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> The same Deputy raised the question of living-alone allowances.  As my time is very limited this evening I may have to communicate with him directly on this matter.  There are allowances in respect of incapacitated persons but the case of the handicapped person cited by the Deputy may not be coming within the definition of the code.  However, we shall examine the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised also the question of old age pensions as they relate to married couples.  While he was talking about people who are on assistance, perhaps the best way to deal with the question is, if at all possible, by way of a national income-related pension scheme.  I will be pressing on with such a scheme because it would be of great benefit to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of the EEC-subsidised free milk scheme which is operated by local authorities. The scheme is a matter for them and for the schools, but from our point of view we should be happy to recover 50 per cent of the cost where possible.  I am aware that some of the schools are not very keen to operate the scheme but I accept the point that if money is available for milk we should make use of that money where possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that only urban local authorities have the statutory authority to operate the scheme and that, in addition, local authorities are being constrained this year by the 10 per cent limit in funds with the result that the funds to operate the free milk scheme are not available to them?  Consequently any initiative in this regard would have to come from the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>On the question of smallholders' assistance, there is not any need for accounts.  They are not required in respect of those whose valuations are more than £20.  For the purposes of social welfare the returns from the marts and creameries are sufficient for such people.  The increased rates will apply to those on a factual basis and there will not be any difficulty for people transferring to factual assessment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey talked about the hand-out situation and referred to the system of supplementary welfare allowances.  He had a good deal to say about the Poverty Committee and referred in this context to a cutback of £140,000 in the estimate.  I do not think there is a cutback of that amount.  That figure would be against what was sought and in effect the rate is being maintained at last year's level.  Like other bodies, this committee sought considerable additional funds, but I assure the Deputy that the funds are being retained at last year's level.</P>
      <P>The same Deputy referred also to the GAA <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Poverty Committee and put one against the other, so to speak.  That is really putting the children and sport against the committee.  The Deputy said that we will get our answer in the ballot box next time around.  It is unworthy of Deputy Cluskey to single out children in relation to this measure of £100,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I wish to make one brief point regarding disability benefit.  In the year ended 31 March 1969 about 21 per cent, or one in five, of the workforce claimed disability benefit; yet in the year ended 31 December 1978 35 per cent, or almost two in five, of the workforce claimed disability benefit.  As we are supposed to have had an improvement in the general health of the community in the decade between 1969 and 1979, it is very odd that the number of people claiming disability benefit should have almost doubled.  I would like to ask the Minister if he believes this very dramatic increase from 21 per cent to 35 per cent is a result of a worsening in health of the workforce or of it becoming easier for people to get doctors' certificates because there are not officers investigating the situation.  Or is it simply a result of a change in the regulations or the general desirability for people to want to claim the benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it a change of that nature is very hard to explain.  The big jump took place between 1975 and 1976.  In 1975 only 24 per cent of the workforce claimed disability benefit. Suddenly in 1976 that jumped to 32 per cent.  It remained at 32 per cent in 1977 but in 1978 it jumped to 35 per cent.  We may well have a situation where an even larger proportion will be claiming disability benefits next year.  The Minister should investigate this.  If more people are getting sick at work, as these figures <Col N="1803" /> tend to suggest, there is something radically wrong.  Either our health programmes are not working, the disability benefit scheme is not working or else in the 1969 period people were not claiming the benefits to which they were entitled, although I have some doubt about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very wide-ranging question and we could have quite a discussion on it.  The figures for alcoholism have significantly increased over this period and that could have an influence. Also, as far as married women are concerned, there has been an easement of the conditions of entitlement and they came into the reckoning.  The number of medical referees has increased, and this legislation is a control measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the change is accounted for primarily by the eligibility of married women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That could be one factor.  The Deputy asked for reasons off the cuff and this is one.  There has been a change structurally and technically in that way and there are others.  The Deputy suggested that people may not have known to claim the benefits to which they had a right.  It is important to bear in mind that this is an insurance scheme for which the people, employers and employees, are paying.  It is important to avoid abuse of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that people are often in a position to claim these benefits even if they are not too ill to work.  The trouble is that it is very hard to disprove that a person has not a bad back.  I think the accent should be on positive health, encouraging people to work and developing the dignity of work as something which is positively helpful. Would the Minister be prepared to carry out an investigation to see what are the real reasons, apart from those we have been speculating about here?</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the decision of the Government to abolish the Home Improvement Grants Scheme and the Household Grant Scheme having regard to the need to extend the life and capacity of our national housing stock and to conserve energy and further deplores the prolonged delay in the processing of current grant applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> I welcome the new Minister of State for the Environment, Deputy Connolly, and I commiserate with his rapid change of role, having been brought in specifically to administer a grant scheme and suddenly finding that, unique among his Government colleagues, he was redundant. The political position of the Minister of State demonstrates the absurd position in which the Government find themselves in relation to house improvement grants.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have always maintained that an effective and progressive housing policy must rest as much on what it does to conserve the existing housing stock as on the promotion of additional new housing units being built in any year.  This decision was taken in panic by the Government. There is no rational reason for it and one must assume that there is some residue of reason on the Government's side.  It is a decision which has seriously damaged the progress of conservation and improvement which is an essential part of housing policy if we are to maintain our housing stock.  In real human terms its effect has been to destroy and distort the private household budgets of numerous families, perhaps in the region of 30,000. It has had a disastrous effect on the position of the small builder employing two or three people.</P>
    <P>We were one of the first states in Europe to devise and implement a system of home improvement grants.  It has had different forms at different times.  At some times the amounts were too little and at others the means test excluded too many people from the scheme.  At no stage, however, was it argued that the system was ineffective or wasteful or that it did not fulfil the national need.</P>
    <P>In two White Papers published by Fianna Fáil administrations, <i>Housing in the Seventies</i> and <i>Prospects and Progress for Housing</i>&mdash;the latter published in the sixties&mdash;there were frequent references to the very high rate of <Col N="1806" /> home ownership in this country in comparison with any other European country and the consequent validity of maintaining in some form a scheme of home improvement grants.  That tradition goes back a long time and I will not take up the time of the House in attempting to document it historically.  I will start with the last chapter in its demise&mdash;until the next election when, no doubt, it will be produced out of the hat when the manifesto mark 2 is published and there is money galore.  I will start with the last described as the most important book in Ireland since the Bible.</P>

      <P>The White Paper went on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attainment of a general improvement in housing conditions depends not only on a high level of new house completions as in recent years but also on effective management of the existing stock.  The Government have substantially increased reconstruction grants and loans and have also extended the range of housing <Col N="1807" /> eligible for such grants.  This programme should ensure an improvement in the quality of the stock of existing housing as well as leading to its more effective use.</P>
    <P>What can we presume will be the effect on housing stock of this first instalment?</P>
    <P>The White Paper <i>Development for Full Employment</i> of June 1978, states as follows:</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the steps already taken by the Government in introducing the £1,000 grant, abolising domestic rates and increasing the local authority house purchase loan limits, adoption of the suggestions listed in preceding paragraphs should contribute greatly to advancing the goal of increased owner-occupation and so of reducing the need for local authority house building.</P>
    <P>In the third version of the approved text published in January 1979 there was another reference to the housing stock. Paragraph 5.6 states:</P>
    <P>The maintenance of the existing housing stock in good repair is an important element of housing policy. Following the recent substantial increases in improvement grants and loans, the extension of the range of housing eligible for such grants and the derating of private houses, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of improvements being carried out to existing dwellings.  This is shown by the fact that the number of applications for improvement grants for houses at almost 35,000 in 1978 was nearly double the number in 1977.  The value of grant-aided improvement work in progress has reached a record level of the order of £30 million.  Since the labour content of such work is high, there have been corresponding benefits in the form of higher employment.</P>
    <P>Not only is the housing stock seen as benefiting from the scheme but there is an employment spin-off as well.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to describe the last White Paper, which was published and <Col N="1808" /> withdrawn almost the same day.  Given its unique status and the fact that it has a certain twilight quality, it is interesting to see what this White Paper had to say in relation to housing stock and housing policy generally.  Presumably somebody on the Government side wrote part of it.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the White Paper <i>Investment and National Development 1979-1983</i>, paragraph 5.17 of which states as follows:</P>
      <P>An important aim of national housing policy is to maintain and improve the existing housing stock.  Improvement work on about 30,000 dwellings (or 3 per cent of the total housing stock) will be grant-aided in 1979.  It is expected that activity in this area will continue at a high level reflecting substantial investment by householders in maintaining and improving their property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This document was laid by the Government before each House of the Oireachtas in January 1980.  Within three weeks the Minister for the Environment went into a meeting hall in Clarecastle, did not even deliver the full <Col N="1809" /> text of this document and simply left it with the meeting and said &ldquo;Watch the news tonight, fellows.  There is an important announcement in relation to grants&rdquo;.  He buried 40 to 50 years of housing policy in a miserable, cowardly runaway from the reality of what had been sound Government policy over the years.</P>
    <P>This motion has been put down to discover why it has become necessary for a Government to abandon the entire system of housing grants because the Government's management of financial affairs has got totally out of control. Why, politically, did it become necessary to throw the baby out with the bathwater?  That in essence is what we are discussing.  One can only be forced to the conclusion that the 1977 manifesto, drawn up we are told by a think-tank, did not fully understand, or was unable to compute, or disregarded the financial implications of a free for all grant scheme that was so flaithiúl and generous and so anxious to buy votes that it did not realise the housing implications, the financial implications or the administrative implications of the promises put before the electorate.</P>
    <P>The reason why this grant scheme has been buried or abandoned is that it got totally out of control administratively. Every Deputy in the House knew about it beforehand.  I have a letter from a Labour councillor in Clare&mdash;I think he is well known to the Minister&mdash;who refers to his first cousin's husband who applied for a £1,000 grant in August 1979 but is still waiting for it.  It is a thing that is easy to measure&mdash;it is either a new house or it is not, it concerns somebody who is eligible or who is not. Think of the hundreds of people around the country&mdash;Deputy Flynn has them in his constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The entire political administration of this system has broken down.  During the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, on Second and Committee Stages, I said that the Custom House under the stewardship of the Minister&mdash;I do not lay any responsibility on the Minister of State&mdash;allowed itself politically to be relegated into the Fourth Division, virtually out of the league altogether&mdash;and the Department of Finance ran the operation; somebody at the level of assistant principal officer had told the people who had been responsible for our housing policy during the past 30 or 40 years how to operate it.  Between early December and Christmas a mad instruction, Santa Claus in reverse, demanded that the scheme be abandoned overnight because the level of applications was running too high.  In a hit and run speech in Clarecastle on 21 January the Minister announced he was ending these grants.</P>
      <P>In February I received a reply to a question to the effect that the grant applications in 1977, 1978 and 1979 had run at 18,000, 37,000 and 52,000 respectively.  They included home improvement grants, solid fuel grants and water and sewerage grants.  So clever was the way in which the Minister handled the cancellation of the grant schemes that in reply to a second question by me about the number of grant applications received from the night he announced in Clarecastle the cancellation of the scheme, he said that up to the closing date, 1 February, he had received a total of 24,142 applications for the solid fuel boilers.  The total number of applications for that period, 21 January 1980 to 1 February 1980, was 44,816, including the solid fuel installations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to think the Government's is as well.  It is good to see Deputy Flynn being comforted by the state of housing in his constituency to the extent that he can view with equanimity the burial of this type of housing scheme.  I can assure him that in the constituency I represent the abolition of the scheme will cause undoubted hardship.  First of all, it will cause fierce personal cash flow problems for people who had committed themselves to certain kinds of construction and who now, because of economic policy on a general front find that the banks are closed as far as any credit is concerned.  It is causing serious problems for small builders who are employing themselves and three or four other workers and who make up 80 per cent at least of the building industry. These small contractors depend on this kind of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the people who were looking for such grants desperately needed to improve their housing because they knew they have not a hope in hell of getting <Col N="1812" /> local authority houses.  Now they are obliged to stay in the houses they occupied. Deputy Lawlor, with experience of the general position in Dublin, will agree with me about this situation.  In this country we prided ourselves on the percentage of home ownership and the assistance in the form of grants to provide bathrooms and toilets and so on.</P>
    <P>Think of the damage that has been done to the credibility of this system: the number of builders who on trust took contracts from householders to do work and the builders who had to wait for six or nine months to get their money.  Will they do that again?  Of course they will not.  They are going bankrupt.  They are caught on the one hand between cash demanded for building materials, no grants coming from the Government, and the banks unable to extend any credit.  That is the real harvest of the profligate manifesto of 1977.  In attempting to buy votes the scheme was made so generous and was extended to categories of people who were not in the same need of housing as those who desperately needed home improvements that the thing got swamped.  In the traditional right wing Fianna Fáil way we have seen so often in the past, the people who effectively benefited from this, because you needed to put up money to get money in the new house grant scheme, already had it.  Now, when the Government run into difficult times there is no suggestion of a means test or any suggestion of restricting it and saying that the people who want weather glaze windows can finance them themselves or those who want to convert their grates can finance them themselves, because they already had the rates abolished so that people who want bathrooms, toilets or running water in their houses might get some degree of preference.  No, the whole thing goes. That is housing policy from the party of reality.</P>
    <P>In the current edition of the White Paper there is reference to employment, and the employment content of home improvement schemes for 30,000 applications a year or approximately 3 per <Col N="1813" /> cent of housing stock.  What happened to that?  What happens to the job creation programme relating to the construction industry?  What happened to the frequently boasted 5,000 extra jobs created in the construction industry in the first year of the present Fianna Fáil administration? They were funded by schemes like this.  It is reasonable to assume, if the market is in any way rational, that if you eliminate or withdraw the funding the jobs will go with it.  Not only has the housing stock been damaged but the building industry in general has been damaged, particularly the most vulnerable section of it.  In addition an unspecified number of people will be out of work because of this.</P>
    <P>I know that no Deputy in the House welcomes the abolition of those grants.  I know that Deputy Flynn and Deputy L. Lawlor are doing a loyal job in the House tonight.  I also know that they have received the same kind of representations in relation to the abolition of those grants as I have received.  I am sure they have also read the story about how the office of the Minister for the Environment ran out of application forms in Ennis half an hour after the announcement. It was Labour councillors in Clare who were making application forms available which now flood the desk of the Minister of State, to which he is courteously replying giving an acknowledgement.  It is a much more difficult thing for the Minister of State to indicate when those grants are likely to be paid, assuming they are in order, in that the effect of 44,000 applications in the first three weeks of the year is a nightmare for the Minister for Finance because they come due at approximately the same time.</P>
    <P>What system of priority will there be? Will there be an allocation?  How long will they be on bridging finance?  How long will the builders have to wait for their money?  What special kind of pleading can a Deputy make to the Minister of State?  Can he say that a particular case has been in for nine months and will he kindly do something about it because the bank will close on the <Col N="1814" /> builder?  What special kind of argument will have priority for getting those grants out in time?  If the argument is that the Government had to terminate the grants because they had an unexpectedly high level of demand running at 52,000 for the year, then it is 100 times more valid if they get 44,000 applications in the first three weeks of the year.  I would like to hear the Minister of State, besides describing his attempts to enter his office on a famous occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like the Minister, in moving his amendment, to indicate how he will redeploy the public funds which are already committed as a result of the three weeks open season on those grants to those people who are entitled to them. There are people at the moment who are legitimately entitled to those grants.  The frequent source of complaint now is that those people who applied in that threeweek period do not know when they will get paid.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last two and a half years we have repeatedly asked the Government to put some kind of flesh to the frequent well-meaning phrase they published in their White Paper and the Government announcements on housing policy in relation to the conservation of the housing stock.  As far as I remember, on Committee Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill the Minister indicated that there was a good future for measures relating to the conservation of housing stock.  He was asked on a number of occasions if he would introduce some kind of energy conservation grants to counteract the disastrous loss of heat and energy we have in our housing stock.  The House is probably well aware that 70 per cent of the energy consumed in the country is consumed in building either for space heating or for related purposes.  We have probably the worst system of heat conservation, including insulation and building standards generally, of any country in northern Europe.  Belatedly &mdash;perhaps it was a taste of the <Col N="1816" /> chaos that was to come&mdash;the Minister introduced a grant scheme for the back boiler, then cancelled it, then had a think again and reintroduced it.  In his opening speech on Second Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979, a large amending piece of legislation enabling him to do many things, he stated in this House on 27 June:</P>
      <P>The grant provisions of the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1970, are inflexible in that the amounts of grants payable, floor area limits and other detailed qualifying conditions are specified by the Acts so that changes which were found to be desirable from time to time in grant schemes required amending legislation.  This situation has proved to be unduly rigid in the light of the frequency of these changes.  To meet this situation, sections 4 to 6 of the Bill have been drafted on the basis that a broad general power is conferred on the Minister or a housing authority to pay a grant for specified purposes, subject to such regulations as may be made by the Minister for the purposes of the section concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcomed that amending legislation. But little did we believe, in our innocence, that it was the forerunner of the abolition of virtually the entire scheme. If the Minister had indicated at that stage that, not only was he going to remove the minor details and constraints that were embodied in the legislation, but that he was, in effect, going to abolish the entire system, we would have had a much different debate.  I will accept that perhaps the Minister did not know at that time.  I have frequently stated that as far as we are concerned politically on this side of the House&mdash;and it is not meant to be a personal slight on the occupants of the ministerial chair at the Custom House&mdash;the Department of the Environment have been on automatic pilot since 1977.  There is no political direction.  Consequently I say to the present incumbent, who is a new Minister of State who has responsibility for housing and for housing grants generally, that <Col N="1817" /> he should, for God's sake, rescue the Department of the Environment and particularly the housing section from its relegation to the fourth division which has taken place over the last two and a half years.  It did not have that status when Deputy Blaney was there.  It certainly did not have that status when Deputy Boland was there and, while it went through a shaky period with Deputy Molloy, it was more than rescued by Deputy Tully in the politically heavyweight Department. That is not the case any more and because that is not the case any more the Department of Finance were able to run the raid on the grant scheme which makes, perhaps, financial sense to some accountant in the Department of Finance.  But, in one fell swoop, it has done two things; it has made it administratively impossible for the grant section in O'Connell Bridge House to administer the 44,000 grant applications received in the period of three weeks and it has done untold damage to the housing stock and to the building industry that has grown up around the repair and maintenance of the housing stock.</P>
    <P>There are two last points I want to move to before I finish.  If the housing stock is not maintained, extended and developed people who live in substandard housing, who occupy inadequate housing or who are forced to take a second family, for example, a married daughter or son, into an unreasonably small house and who do not have the financial assistance to extend or amend or improve that house in one shape or another will be undoubtedly pushed on to the local authority housing list.</P>
    <P>The entire drift and direction of Fianna Fáil's housing policy since they came back into office in 1977 has been to encourage home ownership by reference to the private market.  It is quite clear that the financial institutions combined with the building industry have put private housing costs beyond the reach of many lower income families. That was bad enough.  At least there was the grant scheme that enabled them to try to put on some kind of extension. <Col N="1818" /> Now that has been taken away too and many of these people are going to be forced on to the local authority housing lists.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Barrett, has had the unique privilege of presiding over a continuous decline, to all intents and purposes, of local authority housing completions since he took office in July 1977.  It is much more expensive, if one is simply using an accountancy chart taken from the Department of Finance, to house somebody in a local authority house, as Deputy O'Donoghue frequently pointed out in the White Paper, than to extend the grant scheme to enable somebody to put on an extra bedroom or an extra bathroom.  This is going to be one of the effects of this grant scheme abolition. People will be forced on to the local authority housing list who otherwise would not find themselves there.</P>
    <P>The second reason to which I want to refer is the question of energy conservation generally.  We had started, belatedly and after much prompting from this side of the House, a system of energy conservation grants for our housing stock and, for all its flaws&mdash;and there were many&mdash;it was a start.  The principle of the grant scheme had been accepted and it was something upon which successive administrations, and indeed successive Ministers of the same Government, could build upon and argue the case.  As the price of energy inevitably rose each year, and indeed each month, the logic of such a scheme and the immediate cash benefit and return to the national economy could be accurately measured. This has been abandoned, too, and it is quite possible that the alleged savings which will arise as a result of the abolition of this scheme will be more than offset by increased demands for energy and the consequent cost which householders will now make, that is, assuming they can get it.  We, on this side of the House, must draw the conclusion that whatever about the technical competence of the officials in the Custom House which is undoubted so far as we are concerned, the political chaos and confusion that rages in the Minister's office, whether it be in the <Col N="1819" /> Custom House or in O'Connell Bridge House, is something which if the public were really to see it in operation would cause a scandal in this country.</P>
    <P>A tradition of maintaining the housing stock which has been validated by successive Governments here and recognised by numerous external agencies as being the correct kind of policy for a country like this to adopt has been thrown out in one fell swoop in a miserable speech delivered in Clare castle to a small audience who did not even hear the full text but were directed to watch the news at 9 o'clock on RTE. The effect of it will be to make the housing position of many people more miserable than it is at present, to create extra unacceptable financial pressures on numerous small builders who are the first to go to the wall in the kind of recession that we are currently experiencing, and to destroy the credibility of any grant scheme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Minister and the Deputies on the Government side of the House recognise the kind of political damage that has been done.  The Minister, in the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in the RDS a couple of weeks back, indicated that he was considering a couple of proposals to introduce a new form of means tested grant.  Undoubtedly it will be unfurled with a great fanfare of trumpets three weeks before polling day.  I ask the Minister of State present and the Government backbenchers who may speak on this matter to say if they think the Irish public will believe that.  Does it take an election to extract from Fianna Fáil the kind of housing policy that is so desperately needed?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the steps taken by the Government to redeploy the public funds available for housing in the current year, to ensure that priority is given to the most deserving categories of housing need&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> I am grateful to the Deputies opposite who decided that this motion be discussed. The debate gives me a welcome opportunity to correct some misrepresentations and misunderstandings which have been aired both within this House and outside it.  It is right and proper that the reasons for the Government's decision about house improvement grants should be put on the record and I have no doubt that fair-minded people, irrespective of their political affiliations, will agree that the package of measures taken including the abolition of house improvement grants, is in the best interest of the national housing programme.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion criticised the decision to end the house improvement grants scheme, including grants to reduce dependence on oil for domestic heating purposes.  Their motion ignores some basic facts governing the situation which were made clear by the Minister for the Environment in his public statement on the subject on 21 January last&mdash;in particular, that the amount of money which the State can afford to provide for housing operations this year is not unlimited and that the decision in regard to the grants was only one of a comprehensive set of actions taken to redeploy the available finances in such a way that assistance from public funds would be channeled to help persons who genuinely need and merit that help.</P>
    <P>To put our country on a sound economic footing it is necessary that the community should stop living beyond their means, and especially that the extent of taxation on public borrowing should be rigidly controlled.  In this context every aspect of public expenditure has had to be critically examined and some services, however desirable from a public viewpoint, suspended or curtailed. Against that background it was inevitable that the nature and scope of the Government's investment in housing would have to be included in that review. The Government's investment in and subvention of housing operations rose from £130 million under the Coalition's last budget to £180 million in 1978 and £212 million, in round figures, last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> If the financial arrangements which applied in 1979 were to remain unaltered in the current year, it is estimated that more than £250 million would be required to fund the operations.  Having regard to the scale of these and other demands on the Exchequer, the present economic situation, the outlook for the immediate future and anticipated international developments, it was clear to the Government that expenditure of this order from public funds on housing would not be feasible in 1980.  Immediate and radical measures were necessary to bring the spending within the limit of the public funds which could be provided.  It was in that situation that a decision was made to end the house improvement grants scheme.</P>
    <P>In deploying the total provision expected to be available for housing in the present year, the Government were concerned to ensure that the major part of the funds would be applied to deal with the housing needs of the less well-to-do and most deserving categories in the population. It was also considered that schemes of assistance which, at public expense and without regard to the means of the beneficiaries, increase the value of existing houses should not be continued.</P>
    <P>I challenge any Deputy opposite to condemn the policies inherent in that reallocation, to advise that the unprecedented increases in local authority house purchase and repair loans and in the income limits applicable to these loans should be cancelled or that the allocations for local authority housing programmes should be cut back in order that the house improvement grants scheme could be revived.</P>
    <P>The general scheme of house improvement grants had no regard to the economic circumstances of applicants. The work which qualified for grants was very wide-ranging, including the extension, enlargement, improvement or repair of a house which were reasonably necessary to make the house more suitable as a dwelling.  Grants were paid for sun parlours, playrooms, the conversion of garages into living accommodation <Col N="1822" /> tion and the provision of extra rooms which were in no way needed to relieve overcrowding.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that while the basic scheme of grants has been ended, the Government have decided to continue paying grants in cases in which exceptional conditions justify such exceptional treatment as for essential repairs to old rural houses, for the provision of accommodation for elderly persons and for the adaptation of existing houses to make them suitable for occupants suffering from physical disability or acute mental illness or mental handicap.  Grants for the provision of group piped water and sewerage schemes are, of course, being continued.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the termination of the grants to reduce dependence on oil is a retrograde step, having regard to the need for energy conservation.  I would suggest, however that the massive price increases and the occasional scarcity of supply of oil in 1979 and the rather grim prospects in this regard for 1980, should make people in their own interest convert from oil-fired to solid fuel heating.  In fact this was being done independently of the grants and a survey by An Foras Forbartha of private house building in Ireland in 1976 and 1978 showed that between those two years, while no grants to reduce dependence on oil were available, the proportion of new houses being provided with solid fuel systems increased from 13 per cent to 33 per cent or a 150 per cent increase.  This trend obviously is continuing and advertisements for many new private houses feature the provision of solid fuel systems.</P>
    <P>Persons of modest means will be more than compensated for the termination of the open-ended scheme of house improvement grants by the concurrent big increase in local authority loans for house improvement work.  The maximum unsecured loan which was a mere £200 before the change of Government in 1977 was increased to £600 in November of that year and has now been raised to £1,000 for work started on or after 1 February 1980.  Where <Col N="1823" /> security can be provided a loan of up to £4,000 may be advanced.  The interest rate on these loans is substantially lower than that charged by banks and other commercial agencies.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have a hard neck in criticising the action taken last January in connection with the house improvement grants.  They have short memories indeed if they cannot or do not choose to remember that under a Labour Minister for Local Government reconstruction grants were suddenly restricted in January 1977 to houses with low valuations with the result that only 11,517 reconstruction grants amounting to £2 million were paid in that year&mdash;this notwithstanding the abolition of the valuation restrictions by the present administration immediately on resuming office in July 1977.  Compare that record with the 29,764 grants, over and above water and sewerage grants, totalling £15 million which were paid last year.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies also that the severe restrictions on eligibility for reconstruction grants introduced in January 1977 came into operation without any warning and without giving an opportunity to persons excluded from eligibility who might have entered into binding commitments or bought materials in the expectation of obtaining a grant.  The previous administration gave no notice and did not give a hoot about anyone.  In contrast, my Government allowed a period of grace of two weeks up to 1 February 1980 to allow people in such circumstances to submit their applications for grants.  In consequence, 44,800 applications were submitted to my Department in that fortnight alone, corresponding to the total intake of applications during the first nine months of 1979.</P>
    <P>In January 1977, when the Coalition Government introduced the restrictions on reconstructon grants, the building industry was barely beginning to recover from the recession which occurred in the mid-seventies.  It was not until 1978, as a consequence of measures taken by the present Government, that the output of <Col N="1824" /> the industry again reached the level it had achieved when we left office in 1973. In other words, when the industry most needed additional capital expenditure and investment, the previous Government were, in fact, reducing the capital available to it.</P>
    <P>The situation in January 1980 was precisely the opposite to that which obtained in January 1977.  During the past two years the building industry had experienced rapid and unprecedented growth.  Indeed, the industry had grown at such a rate that there was evidence of a certain degree of overheating in some areas.  This was reflected in the difficulty experienced by builders in recruiting skilled workers in 1978 and 1979 and by the shortages of some building materials, notably cement, in 1979.</P>
    <P>If I have dealt at some length with the matter of house improvement works, it is necessary for the purpose of clarifying the Government's decision in relation to this particular scheme of grants to deal also with the question of new housing.</P>
    <P>It has been the basic principle of the Government's housing policies to encourage and assist every household to obtain a house of good standard, located in an acceptable environment, at a price or rent which they can afford, The only qualification on the implementation of this fundamental principle is the availability of the necessary national resources.  As a natural corollary of this policy the Government are committed to promoting the concept of home ownership. Our achievements in this regard have been so successful that we have the highest rate of owner-occupation of any European country.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Government also accept their responsibility to provide sufficient capital to enable local authorities to maintain a steady programme for the accommodation of persons living in unfit or overcrowded accommodation who lack the personal resources to rehouse themselves.  The local authority programme which had run into a serious decline from 1975 onwards has now been put on a basis in which about 6,000-plus dwellings are being completed <Col N="1825" /> at a steady rate year by year.  One of the results of the discontinuance of the house improvement grants is that practically £100 million is being made available to local authorities for their direct house building operations in 1980.</P>
    <P>The Government felt that they had a strong commitment to facilitate persons who did not already own houses and were not accepted for rehousing by local authorities to purchase dwellings for their occupation.  The claims of these people were felt to be more genuine than those of individuals who already had homes of their own and who, if the grants scheme were continued, would probably turn to the State for grants towards improving their existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>When we resumed office two and a half years ago the maximum annual income for qualification for a local authority house purchase loan was £2,350 and the maximum loan that could be obtained was £4,500 only.  Those limits had not been increased since 1973; four and a half years almost in which the Coalition had to do it but they did not.  We increased the income and loan limits on three occasions in less than three years. Now the maximum income is £5,500 a year, the maximum loan for new housing being £12,000, representing increases of 134 per cent and 166 per cent respectively over the July 1977 limits.</P>
    <P>The success of this policy of regular revisions of the limits is shown by the fact that last year local authorities approved 8,850 house purchase loans, including loans under the low-rise mortgage scheme, amounting to £72 million and that at the end of last December they had on hands over 14,913 applications for loans totalling £97.5 million.  The policy is an indication of the acceptance by the Government of the importance of these loans schemes in enabling persons in the middle and lower income groups to house themselves.</P>
    <P>The provision of mortgage finance from public funds for these categories was matched by the activities of the <Col N="1826" /> other main lending agencies and, during 1979, a total of £293 million in respect of a record 24,742 new and previously occupied houses was advanced by all such agencies, compared with £223 million for 22,648 houses in 1978.  Loans approved by the agencies totalled £374 million in value, representing 30,051 loans of which 15,833 were in respect of new houses.  Each of these three figures was a record for any one year.</P>
    <P>I am particularly happy to report that despite the huge and continuing volume of new house building in progress, stimulated by this massive investment of public and private funds, for the second consecutive quarter the Bulletin of Housing Statistics published by my Department has recorded a decrease in the average gross price of new houses for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies.  This welcome outcome is due in large measure to the measures taken by the Government to ensure that new houses for which loans are sought represent reasonable value for the price charged.</P>
    <P>Our success in pressing forward the objective of owner-occupation can be gauged from the fact that the number of now private houses built last year, at 20,330, was the highest total ever recorded. This form of tenure makes for national social stability.  It provides the householder with an asset the value of which is constantly increasing and, at the same time, vests in him a stake in the local community and a positive interest in working for the improvement of the standard of public services in his neighbourhood and the quality of his environment.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the delay in dealing with grant applications.  I do not deny that there are, and have been, delays on the part of the Department in dealing with grant applications.  From my own direct personal association with the working of the grants section I am satisfied that these delays are due to the huge growth in the numbers of applications for house improvement grants and particularly the unprecedented inflow during the fortnight ended 1 February <Col N="1827" /> 1980.  For example, the total numbers of such applications received in 1977, 1978 and 1979 were 18,907, 37,550 and 52,533 respectively.  The total number received between 1 January and 1 February 1980, was 49,381, including 44,800 in the final two weeks of that period.  In other words, the house improvement grant applications received in the five weeks of 1980 up to 1 February was almost the equivalent of the number received in 1979.</P>
    <P>I admit that there has been a delay. Steps had to be taken to enable the staff to deal with this unprecedented volume of work.  The public offices were closed, the telephone service suspended, staff was assigned temporarily from other sections to help and constant overtime was worked.  The position now is that all applications received have been acknowledged and practically all have been indexed, recorded and filed.  If there are now any outstanding cases they will be dealt with within a week.</P>
    <P>I want to say also that I am the first Minister to set up office in O'Connell Bridge House, where all the sections of the Department dealing with housing have been located for several years past. I did so because I considered housing too important and sensitive a matter to be dealt with by remote control from the Custom House.  I want to say also that I know every member of the staff in O'Connell Bridge House.  I wish to refer to remarks made by Deputy Tully last week and by Deputy Quinn.  An article appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 25 January last stating that because of the queues of people waiting outside the office in connection with house improvement grants I was unable to gain admission to my office.  The story is without foundation.  When I pointed this out in a letter to the Editor he had not the good grace to admit that the second- or thirdhand report which he had accepted for publication was a fabrication but suggested instead that his reporter had merely mistaken the date of the imaginery incident.</P>
    <P>I refer to this, not because I am thin skinned&mdash;what politician is?  &mdash;but <Col N="1828" /> because the story reflected on the competence and intelligence of the staff concerned and also in the hope that the truth of the matter will register with Deputy Tully who gave the fairy story an airing in the Dáil last week.  Deputy Tully knows how unwilling some prominent newspapers are to say honestly that they mistook fiction for genuine news.  The staff in O'Connell Bridge House are competent to deal with the position as they always have been.  The manner in which they dealt with the public was courteous and efficient and I thank them for that.  I am sure they will continue to deal with the public in regard to all grant applications in the same way.  If any Deputies write to me I will answer them and will not send a stereotype letter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It is not necessary for the purpose of this debate.  One thing is beyond doubt and that is that a precedent has been established by excluding citizens from access to the housing department of the Department of the Environment for a number of months.  They have been locked out and their phone calls are unanswered.  Of that there is no doubt.  That is a queer situation to find in a Department which only a short time ago abandoned another scheme, the licensing of motor drivers, because they found themselves in such a mess that they were unable to handle them.  That aspect, followed by the locking out of the public from the Department of the Environment and refusing to answer phone calls, reflects no credit on the Minister.</P>
      <P>made history by taking up residence in O'Connell Bridge House.  I hope to find that the doors will be open again to the people who keep him and his staff there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore the withdrawal of the house <Col N="1829" /> improvement grants by the Government. It represents a cruel attack on householders, who badly need assistance, living in houses unsuitable for them.  They find it impossible, because of the extraordinary price of houses at present, to provide new houses and want to prolong the life of their existing house and modernise it by adding rooms or providing essential facilities such as bathrooms and toilets, improving roofs and carrying out such repairs.  It is a shameful and disgraceful attack on people who badly need help.  We must consider the withdrawal of these grants in the light of the cost of providing new houses.  That is the yardstick we must judge this conduct by.</P>
    <P>Since 1976 the average price of a new house qualifying for a grant, according to a bulletin issued by the Minister's Department, has soared from £12,113 to £24,206 to the end of last year.  As far as I can see prices are still soaring contrary to what the Minister thinks.  I put a question down to the Taoiseach which was answered on 20 February asking him the average percentage increase in building materials per month in the years 1977, 1978 and 1979.  The information I received was that the average percentage monthly increase in building material was 1 per cent per month for 1977; 0.7 per cent for 1978; for the first ten months of 1979 it was a massive 1.8 per cent increase, nearly 2 per cent.  Surely if there was ever a time when it was reasonable and necessary to preserve the life of the existing housing stock this was the time.  The Government, when they came to office, found that there were housing grants available for the people who required them and money was not being squandered on them.  Deputy James Tully, then Minister for Local Government, modified the scheme by confining it to those who reasonably required it and fixed the poor law valuation of houses which would qualify for reconstruction grants&mdash;as they were then called&mdash;at £10.  I could not readily find statistics but I suggest that a £10 valuation covers the vast majority of our houses needing reconstruction.  It would <Col N="1830" /> cover and include the vast majority of our as yet unmodernised farm buildings which need water and toilet facilities.  It would cover all the local authority houses which have been vested in tenants, many of these houses without bathrooms, many without toilets.  It would cover the vast majority of private houses needing reconstruction.  When this Fianna Fáil administration came into Government there was a grant available of £400 for reconstruction&mdash;I hope I did not hear the Minister say correctly that it was £200.  There was, of course, £200 payable by the State and £200 payable by the local authority.</P>

Those grants were available to the people who wanted them, to thousands of small farmers who need grants to modernise their houses and improve them; to local authority tenants who buy <Col N="1831" /> houses that may have water but that certainly have not sewerage, and the many thousands of private householders who are in such an income group that they cannot possibly buy a new house.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> They did that all right.  They increased it by one-third to £600 maximum, which did not keep pace with the increase in the cost of building and the cost of reconstruction since that Government came into power, as the figures that I have show.  Having operated that grant which, in real terms, was not as good as the National Coalition Government's grant to those who needed it for two and a half years, this Government cut it out altogether and now there is no grant available to the man who wants to improve his house.</P>
      <P>Arising out of what Deputy Flynn said about the man who bought the bungalow for a holiday home, the position at the moment is that a very wealthy man can qualify for a £1,000 grant to build a new house, but the man who buys his house from the local authority for £1,000 or £2,000&mdash;a house that was built 30 or 40 years ago&mdash;and wants to replace doors and windows and to install a bathroom or put in a back scullery cannot get a shilling of a grant.

I say it is not good enough that that should be done. The position is that houses are gone beyond the capacity of people to buy or to build.</P>
      <P>There is another phenomenon appearing here at present and that is unfinished houses.  Many houses were started and have remained unfinished for months and months because the people who started to build them hoped that they would be able to get finance and cannot get it.

When drafting clarifications were made, it was not considered necessary to submit them for discussion. The TUI have recently drawn attention to two of these drafting clarifications. They relate to:</P>
      <P>(i)  the substitution of the adjective &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for the adjective &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; in qualifying the transfer of a religious teacher in circumstances which would not give rise to a vacancy in a community school.</P>

The initial phase of the scheme provides for preliminary courses of training in socio-economic advice and participation in the courses is open to all interested members of the agricultural advisory service.  So far, 148 persons have taken part in the preliminary courses and are available to meet requests from farmers and their families for socio-economic advice.  On the completion of the last of these preliminary courses early this year, it is intended to proceed with the selection and training of full-time socio-economic advisers to meet the full requirements of the directive.</P>
      <P>The purpose of such advisers as indicated in the directive is to give farming people general guidance on the possibilities open to them for improving their socio-economic situation, whether within agriculture or in outside occupations, or through retirement, so that in taking decisions affecting their own and their children's future, they will be in possession of all the relevant information.</P>
      <P>The level of EEC financial aid is as follows: 25 per cent of a standard amount of 7,500 units of account in respect of each qualified adviser entering upon his duties and 25 per cent of the expenditure incurred in training such advisers up to an overall amount of 4,500 units of account for each adviser trained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concern of local residents in the Fintown area of County Donegal at the possibility of uranium mining in the area.</P>
      <P>The question of actual mining of uranium in the area does not arise at the present time.  Under a licence granted by my Department, a minerals exploration company is engaged in a prospecting programme aimed at establishing the minerals potential of the areas licensed to them in the vicinity of Fintown. Whilst the company has reported positive indications of uranium presence, its work is at a relatively early stage and no firm conclusions can be drawn at present about the prospects of a deposit of commercial proportions being delineated. The licence does not authorise the company to carry out mining operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a commercial deposit is established it will be necessary for a prospective mine operator to secure planning permission from the local planning authority, to obtain a mining lease or licence from my Department and to secure a licence from the Nuclear Energy Board.  Before any mining operation could commence, the appropriate authorities would have to be fully satisfied in regard to impact of mining operations on public health and the environment and other aspects of public concern.  The adequacy of existing statutory requirements in the interests of public health and protection of the environment will be kept under review and, <Col N="1718" /> if necessary, they will be supplemented.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board, the statutory authority in Ireland in relation to radioactive substances, has advised me that there is no evidence that prospecting operations in the Fintown area, or elsewhere in the country, lead to any radiation hazard.  The board is keeping in close touch with prospecting activity in the area and has initiated a programme of measurement of any radioactivity in air, water and soil in the area.  Furthermore, to ensure adequate consultation between my Department, the board and other bodies with public responsibility in relation to uranium prospecting, I am setting up a working group under the chairmanship of a senior officer of my Department which will keep prospecting activity in the area under regular review.</P>

      <P>Capital acquisitions tax may, at the option of the taxpayer, be paid by five equal yearly instalments, the first of which is due 12 months from the date upon which the tax becomes payable. This option is available mainly in respect of the tax chargeable on lands and house property.  While it would not be possible to estimate with any certainty the cost to the Exchequer of doubling the instalment period to ten years, it can be assumed that the sum involved would not be significant for two main reasons.  Firstly, tax that is being paid by instalments is, in common with all outstanding capital acquisitions tax, liable to a charge to simple interest of 1¼ per cent per month.  Secondly, the percentage of taxpayers that currently avail of the option to pay by instalments is as low as 5 per cent of all taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the withdrawal of re-wiring grants from corporation tenants and tenant purchasers which is causing severe hardship; if, in a particular case (detailed supplied) in Dublin where electrical re-wiring is urgently needed, he will ensure that the local authority who are currently re-wiring all tenant houses in the area will re-wire this house in the interest of safety; if he is further aware that the withdrawal of re-wiring grants to tenants will mean the extra burdening of local authorities in this regard with resulting demands on public money and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>In so far as dwellings let by the corporation to tenants may require re-wiring, it is a matter for Dublin Corporation to carry out such work as part of their normal maintenance programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of tenant purchasers of corporation houses, a special arrangement was made whereby a grant for re-wiring on its own was made <Col N="1729" /> available to the tenant purchaser who met the balance of the cost from his own resources.  This arrangement terminated with the discontinuation of the improvement grant schemes, but applications for these special grants received on or before 1 February 1980 are being processed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>In the particular case quoted by the Deputy, I understand that an application for the re-wiring grant was not received up to the closing date of the improvement grant schemes.</P>
    <P>While the improvements grant schemes have been discontinued, I have had extra funds made available to enable home owners to carry out necessary improvement works with the aid of substantial loans if they so desire.</P>

I understand that the college considered the failure rate of the day release candidates to be unusually high. The results achieved by the 18 block release candidates in the same examination, however, were up to the standard of previous years, as were the results obtained by both categories of candidates in the other colleges involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Boland</b> asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason free board and lodging is assessed as means in claims for single women's allowance but not assessed in claims for non-contributory old age pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason free board and lodging is assessed as means in claims for single woman's allowance is that means assessment for that allowance is similar to that applied to unemployment assistance which requires the assessment of free board and lodging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> The scheme of social assistance allowances for single women was introduced to cover a need which was not being covered adequately by the unemployment assistance scheme and it was considered appropriate to apply the same criteria for means assessment to it as applied to unemployment assistance. The same considerations do not apply in the case of non-contributory old age pension the means test for which is designed to meet the needs of persons aged 66 or over and differs in several respects from that applicable to unemployed persons.</P>
