      <P>: I wish to bring to the attention of the Ceann Comhairle a matter in respect of the functions of this House and the rights of Members in which I believe he has a function.  It is the precedent, as far as I am aware, that when Members put down questions for written reply those written replies are available in the General Office at the end of Question Time.  A disgraceful practice has now been adopted, by the Minister for Education in particular, by refusing to let Deputies have replies to questions until, in yesterday's case, 5.10 p.m.  It seems to be quite obvious that he is attempting to delay or suppress the publication of politically damaging information by sitting on replies to written question in this manner.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann affirms its lack of confidence in the economic policies of the Government, and particularly its concern at the rise in prices, unemployment, and public borrowing, the collapse of agricultural incomes and of tourism, the failure to provide adequate funds for local services such as housing, health and roads, and the chaotic state of industrial relations.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: When we adjourned last evening I had been analysing that part of the Taoiseach's speech which referred in particular to what he alleged were the positive indicators in the Irish economy. I should now like to turn very briefly to the contribution made by the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, in his defence of the Government of which he was a member and which he now supports.  I have never heard a more qualified defence of anything.  When one analyses what Deputy O'Donoghue had to say one realises that he reserved all his eloquence for the Fianna Fáil manifesto and for the two years or so following the publication of that manifesto.  In relation to the direction which economic policy has taken since he left the Cabinet his silence was the more eloquent part of his speech.  I should like to take him up on the couple of points he made in defence of what has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was Deputy O'Donoghue's belief that Fianna Fáil economic policy would trigger off a wave of investment&mdash;an unhappy mixture of metaphors if ever I heard one.  It is now a matter of record that whatever investment it may have triggered off, Fianna Fáil's economic policy also triggered off a wave of purchasing, not least the purchasing of expensive consumer durables.  When he was a Minister Deputy O'Donoghue greeted a group of Japanese businessmen in the Shelbourne Hotel and remarked laughingly to them that given the rapidly escalating <Col N="462" /> increase in imports of Japanese-manufactured motor cars Fianna Fáil had contributed very positively to the Japanese balance of payments situation.  That was a merry jest at the time and the Minister was at some pains to conceal his jocosity when he faced questions in the House on the matter.  If it was ever a merry jest, it is a very sick joke now.</P>
    <P>I am also intrigued by Deputy O'Donoghue's suggestion that the major part of the blame for the economic crsis can be laid at the door of external factors in general and at the rise in oil prices in particular.  The case could be made for the argument that previous Governments could not be faulted, whatever else they might be faulted for, for not anticipating the oil price rises of 1973-74.  Every government in the western world had been lulled into a sense of false security by the stability which had existed in the oil price sector over previous decades.  Deputy O'Donoghue is attempting to have it both ways with a vengence in saying that our present economic crisis can be traced in large part to oil price rises and in absolving his party and his Government from any responsibility for having failed to foresee the fact that the 1973-74 situation could and almost certainly would return. When Deputy O'Donoghue and his colleagues came into office in 1977 they had seen the effects of the previous oil crisis and if they neglected to assume in what passes for economic planning on that side of the House that the same thing could and probably would happen again they stand proven guilty of most extraordinary negligence, if not irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>The other scapegoat which Deputy O'Donoghue chose to identify was basically the trade union movement and he suggested that a commitment which had been required from the Irish people by the Fianna Fáil Government had not been totally honoured in the area of restraint.  It is amusing that in his speech he simultaneously invokes restraint and condemns the previous Government for having practised it.  He seems to suggest that the trade union movement in general, working people, should bear a large part of the blame for what has happened because they have failed to exercise sufficient <Col N="463" /> restraint.</P>
    <P>These are very delicate times.  The national understanding is due for discussion and will be voted on by the trade union movement tomorrow.  I would not want to say anything which could be interpreted as political interference in that legitimate exercise tomorrow by the trade union movement.  However, the degree of restraint which is being exercised by the trade union movement, in recommending to its members an agreement containing a commitment by the Government on employment targets is, given the unbelievable shortfall in job targets in the last national understanding, little short of extremely generous.</P>
    <P>When we talk about restraint we will also have to accept that the famous hair shirt of the former President and former Taoiseach, the late Mr. de Valera, sits very uncomfortably indeed on some of the well upholstered shoulders on the far side of the House.  When it is stripped of its politics and its rhetoric Deputy O'Donoghue was, basically, trying to say yesterday that it is the same kind of crisis as 1973-74 but we have a different Government and they are better able to handle it.  The differences between 1973-74 and today are very marked and the situation is now far more serious than it was then.  In the first place, the industrial recession coincides with an acute crisis in agriculture, which was certainly not present in the mid-seventies.  It would be amusing to hear some of the farmers' reactions to what Deputy Leyden said last night when he was contrasting the price of cattle now with the price of cattle in 1974.  The farmers are not living in 1974, they are living in 1980 and they are not interested in comparisons, they are interested in prices.</P>
    <P>The second major point is that the industrial recession coincides this year with the decline in the number of foreign tourists into the country with the consequent serious loss of foreign earnings. Tourism is one of our most important export markets in a sense.  The combination of a bad year in agriculture, a bad year in tourism and a bad year in industry adds up to a situation which is totally <Col N="464" /> different in a very real sense from that which obtained in 1973, 1974 and 1975 in particular.</P>
    <P>This recession is occurring at a time when our foreign borrowing requirements are not only large but expected to grow.  The degree to which the economic crisis may be expected to get worse rather than better can, I believe, be made more clear if the Minister for Energy or the Minister for Finance when they speak in this debate give us a number of key factors. Would the Minister for Finance give the estimated sums for servicing the Government borrowing for 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984?  Will he give us an estimate of the cost of providing the current level of Government services, including the pay and non-pay commitments of the draft understanding in 1981?  Will he give us estimates for tax and non-tax revenue in 1981 based on the existing tax structures but allowing for income tax and income changes contained in the national understanding? If we are given those figures during this debate rather than the woolly optimism of the Taoiseach we may be in a better situation to discover exactly the irresponsibility into which the economic policy of Fianna Fáil has led us.</P>
    <P>One of the key areas involved in economic management is that of unemployment. It has long been the contention of this party that unemployment is not just cyclical but structural in its nature in the society we live in at the moment.  There are a number of developments which make this even more inescapable now. One of them is the quantum leap in technology which is taking place with the introduction of the microchip.  We are already losing jobs because of the microchip but we have to face the fact that we will be losing jobs whether or not the microchip is there.  The microchip, in a particularly pointed way, draws our attention to the massive problems which will face any Government in this country in the future in providing adequate employment for all our people.  Will we accept some of the current rhetoric which implies that there simply will not be jobs for, first of all, a minority and then, perhaps, even a majority of people, that we will have to train people in leisure at <Col N="465" /> extraordinary costs, some modern equivalent of bread and service while the few jobs that are there are rationed out in some streamline version of the patronage system?  Will we insist that the wealth which is there, which is being created and which will be created in even greater quantities by the sophistication of technology and the industrial process, should be shared out more evenly in service jobs, better social facilities and in shorter working hours for the vast majority of the working population?</P>
    <P>There is a real political crunch involved here in this analysis of employment and unemployment.  You cannot divide what you have not got and wealth has to be created before it can be distributed.  One would think, when we hear some people talk about this, that there was no wealth in the country at the moment.  When one hears Government speakers talk about productivity one would think that working people were the only people expected to become more productive.  Are the owners of capital not also expected to be more productive?</P>
    <P>I do not know how one measures productivity on the capital side but a crude way of measuring it would seem to me to be that when one looks at what is happening in investment one sees what is virtually an investment strike by the owners of capital at the moment.  The political situation is that the owners of capital have gone on strike and they expect the workers to make up for their strike by their increased productivity.  There is a major capital problem even on the public side. The Government's public capital programmes have been doctored in some areas almost to the point of extinction and in other areas are tied in to commitments of quite possibly a disadvantageous kind.</P>
    <P>When I talk about the public capital programmes being doctored to a dangerous extent I want to give one particular example which will be of considerable relevance.  In the nine months to 30 September 1979 the Department of Education approved 53 tenders for new schools; in the first nine months of this year it <Col N="466" /> approved 17 tenders for new schools.  In the nine months to 30 September 1979 the Department of Education approved tenders for 56 extensions to primary schools; in the first nine months of this year it approved tenders for extensions to 20 primary schools.  If there was ever a more graphic or dramatic indication of what is happening to the public capital programme of public investment than that I would like to be shown it.</P>
    <P>Even in areas in which public investment is taking place we need to look at the small print.  Look at the postal and telegraph services, for example.  The Minister, Deputy Reynolds, and the Government are claiming and giving details of a certain amount of public investment in the telecommunications area this year.  I sometimes think, in passing, that there are only two things which keep the postal service going at the moment.  One is that half of the population of Ireland are writing individually to the Taoiseach asking him to solve their personal problems and the other half are being written to by Deputy Mark Killilea, with kindest personal regards, telling them why they cannot have any telephones. But in relation to this telecommunications equipment, which forms such a fundamental part of our infrastructure, we need to ask questions.  We need to ask why is it that we are buying equipment from a particular country and of a particular kind.  Is it the case, as I suspect it to be, that the reason we are buying equipment from a particular country of a particular kind is that that country is the country which is making the loan finance available to us to buy the equipment?  In other words, we are in the position of the miner of 100 years ago who had nowhere to shop except the company store and had to pay company prices with the wages the company paid him.  We cannot escape these facts.  Nor can we escape the fact that services have to be paid for and that Irish people will be slow to be satisfied with an even lower level of services than they have at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was amused to see a recent issue of <i>Business and Finance</i> which had a picture of the Taoiseach on the cover with the <Col N="467" /> legend &ldquo;Hey Big Spender&rdquo; and the quotation underneath it from the budget speech of 1980:</P>
    <P>We cannot ask the taxpayer of tomorrow to pay for the services we require today.  This would be socially unfair and economically irresponsible.</P>
    <P>It is our contention that it is not only the taxpayers of tomorrow who are being asked to pay for the services we require today but some of the people who exist in Irish society today and in particular the children who are going to be in our schools who have no votes and whose schools will be either unrenovated, unheated or inadequately cleaned or maintained because of this Government's present policies.  So it is the children of today who have no income, who have no votes, who are going to be asked to pay in part for any decision to maintain even the present unsatisfactory level of services.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of my contribution that the irony of the present debate was that it was from these benches that the taxation was being proposed and it was on the Government benches that the illusion was being maintained that there was plenty of money for everything and that the future of the economy was in sound hands.  We do not believe that we can have good services without taxation or without fair distribution not just of the current income but of the capital wealth of society.  That is why we insist on the need for a wealth tax and insist also on the need for a capital gains tax which is at least restored to its former level, a level which has been cut to the extent of at least 70 per cent by the Fianna Fáil amendments to it.  Even the most passionate people who marched on those income tax marches in Dublin not too long ago were aware that services cannot be paid for out of thin air.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions in their sponsorship of that protest made consistently and courageously, in the atmosphere of some hysteria that may have obtained in some quarters at that time, the case that what they were looking for was not a decrease in the burden of taxation overall, <Col N="468" /> because that would have meant inevitably a decrease in services, but the redistribution of the incidence of taxation.</P>
    <P>The question of how we raise money to pay for services, whether by borrowing or otherwise, is of course a very acute political one and in the Taoiseach's speech there was a warning that we should not in our fiscal or economic policy put some kind of national concensus at risk.  He said deflationary policies&mdash;and now I quote&mdash;</P>
    <P>would only intensify our economic problems and open up divisions in a society which because of its small size and limited resources should be united in pursuing the overall objective of the prosperity of all.</P>
    <P>I am no more in favour of deflationary policies than the Taoiseach is, but the difference is that he is actually pursuing deflationary policies while pretending not to.  In addition in that sentence he is begging what must be a record number of questions.  He says it will open up divisions in our society.  Does he seriously think there are not divisions in society at the moment?  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday an article headed &ldquo;What recession?&rdquo; describes an assistant in a Dublin tobacconist's saying that he was quite accustomed to taking orders for £2,000 worth of cigars from a single customer at a time.  An earlier section of the article states that the hi-fi and television department in a certain store had doubled their turnover in the past year.  A great number of the people the assistant in that department deals with would have at least three colour televisions, one each for the bedroom, kitchen and television room.  He said that bedroom hi-fi's are selling extremely well at £375 per unit.  High fidelity in the bedroom seems to be Ireland's answer to the Irish recession, and a unique one at that.  On the other side of the coin we have&mdash;and I have to be graphic because the figures demand graphic exposition&mdash;100,000 children living in families whose sole form of income is social assistance.  We have the development in and around our cities of <Col N="469" /> alleged new towns which are breeding grounds for social dynamite, and not only social dynamite but political dynamite as well, in the future.  We have in the face of all this the Government's repeated contention that everything is basically all right, that the economy is basically in sound hands.  Seán Lemass used to say that a rising tide lifts all boats, but what happens when the tide goes out?  Under the Fianna Fáil laws of physics it is the smaller boats which go aground first, not the largest ones; the largest ones stay afloat with their splendidly uniformed crew&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: And the hi-fi audible from the state room.  The people in the small boats are stranded on the bottom. These are the people who are trying to get a house, if they have not got one, from the local authorities.  They are the people whose food bills are affected by the cut in the subsidies on basic food products.  They are the people whose schools will not be able to match, from the private resources at their disposal, the gap left by the cutback in public expenditure.  The Taoiseach thinks that there is a consensus in Ireland which must not be fractured.  There is a consensus in Ireland indeed.  We are increasingly terrified not just of what the Taoiseach has done but of what he might do between now and the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been enough harking back to the verdict of the electorate in 1977. The electorate have already given two subsequent verdicts on this Government, one in the European elections and the second one in the local elections.  There are quite obviously two groups of people who, more than anything else, will influence the result of the next general election. The first group are the group of people who will be voting for the first time.  I believe that Labour offers them a more radical vision of society.  The kind of policies expounded here by the party <Col N="470" /> leader yesterday afternoon offer them a more concrete and realistic vision of the future of an Ireland in which they can have a full share in anything which the Government have to offer.  The second group of people who will help to determine the result of the next election are those people who voted Fianna Fáil in the last election.  I believe that when these two look around and inspect the various alternatives on offer they will come to the conclusion certainly that Fianna Fáil do not offer them what they pretended to offer the last time and, hopefully, that we will offer them something very much more realistic.</P>

In the next election they will be looking to a party that will promise less but will deliver more.</P>

      <P>: I propose to deal primarily in my contribution to this debate with the activities of the Department of Energy for which I am responsible and some of the plans for the future.  I hope also to have time to deal with some other matters including a few of the references we have just heard from Deputy Horgan in the earlier part of his contribution today and indeed at the very end.  But I must resist that temptation at present and come to it later, perhaps even savour the anticipation of it.</P>

      <P>: The extent to which our whole economy is affected when essential supplies of a major energy source are interrupted has been brought home to us all in recent weeks.  The inconvenience and hardship to which the community was subjected and the damage inflicted on our economy during the dispute gave us a foretaste&mdash;and a small foretaste at that&mdash;of what might be in store for us if there were a major interruption in oil supplies, due for instance to an escalation in the conflict in the Gulf area.</P>
      <P>If, as I have said, we experienced only a small foretaste and escaped the worst consequences of the dispute we can thank the Army.  The performance of those members of Óglaigh na hÉireann who were involved in this essential operation was an example to the whole community. The manner in which the officers, NCO's and men set about what must have been a daunting task and then got on with the job in their characteristically straightforward and business-like way earned the admiration and respect of our people.  It also showed what can be achieved when there is a will to succeed.  This approach need not be reserved exclusively for military operations.  We all have something to learn from the experience.</P>
      <P>In this connection also I want to thank the Garda who co-operated so effectively with the Army throughout the operation. Their assistance was essential to the success of the work of the Army and all the Army personnel I have been speaking to have been most appreciative of the fine job done by the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to express my appreciation of the dedicated and unstinting efforts of the officials of my own Department of Energy.  It is as yet a relatively small Department but the wholehearted manner in which they tackled a massive workload was in keeping with the highest traditions of the public service.  In the nature of things, in the world we live in now, the Department of Energy will have an increasingly important part to play in the economic life of the nation.  The manner in which the Department rose to this recent challenge augurs well for its future, I want also to record my own <Col N="472" /> thanks and that of my Department to the officials of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism for their invaluable assistance during those difficult weeks.</P>
    <P>Any discussion of the situation in the Irish economy must take into account the particularly open nature of the Irish economy and what has been going on in the western economies with whom we trade, and on which we are so dependent.  The primary causal factor in the current economic difficulties is the burden which the energy constraint imposes both in the short and in the medium term on our economies.</P>
    <P>Western economies generally are heavy importers of energy.  This fact makes all the economies in developed countries vulnerable to disturbances in the oil market, and these give rise to very sharp increases in price.  Increases in oil and energy prices will have raised our energy import bill from under £400 million in 1978 to something over £800 million in 1980.  The magnitude of the problem which this increase causes for the Irish economy can be illustrated by saying that in 1980 we are spending on imported energy an average of £120 more per annum for every man, woman and child in the country than we did in 1978.</P>
    <P>This externally caused price increase has had a serious deflationary impact on our economy.  It is, in many respects, just like a very large tax, yielding £400 million, but it does not have a counter-balancing beneficial public expenditure which is associated with the taxes that are levied as part of the national budget. While this Government, or indeed any Irish Government can do nothing to influence the world oil market and the forces that give rise to price increases of this kind, the Government have been very active in recognising the importance of energy in the economy, and in developing strategies for dealing with the energy situation within the economy.</P>
    <P>In changing from an economy based on low energy costs to one of high energy costs production levels and competitiveness can be maintained only by taking positive steps to ensure the more rational <Col N="473" /> use of energy resources.  On average the energy costs in Irish industry as a proportion of operating costs have risen from below 5 per cent in 1973 to over 10 per cent this year.  Yet I am far from convinced that there is sufficient urgency at management level both in the public and private sectors in securing the advantages that rational use of energy can bring.</P>
    <P>Good energy management does not necessarily mean that large capital investment must be made to save money.  Simple good housekeeping in regard to energy use can I submit cut an immediate 5 per cent off almost any energy bill in this country without affecting production or comfort levels.  This trimming down would release as much as £50 million to reinvest and create jobs not to mention the existing jobs which it would protect.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, placed considerable emphasis in my Department on conservation matters.  I have mentioned elsewhere that at least 15 per cent of our energy demand in 1990 could be saved by proper energy management and while I would not wish to be bound by such a figure, I contend that it is quite modest in comparison with the conservation targets of other countries.</P>
    <P>In the domestic sector which accounts for nearly one third of primary energy consumed.  I have recently announced details of a grant scheme under which up to £50 will be paid by my Department in respect of the insulation of attics, the lagging of hot water cylinders and the draught proofing of doors and windows. This ambitious scheme is aimed at having this type of insulation installed in every house in the country by 1990.</P>
    <P>Since setting up the Department of Energy, I have taken a particular interest in the efficiency with which we use our energy, and the possibilities for conservation, because, of course, conservation is not merely using less energy; in fact, in many cases it does not mean that at all, but means the more efficient use of a particular form of energy.  I have instructed my Department to develop sectoral utilisation programmes to encourage the better use of energy in industry, agriculture, services, public <Col N="474" /> buildings, and particularly in the home.</P>
    <P>I intend to pursue these policies vigorously over the coming months.  Unfortunately, a nationwide tour which I had planned to promote these policies had to be postponed due to the recent tanker drivers' dispute.  I hope to re-arrange the tour very soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: Sorry about that.  We missed Deputy Kelly too.  There is a wider aspect to efficient energy utilisation and conservation.  This arises from making sure that the most appropriate fuels are used in every application or usage of fuel: direct combustion of natural gas for heating for example, or use of coal in efficient appliances rather than electricity or diesel.</P>
      <P>The State can influence the individual decision by ensuring that the pricing strategies, the investment strategies, and the promotion strategies of the energy agencies under its aegis are consistent with the national priorities.  My Department will, as their resources expand, be systematically addressing those issues, and in this way will contribute to the recovery from the present difficulties which have been initiated by the external upheaval in the oil market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a Department of Energy specifically charged with developing an energy policy under my direction is symbolic of the importance which the Government attach to what can be done within the constraints imposed on us from outside.  The primary concern of the Government in the energy field is with improvement of our security of supplies. In order to increase security of <Col N="475" /> supplies, my Department have been examining ways of reducing dependence on imported oil, on diversifying sources and suppliers of fuel and, for short-term difficulties, ways of ensuring increased stocks of coal and of oil.</P>
    <P>We are not just thinking about these matters, we are doing something about them.  At present the generating capacity of our electricity grid is about 60 per cent dependent on oil.  In the knowledge that oil is beginning to run out, we would be foolish to keep to many of our energy eggs in that particular basket.  Already, steps have been taken to change the situation.</P>
    <P>At present, we have about 447 MW capacity generated from peat.  Between 1982 and 1984 two further peat-fired stations generating 40 MW each will be commissioned&mdash;one at Shannonbridge, County Offaly and one at Lanesboro', County Longford.  Between 1985 and 1988 900 MW of coal-fired generating capacity will be brought on-stream at Moneypoint, County Clare.</P>
    <P>A particularly exciting project which is being explored by the ESB relates to the burning of Arigna low-grade coal for the generation of electricity by a specialised technique.  I have given the ESB approval to proceed further with this project. Some 45 MW of power could be produced from this low-grade coal, if&mdash;as I expect&mdash;the project finally proves feasible and a power station is built.  The advantages of a project of that kind in such an area in terms of permanent jobs and the use of native resources is, of course, obvious.</P>
    <P>The ESB are also testing the potential of anthracites in the Leinster coalfields for the generation of electricity.  Should the tests prove successful, it opens up new prospects for the use of high sulphur anthracites in the Leinster coalfields which are not suitable for domestic use.</P>
    <P>Chipped timber and forestry waste are now being used with considerable success for the generation of electricity.  This type of fuel is at present being used at Allenwood, County Kildare, Portarlington, County Laois, Lanesboro', County <Col N="476" /> Longford, Cahirciveen, County Kerry, Miltown Malbay, County Clare, Screeb, County Galway and Gweedore, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Until this year, slack left over from domestic coal was re-exported to the UK. Now this has ceased.  All slack available is being used by the ESB and the Irish Sugar Company.  The slack is mixed with chipped timber and peat or is used on its own.</P>
    <P>This country is second only to the Soviet Union in the extent of its peat production.  Bord na Móna's third development programme will produce additional milled peat sufficient to more than double the present output of briquettes. Two new briquette factories are being built.  One is in Littleton, County Tipperary and it is expected to commence production in 1981; the other is at Ballyforan, County Roscommon, and it will start production in two phases, the first phase in 1984 and the second in 1987.</P>
    <P>While large-scale commercial development of bogs by Bord na Móna must continue to be the cornerstone of policy on the optimum utilisation of our turf resources, I am satisfied that measures to increase turf production by private interests are also necessary.  As I said here in the Dáil yesterday in reply to parliamentary questions, I hope to introduce a short Bill during this Dáil session to promote private bog development.  I envisage that Bord na Móna will act as an agency through which financial assistance can be provided for projects which conform to certain criteria.</P>
    <P>Since the Department was set up I have encouraged the development of a programme for alternative energy and my Department have been considering how best these alternatives should be evaluated and the agencies that will be most appropriate for such evaluations.</P>
    <P>Much valuable work was already under way, particularly in the semi-State bodies and several programmes had been initiated by the NBST and An Foras Talúntais. The prime example is the early start made on short rotation forestry in which a renewable supply of biomass will provide us with economic and strategically <Col N="477" /> valuable supplements to imported fuels.</P>
    <P>The second area where decisive action has been taken to accelerate the development of native resources has been in harnessing windpower.  To date an engineering consultantacy firm has been employed to implement a scheme to assist the local grid on Inis Oirr, and there are projects for meeting energy needs on the farm or in remote areas from windpower.</P>
    <P>The ESB will shortly be installing several machines to test the best methods of connecting small machines into the national grid and an overall programme is being prepared to place these projects in an appropriate context to harness successful results from the major engineering development projects abroad.</P>
    <P>My Department has devoted a considerable effort to the development of a policy for natural gas, and to its proper implementation.  We have seen how major investment programmes in the public sector can go wrong, and it is particularly important that the planning for an extension of natural gas from Cork to Dublin and later other towns should be planned in a way that will safeguard the consumer and taxpayer.  The project to extend natural gas is being addressed in three stages:</P>
    <P>(1)  planning of a pipeline, identification of the problem areas and a detailed costing by the best commercial practice,</P>
    <P>(2)  preparation of a reform programme in the Dublin Gas Company, and evidence of movement away from the unacceptable practices and inefficiencies in the Dublin Gas Company, and</P>
    <P>(3)  preparation of the financing package that will enable the project to go ahead.</P>
    <P>It would appear on the basis of what I have seen of the work to date, that some extension of the gas distribution system would be justified, and would indeed be <Col N="478" /> attractive provided two conditions are met (a) that the pipeline is designed and constructed by the most modern and cost-effective method, and (b) that the vehicle company for distribution of gas in Dublin is also efficient and cost-effective.</P>
    <P>The report which reviewed the town gas industry, and indeed the consultants' report commissioned by the Dublin Gas Company itself indicated very clearly that, on the basis of the current practices prevailing in the Dublin Gas Company, the distribution of gas by it would not be a reasonable proposition, and would bring no relief to consumer or taxpayer. I have arranged a detailed review procedure of what is going on in the Dublin Gas Company on a monthly basis, and I will expect significant progress over the winter months.</P>
    <P>As I announced last summer I hope some time next year to be in a position to put forward the definitive proposals on natural gas development, taking into account the detailed planning that has been done in the meantime, and the reactions in the Dublin Gas Company to the development programme proposed by their own consultants.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned earlier the efforts being made to reduce our national dependence on oil.  This is, of necessity, a gradual process and even if fully successful will still leave us significantly dependent on oil.  We are therefore examining urgently the means by which we can increase the security of our supplies of this vital fuel.  The setting up of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation is an important contribution to this objective.</P>
    <P>The Government have set up the Irish National Petroleum Corporation so that the country can take advantage of any changes in the structure of international oil markets that favour government-to-government contracts.  The INPC is engaged in securing some proportion of our oil supplies on the basis of government-to-government contracts and has been conducting discussions in a number of oil-producing countries.</P>
    <P>The securing of a substantial increase in the quantity of oil stored within the <Col N="479" /> country is another major objective of mine.  There is a need for the oil industry itself to make a contribution in this regard.  In addition, while some big industrial users have very substantial storage and stocks of oil, it has been painfully demonstrated in recent weeks that many others have not.  I recognise that the cost of increasing storage and filling this storage with product can be burdensome for some industries but let me point out that the cost of not doing so may prove to be very penal indeed for industry, workers and the economy.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy which has in the past been so dependent on imported oil is particularly vulnerable to the kind of disturbances in the oil market that we have witnessed in 1973-74 and in 1979. Coherent planning and decisive action, such as was taken recently in the petrol tankers dispute, can significantly reduce the damage caused to the economy by disturbances in energy markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: I know the Deputy did not say that, he was very careful not to, but he is implying it.  He is welcome to his opinion but the fact is that that kind of approach I have tried to demonstrate is being applied to the field of energy generally and it is very important, as I indicated, not just for the sake of industry and workers employed in industry but for the sake of our economy generally, that this should be done.  I did promise early on that I would, if I had time, revert to certain other matters which had been touched on by Deputy Horgan and indeed by others.  I heard Deputy Garrett FitzGerald yesterday dealing with some matters on which I want to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government elected in 1977 set the standard by which future Irish Governments, of whatever party, would be judged.  The success of our efforts to create jobs was such that many people took <Col N="480" /> it for granted that almost everyone who wanted a job could get one.  In reality, however, nothing like this had ever been seen before in our history.  Strenuous efforts have been made since then, and indeed repeated in this debate, by Deputy Garrett FitzGerald yesterday and by Deputy Horgan today to propagate two myths about the job creation programme initiated following the general election of 1977.  The first myth is that most of the jobs created were in the public sector, with the implication that they were useless, non-productive jobs.  The truth is, and the record shows this, that the bulk of those jobs were created in the private sector and that, of those created in the public sector, many were in such fields as telecommunications, which are vital for the development of both public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>The second myth is that Fianna Fáil made irresponsible promises to get back to office in 1977 and that this is the cause of the difficulties we face today.  Those who make this charge conveniently ignore facts such as the reference on page 6 of our manifesto&mdash;&ldquo;pay rises of about 5 per cent&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste The Tánaiste">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;which was teased out in great detail during that election campaign.  If the Deputy is unable to remember that, perhaps I could jog his memory by reminding him that this particular item was latched on to very quickly, not only by political commentators but, and fairly, by our political opponents who thought they were on to a good thing.  Here was an Opposition party talking about pay rises of 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste The Tánaiste">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am afraid the Deputy's memory is very truncated.  Does the Deputy remember now what the rate of inflation was at that time?  It was in the region of 15 per cent.  It had come down.  In that context, to talk about increases of 5 per <Col N="481" /> cent was something, I suggest, no other political party in this country would attempt to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is there any other political party who would attempt it?  Try to reconcile that with this image which is now being put across of irresponsible promises designed to lure the people to vote for them, not caring where the money came from.  That is the picture which is tried to be put across, but the facts are different.  I know people do not like to be confused with the facts and to be reminded of the facts, but they are different.  It is important for the sake of future politics here that the facts should not be completely swept under the carpet.</P>
      <P>The people who try to propagate this myth are obliged in order to do so to pretend that our economy was unaffected by the massive increase in oil prices and the worldwide wave of inflation which it caused.  Of course that is demonstrably untrue.  They would have people believe that these things had no impact on the level of our spending and our borrowing. They try to pretend that what Fianna Fáil proposed in their election manifesto was inherently something which would produce the figures of borrowing and spending which were produced by what happened to the price of our energy.  I dealt with this earlier to illustrate the kind of impact it made on our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that, in order to put across the image I have mentioned, it is necessary for those who are doing so to engage in a number of pieces of deception, whether self-deception or otherwise I am not quite sure.  It may be different in different cases.  Quite apart from this abandonment of reality in which the critics have to engage, there is one fundamental question such people must answer.  Do they say we should not have <Col N="482" /> created the jobs we did?  I should like people to think about that.  I should like to address this question to Deputy FitzGerald who criticised as yesterday on this, and not for the first time, and to Deputy Horgan who did so today and, indeed, to any other Deputy who proposes to participate in this debate.  Before he or she launches forth on this criticism about the irresponsibility of Fianna Fáil and what we are alleged to have done to our finances in 1977 and subsequently, would he or she please consider and then answer the question?  Is he or she saying we should not have created the jobs we did?  Unless people are saying that, they are dishonest in their criticisms.  If they are saying that, I would be quite happy to argue with them the rightness of our commitment to job creation.</P>
    <P>An additional what I suppose one might call sub-paragraph in this myth which is sought to be put across from the benches opposite and, indeed, by some commentators who perhaps should know better is that, if we had applied no stimulus to the economy in 1977 and 1978, the economy was correcting itself.  Deputy O'Donohue dealt with that last night, but it is worth recalling again that the facts are different from the myth which is sought to be propagated.  The facts show that, if we had not given the stimulation we did, there would have been virtually no net increase in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: There has not been.  It has got worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste The Tánaiste">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not think it would be necessary for Deputy Kelly but obviously it is necessary to point out that what I have been talking about is the kind of performance by the Government in what might be called more or less normal economic circumstances.  Of course we are not in normal economic circumstances today.  As I have said, the standards set by the Government elected in 1977 are the ones by which future Governments of whatever party will be judged. Those standards relate primarily to the performance in job creation.  If we are to be told by Deputies opposite&mdash;which is what we are being told although it is not <Col N="483" /> being put this way&mdash;that we should not have created those jobs, people have to come to the conclusion, perhaps not for the first time, that the parties opposite, whatever other qualities they may have, have not got the quality of being able to tackle the essential and major problems facing our people.</P>
      <P>Unless we can provide work here at home for our young people and our growing population of young people, we are a failure as political parties; we are irrelevant to the future of this country; and this institution in which we sit today will become irrelevant.  I do not believe we should allow that situation to develop.  I do not believe the ultra orthodox economic views being propounded by some people, including people on the Labour benches, and which we have been hearing for quite some years, are correct economically. One of the problems about economics is that so many experts have totally different and diametrically opposed views on the correct course.  I do not think economics have any real value other than in so far as they advance the general situation of our people.  I suggest that the approach which was put forward to the people and implemented by the Government elected in 1977 demonstrably improved the situation of our people.</P>
      <P>To argue that the undoubtedly difficult problems which arose in regard to the level of borrowing and public spending, and the size of the deficit in the current budget, arose primarily because of the policies being pursued by the Government, and to ignore the impact of the massive increase in oil prices and the massive inflation worldwide and deflation in economies worldwide, is simply to distort reality.  Perhaps it is tempting to do this for party political purposes, but it is not healthy for the future development of our economy to confuse the issue in that way and to mislead people in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, that any Government faced with the massive increase in world inflation, and in the price of oil on which we are so dependent, have to adjust policies.  This has had to be done, but it is not true that those who are now <Col N="484" /> preaching the doctrine of virtual monetarism can claim that they have the answers to our problems.  Demonstrably they have not.  This is not merely a question of theory.  One can look at what happened to the economy when they were in power.  They do not have the answer.  So far as borrowing is concerned, of course, there is a definite constraint on this.  Of course we cannot view with equanimity the use of so much of our current income simply on servicing debt. That is perfectly true but, on the other hand, the real test&mdash;subject to the overall constraint of whether one can pay back or not&mdash;of whether borrowing is justified is what one does with the money.</P>
    <P>I suggest that what was done with the money borrowed by the Government elected in 1977 was the best use that could be made of it, namely, the creation of jobs.  The kind of criticism to which any Government, including this Government, should be subjected is whether the borrowing in which they engage, or the bulk of it, is being spent on unproductive purposes, as was the major criticism we made when we were in Opposition at the time of the previous oil crisis.  The major criticism we made of the Coalition Government and their borrowing&mdash;and we should remember that their borrowing was totally unprecedented&mdash;was that there was virtually nothing to show for that borrowing.</P>
    <P>I believe that the overall economic situation in which we find ourselves is difficult but it can be tackled successfully. Obviously there are constraints to which we will be subjected while the world economy is in difficulty but the whole stance of the Government has to be one that is governed by an expansionary approach, expansionary in the sense of trying to create more jobs and protect existing jobs as far as possible.  Recognising the limitations that apply at the moment, one has to be geared up to take advantage of any possibilities that will arise in the future.</P>
    <P>I am not by any means advocating a disregard of the constraints which apply themselves automatically to excessive borrowing and excessive spending but I <Col N="485" /> am advocating that we should not allow ourselves to be governed in our approach to the economy by the tenets of monetarism&mdash;even if they could be shown to be correct and to work and certainly that has not been shown nor do I believe can be shown&mdash;because the primary purpose of economic policy should be the advancement of our people.  Even if monetarism were successful, in our circumstances of a growing population and high unemployment it would not do that.</P>
    <P>For that reason we should bear in mind that it was demonstrated after the 1977 election what could be done.  Whatever the economic difficulties around us, we know now that an Irish Government can achieve what was achieved at that time. Therefore, all our efforts should be geared to re-establishing that situation as fast as economic circumstances at home and abroad will allow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I think the Minister will agree, and his longer experience will confirm, that as a rule politicians allow their card to be marked by economists.  They tend to find a clipping in the newspaper favourable to a prejudice of their own and they rush in here and brandish it.  A curious situation has developed in regard to the matter under dispute, namely, that far from having our cards marked by the economists and independent commentators one could be very tempted to the self-flattering conclusion that exactly the opposite has happened in the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed during that period that although our message from this side of the House has been a very simple one and has always been the same one, it is only in recent times that it has been taken up in almost the same words by outside, independent commentators.  I do not flatter myself that any of the commentators in the press, in the ESRI or in the banks regard me as a monument of skill and judgment in this field but at the same time, I find it uncanny that headlines are appearing regularly over their reports that almost look as though they were lifted out of speeches made by me, by Deputy Barry or by Deputy FitzGerald <Col N="486" /> any time in the past three years.</P>
    <P>Every politician has an eye to his own coverage.  As a rule I find that a scripted speech on the economy containing many percentage figures and decimal points if it is printed at all&mdash;unless it is a very poor day&mdash;will be printed in a heavily abridged form and will be pushed on to page 17 alongside advertisements for agricultural machinery and tents for hire.  If you want real coverage you must say something about a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; subject, such as the North or something that consists of personal abuse.  That guarantees immediate, automatic coverage but subjects dealing with bread and butter issues, the nuts and bolts of the economy, do not get that coverage.  They are not &ldquo;hot&rdquo; subjects or they are not perceived as such by the press and by the people.  Therefore, a person could put out scripts&mdash;I do not just mean election-time scripts that are transparent&mdash;that genuinely correspond to a speech made on the economy until he was blue in the face and he might never see such speeches getting through to the people.</P>
    <P>A simple example of that was in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday's date where a gigantic headline surmounted an article by their economics correspondent on the level of the national debt and on the level of debt servicing which that required.  He computed that as running away with 25p in every £ of revenue collected.  My own calculation was nearer to 27p but whether it is 25p or 27p we on this side of the House, and myself in particular, have repeatedly called attention to this feature. I have repeatedly called attention to this in speeches made here and outside but I had to wait for an outside commentator to feel suddenly in his gut the conviction that it was of some importance before it surfaced in that form.</P>
    <P>I am not making any complaint about that.  I hope nobody thinks I am whingeing about coverage or about the way the press do their job.  Far from it.  In a general way I have no complaints at all on that score but I say it is uncanny that suddenly in the second half of 1980 economic commentators are surfacing like bubbles in a pond and the message delivered is the same as that we have been <Col N="487" /> enunciating here and outside since 1977.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Tánaiste had to leave because I want to take up and meet head on a point that he made here a few minutes ago.  Essentially, our message is that the economy was visibly on the mend from the end of 1975 onwards.  In that black year I had a fair amount of free time because while the post of Government Whip is hectic at times Mondays and Fridays are fairly clear and I used to spend those days closely scanning economic indicators.  It was quite evident to me, and to everybody else on our side, that from about the end of 1975 these indicators were showing an upward turn. From about that time onwards the number of new car registrations was rising and the unemployment figures, although still appalling, were coming down, inflation was moderating, the balance of trade was improving and the level of State indebtedness was being sharply reduced by Deputy Ryan who put up with and manfully absorbed more unjustified abuse than I ever remember a Minister for Finance accepting.  It may be that former Deputy McEntee took abuse of that kind because I remember he was a favourite punchball for critics when I was a student; but since that time nobody has come in for so much unjustified abuse.</P>
    <P>Those indicators, for which thanks have to be given to the Government of which Deputy Ryan was Minister for Finance, were showing positive signs from about the end of 1975.  In 1976 those signs became very strongly positive.  We realised the people were having a hard time; we were having a hard time ourselves. There was not one of us who was not worse off financially by having a job in Government as Minister or Minister of State than if we had had a job in the outside world.  We were not codding ourselves that the people were bleating without reason.  We never flattered ourselves that that was so.</P>
    <P>The solid indicators showing that the recession had bottomed out&mdash;to use a favourite expression of Senator Keating&mdash;and that the economy was coming right were visible a full 20 months before <Col N="488" /> the general election.  That was why the Government reduced the level of public borrowing, which was unsustainable&mdash;we did not dream, even in a nightmare, that it would reach the level we now see&mdash; and why the burst of public expenditure&mdash;and I include in public expenditure the remissions of taxation which excite private expenditure and have a certain encouraging and promotional effect on economic mechanisms&mdash;at the latter end of 1977 and 1978 set in motion by the Fianna Fáil Government in response to their election promises, was unnecessary and damaging.  We were told in 1977 and 1978 that what we were saying was sour grapes, that the people were doing well, were high on the hog, delighted with themselves and we were bleating about a lost election.</P>
    <P>Two years on what do we find?  That same message, almost in our own words, is coming through from the Economic and Social Research Institute, from the newspaper economic commentators and from the people who write the bank reports.  <i>The Irish Times</i>, Business and Finance page on 29 and 30 September last published two much-quoted articles written by Dr. Brendan Walsh and Dr. Colm McCarthy of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I will briefly quote from the first article:</P>
    <P>An air of unreality pervades some recent pronouncements on the state of the Irish economy.  The conclusion of a UK agreement, the moderation of the trade deficit and the recovery in the level of gross foreign exchange reserves may have given the impression that the underlying economic situation has improved since the budget. This in turn may have raised hopes that a reflationary fiscal stance is now appropriate.  In fact the condition of the public finances is worse than was predicted in the budget speech, the improvement in the trade deficit is slight and may be temporary, while the increase in reserves is less than the increase in official foreign debt.</P>
    <P>... But the actual situation is much worse than it would have been if the manifesto targets had been adhered to ....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> This borrowing spree has been financed externally to an extent that has serious implications for Ireland's external debt and for its creditworthiness.</P>
    <P>That spree became necessary because of the election promises made by Fianna Fáil and which they naturally had to meet on being elected.  It would not have been necessary if the public finances had not been run down by the remission of various forms of taxation purely to buy votes.  I am sorry if there is an element of political prejudice here; but I see the most direct possible connection between the billions of yen and the millions of marks we had to borrow and the hand-outs the 1977 election called for.  This must be the twentieth time I have said this; but it is only now beginning to surface among independent commentators. I will now quote further from Dr. Walsh and Dr. McCarthy:</P>
    <P>The build-up of foreign debt also raises doubt about the punt's apparently strong showing within the EMS. When the current account of the balance of payments is deeply in deficit, a strong exchange rate performance financed by foreign borrowing is artificial and does not reflect underlying market forces.  Such apparent strength cannot be maintained indefinitely.</P>
    <P>That was a very prescient observation.  If they had published their article four weeks later they would have been able to add the performance of the Irish pound over the last week to their data.  The article continued:</P>
    <P>The main reason for our concern about Irish public finances is our fear that the current political atmosphere may preclude the kind of action that is needed to stave off a precipitate financial crunch.</P>
    <P>That is not a member of Fine Gael or the Labour Party speaking.  I do not know the politics of these gentlemen, and I do not care what their politics are, but no one has ever alleged they are not absolutely competent, capable and, above all, <Col N="490" /> independent commentators.  The <i>Irish Banking Review</i> quarterly, September 1980 said, and I do not know who wrote this article:</P>
    <P>The pursuance of a policy of incurring current budgetary deficits in each of the past seven years, even in years when the economy was experiencing relatively favourable growth&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was in 1977 and 1978</P>
    <P>&mdash;has greatly limited the capacity to react to current high unemployment by stimulatory spending programmes in the public sector.  Such policies are meant to operate in a contra-cyclical fashion by providing a stimulus to demand when the economy is weak and, similarly, playing a smaller role when demand in the private sector is strong.</P>
    <P>In the Republic, in the past oil-troubled seven years, public fiscal policy has not been conducted with the necessary refinement and discretion in reaction to changes in the general economic climate.  The accummulated deficits and borrowings have been allowed to rise to a point where moderation of the trends of recent years is urgently required.</P>
    <P>To point out how dramatic and quick this change has been let me revert to the figure I mentioned, which occupied the headline in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i>, of 25p in the revenue pound being needed to pay the interest on our debt.  I think the figure is 27p, but whichever is right, the figure in the last year for which the National Coalition were responsible was 21p.  If I am right, in three years that proportion has jumped by 30 per cent and an extra 6p in the revenue pound is being posted out of the country in the form of interest on State borrowing.  That means 6p less in the pound for productive investment and job creation the Tánaiste was talking about.</P>
    <P>On 11 October 1980 <i>The Irish Times</i> published a speech by Senator Whitaker made at Westport, County Mayo, the previous evening.  Since Senator Whitaker is, by common consent, the father of Irish economic planning and was the architect of the change of industrial policy <Col N="491" /> and the national psychology, almost, at the end of the fifties and the early sixties, I think his views are entitled to be listened to with respect.  I admire Senator Whitaker very much.  The fact that he was appointed a Senator by Deputy Lynch I take to have been then a genuine tribute by Deputy Lynch to a man whose political allegiance he was never planning to buy.</P>
    <P>I am not making any particular point about his being a Taoiseach's nominee.  The Senator is an absolutely independentminded man and I am very glad that he is in public life.  As reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 October, Senator Whitaker, speaking about the national understanding, said that &ldquo;it will not make us more competitive unless there is a quite abnormal increase in productivity&rdquo; and that &ldquo;this tends to occur only when there is a strong upsurge in demand&rdquo;.  The Senator went on to say that &ldquo;we have not left ourselves any room for attempting to spend our way out of the recession&rdquo;.  That is what I have been saying during the past three years.  It would be insulting to the Senator for me even to hint that he was taking his tone from speeches made from these benches or from the Labour Party benches; but it is like a dream to me that I wrote that myself.  The Senator went on to say that:</P>
    <P>Unbridled inflation would merely store up worse trouble for the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>In other words, he is saying what has been said in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> about there being no scope for the operation of the counter cyclical reflation which would have been possible if the Government had resources and not flung money away for votes.  The report in <i>The Irish Times</i> continued:</P>
    <P>In Senator Whitaker's view, the Irish economy is suffering the full effects of the current international recession because &ldquo;resources were over-used here during the last few years when we ran the boat's engine at full throttle even though the current was with us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Even in the good years prior to the <Col N="492" /> current recession, we were devouring the seed-corn by drawing down our external reserves and borrowing abroad to boost an already-high level of private consumption.</P>
    <P>The good years were those prior to the recession, the years 1977-1978.  The Coalition must take the credit for those good years just as they would have to take the blame had they been bad years. The report continues:</P>
    <P>Now that the economic tide has turned against us &ldquo;we are in the uncomfortable position, having used up our spare fuel, of being forced back by the current&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I had not thought of that elegant figure of speech, but it expresses exactly what has been said from these benches since 1977.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the House a concrete expression of what I am saying about the relationship between election promises.  Government borrowing and the situation in which we find ourselves now, that is, that when the reflation is needed badly the Government have their back to the wall.  With the Irish economy in a weak position, we are in the worst possible position to apply the type of measure which Deputy Ryan, as Minister for Finance, applied in 1976.</P>
    <P>Let us consider merely one item in the Fianna Fáil election promises.  I refer to the remission of motor taxation on vehicles below 16 horse power.  In September 1977 there were some 545,000 private motor cars in that category.  In 1979 that figure had risen to 640,000.  While I do not have the figure for 1978 I am splitting the difference and assuming that the figure then was half way up that climb.  I am assuming also that the difference between the then £5 registration fee and what would have been collected in motor taxation would have been £50, give or take a few pounds either way, depending on car size.  I have calculated on this basis that in the year 1977-78 the Government threw away £27.25 million in terms of uncollected motor tax.  That is the amount that would have been collected had the tax not been abolished&mdash;and it <Col N="493" /> was abolished in the absence of any demand for such a move.  There were complaints from time to time that the rate of taxation should have been related to engine capacity, for instance, rather then to horse power; but the principle of motor taxation had never been assailed and it would never have occurred to anyone to assail it until the buzzing brainpans of Senator Ryan and Deputy Donoghue and those who helped them decided suddenly that such a move would bring in a good deal of votes.  Undoubtedly that action brought in a lot of votes, but at a cost of £27.25 million.  This figure for 1978, calculated on the same basis, would have been £29.5 million while in the year 1979-80 it would have been £32.037 million.  That makes a grand total of about £88 million thrown away in three years on that one item of taxation.</P>
    <P>In addition, there was the over-hasty abolition of rates on private dwellings. We had been planning to phase out these rates.  Indeed, we had already phased them out by one-quarter and the remaining three-quarters were due to be phased out in the following two-and-a-half years. I have not calculated what was lost as a result of the immediate abolition of these rates.  Neither have I counted what was lost by way of wealth tax or capital gains tax, of which virtually 80 per cent disappeared. Neither have I counted what was lost by way of income tax remissions.  I have concentrated solely on the loss in terms of motor taxation.  That was £88 million in three years, but since we are now three-and-a-half years on the up-to-date figure should be about £105 million. One can reasonably increase the figure on the assumption that the rates of motor taxation would have been increased as they were increased regularly in the normal way and also on the observation that money in 1977 was worth more than it was in 1978, that in 1978 it was worth more than it was worth in 1979, and that in 1979 it was worth more then it is worth now.  The pound which Deputy Haughey inherited here on 6 December is worth now, in terms of our major trading partner, 82p and about the same in terms of our cost-of-living index.  The Taoiseach <Col N="494" /> has managed to knock 18p off our pound whether we are talking in terms of dealing in Irish goods and services or of the products which we must import from our major trading partner.  That figure could be increased to allow for both these factors; so that approximately £150 million has disappeared from the public purse in the past three-and-a-half years in consequence of that single election promise on motor taxation.  That is a lot of money, money which would not be despised even in an industrial development budget.  It is money which would have paid for many of the services which are now being curtailed and which would have rendered unnecessary the abolition of, for instance, house improvement grants.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I am boring the House with this message, but it is a message that must be put across to the people.  As was said here yesterday, the Government that will be formed after the next election will find themselves with many ugly and hard choices to make.  I suspect that as soon as the Donegal by-election is over we shall witness some sign of these harsh decisions. However, without being forced to opt for an even more inflationary counter-cyclical treatment, which could be financed only by increased foreign borrowing or by the reimposition of tax rates at a level and with a suddeness which would probably be very damaging to the economy, administering a shock that it could not take, without giving my view as to what the correct course on that might be I wish to say to the House that the main failure of this Government has been their failure to appreciate the fact that intensive care treatment of the economy by way of heavy foreign borrowing, or by way of whatever year to year mechanism one may choose, fails to solve the underlying problems facing the economy. In terms of their main failure what I have been talking about for the past 15 minutes is relatively minor.  The year to year mechanism chosen to deal with the situation fails to insulate the economy against its vulnerability to outside forces.  It is not possible permanently and fully to insulate any economy but we have been able to identify our weaknesses.  Politicians on <Col N="495" /> all sides are tired of repeating time and again what these weaknesses are, but there has not been anything basically done to deal with any of these problems. There had not been applied any psychological discipline.  It might not be any harm to condition the people to fairly substantial changes in the way we operate here.  It might not be any harm to apply some discipline and to take a few decisions of a kind that would make sense to the people though they might feel the brunt of them painfully.</P>
    <P>In Volume 310 of the Official Report for 13 December 1978 the then Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, spoke on the EMS and in his whole contribution, which covers about ten columns, there is not one word of praise or of encouragement for the Government of which he was a member and there is not one word which could have implied a sense of solidarity with the Government.  From that point of view it was a curious contribution. Deputy Haughey said:</P>
    <P>Confining ourselves strictly to that theory, we must admit that our economy is doing very badly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey was referring to the comparison between our economic levels and that of our neighbours.  Deputy Haughey spoke very late in the evening and his comments were not noted by the press.  That finger pointing at Deputy Lynch and Deputy O'Donoghue was not picked up by the press.  Having observed that the economy which had been in the charge of his own party for 18 months was doing very badly Deputy Haughey went on to give his long-term recipe for the economy and it is as follows as reported at column 1510 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>There is one factor which everybody must accept plays a major part in this situation.  One factor more than any other, or at least in direct line with others, contributes to our low level of economic achievement.  That factor is the level, the appropriateness and the suitability of our infrastructure.  I suggest it would be generally accepted that the inadequacy of our infrastructure, <Col N="496" /> our roads, telephones, technical education, transport and all these things which for convenience are put under the generic title of &ldquo;infrastructure,&rdquo; is a major factor in our not being able to reach much higher levels of output. This is the major impediment preventing Irish industry, agriculture and commerce from performing in the way they might otherwise perform.  I do not think they can be expected to function in the inadequate infrastructural environment we have today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey then referred to the amount of money that the Government were putting into roads and telephones and said that it was quite inadequate.</P>
    <P>What have we seen in the way of conditioning the people, of a changed psychology, of a changed atmosphere of Government, of a different approach to Government mechanisms?  What have we seen over the last ten months which could make us feel that the Taoiseach or the Government had any clue about putting into practice the lessons which the Taoiseach as Minister for Health was able to give to the House?  What has been done about roads and telephones?  It is notorious that the roads are worse than they have ever been.  What has been done about technical training?  We are always hearing about it and about the fact that employers cannot find enough computer operators or programmers and that if they want anybody to operate a machine at anything above the level of turning a screw they have to send to England for someone.  One only has to open a paper on a Friday or Saturday to see hundreds of skilled technical jobs going abegging, not upper management jobs but skilled technical jobs, while we have 105,000 people on the unemployment register. What is being done about that?  What is being done about providing a permanent system of inducements in order to achieve a higher output of engineers for example?  What is being done to encourage the universities and third level institutions to remit fees altogether in the engineering faculty?  I would not regard that as discrimination.  Of course, if I were a parent whose children wanted to <Col N="497" /> become lawyers and so on I might envy in a mild way the aspiring engineer who got this third level education for nothing, but that is what national leadership is about.  We need engineers and computer operators and programmers and if we cannot get them by ordinary salary inducements we must get them some other way.</P>
    <P>The speech from which I have just quoted actually mentions technical education. What has been done over the last ten months to solve that structural flaw in our system or to condition people away from white collar desk jobs?  The French do not think it beneath their dignity to do that.  When I was in Paris I saw in every underground station advertisements to the effect that &ldquo;blue is beautiful&rdquo;.  They did not put it as crudely as that, but essentially the message was that there is no need to assume that only white collar jobs are socially respectable.  The only reason we deem it crude to do that is because the English do not do it.  There is no reason why we should not pick a leaf from the French book and follow their example.</P>
    <P>What is being done about language training or the level of language competence here?  The last manager of CTT for the German market, which is our most important European market, said that the level of competence in European languages among Irish exporters is lamentable. Not one in a hundred can speak adequate German or French let alone Dutch or Italian.  What is being done about that and in regard to the leaving certificate syllabus, the training of teachers, in regard to inducements and even compulsions to produce results there?</P>
    <P>I will invite a smile from the House if I mention Chinese, Japanese or Arabic, but it is not a joke.  Those are the languages spoken by gigantic proportions of the world population.  What is being done to get us to a level where some of our people will be able to meet these people on their own terms without relying on their use of English?  It is all right for the Japanese and Chinese to learn English, but apparently it is not all right for us to do the same for them.  Any country like <Col N="498" /> ours that depends increasingly on high grade industrial exports in a world which is full of countries which have enormous potential markets should direct education in such a way so that we will have enough people to fulfil these requirements. We are doing nothing, nor was there any sign of action in the last ten months which was supposed to be the millennium.</P>
    <P>What is being done about industrial relations, another structural problem? The Taoiseach promised legislation on that but he backed off just like he has backed off everything else.  I am not an advocate of any particular legislation but the proposals made by our party in Deputy Mitchell's document some months ago would represent, if put into practice, a very considerable advance on our present situation.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be misunderstood because like every other citizen I very much admired the Army's performance in the recent petrol dispute and I support everything that the Tánaiste said by way of praise for the Army, the Garda and the officials of his Department, but we would be a very foolish people if we expected the Army to pull us out of these industrial problems indefinitely.  We cannot rely on the Army indefinitely.  This did not get much coverage although it is highly relevant to the recent dispute, until the Tánaiste made certain that it was highlighted but it appears that there is certain evidence which would lead the average citizen to assume that a certain subversive intent was at work.  If that is so we can be sure that the same subversive element is already at work trying to undermine the willingness of the Army to do menial jobs of this kind at a time of national emergency.  I have no doubt that the Army, from the Chief of Staff down to the most recent recruit are rightly proud of the job they did in the petrol dispute.  However, as a people we would be crazy if we supposed that we can in the indefinite future rely on the Army to shift petrol, to shift refuse, or to do any other job which our lamentable industrial relations leave undone.</P>
    <P>What is being done on incomes policy? What is being done about creating an <Col N="499" /> atmosphere of equity so that we will get reasonable wage settlements and so that our competitiveness is not going to be destroyed?  We have heard a lot about cost-competitiveness and the importance of not pricing ourselves out of markets. I do not need to underline the relevance of that to the national pay agreement. The Tánaiste when referring to national pay agreements reminded us of the small print in his party's manifesto, in which it was stated that Fianna Fáil promises were conditional on a 5 per cent rate of wage increase.  In retrospect, that was pretty ridiculous because settlements now, when slippage is taken into account, tend to be more like 15 per cent.  I interrupted the Tánaiste to point out that 5 per cent in previous years was pretty well the norm.  I should like to remind him of the wage settlements which the National Coalition presided over in 1976 and 1977. On 16 September 1976 a national wage agreement was ratified for a seven-month period amounting to a 3 per cent increase of basic pay, plus £2 per week, subject to a maximum of £5 per week or £3 per week if greater.  On 23 February 1977 a further agreement was ratified for a duration of 14 months.  Under that agreement the first phase was for 2½ per cent of basic pay, plus £1, subject to a minimum increase of £2 or a maximum of £4.13. Phase 2 of that agreement, from 1 September 1977 to 31 December of that year, was similar.  They are like dreamland figures now.  Nobody thinks in terms of 2½ per cent or 3 per cent, even for a fraction of a year.  There was nothing strange or eccentric about the 5 per cent figure in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, because that was at that time more or less the norm.</P>
    <P>Who has destroyed that?  Who has destroyed the psychological climate in which such a norm was possible?  It was possible for the National Coalition.  I do not stand over every line of the wealth tax, introduced by the National Coalition, perhaps it should have been amended, perhaps the threshold at which it began should have been higher, and, above all, perhaps we might have sold it more skilfully.  However, the principle I still believe in.  Even if it was wrong it <Col N="500" /> created the impression among people who do not have anything, among people where there are three generations of a family living in the same three-bedroomed house, people who cannot get a job, people whose children sit in overcrowded schools and will in 50 years' time be in the same dead-end situation they are now in, that there was a Government who were trying to achieve something like equity.  It created the impression that the Government were trying to be fair to all sides.</P>
    <P>That atmosphere, together with measures we were able to take because we had the money to do so, such as the application of food subsidies and the remission of VAT rates, ensured wage agreements in 1976 and 1977 which Deputy O'Donoghue had the honesty and the manliness to admit were the foundation of the recovery of 1977 and 1978.  Deputy O'Donoghue admitted that in the Bulletin of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and I respect him for that.  We paid a heavy price for laying that foundation, we climbed out of that foundation 12 seats short in this party and a couple in the Labour Party.  The benefit of that settlement was reaped by the people in 1977 and 1978, and has only been dissipated because in order to get Fianna Fáil into power promises were made the fulfilment of which has left them fiscally in a hopeless position from the point of view of meeting this round of recession.</P>
    <P>What has been done about some long-term policy on public sector employment? I never enunciated the myth the Tánaiste was complaining about, that the only job creation was in the public sector. I am aware that it was not.  There was an enhanced effort by the IDA.  Our Government never stinted the IDA and their efforts, even in the depths of recession, were always spectacular.  I freely admit that the performance of the IDA has been excellent over the last couple of years.  I must say that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, has always been active in giving that body every possible support and he cannot be faulted on that score. I admit that the performance of the IDA was superb, but the public sector at the <Col N="501" /> same time has got out of hand in its numbers.  In the two-and-a-half years after we left office the non-industrial civil servants&mdash;I am not talking about people who lay telephone cables&mdash;increased by 5,500 people.  How can that be right?  I am not criticising the public service, naturally. I hope I will not be misunderstood on that score.  The last time I made a speech about this I got an anonymous letter from a person who said he was a public servant telling me I was a disgrace criticising them, that their only &ldquo;perk&rdquo; was the fact that they were permanent. The writer of that letter felt that could not be rated very highly, although many people would rate it highly.  There is no long-term policy about making sure that we have the right number of people in the public service, and about making sure that we are getting value out of the way the civil service is organised and run. That is also part of the infrastructure situation we are up against, because the public service has to be paid for and it is running away with more than half of what the State takes in in revenue.</P>
    <P>What is being done about the encouragement of self-reliance, about the encouragement of the co-operative movement, about the encouragement of voluntary effort?  What is being done in terms of tax relief towards the encouragement and inducement of voluntary effort?</P>
    <P>What is being done in regard to energy policy?  The Tánaiste has been making the right noises since he became Minister for Energy, but when I look behind the noises I do not see a lot.  There are measures which will be uncomfortable and disagreeable to apply which should be considered.  They will have to be applied sooner or later in order to meet this energy ogre which is hanging over us all the time.</P>
    <P>I have enumerated eight infrastructural problems not one of which has been approached or confronted by the Government. I have referred to the communications infrastructure, the training infrastructure, language training&mdash;in other words, a broader educational <Col N="502" /> infrastructure&mdash;industrial relations, incomes policy, public sector employment, the encouragement of self-reliance, and the trying to hand back to the people part of the load the State has taken on itself and energy policies.  There are probably other fields where one can say nothing fundamental has been done, but those bitter problems will have to be faced even after the economy has undergone intensive care treatment of the type that is looming up fast.  That treatment will only get us over the worst of the immediate recession, and it will do that only at the cost of a lot of pain to people. The long-term vulnerability is much more serious.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that this oil induced crisis is spectacularly different from the one we faced in 1974.  One rough guide I thought up and applied is to measure the cost of oil imports as a proportion of total imports.  In 1975, our worst year in that respect, oil imports roughly represented 13.2 per cent.  In the first five months of 1980 oil imports represented almost the same figure, 13.6 per cent, of total imports.  It is possible that that figure has increased since then because, with the deepening recession, import demand has slackened for capital commodities and not so much for oil.  However, as the economists say, it is still a figure of the same order as we had to contend with in 1975.  I do not accept, therefore, that there is any spectacular difference in the Government's favour between conditions today and those which existed five years ago.  In fact, we have slipped back very seriously through the extension of the national debt and the encouragement of quite insane expectations among our people in response to election promises, and the failure to confront the structural problems I have detailed in the course of my contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should first like to review some of our recent industrial history and to make some comments on the present situation in which we find ourselves in terms of industry, investment and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's entry into the EEC in 1973 <Col N="503" /> was the single most significant step for the Irish economy in the seventies.  In the industrial area the jump in foreign investment attracted by the opportunity to produce within the tariff barriers of the EEC was dramatic.  This investment has been the main thrust of our industrial expansion since then.  A firm invests in the hope of earning a high rate of return.  If the climate for earning and retaining profits is good investment will expand.  Successive Governments have recognised these basic principles which would encourage the private sector to play a major part in the expansion of our industry.  Our basic philosophy has been to encourage the private sector to provide this thrust for the expansion of industry.  Government policy first formulated in the fifties by Fianna Fáil and continued by successive Governments since then set out to create the environment necessary to implement this philosophy.  It is aimed to improve access to export markets and to provide a favourable business environment.  In this way firms were and are encouraged to invest, to export and to make and retain profits for further expansion.</P>
    <P>Growth in investment is essential if output is to increase.  High output in industry leads to both productivity and employment gains.  Growth in productivity improves the company's competitiveness and facilitates higher living standards for its employees while the provision of new employment fulfils a basic national need.  In Ireland manufacturing industry has been the engine of economic growth in recent years.  In the period mid-1977 to March 1980&mdash;which is the latest period for which official statistics are available&mdash;the number at work in manufacturing rose by 16,000.  It is worth comparing this impressive outcome with the fall in manufacturing employment in the preceding four and a half years.  Job creation is the principal objective of our industrial development drive.  At this stage much of the real struggle for a secure industrial base is behind us.  Looking back at the structure of industry in the fifties and sixties I sometimes shudder now at its weakness then in so many aspects.  Today we have the fastest growing <Col N="504" /> industrial sector in the EEC: our growth in output and investment and jobs is faster than in any of our EEC neighbours. This growth has taken place in a free market economy which offers positive incentives for expansion and job creation. While the next ten years will present many challenges and problems for Irish industry I believe they will be somewhat easier than the past decade in one major respect, in the sense that we now know what we have achieved.  We know that we can measure up in many sectors to the highest international standards.</P>
    <P>Irish industry today is better able to withstand adverse conditions than it was at the beginning of the last recession in 1974-75.  Then the impact of free trade coupled with the effects of the general slow down resulted in many closures particularly in the older traditional industries. Since then the IDA have worked to strengthen Irish industry and assist it in weathering harsh new conditions.  The industries that have survived through the last recession are now stronger and more competitive than they were six years ago. This is borne out by the indications during the current difficult period.  A higher than average proportion of job losses are resulting from firms shedding labour rather than closing down.  During the last recession 30 per cent of job losses were attributable to closures compared with a figure of 15 per cent this time.  A higher proportion of the jobs lost during the current recession will therefore be regained when trading conditions improve.</P>
    <P>In this regard, despite the current slow down, the IDA's experience in negotiating new industrial projects and in generating first-time jobs on the ground is highly encouraging.  Last year was a record for this country.  In 1980 it is expected that the IDA will again exceed their target.  In the first six months of this year they created 8,500 new first-time jobs on the ground which is 63 per cent of the full years' target.  They confidently expect to repeat this performance during the second half of this year.  The level of job approvals&mdash; as opposed to job creation which I have just spoken about&mdash;which is the most positive indicator <Col N="505" /> of the rate of future manufacturing job creation is also very encouraging in this exceptionally difficult year.  By the middle of the year, 30 June, the IDA had achieved 71 per cent of its total, overall annual target of job approvals.  SFADCo, through its intensive promotion of small indigenous industries in the mid-west and the attraction of new or the expansion of existing projects in the Shannon Industrial Estate will also make a worth-while contribution to the overall national job approvals and creation effort.</P>
    <P>Our current export performance has also many gratifying features.  In the eight months ending 31 August 1980 the total value of exports was £2,638.6 million which is more than 20 per cent greater than in the corresponding period of 1979 and which I regard as a highly praiseworthy achievement especially when viewed against the background of deteriorating international trade conditions resulting from the world recession.  It is now estimated that total exports for 1980 will amount to at least £4.2 billion, an increase of almost 21 per cent on 1979. General indications, together with information available to Córas Tráchtála directly from exporting industry, suggests that this figure will in fact be achieved.</P>
    <P>In sharp contrast with the 1974-75 recession when manufacturing output fell in four consecutive quarters, output in the first half of this year, despite a dip in June, is up 2 per cent on the first six months of 1979.  At a time when the trend of industrial production in the European Community is universally downwards Irish output is still expected to be higher for the year as a whole in comparison with 1979.</P>
    <P>All these results constitute an impressive record by any standard at a time like this.  They do not come about by chance; they are the fruits of deliberate policies and of very hard work and of a most professional approach by various agencies. I believe they set a pattern for continuing real growth in industry in the years ahead.  There is no question in my mind that we have the resources to make this happen if we want to.  We have a high degree of political stability, something <Col N="506" /> which I suppose we take for granted but which is a more precious commodity than perhaps we realise.  Our people have a clear sense of identity and they now have self-confidence which is greatly strengthened by the experience of the last 20 years, a period in which manufacturing industry here grew annually by 6 per cent in real terms.  We now have had consistency of industrial development policy for over two decades and this also is a matter we may take for granted somewhat but it is of fundamental importance particularly in reassuring potential investors.</P>
    <P>We have successful and dynamic promotional enterprises and an attractive and developed range of incentive programmes without parallel in Europe.  We have some of the most modern plant in Western Europe, arising from the fact that our drive for industrialisation is less than 25 years old.  Our skills are not inhibited by hide-bound tradition, and our industry is increasingly oriented towards sectors of long-term growth.</P>
    <P>Finally, and perhaps most significantly, for the first time in the history of this country there is available a substantial group of Irish managers capable of competing with the best in the world. This, I believe, may be our greatest resource, and it is one that has only become available to the Irish economy in very recent years.  In the 1950s and earlier the enterprising Irishman too often went abroad out of necessity and was lost forever to us, but the Irish emigrants of the 1960s have begun to come back bringing with them the skills, experience and vision acquired in their years abroad.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to see the growth of this last factor&mdash;the emergence of high quality native Irish managers and entrepreneurs.  I believe this is the way of the future and that the 1980s and 1990s will increasingly see the growth of indigenous industries in all kinds of sophisticated and technologically advanced areas, industries owned and managed by Irish entrepreneurs and managers.</P>
    <P>Even today there are clear signs that this is happening.  While there is a widespread impression that the IDA have concentrated most of their efforts on the introduction of large overseas companies <Col N="507" /> to Ireland, this is to a great extent due to the fact that the establishment of such companies here usually attracts much more attention in the press than similar investments by Irish firms.  The IDA however, with my strong support, are committed heavily to the maximum support and encouragement of Irish industry. Over the last three years the number of jobs approved from domestic industry has increased significantly.</P>
    <P>In 1973-1974, for example, job approvals for domestic sources represented 41 per cent of the total job approvals, while last year this figure was 58 per cent, a very significant increase.</P>
    <P>Last year small firms employing 50 persons or fewer accounted for 24 per cent of jobs approved for assistance by the IDA.  This year the figure is expected to be at least 33 per cent of the total approvals. The rapid growth of small industries in Ireland can be appreciated by a comparison of the results of the first year of the Small Industries Programme in 1967, when a total of 34 projects were approved, with 1979 when on average three projects were approved every working day.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to see this kind of progress not only because 90 per cent of these projects are Irish owned, but because small firms play a very important role in developing a balanced industrial structure.  They bring jobs to towns which are not large enough to sustain major industries.  Since 1967 small industries have been located in 440 separate locations throughout the country.  On top of this they encourage native entrepreneurial talent.  One in four projects helped by the IDA is created by persons not previously engaged in manufacturing, persons who are developing and exploiting their own ideas.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this year 23,000 persons were employed in small grant-aided firms, equivalent to 10 per cent of the manufacturing labour force.  Over the decade of the 1980s the growth potential for small industries will be greater than ever due to the increasing number of &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; opportunities arising from new larger scale industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> The 1980s will also see a vast array of new business and job opportunities becoming available to Irish entrepreneurs and managers.  In Ireland today we already have companies who are operating at the very core of the electronics revolution which is now sweeping the world.  As a result of our calculated and deliberate policy, one out of every two US electronics industries now making greenfield investments in Europe are being located in Ireland.  Today there are 13,500 persons employed in the electronics industry here; by 1985, in this industry alone, the number employed will be just below 30,000.  The opportunities for native Irish entrepreneurs in this field alone will be immense.</P>
    <P>Within the IDA we have a special industrial intelligence unit which identifies developments which show the greatest prospects of growth in the years ahead and which could provide the best opportunities for the continuing expansion of the Irish industrial sector.  The main area where I expect to see dramatic impact being made by Irish businesses is in biotechnology which will have as great an impact in the 1990s as did electronics in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</P>
    <P>All of these new technologically sophisticated industries will provide Irish industry with many opportunities over the next decade.  These opportunities will call for new creative approaches by Irish companies, such as the acquisition of new overseas markets and the development of established markets, the development of new products and new markets by entering joint ventures with strong companies, and the development of new markets directly by investing heavily in R and D and marketing.</P>
    <P>On the marketing side it will call for a high level of skills from Irish marketeers and salesmen.  Over the next decade the real thrust for growth will have to come from developing new export opportunities where we have a competitive advantage. Here, I would expect that the favourable light in which Ireland is held in many countries would help these efforts.  In this regard, I can assure Irish industry that the State bodies under my control will be there to advise, encourage <Col N="509" /> and assist any Irish manufacturing firm who adopt a bold and innovative approach to their continuing development.</P>
    <P>Three key points which are relevant to our economy at present are (1), we have entered a changed international situation, which is demanding new thinking and new attitudes on our part; (2), these changes will demand a new personal commitment from everyone in this country&mdash;our problem will not be solved by new economic measures alone; and (3), to continue to make progress we must shed a number of myths on all sides in our society and face our realities more objectively.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are not only a very small economy in world economic terms but we are a very open economy.  This smallness of our economy has dictated the type of economic policies we have tried in the past.  During the early 1930s, for example, an attempt was made to develop Irish industry behind high tarriff barriers&mdash;to create a siege economy.  The result of this could only be very limited in the protectionist international climate of the time. It was realised that the Irish market was too small a base on which to build the desired improvements in living standards. These improvements could only be achieved if the market for Irish goods were expanded, so from the late 1950s on we became staunch advocates of free trade.  We had the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement of 1966 and in 1973 EEC membership, both of which increased our exposure and vulnerability to international competition.</P>
    <P>The second characteristic of our economy&mdash;the openness which I mentioned&mdash;is essentially a function of our smallness.  It is simply impossible to produce all the goods we require domestically. The extent of the openness of the Irish economy is demonstrated by the fact that this year exports and imports combined are expected to be equivalent to about 121 per cent of our GNP.  The comparable figures for western Europe and the USA would be about 48 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.  At present over half our total factory production is <Col N="510" /> exported.  Two in every three jobs in manufacturing industry are export related to some degree.</P>
    <P>This smallness and openness makes us very vulnerable to fluctuations in world economic activity.  The clearest example in recent years is in the case of oil.  When the price of oil is raised we either pay the increased cost or the tap is turned off. We should ask what is happening on the international scene generally.  While there is some indication that international economic growth may turn upwards by mid-1981, this is likely to be within a different framework from that of the sixties and seventies.  During the last three years in particular we have seen the painful adjustment process to a new world economic order.  We have seen enormous price increases in oil and the supply disruptions which have demonstrated how vulnerable not only Ireland but the whole world is to movements in this precious source of energy.  It has been brought home to us with renewed force and urgency the need for change in our whole way of life so that we can reduce our dependence on oil and learn to develop patterns of life that are less demanding in their energy needs.</P>
    <P>Almost uniformly in every western country we see implacable inflation and steadily rising energy costs holding out grim prospects for the eighties with all the major western economic forecasting institutions from the OECD to the IMS and the EEC looking at slower growth in output, increasing inflationary forces, persistent monetary instability and dramatically increasing unemployment.  This is the international framework within which we will have to operate in the eighties.  We should all be aware of it whether as a businessman, trade unionist, worker, public employee or farmer. For our small, open and energy importing economy the impact of these uncertainties and problems will be inescapable and our future will be very bleak indeed unless we can develop a national will to create productive jobs, unless all sectors in our society can agree on working together and unless we stop trying to deceive ourselves about the economic realities of today's world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> Some years ago in the Solomon Islands there was a phenomenon called the Cargo cult.  On an abandoned military airstrip islanders wearing American GI uniforms marched in formation before a control tower.  In the tower a man wearing earphones carved from wood spoke into a wooden microphone.  Other islanders sat patiently looking at the sky watching and waiting for a silver airship to arrive in answer to the magic they were making.  During the war the Cargo cultist had seen that the GIs were able to call down wealth from the sky apparently without doing any work, merely by talking into little boxes, signalling with flags and marching in formation.  Lacking any understanding of the elaborate production, transportation and communications technology, the hard work and productivity that made possible this abundance of goods, the cultists attributed it all to what they saw and they tried to achieve the same results by ritual imitation. When their efforts failed to produce the desired results they often became increasingly fanatical and dogmatic. They would kill off their livestock, consume their food stores and seed corn, destroy their tools and refuse to work until the wealth came from the skies.</P>
    <P>There are, I regret to say, certain parallels between our behaviour and that of these primitives in the South Sea Islands. Both societies suffer from a failure to perceive reality and an unwillingness to act upon it.  The difference is mainly one of degree.  But any society that acts upon false perceptions of reality is in serious trouble.  The question is: what is our excuse?</P>
    <P>In this country we presumably do understand that our security and progress towards greater and social wellbeing, more and better jobs and inflation free economy depend on sustained economic growth and productivity.  We do understand that to have these we must encourage high levels of investment in research and development and in replacement and modernisation of plant and equipment in order to increase productivity.  We do understand that we face an exceptionally rapid increase in the working age population, <Col N="512" /> not just for years but for decades ahead, and these young people have to be provided with an opportunity to work and build a better future in this country.</P>
    <P>We do understand that to enjoy an increase in our standard of living we must create additional wealth.  We do understand that growth in our wealth depends on our ability through our manpower and other resources to turn raw materials into goods that are competitively priced and saleable on the international market.  Yet we have been acting as if these economic facts of life did not exist.  We have been concentrating on the distribution of any wealth created, or expected to be created, rather than on the creation of such wealth.  We have been emphasising short-term interests&mdash;protection of current income differentials and outmoded and unproductive jobs&mdash;at the expense of vital long-term economic issues.  We have tolerated the bludgeoning attempts by some of the more powerful groups in our society demanding more than their fair share and holding the rest of the community to ransom thereby ensuring that the weaker sectors get less.  We have put up with the disruption and the economic damage caused by unofficial disputes by people who apparently do not care about the impact of this bad image on jobs and employment.  We have supported these people in their attempts to subvent democratic procedures by refusing to pass unofficial pickets.</P>
    <P>Our response to these fundamental issues has been in many ways as bizarre as any Cargo cult manifestation.  Like the Cargo cultist, we have been drifting along blindly on the assumption that to make progress all we have to do is follow a certain ritual&mdash;to get a higher real income all we have to do is strike; to create a new job all the Government have to do is employ another person.  Too many people in the country have been sailing along assuming that the Government can spend vast extra sums of money on welfare, reduce taxation, increase capital spending, provide the conditions for full employment and produce a balanced budget all at the same time.</P>
    <P>Life is not like that.  As a nation we live in a highly competitive world which does <Col N="513" /> not owe us a living.  We have to earn our wealth and pay our way.  We all agree that full employment and a high standard of living are important, but statements of hope or good intentions are not enough. To achieve our ambitions we have to produce and sell goods and services that are wanted in home and overseas markets. Unfortunately problems that confront us today are survival problems. They will not yield to the Cargo cult mentality.  We must be clear about the scale of the challenge that confronts us. We have to define the choices open to us, set realistic targets and, above all, we urgently need to recognise and remove the unexamined assumptions and myths underlying so much of our contemporary thinking.</P>
    <P>Essentially we need to understand a few basic economic facts of life.  We spend our lives either producing goods or services or using them.  This means working to the full capacity of everyone if the nation is to make the best use of its resources.  It is so obvious that it is often ignored.  We must all work because there is no free lunch.  It follows that we cannot consume more than we produce.  We cannot increase our standard of living without either producing more or taking somebody else's share from somewhere in our society.  Unless we increase the total national cake we cannot take a bigger share without letting someone else go hungry.</P>
    <P>We must understand that growth in living standards of the whole nation cannot be achieved without increased productivity by whoever can contribute. That is common sense, but how often do we see efforts to bring about the changes necessary to increase productivity being resisted, or else extravagant demands made in advance of the changes?  Increasing the prosperity of our nation means more and harder work and, above all, a commitment to change.  However, in the time in which we live there tends to be disenchantment with work and the prevailing culture is that it is only the idiot who goes home tired, who does not avail of all the day's absence he is allowed, or <Col N="514" /> who does not create the maximum overtime opportunities for himsilf and his colleagues. There are many other aspects of human behaviour, of community interests, of external trade, of the distribution of wealth and so on, on which we need an understanding if we are to develop a society which is not racked continuously by sectional conflict.  The fact that we are a small nation should make it easier for us to communicate and to give all our people an opportunity to grasp the interdependence of industry, agriculture, trade unions, Government and the whole fabric of our society.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the key to a sound economy is the creation of viable, productive jobs.  We must create these kinds of jobs at a rate and on a scale never achieved here before if we are to create the conditions in which we can attain full employment and a rising standard of living. The essence of our problem at the moment is that we are not creating enough wealth to do either.  Growth in our wealth depends on our ability, through our manpower and our other resources, to turn raw materials into goods and services that are demanded at home and overseas.  The value added through this process is the source of the wages that pay for the needs of the work force and their families and of the taxes that fund Government programmes and thus determine the community's standard of living.  It also provides the surpluses or profits for private and public enterprise to maintain the capital stock and to finance the further growth of value-added in the future.  In a small and open economy such as ours this value-adding process has for the most part to be carried out in direct competition with foreign producers. This means that we cannot tolerate the creation of non-productive jobs simply for the sake of creating employment. Artificially created jobs by the State mean simply that we as a nation become less productive and less competitive. These nominal jobs must be paid for by either increased taxation or an increase in State borrowing.  We must reject the illusion that the State in some sense can create new short term jobs at the stroke of a pen.  These so-called jobs <Col N="515" /> cost money.  They have to be paid for by the rest of the community.  It is a fundamental law of economics that in the long run it is impossible without disastrous consequences to take more out of the economy in wages, taxes and profits than is put into it in the production of goods and services.  This basic value-added principle needs to be more widely communicated and understood by each individual in our community and we must give as high a priority to the creation of the wealth or added value as we do to the distribution of it.</P>
    <P>It takes actual productive projects to create long-term, self-sustaining jobs and growth.  This means that we have to go out and identify new markets, develop new products and produce them competitively. In an increasingly tough international climate opportunities are not necessarily going to be easy to come by. Achieving jobs and output targets of the scale needed will not be a matter of a few grandiose gestures.  It will require a sustained effort, with small products as well as large, in a wide range of industries where Ireland is able to establish and maintain a competitive edge.</P>
    <P>The key requirement is enterprise. Enterprise of all kinds will have an important contribution to make.  Foreign enterprise will continue to be a vital source of new investment and jobs.  Public enterprise, either alone or together with the private sector, has a contribution to make.  However, domestic private enterprise will have to take the leading role through both the expansion of existing business and the creation of new business. In this context the role of Government is to create the conditions in which enterprise, both public and private, can flourish.  My Department and all of the State agencies under my control are striving hard to build this role and to create these conditions.</P>
    <P>The production that we have been able to achieve in a year as difficult as 1980 is indicative of the even greater triumph that I think can be brought about in easier years in future and it is very unlikely that we will have to face again the kind of international trade difficulties that we <Col N="516" /> and other countries face at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: I find myself in agreement with a lot of the second part of Deputy O'Malley's speech.  The only trouble is that it is rather a pity that he did not know as much about the economics of this country in 1977 as he appears to know now.  The lecture he has just delivered to us about the fact that we cannot hope to get prosperity just by wishing for it suggests that he did not know that at that time.  He has given us the story of the &ldquo;Cargo Cult&rdquo;.  The first time we heard about that in this country was in the Fianna Fáil general election manifesto of 1977.  This document did exactly what the &ldquo;Cargo Cult&rdquo; did in that, according to Fianna Fáil then, all we had to do was return them to power and, hey presto, everything in the garden was going to be lovely.  We were going to have employment, we were going to have lower prices and so on.  Lest anybody should try to say that this was not so, let me give a couple of examples.</P>
      <P>Two nights before the last general election Deputy Jack Lynch, then Leader of the Opposition and subsequently Taoiseach, was asked in a television interview what Fianna Fáil proposed to do about the unemployment situation which at that time was bad, admittedly.  He said &ldquo;We are going to abolish the dole queues&rdquo;. The interviewer was somewhat taken aback and he asked &ldquo;When will that happen?&rdquo; Deputy Lynch said, &ldquo;Immediately Fianna Fáil take office&rdquo;.  Twice within the first six months subsequent to Fianna Fáil's resuming office in this state Deputy Lynch repeated that and then he forgot all about it.  It was so incredibly stupid to suggest that it could be done that it should be rated with the ideas of the &ldquo;Cargo Cult&rdquo; people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was not the whole story.  Prices were to be reduced according to this manifesto, by 1 per cent in 1977, by 2 per cent in 1978 and 2 per cent in 1979.  They did not go into 1980.  I assume that there <Col N="517" /> would be no increase at all then and that would be away ahead of Deputy O'Donoghue's 5 per cent increase at that time.  There would be increases in output of 4 per cent in 1978, 3 per cent in 1979 and 3 per cent in 1980.  Borrowing as a percentage of GNP was to be 11 per cent in 1977, 13 per cent in 1978, 10.5 per cent in 1979 and 8 per cent in 1980.</P>
    <P>Again we must examine the situation and we must consider the whole story in this vote of confidence or no confidence which is before the House.  Until the Minister came in&mdash;and other people have spoken including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste&mdash; nobody seemed to have a clear notion of the way in which we ordinary people live.  Apparently they are not aware.  Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, in the first part of his speech seemed to suggest that he also is not aware of the position we have at present.  As Deputy John Kelly so ably pointed out, oil price increases are not the major factor which Fianna Fáil would have us believe in our disastrous economic situation.  In 1974-75 we had the first blast of the open economy and on top of that we had a world recession which we survived.  In 1976-77 the country was coming out of that recession and was handed over to Fianna Fáil with all their promises.  We have finished up in the disastrous position we now face.</P>
    <P>During the past couple of years, and particularly this year, local authorities have been given such a small amount of money for housing and the provision of SDA loans that young people will now have to settle for any type of accommodation they can get.  There is no prospect of getting new houses, which were available while the National Coalition Government were in office.  People who are now getting married cannot hope within a reasonable time to be housed by a local authority.  According to the figures I recently received, it seems that local authorities are now back to the old Fianna Fáil system where people will have to wait up to five years before they will be considered for rehousing.  This is in line with what Fianna Fáil said in 1976 and again early in 1977, that the National <Col N="518" /> Coalition were building too many local authority houses in relation to the total number of new houses being built.</P>
    <P>People who applied for SDA loans were promised in writing by local authorities that loans of up to £12,000 would be available to help them build their own houses.  This money had been promised to the local authorities by the Department of the Environment.  It must be remembered that to qualify for an SDA loan an applicant must not earn more than £105 per week gross.  People who received this written promise from the local authorities went to the banks and got bridging loans on which they were paying large amounts of interest, but in June this year the local authorities discovered that the money would not be made available to them by the Department. Despite the relatively small amount of money given recently to each local authority in order to redeem the SDA applicants, there are thousands of young people building their dream houses&mdash;some of them have actually moved in or are in the course of completing the work&mdash;who must sell their houses in order to keep out of debt.  This is what the Fianna Fáil Government are doing to the people to whom they promised better housing loans and grants.</P>
    <P>On the subject of rents paid by local authority tenants, I challenge the statement made by the former Minister for the Environment that he met and discussed with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations the matter of rents and the purchase price of houses. He met them and told them what he proposed to do and apparently regards that as discussing the matter.  That is not acceptable.  Handing over now to somebody else when everything is in a mess is not the solution.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Ministers speaking here ever look at the type of road on which they are travelling when using the State car.  I travelled in a State car for over four years and I could see whether a road was in bad condition, but I do not belong to Fianna Fáil.  If I were a Fianna Fáil Minister I probably would not be able to see it now either. Obviously they cannot see that the condition <Col N="519" /> of the roads is abominable.  More accidents are now caused by bad roads than by any other factor.  I travel a lot around the country and even on national, primary and secondary routes it is not unusual to find people driving in the middle of the road because they dare not drive towards the side due to potholes. The lesser county roads for which no money is available are in an abominable condition.</P>
    <P>I was amused yesterday at Question Time to hear the Minister for Energy speaking about grants being available to people who want to repair bog roads. Where is the money to be found?  If enough money is not being allocated to keep national, primary and secondary roads in order, where are local authorities to get the money for this type of work?</P>
    <P>Apparently the Fianna Fáil Party are still unaware that all over the country road workers are being laid off, pensionable servants of local authorities, because the money is not available to keep them. This is not the type of treatment they were promised in the manifesto.  It riles me when I hear people talk about how well the country is doing.  Such people have never known what it is to be told that there is no longer any work for them. It would be a very good thing if some members of the Government had that experience and had to go home to their families without any prospect of further employment.  Anybody over 45 who loses his job has not a chance of ever getting permanent employment again.  A person is now too old for re-employment at 45 because the labour market is flooded with people under that age, particularly thousands of young people, many of whom have university degrees.  These young people are doing temporary jobs washing up in cafes, working as waitresses and doing any odd job they can get because they do not want to go home and admit that even with their degrees they are unable to find employment.  I know one young girl who speaks seven languages. She applied for employment in the civil service.  They told her she was not up to the standard.  So obviously the standard <Col N="520" /> must be very high and there must be a tremendous number of talented young people who are unable to find employment if somebody who speaks seven languages fluently is unable to get a job.</P>
    <P>Again the Government do not seem to understand the position in which the building industry generally is at present. I will never forget the attitude of Fianna Fáil when they were in opposition.  Two or three of them in particular, including the present Minister for Labour, got up day after day and shouted across the House at me about what Fianna Fáil would do when they got back into power and how they were going to give 5,000 extra jobs in the building industry.  If there was a drop of 1 or 2 per cent in the amount of cement used in any particular year there was a song and dance about it. They raised it on the adjournment and said everything they possibly could.  The sale of cement in the last 12 months has dropped by over 30 per cent and I do not hear the people over there saying so much about it now.  The fact that there are several thousand fewer people employed in the building industry now than when we were in office is not mentioned now.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is correct when he talks about the tremendous efforts the IDA are making to start new industries here and I was glad to see them being able to conclude arrangements with some of the industries with which negotiations were started in our time.  I suppose the Minister will take credit.  However, the credit is due not to him but to the IDA who have done so much work to get them here.  But the Minister should also be prepared to admit that, while they are doing the best they can, the number of firms closing and the number of people losing their jobs is far greater than the number of jobs being created.  As a result we have, according to the statistics, over 106,000 people unemployed at present. This does not take into account the number of people who are on a short working week, because apparently by some manipulation it has been decided they will be left out.  They are now not regarded as being unemployed and there <Col N="521" /> are thousands of them in the country including an additional 500 this morning in Cork</P>
    <P>If we are going to have a factual debate we should stick to facts.  Those are the facts and those are the things which we must bring to the notice of the general public.  When in opposition Fianna Fáil said, at a time when the figure for unemployment came to about 107,000 that the real figure was 160,000.  If we work on their basis and add all the people who are on a short working week, I would suggest that the correct number of people unemployed must now be about 180,000. They are the people who really will have a hollow belly laugh at the statement being made by the Ministers who spoke here, particularly the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, who told them about the wonderful prospects there are for this country in time to come.</P>
    <P>One thing that Deputy O'Malley did not mention, and which I was waiting for him to make a comment on, was the question of prices.  When Fianna Fáil took office in 1977 there was great joy in certain camps.  One lady in particular, who was head of an organisation outside, said it was a wonderful thing that a woman had been put in charge of the Department that looked after prices. That was the last time she was mentioned in connection with looking after prices. They politely let that slip to one side and it was never mentioned again.  There is nothing that she could be very proud of if she was in charge of prices.  However, the Minister himself is in charge of prices, and if we compare what has happened now with what was happening during our term of office everybody must be satisfied that there is absolutely no control whatever over prices.  I met a fellow some months ago and I thought he was being funny because he was telling me that his eldest girl had just started work.  I asked him what she was doing and he said she was working in a supermarket.  I asked him if she had a good job and he said she was employed full time changing prices. I was in a supermarket last week and a girl who was doing the very same job told me there were four of them employed <Col N="522" /> full time marking up prices in one supermarket every day.  They do nothing else but go around taking off prices and marking them up.  In this case they were marking up the price of biscuits 3p a packet.</P>
    <P>We see in the Fianna Fáil manifesto that they were going to pay particular regard to price control.  They were not going to allow any prices to be increased without going through the due process. It does not appear to be necessary even to publicise price increases now.  Coal was increased on a couple of occasions recently and it was not necessary to notify the Prices Commission.  Indeed, the Prices Advisory Body report is currently about four months late.  Having sanctioned prices and the prices having been put into operation, the public are not informed unless RTE give two or three of the really shocking ones in the morning news and then forget about it.  The newspapers will not publish it at all, and I do not see why they should because the news is months late and people are paying these prices before the news is given in the Prices Advisory Body report.  This news should be issued and it should be published immediately, because that also was one of the promises made by Fianna Fáil-they were going to give a weekly run down of prices and price increases.</P>
    <P>There is something else with regard to prices which is rather horrifying.  It is that in supermarkets particularly&mdash;and they are not the only ones to blame&mdash;about 80 per cent of the products, including agricultural products such as carrots, potatoes, peas and so on, are imported.  Since most of them are imported from Britain there is a mark up on the price immediately and there is nothing the Prices Advisory Body can do about it, apparently, because at present there is a difference of about 18 per cent between the púnt and the pound.  This means that what is being offered in the supermarkets is the price in pounds sterling converted to the púnt and the result is that 17 or 18 per cent is added to the price of what could be bought cheaper before we joined the EMS.</P>
    <P>I know there are people in every party who believed that joining the EMS would be the greatest thing that this country <Col N="523" /> could do.  I believed at the time&mdash;and I opposed it when I was in Government&mdash;that the idea of joining the EMS was a bad mistake for this country because now it has reached the stage where people who are on a fixed income, and people who have a small amount of money invested, are finding that with the clamour at present for a devaluation of the púnt they will be literally beggared. Goods are now very much dearer than they would have been in the normal case. The answer, of course, is to buy Irish and I would be 100 per cent behind those who say we should by Irish in every case.  I do not shop a lot but any time I go into a shop to buy anything for myself I always insist on buying Irish.  I am amazed at the difficulty I have in getting somebody to supply me with an Irish article.  I do not know whether it is because there is not as high a profit on it or some other reason, but again and again I go from shop to shop looking for shoes and shirts and they do not have any Irish articles.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about this if we are really interested in buying Irish. We see advertisements on the television practically every evening and people are spending a lot of money advertising Irish goods and appealing to people to support Irish made goods.  But what do we find? Last week or the week before last Telefís Éireann wanted a new floor covering for their new building.  So what do they do? They do not even ask for an Irish article, they purchase the article in Holland.  That was a sore blow to carpet manufacturers who pay.  I believe, as much as six figures in cash over a 12-month peiod to RTE in advertising revenue.  Yet RTE have the hard neck to say that the type of floor covering they required for their building was not manufactured in this country. Would somebody tell me why Irish goods manufactured here were not good enough for the floors of a new building built by RTE.  There is a carpet factory in my constituency&mdash;Navan carpets are well known not alone in this country but throughout the world.  Is it not extraordinary that while their employees have to go on a three-day week the national television service, through whom they carry <Col N="524" /> out a considerable amount of advertising, buy floor covering in Holland?  I suggest this Government should do what the previous Government did, that is, when an effort was made by another semi-State body to purchase material abroad, they were told they just could not do it.  I have raised this issue here now.  I attempted to get a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs about it but it was ruled out of order.  I am quite sure it was to save a blush that that was done.</P>
    <P>In regard to education the position is that there appears to be a cut back in the amount of money made available.  Our primary schools are too small to accommodate the additional pupils wanting to commence school this year.  I believe&mdash;and it is our party policy&mdash;that the State should and will ultimately provide kindergarten facilities for children so that they can be trained into the school routine a year or so before they commence at the age of four or five.  Indeed if there were kindergarten schools available there would be no reason why the commencing age should not be five.  The situation obtaining is that people who can afford to pay can take their children to kindergarten schools.  Yet when other children want to go to school at four years old they are told there is no accommodation available to them.  I was involved in an attempt to get accommodation for one group in Navan when, at first, 70 four-year-olds were told there was no accommodation at all for them.  Eventually 40 of them were taken and the remainder were told they would have to try later on.  But this Government who talk so much about the rights of people did not consider that those parents or their children had any rights at all.  Much as we may dislike pre-fabs there are still some available which would be adequate until suitable schools were built.  But very little effort is made to make them available, certainly in the case of the Navan school, and I am quite sure the same applies all over the country.  Many people wonder why so many children leave school at primary certificate level or shortly afterwards.  The reason is that there is no accommodation for them in many secondary schools around the <Col N="525" /> country.  Indeed in this city there are children who cannot get into a secondary school.  There is no point in the Minister saying that adequate accommodation will be made available in some years' time, that the money is not available.  The money should be made available.  That is the sort of thing for which money should be made available.  Unless we are able to educate our children we will not have a nation of people able to look for employment and support themselves later in life. Indeed I understand that the figure for those children who do not go any further than secondary education is something like 66 per cent of the school population which makes the picture appear rather bad.  Here I am not blaming the present Minister or Government.  I am afraid that has been the history for a number of years.  It is just too bad that such people are unable to get the education to which they are entitled.  Before the last election we heard a great deal about the tremendous reductions that would be effected in class numbers.  The fact is that these numbers have gone in the opposite direction and there appears to be nothing done about it.</P>
    <P>There is something else about which I feel very strongly and have spoken many times in this House, that is, the training of school children for the trades they will follow when they leave school.  Technical schools and colleges are doing a lot.  But there is a craze in this country with parents feeling that they are doing better than anybody else if they are able to send a son or daughter to university.  I feel that is a serious mistake because we need technical people; we need technicians. For God's sake why can we not train our children for the jobs they are prepared to do and can get at a later stage.  Why waste money getting degrees which are not worth a damn to many of the people who get them?  Parents may feel a glow of pride when their child receives such a degree&mdash;and many of them do not pass&mdash;but, when they do, the priorities are not in order.  The whole concept will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard of an extraordinary state of affairs.  As everybody is aware the town of Navan is regarded as the <Col N="526" /> home of furniture.  There are more furniture factories in that town than in any other in the country.  I asked if it would be possible to have an old technical school there converted for the purpose of providing accommodation for trainees in the furniture trade.  I was told it was not necessary.  I had a discussion with some furniture people in Navan recently and I was very surprised to learn that in Dublin, where there is such a school, there are eight pupils only being taught for the whole of the country.  If we are in earnest about bringing industry into the 1980s that figure should be much nearer 100 than a mere eight.  It is ridiculous that this sort of situation should obtain.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has just come into the House.  He has always been very forthcoming about the number of telephones we would get this year, next year, the year after and so on.  I have told him on many occasions that there is a telephone in my room in this House on which it is possible to dial ten times and get eight wrong numbers.  As recently as yesterday I was endeavouring to telephone my home on that telephone.  First I got the engaged tone&mdash;I subsequently learned the number was not engaged&mdash;then it was out of order; then there was no tone at all; then I got Dundalk telephone exchange, bearing no relation whatever to the number I was dialling.  On the sixth attempt, I got my home number.  One can do a tour of this country by picking up a telephone and dialling any number because one will find one gets any number in the country rather than the one dialled.  This is the sort of thing that must be dealt with.  The Minister may contend that the equipment installed over the years was not what it should be.  Perhaps that is the reason. But before we talk about hundreds of thousands of new telephones, let us get the existing ones working, when perhaps it will then be possible to talk about others.</P>
    <P>I write to Government Departments fairly often.  I do not write to the Minister or his junior Minister.  I do not believe it is the function of the political head of a <Col N="527" /> Department to deal with individual queries. Generally I write to the secretary of the particular section dealing with such matters, to the civil servants paid to do the job.  Usually I get a courteous reply. I am surprised at the number of people who tell me that they have been waiting for four or five years for a telephone.  I hope the Minister's claims that he will be able to supply all these phones will come true.  We shall only have to wait and see.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make some comment on what is happening with regard to the changeover in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the ordinary postal services.  Almost 12 months have gone by and, as some Member said here yesterday, only one official, as far as we know, has been appointed.  What is being done, I do not know.  I do not agree at all with this changeover because, while the Minister has given a guarantee that it will still be a monopoly service&mdash;in other words that the board to be set up will carry out the work&mdash;he has also said that in the postal end of it there will be provision for certain private services.  If he believes that that is a misquotation, I can quote his exact words.  It cannot be the two things; it will either be a monopoly service by the new board or a service which will allow other people to cream off what is a good way of making money and then let somebody subsidise what is left.  That is an old ploy used before by Fianna Fáil and I would not be surprised to see it happen again.</P>
    <P>On the subject of telephones, in the social welfare sphere the telephone service and letter post affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of our people who are dependent on social welfare.  I am always amazed when told that someone phoned the Department of Social Welfare and was passed around from one section to the other.  I know the officials in a number of these sections in the Department of Social Welfare and, with one exception, I find them most courteous, intelligent and willing to help.  If people who have not got an old age pension book for three or four weeks ring from the country to the section dealing with their book and are put from one to <Col N="528" /> the other until they have spent their money on phone calls and eventually are left holding a dead line.  That is not the way to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare must try to ensure that what has recently happened will never happen again, for whatever short time he will be in that position. It is outrageous that when the book of a person depending on an old age or a widow's pension is terminated &mdash; and the Department can easily find out when this occurs &mdash; that person should have to wait for weeks on end before getting a renewal.  In a recent extraordinary case a woman got a contributory old age pension book last June, drew her pension for a couple of weeks and then the new book was due.  She applied for it and got a widow's pension.  There was no way in which she or I could persuade the Department that she had not got a widow's pension, even though they had terminated her widow's pension and sent her the other book.  This is a serious thing about which this Government must do something.  People receiving social welfare are entitled to a better deal than they are getting.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am aware of at least one person who is due nearly £2,000 back money and cannot get it although promised it in three or four weeks' time.  There are old age pensioners who are due £300 and £400 back money and cannot get it. Why can they not get it?  My guess is that this is one way of saving money, holding on to money for a little while to save having to borrow that amount; and if this happens to a couple of hundred people, it amounts to a substantial sum.  It is not good enough that this should happen. The Department of Social Welfare must ensure that people get what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I recently saw a statement attributed to the same Minister in his office as Minister for Health, that doctors were sending too many people to hospitals.  Did he really mean what he said?  He is also quoted as having said that some people go to hospital for the purpose of having someone hold their hands, but holding a very ill person's hand might be a very important thing to that person.  We need <Col N="529" /> a hospital service.  At present, it is extremely difficult to get an old person into any hospital through no fault of the health board officials or of the officials of the Department of Health and certainly no fault of the hospital officials.  The fault lies with the Government who are responsible for providing the necessary money to make hospital beds available. It is no use telling us that in 1985 or later we shall have a wonderful health service. Those who are ill now want hospital service and attention now, not in four or five years' time.  I heard Deputy O'Donoghue saying yesterday that what the Government were doing was correct.  The same Deputy is one of the people being blamed for the bringing about of the Fianna Fáil victory three-and-a-half years ago which that party were then so proud of.  When &ldquo;Charlie's Angels&rdquo; took over, he fairly quickly got the works, I grant that.  I was surprised at his coming in here and attempting to justify what the Government are doing now, which is a complete contradiction in many cases of the economic policy being carried out when they took over in 1977.  The Government will have to look at what they are doing and saying.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch very briefly on the question of industrial relations, which in this country could not be much worse than they are.  I was for 30 years a trade union official and during my time as general secretary of a trade union, if I signed an agreement accepted by the members on behalf of those members, I would not tolerate the tearing up of that agreement by a couple of people who thought there might be some way of getting more.  As far as I am concerned, unless unofficial strikes result from an employer unjustly dismissing people and giving them no chance to make a case for themselves, they will have to be banned.  They will not be banned or outlawed by the Government because no Government can do this without making martyrs of certain people.  Unless the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, of which I was a member for about ten years, deal with people who flout the wishes of the majority of our trade unionists, we shall reach a stage of <Col N="530" /> anarchy and the first to suffer from this will be the trade unionists themselves.  I have no apology to make for saying that. We in the Labour Party do not stand for anarchy; we stand for organised bargaining. That is the way it should be done and must be done.</P>
    <P>On the question of farmers, the Taoiseach spoke recently about his plan to reduce the rates for the 40- to 60-acre farmers, who would not now have to pay the second moiety.  In this connection I have three questions.  Firstly, what will happen to those too honest farmers who have already paid, as I know some have? Will they get this money back?  Secondly, the reason why so much of a row is being kicked up by this category of farmers is that Fianna Fáil increased the rates to, in many cases, over double the amount, by taking away the rates abatement on agricultural land.  What about the 20- to 40-acre farmers?  Where do they stand?  Is there some reason why they should be left out?  This must be dealt with and I would like a straight answer.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Department of Justice I am appalled as every decent person must be at the trend of shooting gardaí. We have brought into this part of the country the worst things that were happening in the North.  Fianna Fáil have brought it on their own heads.  When we were trying to do something about it four-and-a-half years ago Fianna Fáil sneered that we were a law and order Government. I would like to see law and order now.</P>

      <P>: In relation to the issue that Deputy Tully raised about phones in his room and at home I am glad that he accepts that the political head of the Department need not know every telephone number.  I have never pretended that the telephone service is what it should be but I will outline what is being done and what will be done in that area. I will also cover the other areas in relation to the splitting up of the Department and the point the Deputy made in relation to social welfare people who cannot get their pensions.  I am aware of complaints <Col N="531" /> in this area and I made provisions in the Post Office framework to ensure that if a person has not received his book he would be paid on the stubs of the old book until the new one came through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have listened with interest to the contributions from the other side of the House and these contributors have been sadly lacking in positive suggestions and positive thinking as to how the Opposition would cope with the current recession.</P>
      <P>I will illustrate with a few statistics just how well the Government have been coping with the recession which is generally regarded to be as bad as that experienced in the thirties.  The current recession first began to affect our economy at the end of 1979.  In contrast with the 1974-75 period when the Coalition were in office, manufacturing output has held up well and the predictions are that an increase of 3 per cent in volume terms will be achieved in 1980.  To contrast the percentage change in manufacturing output at the time when the recession was biting deepest with this year: in the third quarter of 1974 it fell by 1.0 per cent; in the fourth quarter of 1974 it fell by 2.9 per cent; and in the first quarter of 1975 it fell by 3.2 per cent.  In the first quarter of 1980 manufacturing output rose by 2.2 per cent.  For the entire year it is estimated to rise by 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>As an illustration of how our policies have been effective in maintaining employment the numbers on the live register show that the rate of increase, so far, has been much slower than that registered during the last recession in 1974-75 despite a substantial increase in our population and an increasing number of young people coming on to the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> The numbers employed in UK manufacturing industry have fallen by 7.5 per cent in the period 1975-80 while in Ireland the numbers have increased by 14.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to GNP, of course the current recession affects our EEC partners as well.  In the UK GNP is expected to fall by 2.25 per cent this year with investment in the manufacturing sector expected to fall by 4 per cent and output by 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare these statistics with current projections for Ireland where our GNP is expected to increase by up to 2 per cent this year while in the UK it is expected to decrease by 2.25 per cent.  Manufacturing output here is expected to increase by 3 per cent while in the UK to decrease by 6 per cent. Investment in manufacturing is expected to increase by 10½ per cent while in the UK to decrease by 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are complaining that the Government are spending too much, and are calling for cutbacks.  They are not of course prepared to say where these cuts should be made.  This shows that the Opposition have no ideas of their own. They are able to say where they think the Government are spending too little. Surely if it is possible for an Opposition to identify where too little is being spent, then, the same approach should tell them where spending is too high.  But the greatest confusion of all is to call for cutbacks in spending and then go on to suggest areas where more should be spent.  This indulgence in hypocritical contradictions and criticism is no substitute for economic policy.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the areas in my Department where we are making our contribution towards economic development. In a modern society, one of the principal functions of a Government is to foster and maintain a climate conducive to economic growth and social development. That climate is made up of many elements. Some, such as the state of business confidence, are intangible.  Others are very practical and relate to a country's infrastructure&mdash;housing, roads, transport, sanitary services and, perhaps most important of all in the last two decades <Col N="533" /> of the twentieth century, telecommunications.</P>
    <P>A high standard of telecommunications service is essential for all those engaged in trade and industry if they are to be efficient and to match their competitors, most of whom in the EEC, in other European countries and in the United States and Canada have a high quality of telecommunications available to them.  A high quality of service is particularly necessary to offset the natural disadvantages inherent in siting industry in remote areas, and industries in these areas cannot hope to prosper without a good standard of telecommunications services.  The free availability of telephones is most desirable too from a social point of view.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised fully the need to develop our telecommunications services and since taking office, have pursued a consistent policy designed to provide, in the shortest possible time, telecommunications services on a par with those in other EEC countries.  We established a review group to advise on the most appropriate structure for the services.  Their principal recommendations were quickly accepted and work is proceeding on the establishment of a statutory body to run the services.  A Green Paper was published earlier this year and work is being concentrated at present on getting the White Paper ready for publication. I hope to have this ready for publication in January next and draft legislation presented to the Oireachtas soon after that.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Government must press ahead with all possible speed in developing the services, Indeed, the need for accelerated investment was recognised in advance of the review group's report when a special building programme was initiated.  This was followed by the announcement of our development programme, estimated at 1980 prices to cost approximately in 1980, £120m; 1981, £246m; 1982, £219m; 1983, £150m; and in 1984, £145m.  The total cost is £880 million in 1980 costs.  We are now coming towards the end of the first year of that programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> Since taking office, I have not made any secret of the fact that the telecommunications services require substantial improvement if they are to make the maximum possible contribution to our economic and social development.  At the same time, I hope Deputies will accept that the magnitude of the task is such that it is impossible to transform the service in even two or three years by adopting a crash programme.  The Posts and Telegraphs Review Group who examined the matter gave their estimate of the time needed as at least five years, which accords also with the Department's assessment.  What we will achieve in the first year of our programme is to begin to lay the foundations from which substantial improvements will flow on a gradual basis over the next four years or so.  There will, for example, be a number of significant developments next year but it will take at least a further four years in all to accomplish the task we have set ourselves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important development in the first year of the programme was the decision to order digital equipment which offers many advantages over exchanges of earlier design such as reduced space requirements and lower maintenance costs.  It will also afford us the opportunity to introduce such services as touch dialling and abbreviated dialling.  There will be two suppliers, L.M. Ericsson Limited, Athlone, with whom my Department has had a long and happy association, and Telectron Limited, Tallaght, who will supply exchanges designed by the French firm C.I.T./Alcatel.  These exchanges will have a high local manufacture content.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words now about the various elements in our development strategy.  A prime requirement in the development of the service is the availability of the buildings needed for new telephone exchanges, for staff, for training and for stores.  The programme for the provision of these buildings is now well under way.  For our current accelerated programme over 500 new or extended buildings are needed.  To erect new buildings over 500 new sites were <Col N="535" /> needed; to date 485 sites have been acquired leaving only a small residue still outstanding.  Two hundred and twenty three buildings have now been completed or are in course of construction, leaving over 300 to complete the building aspect of the accelerated programme.  To date £8¾ million has been spent or committed on sites and a further £47 million on buildings.  This year alone over £26 million will be spent on sites and buildings.</P>
    <P>Planning work for most of the remaining major buildings in the programme is well advanced and construction work should get under way in the course of the next year.  Just as telecommunications is part of the infrastructure for the economy, so sites and buildings are the infrastructure of the telecommunications service, and must be taken as a first step in raising the quality of the service.  It will be evident from what I have said that this part of the programme is being tackled vigorously.</P>
    <P>Raising the quality of the service for existing subscribers and making it available to those on the waiting list entails in the first instance the provision of sufficient trunk and subscriber exchanges.  Many such projects are already in hand.  Next year, for example, new computer-controlled trunk exchanges will be completed in Dublin, Cork, Mullingar, Kilkenny and Tuam, while digital trunk and subscriber exchanges will be completed at Athlone, Naas, Galway, Bantry, Kells, Donegal, Sligo and Ennis.  The list speaks for itself. Work is either in hand or at an advance planning stage for numerous other projects.</P>
    <P>In addition to exchanges, of course, there must be an adequate trunk circuiting system to carry traffic.  Many major schemes are in progress.  These include a new cross-channel radio link which will come into service shortly in conjunction with the first phase of a major new trunk exchange at Adelaide Road, Dublin. Another is the Dublin-Sligo-Letterkenny radio link which will become operational on a phased basis during the first half of next year.  Trunking schemes due for <Col N="536" /> completion before the end of this year include: Dublin-Wicklow, 960 circuit radio link; Dublin-Arklow, 960 circuit radio link; Dublin-Enniscorthy, 960 circuit radio link, and Wicklow-Arklow, 960 circuit radio link.</P>
    <P>Other schemes either in progress or to be undertaken next year include the upgrading of the Dublin-Navan-Mullingar co-axial cable, and the provision of a new radio link between Dublin and Waterford via the east coast.</P>
    <P>According as these exchange and trunk schemes are completed there will be a progressive improvement in the quality of the trunk service, beginning about the end of this year, and gathering momentum over the course of next year, enabling industry and business to function more effectively.  In order to protect the co-axial cables from damage due to water seepage my Department has commenced a systematic programme of pressurising the existing cabling network.  All cabling to be installed in the future will of course be pressurised.  This programme of pressurisation will make a very significant contribution to the overall quality and reliability of the service and should be completed in two years.</P>
    <P>The second element of the programme requires the conversion to automatic working of the remaining manual exchanges.  There are some 450 of them even though they serve only 10 per cent of subscribers.  Our aim is to have all exchanges converted by 1984.  Here too, the necessary work is well in hand.  Over 300 exchanges are already included in the auto-conversion programme.  For most of the others, sites have been acquired.  Our programme envisages the conversion of a further five exchanges this year.  Next year about 60 exchanges are due for conversion. Some of the major ones include: Ballymote, Bantry, Buncrana, Ceannanus Mor, Donegal, Gort, Manorhamilton, Milford.  The exchanges due for conversion before the end of this year are: Raphoe, Newcastlewest, St. Johnston, Rathkeale, Ballingarry.</P>
    <P>In 1982, over 200 exchanges will get automatic service and, in the following year, about 140 are scheduled for conversion. That will leave a small number <Col N="537" /> to be attended to in 1984.  In the nature of things, some slippage in the dates for conversion of individual exchanges or groups of exchanges to automatic working is inevitable but I am confident that the entire programme can be implemented over the next four years.</P>
    <P>The third element in our programme is the provision of service virtually on demand.  At present, we have a waiting list of over 90,000 while demand is running at a rate of about 65,000 a year and there is every reason to suppose that it will continue to grow.  If we are to eliminate the waiting list, therefore, the connections rate must be stepped up substantially. We have made a good start this year.  Although I cannot say exactly what the final connections figure will be, I can say that it will be a record&mdash;well in excess of anything achieved before.</P>
    <P>My target is up to 60,000 and although we lost ground in August because of an exceptionally high level of faults caused mainly by bad weather conditions and which necessitated the transfer of staff from installations to repairs, I still expect to go very close to achieving the targets for the year.  Many additional exchanges needed to enable service to be provided for applicants are on order and more will be ordered next year.  The local cabling network is also being built up both by Departmental staff, the numbers of whom are being greatly increased, and by contractors.</P>
    <P>Besides the telephone network, of course, we must expand the telex and data services which are of vital importance to the business community.  The telex network in Ireland is already highly developed and we are about tenth place in the world in terms of density of subscribers. The first large, fully computerised telex exchange in Europe was brought into service in 1974 and, to meet demand for the rest of the decade, a third telex exchange will be brought into service early next year.  The initial capacity of the new exchange will double the existing capacity of the telex system.  A new development in the telex service is the provision of electronic teleprinters which are <Col N="538" /> now in widespread use in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The internal telex service is completely automatic and an automatic service is available to 99 foreign destinations.  In the last year, there has been an unprecedented increase in the demand for telex service and, while more telex applicants are being connected than ever before and many hundreds of existing subscribers are changing to electronic teleprinters, there is at present a backlog in meeting demand.  I am glad to say that a special programme to provide the necessary trunk circuits, exchange systems and terminal apparatus to meet this demand is nearing completion.  Our aim is to provide telex service virtually on request by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>The data transmission service has also expanded rapidly this year and it is expected that the number of data terminal devices, or modems as they are called, supplied to subscribers by my Department will total about 1,000 by the end of the year.  A new data centre was opened in Dublin recently, which will enable the growing demand for data lines to be met. In addition, a new data communication network, Euronet, to provide access to computerised information databases in other EEC countries was brought into service this year.  This is a joint venture between the EEC telecommunications administrations and the European Commission and is the first international data network in service in Europe.  Arrangements are in hand to substantially increase the capacity of this network over the next few months and provide a better quality of service to subscribers.  A similar network to provide access to computerised databases on an intercontinental basis is expected to be in service by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I think it will be obvious from what I have said that the development of the telecommunications service is being pressed forward vigorously and will clearly ensure that in a relatively short time development of our economy will not be retarded by shortcomings in these services.  But as this debate is about the Government's economic policies, I would like to say something also about <Col N="539" /> another direct spin-off from the telephone development programme.  I refer here to the additional employment the programme itself generates.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the buildings aspect of the programme.  The buildings currently in progress are, it is estimated, giving direct employment to over 1,450 persons, and it is expected this will grow by 2,000 on the basis of continuation of the present planned level.  This is clearly a substantial injection into the economy. These figures do not take account of the extra employment generated in the industries and businesses servicing the building industry.  Activity on the scale I have outlined represents a significant contribution to the construction industry, which has a low import content.</P>
    <P>So far as employment in the Department is concerned over 850 extra staff have been recruited this year and this is expected to reach at least 1,200 before the end of the year.  I would like to stress that these are extra jobs not the filling of existing vacancies.  It is planned that our intake next year will be of the order of 1,500 and could in practice prove to be more.  All these jobs will be for work directly connected with our development programme.  In addition, as I mentioned earlier, contractors are being employed extensively to supplement the efforts of the Department's own staff on work such as poling, ducting, cabling and exchange installation giving additional employment which is estimated at about 175 this year and 400 next year.</P>
    <P>Again, some £30 million was spent this year on stores and transport required to service the telephone development programme. Well over half of this was spent on Irish manufactured stores, and this clearly contributes in a variety of ways to the economy but particularly in the employment it affords.  In this connection. I also want to mention that my Department is making a determined effort to maximise the contribution of Irish firms to the improvement of the telecommunications services.  To this end we recently staged exhibitions in Dublin and Limerick of components we use and which, we feel, could be made at home. <Col N="540" /> I am happy to say that the initial reaction has been most favourable.  I honestly hope that this exhibition succeeds in arousing the interest of more manufacturers or would-be manufacturers.  There are some who will see in this an opportunity to help expand or diversify their existing businesses.  Others, perhaps, may be inspired to build a business from scratch.  All these can be confident that for the foreseeable future there will be a need for their products and their services. In turn, this leads to the provision of jobs at home, in itself a major consideration in the decision to mount this display and exhibition.  It will also mean that tens of millions of pounds will continue to circulate here which up to now has been spent abroad.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may know already, long-term arrangements have been negotiated for the supply of digital exchanges to be manufactured here.  These arrangements will not only ensure the continuity of employment in these two firms but also, as part of the deal, involve the establishment of other industries giving substantial employment here.  In fact up to 1,000 new jobs will be created.</P>
    <P>It will be evident from what I have said that in committing themselves to the current accelerated telephone development programme, the Government are making an important contribution to mitigating the effects on this country of the present world recession and ensuring that our economy gets the maximum benefit from this programme.</P>
    <P>Turning to the postal service, the other major service run by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, there is clearly not the scope for expansion in this area as in the telecommunications service. Indeed, the main concentration in the postal service must be in providing a service of consistently high standard at economical rates.  The period following the strike last year was a particularly difficult one for the service and for users of it.  As Deputies know, lengthy negotiations on staff claims have led to agreement on new pay scales on the basis that ready co-operation will be extended by the staff in measures aimed at improving productivity and service to the customer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> Discussions with union and staff representatives have already begun and will continue on an extensive scale in a joint endeavour to ensure that the customer who has to foot the bill gets a good service and reasonable value for the money he pays.  I am confident that we will be successful in achieving these ends.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that as well as providing good services now we must also look to the future.  If our costs continue to rise as they have done in recent years the volume of business cannot but be affected.  Faced with the challenges of maintaining high quality services and cost effectiveness, the postal business must clearly adopt a greater orientation towards marketing.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the value of the skilled and dedicated staff in my Department and the unique country network of offices which we have.  I am concerned that these resources should be used to the greatest extent possible to meet public needs.  To this end I have arranged that special attention will be given to the whole process of anticipating customer demands and providing the services which customers require and which will be to the financial benefit of the postal business.</P>
    <P>The aim is to foster greater use of all the services and facilities which the Post Office can offer, whether in terms of carrying letter or parcel mail or of providing services at post office counters.  This may involve the development of new services, and the adoption of more flexible approaches to existing services.  Any possibility that would give a better service to users is not being ruled out.</P>
    <P>The four broad areas under examination are (i) basic postal services; (ii) express collection and delivery service; (iii) financial services and (iv) other agency services.</P>
    <P>One area of my Department's operations which has been growing well in recent years and which offers scope for further expansion is philately.  Irish stamps in recent years have been praised internationally for the high quality of their design and production.  These qualities have no doubt contributed to their appeal to collectors throughout the world with the result that the Department's revenue <Col N="542" /> from philately will be of the order of £1 million this year.  Well over half of this revenue comes from overseas so our stamps are a good source of foreign earnings for the country.  A number of steps have been taken to maximise the return from the Department's philatelic efforts. These include continuing attention to the design and production stages of stamp issues to maintain high standards, extensive publicising of new issues of stamps in international philatelic publications and among philatelic dealers and collectors overseas, and the appointment of three agents in the recent past to promote Irish stamps in the British, European and American markets.  I aim to continue the good work which has been done in this area of philately.</P>
    <P>Good staff relations and a positive attitude towards operational and technological changes will be vital to achievement in the Department and by the various staff organisations to promote these objectives and it is an area to which the Minister of State and myself have devoted considerable personal attention. I think it is true to say that there is still throughout the community as a whole an insufficient appreciation of the futility of confrontation as a means of conducting industrial relations.  There are still those who think that benefits can be won without their being earned or by obstructing rather than promoting technological and other changes.  We must continue to press the point that apparent gains achieved by these means are illusory and counter-productive and have to be paid for by inflation, slower economic growth and higher unemployment.</P>
    <P>So far as the Post Office is concerned, the opportunities for progress and development over the next few years are clear. If they are to be grasped, the Government's commitment must be matched by a similar commitment on the part of management and staff to use the resources provided fully and productively.  The necessary skills and talent are available in the Department to do the job.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed, in my visits to various post office locations throughout the country since I became Minister, by the evident personal desire and enthusiasm <Col N="543" /> of the staff to see the Department develop and progress and so to provide the public with the standard of service to which it is entitled.  These positive attitudes must, in order to be effective, be reflected in a co-operative and flexible spirit towards change and efficiency throughout the organisation.  They will then be translated into real achievement.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Department of Transport and in addressing this House as Minister for Transport.  I am conscious of the key role which the transport industries&mdash;both public and private&mdash;for which I am responsible play in the national economy.  Now that the effects of the world recession are being brought home to all of us in no uncertain terms. I am determined that my Department and the State companies under its aegis should strive to make the maximum possible contribution to our economic development and in this way facilitate and hasten the day when rapid economic growth&mdash;which our country needs so vitally&mdash;can be resumed.  In this context I think it would be useful if I mentioned the principal areas of development coming within my responsibilities so that Deputies can more fully appreciate the Government's purpose.</P>
    <P>As an island nation, adequate air and sea links are essential to us, more particularly as so much of our economic activity is dependent on trade.  The contribution of the national air companies to the economy is impressive.  In 1979-80 the companies' air transportation activities generated revenue of £152 million while the companies' ancillary activities brought in an additional £86 million making a total revenue of £238 million.  Roughly three-quarters of this revenue comes from overseas making the air companies the country's largest single exporting industry and foreign exchange earner.  Last year the companies carried a record 2.5 million passengers and over 64,000 tons of air cargo and provided steady employment for around 6,000 persons.  These few figures illustrate the scale of the companies' operations and their impact in a national context.</P>
    <P>The companies' ancillary activities are <Col N="544" /> mainly in the aviation related area, in hotels, leisure and catering activities and in financial and computer services.  These three sectors now provide a major share of the profits from ancillary operations. A new and important development of these activities is the jet engine maintenance plant, Airmotive, which has been launched at Baldonnel, County Dublin. This project, which requires a total investment of £24 million already employs some 60 people.  That number is expected to rise to 150 by December next and the plant will employ 600 people at full production.  Overall the companies' ancillary activities are proving their worth, in supporting the companies primary transportation activity, creating employment and providing a wider and more diversified base for the airlines' operations and profitability.</P>
    <P>The State airports represent an essential infrastructural element in airline operations and are a major source of economic activity in their own right.  In 1979 the airports generated a total revenue of nearly £40 million and the airport management agency Aer Rianta provided employment for nearly 2,000 people: the airports handled over 4½ million passengers and 63,000 tonnes of freight and mail.  These figures, as well as those I have cited for the airlines, represent the direct and readily-identifiable contribution of the total air transport sector to the national economy.  There are, of course a whole range of indirect benefits which are not so readily quantified and yet have a very real impact.  These would include items such as the heavy promotional expenditure abroad by the national air companies, the contribution to trade, business and tourism generally of the companies' extensive network of air links, the financial, managerial and technical skills built up by the airlines and increasingly recognised in developing countries, for example where we are constantly seeking out new opportunities in the consultancy field.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that air transportation has been the largest single contribution to the growth of international tourism and Ireland is no exception in this respect.  The pleasure travel market <Col N="545" /> is now a vital element for the airlines and this will be clear from the severity of competition between airlines in such areas as fares, especially on the North Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Air transport is a dynamic and rapidly changing business.  It is not without severe problems, including the escalation in the cost of fuel, the massive investment involved in fleet renewal, severe competition, fluctuations in traffic due to cyclical swings in world economic activity and so on.  Our air companies are coping well, however, and I am confident that they will continue to make a major contribution to our national development.  In the context of access transport generally, the Government recognise the importance to the economy of the ports and in conjunction with the harbour authorities is taking steps to ensure that our portal facilities are capable of meeting the demands of seaborne trade and of resumed economic growth.  By the end of 1980, a total of more than £11.6 million will have been spent on the Cork Harbour development scheme of which over £11 million will have been met by Exchequer grant.  The sum of £5.7 million has been provided by the Government for this purpose in 1980. A grant of £1.125 million has also been provided this year by the Government towards the construction by CIE of an additional roll-on-roll-off berth at Rosslare. The availability of the new berth since earlier this year has greatly increased the potential of the harbour and has enabled B + I to introduce the new Rosslare-Pembroke service.  Traffic, both tourist and cargo, has been growing steadily on the continental and cross-channel routes served by this harbour with important beneficial results for the Rosslare area.  This and other investment in portal development and improvement has also contributed significantly to employment in the construction sector. A grant of almost £1 million has been approved for quay reconstruction at Drogheda and the Government have also given a commitment to proposed extension of deepwater facilities at Foynes Harbour to enable the harbour to accommodate prospective new traffic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> I need hardly emphasise the importance to the economy of adequate shipping services.  As an earnest of its commitment to the development of such services the State has provided £10 million in equity most of which has been taken up towards the acquisition by the B + I of an additional car ferry.  The ferry which is at present being built at Verolme Cork Dockyard will be launched in early November and should be in service for the 1981 tourist season.  Similarly, Irish Shipping will be placing an order for a bulk carrier with Verolme in the near future.  Together, these orders will enable the dockyard to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>The Irish shipping industry has, of course, had to contend with the problems arising from worldwide inflation and in particular the continuing escalation of fuel costs, as well as a depressed tourist trade.  Despite these problems, Irish Shipping Ltd. have continued to trade successfully with the help of their ancillary commercial activities which provide additional sources of revenue to compensate for the slumps which are endemic in the shipping industry.  B + I have turned in a loss after depreciation, interest and all other charges of £1.1 million in 1979 and a loss of £3 million is likely for 1980. The difficulties occasioned by the postal strike and petrol shortage contributed to the loss in 1979.  The situation in 1980 is attributed to industrial action at Liverpool which cost the company £1 million, the disappointing tourist season and the unremunerative level of rates and fares due to the high level of competition on cross-channel routes.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised, however, that the B + I Company and Irish Shipping's subsidiary&mdash;Irish Continental Line&mdash; have a very important role in the promotion of Irish tourism which would be difficult to quantify in money terms.  Both companies have made a significant investment in shipping infrastructure and are very well equipped with modern fleets and ready to take optimum advantage of improved circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the face of the same adverse situation the private sector of the Irish merchant fleet has continued to operate valuable regular cargo services and coastal <Col N="547" /> and short-sea voyages at highly competitive rates.  The fact that the fleet can, though with difficulty, maintain itself against all competition&mdash;shipping is virtually unique in that it enjoys no form of protection against outside interests &mdash;speaks well for its efficiency.</P>
    <P>Whilst on maritime matters.  I should mention that plans are well advanced for the provision around our coasts of a maritime VHF pilot scheme to improve maritime communications.  The initial scheme will consist of up to four remote VHF transmitting and receiving stations controlled from two centres, that is to say, Malin Head and Valentia Coast radio stations.  Tenders have been invited for the supply of the equipment for these stations.  In the case of Malin Head one remote station will be located close by within 8 km of the station with the other to be sited south of Malin Head on the west coast.</P>
    <P>The maritime VHF network will make it possible for ships, fishing vessels and pleasure craft to communicate with the coast station through that medium and it will also provide increased capacity by extending the link call facility from the public telephone system to this network.</P>
    <P>The Transport Consultative Commission which earlier looked at the question of passenger transport services in Dublin, a subject I will return to later, are now studying the adequacy, cost and efficiency of the services provided for domestic and international road haulage. I expect the commission to finalise their report in the new year and I am hopeful that the report will represent a major contribution to the continued growth of an efficient transport industry geared to the needs of the eighties.</P>
    <P>I am confident that there is much scope for increased efficiency in this sector and I am heartened by experience in the international road haulage sector.  The development of roll-on/roll-off ferries to the United Kingdom and the Continent, combined with our membership of the European Community, has led to the creation of this entirely new industry which did not exist ten years ago.  It is estimated that employment in the industry at the <Col N="548" /> end of 1979 was over 1,000 and growing at a rate of 20 per cent per annum.  There are excellent prospects for maintaining this rate of growth as Irish hauliers make inroads into the dry freight business from which many of the specialist international hauliers were excluded prior to the 1978 Road Transport Act.  The liberalisation measures in that Act have been of very significant benefit to our international haulage industry in facilitating diversification from carrying refrigerated goods only to carrying dry freight, which is a substantial growth area.</P>
    <P>I am promoting the growth of the international haulage industry by the negotiation of bilateral agreements with various European countries to facilitate Irish hauliers' operations to those countries. Four such agreements are in operation and I expect that several others will be concluded in the coming months.  It is also my policy in the EEC and the European Conference of Ministers of Transport to press for much greater facilitation of international multilateral transport.</P>
    <P>At present we hold 76 EEC multilateral authorisations and in accordance with a recent EEC decision I have arranged for a number of these to be converted into short-term authorisations, each valid for a period of 30 days.  This will enable more use to be made of the multilateral authorisations and will also give me the opportunity of giving authorisation to a greater number of Irish hauliers. We also hold 16 ECMT multilateral licences and this figure is being increased to 22 from January next year.</P>
    <P>Deputies, I am sure, are keenly aware of our notorious traffic problems which represent an unpleasant side-effect of the country's prosperity.  Traffic congestion in our cities and towns results in the waste of economic resources at a time when our economy can ill afford it.  The problem is at its worst in Dublin and I am taking steps to tackle it there.  Although these steps may not be entirely appropriate or necessary elsewhere, they indicate the general principles on which the problems can be tackled in other cities.</P>
    <P>The programme of action I am pursuing in Dublin has been derived from the Report of the Transport Consultative <Col N="549" /> Commission on Passenger Transport Services in the Dublin area.  Arising from that report, the Government decided to establish a Dublin Transportation Authority.  I have set up a task force to implement this decision.  The task force are representative of the Government Departments directly concerned, the city and county manager and the Garda Commissioner. Pending the establishment of the new Authority, the task force have also been given responsibility for traffic management and for the further evaluation of road and rail investment plans for the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The new Authority will have the overall functions of ensuring the integrated planning and operation of transportation in the Dublin area.  The chief feature of the new structure will be a single plan for roads, public transport and traffic law enforcement and a single body responsible for co-ordinating the management of traffic in the area.  Using the commission's recommendations as a starting point, the task force are pressing ahead with development of the necessary proposals.  I indicated in April last that I planned to have the necessary legislation enacted within about 18 months.  That is the time-table to which the task force are working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the traffic management field, the task force and their technical working arm, known as the operations group of the task force, are implementing a strategy designed to reduce traffic congestion, particularly at peak hours, by a transfer of commuters from cars to buses.  This is in line with the report of the commission.  The first concern has been to improve the level of enforcement of parking regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with a recommendation of the task force the number of traffic wardens is being increased from the present level of 60 part-time staff to the equivalent, between full-time and part-time staff of 100 full-time staff.  Recruitment of extra wardens is taking place at present and I expect that they will be on duty within the next month or so.  Additional <Col N="550" /> Garda motor-cyclists are also being assigned to traffic duty.</P>
    <P>The task force are also making progress with regard to improving public transport.  I have accepted recommendations by the task force in relation to the introduction of bus priority measures. These measures will be introduced on the main arterial routes between the city centre and the suburbs of Rathmines, Terenure, Blackrock, Whitehall and Artane.  The measures will be introduced on a phased basis next year, starting in the spring.  Bus priority measures will follow later on the remaining main routes.  It is desirable that bus priority measures dovetail with the introduction of new buses in Dublin.  CIE, who are represented on the operations group, plan to introduce more than 500 new buses in Dublin in 1981-1983, about 200 of which will be introduced during 1981. I will return to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>It is in all our interests that the traffic problem in Dublin be tackled.  I believe that the programme I have outlined offers the best hope of tackling the problem effectively.</P>
    <P>Any discussion of transport matters or transport policy inevitably focuses attention on CIE.  The usual highlight of such attention is, of course, the huge and growing annual subsidy which the Exchequer provides for the continued provision of CIE road and rail services. The continuing substantial increases in the CIE subvention are viewed with the utmost seriousness by the Government. As Deputies will be aware, the very sharp decline in the CIE financial position in 1979 resulted in the appointment of the international consultants, McKinsey and Company, to make a study of CIE's financial position with a view to determining such corrective measures as might be possible to bring about an improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>The consultants are at present in the final stages of completing their report and Deputies may be fully assured that the report and recommendations will receive urgent consideration by the Government. Despite recent premature publicity I can assure Deputies that there is no preconceived idea on the Government's <Col N="551" /> part in relation to closure of rail lines. The McKinsey report, together with other recent reports on transport matters, notably those of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, the NESC report on transport policy and the report of the Transport Consultative Commission on passenger transport services in the Dublin area will ensure that the Government will be fully alert to the complex issues which must guide policy-making in these areas.  The McKinsey study includes an analysis of the underlying financial and operational characteristics of each sector of CIE services, covering passenger and freight services by road and rail, as well as the social and other non-financial benefits and costs of major services.</P>

      <P>: Soya bean oil is being experimentally mixed with diesel oil in the USA, but not, so far as is known, on a proven commercial scale.  It is likely that competing uses for soya bean oil would make it uneconomic as a fuel extender.</P>
      <P>The most likely sources of oil from crops grown in Ireland are from oil-seed rape or flax.  However, oils from these sources have other uses, for example linseed oil is used in paints.  Oil-seed rape is used in animal feed and is supported by the common agriculture policy.  The use of these oils as a fuel extender would not be economic at present price levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Ireland is a signatory, through the ESB, to the Implementing Agreement on Wave Energy of the International Energy Agency.  Within this agreement practical research is being carried out in Japan and the results made available to Ireland.  In this way Ireland can participate in, and reap the benefits of, costly research.  While the Japanese project has produced a working prototype of 1 MW, it is generally felt that truly commercial machines will not be available for a decade or so.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the possibility of using wave machines in Ireland a measuring buoy will be located at the Porcupine Bank early next summer.  As well as data on wave characteristics, the buoy will measure meteorological data and oceanographic data, which will be of value in relation to offshore exploration, weather forecasting and fishing operations.</P>
      <P>A wave tank is available in UCC for studies on wave machines.  Some fundamental research is in progress in UCC and also in UCG and NIHE (Limerick) on the characteristics of waves and machines.</P>
      <P>The ESB have installed eight solar energy domestic water heaters in private houses in the Dublin area and these are being closely monitored.  In addition the ESB will shortly be installing solar collectors for a swimming pool and this installation will also be monitored.  The ESB have agreed to fund part of the cost of a photo-voltaic assembly to be built in UCC.  This will provide a maximum of 50 kw of electricity.</P>
      <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are participating in the EEC Solar Energy Research Programme on two projects.  The first project involves the construction and operation of a solar pilot test facility, which includes two full-scale complete solar house-heating systems and one domestic hot water system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will make a statement, giving if possible an interim indication, of the results of the research so far conducted in this country on the possibilities of generating significant quantities of electricity by wind-power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>At the end of last March after some consideration of the state of technology and the possibilities that existed I asked the NBST to prepare possible outline demonstration projects to harness wind energy.  I identified four projects types:</P>
      <P>(1)  a coastal-mountain project,</P>
      <P>(2)  a midland location project,</P>
      <P>(3)  an island project and</P>
      <P>(4)  a wind energy machine linked to an agricultural co-operative or small rural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> I have received from the NBST a proposal which indicates as far as possible with regard to each project, the appropriate technology, the likely agency of implementation, the estimated budget and the time frame within which the various projects can be launched.  The ESB will shortly place orders for three wind generators and An Foras Talúntais has erected a machine at their station in Kinsealy. A firm of consulting engineers have been engaged by my Department to select and install a machine on Inis Oirr to supplement the diesel generated electrical supply on that island.  Work is well advanced to select the sites and types of wind generators necessary for the other demonstration projects.</P>
    <P>These projects are only part of a broader programme which I am preparing aimed at assessing the potential contribution of wind energy.  I have recently appointed a steering committee which has the help of a full time technical officer to develop the national wind-power programme, initiate the demonstration projects already announced and to establish contacts with agencies and companies at home and abroad who can assist us in the wind-power programme.  I am anxious to ensure that in the event of the success of the pilot or demonstration programme possibilities for the industrial manufacture of wind machines in Ireland will be pursued.</P>
    <P>A study was completed in 1979 by a group from Trinity College on the potential of wind-power for large scale electricity generation.  The study concluded that several hundred megawatts of capacity could be added to the national grid without a need for storage.  Of course the large scale wind generators required are still being developed and are not yet commercially proven.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the investigations that have been going on in recent times has any specific cognisance been taken or has there been any examination of the fact that Denmark are already operating machines of a large nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy can rest assured that any information on work in <Col N="555" /> European countries has been made available to our people and has been taken into account.  He will appreciate that conditions are somewhat different in Ireland, particularly on the west coast, from what would normally be encountered in Denmark. The technical problems that would have to be dealt with are somewhat different. In so far as the design work and so on done in Denmark can be of assistance to us it is being taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister refute the suggestion that people engaged on his behalf and on behalf of State agencies in investigating wind machines, of which the most advanced are in Denmark, have been denied the necessary small amount of finance required to enable them to go there and do an in-depth study?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not aware of such an allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the light of the extreme urgency of our energy situation and the increasing burden which oil imports are placing on our tottering economy would the Minister not agree that there is a slight suggestion of a snail's pace about the wind programme?  I know the Minister's heart is in the right place but it is about seven months since he first said anything about Inis Oirr.  It is only now that arrangements are being made to buy land on which to site this plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy's understanding of that is not correct.  I agree that anything that can be done to speed up this programme should be done.  I hope that I communicated to those concerned, if they did not have it already, a sense of urgency about this task.  On the other hand, it would be unrealistic not to recognise, firstly, that a good deal of work in that area is and must be experimental, because the whole technology is relatively new.  People may say that we have had windmills for hundreds of years but we have not had for hundreds of years windmills generating electricity.  A good deal of new technology is being applied to this in various parts of the world but <Col N="556" /> conditions obtaining in this country are different from those in other parts of the world where this sort of work is done. Generator designs used successfully in other parts of the world have resulted when used around our coast in wind-generators being damaged seriously by the wind.  They were not geared to our conditions. It is important that any work we do on this takes account of our own conditions and does not result in collapse of the whole operation.  Therefore, it is necessary to spend some time testing and measuring wind velocities and gusts and trying to ensure that the design applied is suitable to the conditions encountered off our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not entirely happy with the reply but I cannot think of another question to ask the Minister arising out of it.  Yes, I have another question.  Has he in his wind programme any element of multiplying wind generators and wind intermittency?  If the wind would not be in one place there is a good chance it still may be blowing in another, so that his wind programme could be spread around the country so as to take advantage of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is being taken into consideration and, the Deputy is right, really it has to be taken into consideration. It is one of the purposes of measuring the velocities and gusts which are encountered at different times of the year.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy whether he or the ESB has under consideration the negotiation of an agreement or agreements with a coal-exporting country or countries to maintain long-term supplies to this country at a pre-determined price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: In so far as current requirements of coal are concerned the actual negotiation of agreements with coal suppliers in exporting countries has traditionally been a matter for the Irish coal importers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> With regard to the ESB, the board have issued an inquiry for coal supplies for Moneypoint generating station to major, coal producing countries and suppliers. The replies to this inquiry are being evaluated at the moment but no decisions will be taken for some time.</P>
    <P>I have been considering how best the procurement arrangements for coal could be co-ordinated or centralised on a national basis in the light of the much greater overall demand for coal imports which will arise when, in due course, substantial requirements of the ESB and large industrial users have to be met in addition to traditional demand.  I have not, however, reached any conclusions on this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that there is roughly a similar case to be made in regard to effective management of the coal market as there is to be made in relation to oil purchases?  Would he look favourably at the course which might follow, that we would have a national coal-buying agency analogous to the petroleum corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is possible that my conclusions on that question would embrace that kind of proposition.  As I have indicated, I have been considering a procurement arrangement so that the buying could be co-ordinated on a centralised or national basis.  The Deputy will appreciate that even in the case of the National Petroleum Corporation they are dealing with only a certain percentage of the market and that that corporation was set up in response to a movement which has taken place through our oil producers favouring a Government to Government contract.  Such a movement is not terribly obvious in the coal business over the years at least in dealing with, say, communist countries.  While I am trying to co-ordinate the coal-buying arrangement on a national basis and we might end up with something like the INPC, I would not like to indicate at this stage that that was the best solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree that the pattern has not worked out comparable with the way <Col N="558" /> it has worked in the oil market, but it would be a great advantage to us perhaps in regard to a friendly country with large coal resources, such as India with which we have trade links, in trying to negotiate long-term contracts with selling rights so that whatever happens will reflect on the oil market for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It would not be realistic to think that it was open to us to negotiate a contract for the purchase of coal from any country in which there would be a fixed price for a very long period.  No information available to me suggests that that is a real possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am asking the Minister whether we are importing any large quantities of coal from America.  Is he aware that there are available on a long-term basis very large quantities of coal, provided those can be contracted for by either a Government or a Government agency, which are perhaps much more attractive than what we are importing at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy whether, in view of the likelihood that greatly expanded coal imports will be implied by the postponement of nuclear development, he considers that existing facilities for landing, storing and transporting large quantities of coal are adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The existing facilities, together with facilities now being provided or in contemplation, for landing, storing and transporting coal for use in this country are regarded as adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister saying that facilities&mdash;for example, in Dublin port&mdash;for a coal import figure of several times what it is now are adequate and facilities for transporting it include railway rolling stock?  What other forms of transport will be employed?  Have CIE, if called on, enough rolling stock to transport five times the amount of coal we now transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will appreciate that CIE will not be asked to transport five times the present amount with the present rolling stock.  The projects ahead will include not only a project of an increase in the import of coal but also a project of change and improvements and expansion in the facilities for landing, storing and transportation of coal.  The inquiries which my Department have made from various sources indicate that, leaving aside the ESB and another large industrial user who will almost certainly provide their own facilities, the expected facilities for landing, storing and transportation will be adequate to keep pace with the expected growth in imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Are there people in a definable section in the Minister's Department who have the specific responsibility of keeping an eye on this question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Could the Minister define what is meant by the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;? The question itself could be deemed to be unclear.  Would the Minister have a <Col N="560" /> more detailed study carried out of the implications of transporting through the port of Dublin and the surroundings the increased quantities of coal to which he referred?  Perhaps he would give the House details of such a study.  The question which the Minister answered is not sufficient to satisfy the concern of myself and Deputy Kelly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I must make two points in response to that.  Firstly, the question of transport facilities generally is one for the Minister for Transport rather than the Minister for Energy.  Secondly, it would be a mistake to assume when talking about increased imports and facilities that we are speaking solely of the port of Dublin.  We are talking of other ports as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: Regarding imports of American coal which we are obtaining at lower prices than coal from elsewhere, has the Minister had any studies carried out of facilities on the north and northwest coast which would seem to be obvious landing points, rather than all coal going to Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy whether any British exploration for off-shore oil is taking place or has taken place in the area of sea disputed between Ireland and Britain arising out of the Rockall Plateau issue; and, if so, if he will give details of each such exploration including the names of the exploring companies and the basis on which they are carrying out their explorations in that part of the disputed area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my written reply to a similar question from <Col N="561" /> Deputy O'Keeffe on 26 June 1980, it had come to my attention earlier this year that a British oil company intended to carry out seismic work in certain blocks off the north west, parts of which are claimed by both this country and by Britain. I indicated that my Department had written formally to the company in May of this year pointing out that parts of the blocks in question were claimed and designated by this country and that no company had the right to carry out exploration work in our designated area without first obtaining a licence from my Department to do so.  In July the company informed my Department that they would not be going ahead with the seismic programme planned for this year.</P>

At that time the party quoted the cost of a smelter at between £30 and £40 million and it is now put at about £150 million and rising.  If a smelter is to be erected, particularly by the State, the sooner the better this is done, or is the Minister saying that a smelter will not be erected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if, in order to clarify the public mind regarding uranium mining and exploration, he will arrange for such exploration to cease until such time as he, on behalf of the Government, can authoritatively state that such mining and exploration are not unsafe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I informed Deputies White and Harte in replies to questions earlier this year, the Nuclear Energy Board have advised me that there is no evidence that prospecting operations associated with exploration for uranium lead to any radiation hazard.  Nevertheless, so as to provide further reassurance at local level, the board initiated a programme of radioactivity measurements on water samples from certain areas in which uranium prospecting operations are in progress; they have also carried out some studies on air and rock samples. Final results of analysis of samples taken <Col N="565" /> from the scene of uranium exploration, in County Donegal, confirm the board's advice.</P>
      <P>Studies of areas in other parts of the country are not yet completed.  However, I have no reason to expect that the results from these areas will lead to a different conclusion.</P>
      <P>A uranium deposit of economic size and grade yet remains to be discovered in Ireland, so the question of mining uranium does not arise, at the present time. However, if at some future date such an economic deposit were to be located, it would be necessary for a prospective mine operator to secure planning permission from the local planning authority, to obtain a mining lease or licence from my Department and to secure a separate licence from the Nuclear Energy Board, before a mine development could take place.  The most stringent conditions would be applied to such an operation, and the appropriate authorities would have to be fully satisfied in regard to the impact of a proposed mining operation on health, safety and the environment.</P>
      <P>In the foregoing circumstances I consider that I would not be justified in requiring the cessation of uranium exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it true that in other parts of the world a moratorium has been placed upon exploration for uranium because it is not yet known that it is safe to continue?  Further, is the Minister satisfied that despite the contradictory statements of the most eminent people, pro and anti, in regard to uranium mining, his board is capable and authoritative enough to make a decision in this offhand manner on something that is absolutely deadly, and one does not take a chance in not waiting to find out if it is dangerous before starting.  I would not want the Minister to think that I am not in favour of the idea of trying these things.  On the other hand, to do something that is not yet proven safe seems to be utter folly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am aware that it has been alleged that in one part of Canada there has been some moratorium placed on <Col N="566" /> uranium exploration.  That is what we are talking about, not uranium mining which does not exist here.  I have also been informed that the reasons for it are not those which have been suggested to Deputy Blaney.  I am also aware that the evidence available from the most eminent scientists from numerous countries around the world, including a number of our partners in the EEC, is that there is no evidence whatever of any risk from uranium exploration.  I am satisfied of the competence of the Nuclear Energy Board.  I am satisfied that they have made the most exhaustive enquiries and that the advice given to me is the only advice on which I can rely and that it would be quite unreasonable of me, in the face of all the evidence available, to refuse to allow uranium exploration to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I sympathise with the Minister's situation.  But would he not agree that, at the very least as a matter of prudence from his own point of view and leaving everything else out of the question, it would be best to meet the misgivings which Deputy Blaney has expressed head on, to go more than half way to meet them and to organise if he can either an inquiry or a public enlightenment programme in which it would be possible for objectors and people who dissent to state their views in order to set these at rest if that can be done?  The Minister ought not to let himself be put in the situation of his predecessor where only after a year-and-a-half of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; did he finally concede an inquiry into the nuclear proposal at Carnsore and then with very bad grace.  The Minister would be wise to avoid such a situation developing in regard to the subject matter of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate the advice of Deputy Kelly but I have gone very far to try to meet these concerns.  Although I was advised as I have indicated to the House, first I have set up a working group of all Departments which might be affected by any of these arrangements such as Agriculture, Environment and so on.  They have visited Donegal; they have met people who are particularly concerned <Col N="567" /> and who are making a lot of complaints; they have discussed the situation with them, listened to their complaints and outlined the situation as they knew it.  In addition the Nuclear Energy Board has, at my prompting, organised tests of water, rocks and soil in the areas where this exploration is taking place and these tests have shown conclusively in the case of Donegal that there is no evidence to support the allegation that there is a risk here and that confirms the information we have got all over the world.  We are also having tests conducted in other parts of the country where uranium exploration is going on and the preliminary results confirm that situation, although we are awaiting the final results.  We have gone very far to meet legitimate concerns.</P>

      <P>: Is there a known anti-nuclear member on the Nuclear Energy Board?  Is the Minister aware that in Australia there is a moratorium on exploration? I appeal again to the Minister to try to do as Deputy Kelly put more explicitly than I did, to show to the public who are <Col N="568" /> worried about this that the Minister's view is correct, if it is so.  Finally, is the Minister not aware that there is a list of the most eminent people with the highest qualifications who say there is danger and they equal in number the people who say there is not?  We cannot be expected to take the chance until it has been shown that it is not unsafe and I do not think that is being unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: There were a number of supplementaries in that and I hope the Deputy will forgive me if I overlook one of them.  First on the question of Australia, to the best of my knowledge&mdash;and I am subject to correction on this&mdash;the only area in which there is a moratorium there is for totally different reasons which have to do with the sacred ground of the Aborigines and has nothing to do with nuclear exploration.  On the question of membership of the Nuclear Energy Board I am not aware whether any member is pro- or anti-nuclear.  I would hope they are objective and independent in their approach.  In regard to the question of the approach that I should take on this matter to allay concern in the area affected I have, I think, replied to that question in response to Deputy Kelly at some length and I do not think I can add anything to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Deputy would allow me finish.  If such a situation should arise the position would be as I have indicated, that in order to operate a mine of that kind the operators would need to have permission from the local authority under the Planning Acts, a licence from the Department of Energy and a licence from the Nuclear Energy Board, which is independent of the Department of Energy. They are the statutory requirements. Whether or not a public inquiry would be necessary would depend on the particular circumstances at the time.  I cannot make a commitment to have one but I am certainly not ruling out the possibility of one.</P>

      <P>: The information referred to in the Deputy's question is not available in the form specified by him.  In order to assemble the information for a full and detailed reply to his question it would be necessary to abstract from, and cross-check with, a number of records including the order schedules prepared at the oil depots and the delivery lists which were compiled by the Defence Forces. These records relate to several hundreds of deliveries of different kinds of oil.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate my reluctance to have the considerable administrative work involved undertaken.  I will consider this if there is no more simple way of dealing with the matter.  I would suggest, however, that the Deputy might let me know now or later whether he has a particular case or a particular aspect of the supply operation in mind and I will endeavour to provide the appropriate information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

For example, just to take the ownership of each of the stations, which is one of the questions asked, it would take quite a bit to correlate that with other information that is available about deliveries.  I cannot believe that the Deputy really wants the information for which he appears to ask. I would find great difficulty in justifying the expenditure of that amount of effort on it.  I am trying to give the Deputy as much information as I can.  If he would indicate to me more precisely his area of concern I will endeavour to give him the information that will enable him to follow that up.</P>

      <P>: I am very much aware that the Karamoja region of north-western Uganda has been particularly badly affected by the prolonged drought conditions in East Africa which have brought famine and disease to large areas of Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan as well as Uganda.  The tragic situation in Karamoja has been exacerbated by the aftereffects of war.</P>
      <P>On the national level, I announced, in an initial action in June a grant of £10,000 for the purchase of an ambulance, with a supply of medicaments, for use as a mobile clinic at Moroto, the administrative capital of Karamoja.  In early September, I announced a further grant of £10,000 for CONCERN towards the cost of the medical team it has sent to the area.</P>
      <P>Assistance from Community resources for Uganda in emergency and exceptional aid totals one million units of account in 1980 so far.  This is in addition to Uganda's normal food aid allocation for 1980 under the Community's Food Aid Programme and to emergency food supplies approved for the East African region in general.</P>
      <P>In addition to these and other governmental offers of assistance, a number of non-governmental organisations are also active in Karamoja in co-operation with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which is co-ordinating the international relief effort.  While reports received suggest that food aid pledges in response to appeals are sufficient to meet immediate needs, the situation remains serious due to poor rains and a small harvest, so that assistance will continue to be necessary into 1981.  Continued assistance in the medical field will also be essential.  It is my intention to keep developments in Uganda under close review in the coming months.</P>

      <P>In my statement during the General Debate at the Thirty-fifth Session of the UN General Assembly on 30 September 1980 I re-affirmed our commitment to progressing towards the 0.7 per cent target for Official Development Assistance (ODA) as rapidly as our resources allow. Between 1977 and 1979, we doubled our allocation for ODA in absolute terms.  I hope that more favourable economic circumstances will allow us to continue to significantly increase our ODA allocations in coming years so as to reach if possible the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP by the end of this decade but we have not given a firm commitment in this regard.  With regard to next year's allocation for ODA, the matter is under consideration at present.</P>

What I have spelled out to the Deputy is the formulation which has been agreed upon by the UN which will form the basis of a programme between donor <Col N="576" /> and recipient countries throughout the next decade.</P>

What has been agreed upon at this special conference&mdash;and it was a tremendous achievement to get this agreement within this meeting&mdash;was that there would be an agreement on all sides, by both donor and recipient countries that the &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; would be used to reach a formulation of achieving a certain percentage by 1980 and that only &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; would be the criterion involved and no other directive or ukase is involved in that.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not believe that it is necessary at this stage for the Government to issue a White Paper on Official Development Assistance (ODA).  The broad outlines of Government policy in relation to ODA have been set out in several statements over the past three years.  These include my statement on the Estimates for my Department in June of this year, as well as the statements of my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs on the Estimates in 1978 and 1979.  The Government's policy on ODA was outlined also in my statement at the inaugural meeting of the new advisory Council on Development Co-operation on 21 March 1980, the text of which was issued as a press release and in the booklet entitled &ldquo;Development Co-operation&mdash;Ireland's Bilateral Programme&rdquo; issued by my Department last year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is satisfied with the high cost of food aid from Ireland having regard to our efficiency as an agricultural producer; and if he has any proposals within the context of the EEC food programme and related national food programmes to improve the delivery of Irish food aid and reduce its cost to the recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The greater part of the food aid given by Ireland for the benefit of developing countries is given in the form of cash payments, to the World Food Programme (as a voluntary contribution to that body or to meet our obligations under the Food Aid Convention), and to the European Community budget in respect of Ireland's share of the food aid programmes of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> In the case of our voluntary contribution to the World Food Programme, for which £650,000 has been budgeted in 1980, two-thirds is given in the form of food (in 1980 skim-milk powder).</P>
    <P>I am aware that suggestions have been made that if, instead of receiving food aid in kind, either directly from Ireland or from the European Community, recipients were to be given the value of such aid in cash, they could buy considerably more food.  The Deputy will appreciate that neither the constant availability nor cost of food products on the world market can be guaranteed.  Consequently the supply of a certain quantity of food aid in kind is necessary.  Given the continuing need of many developing countries for guaranteed supplies of food aid I am not satisfied that advantage would accrue from making our contribution to the World Food Programme entirely in cash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will be aware that details of the annual allocation for Official Development Assistance (ODA) are provided in a press release issued each year by my Department when Estimates for the year in question have been decided.  Information on ODA expenditure has not hitherto been made regularly available in a similar way, although this information is obtainable from a number of official sources.  I can agree, therefore, with the suggestion that the break-down of expenditure on ODA should be available in one source and I would propose to do this by placing in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas each year a statement showing overall expenditure on ODA in the previous year and a break-down of the total out-turn under the various sub-heads.  I cannot say when this could be done each year, as the final definitive figure of expenditure on <Col N="581" /> one or two items in the multilateral area is usually not available for several months.  I would expect, however, to be in a position to give the final out-turn on all items of expenditure as a rule before the summer Recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The objective of the bilateral aid programme is to channel resources in the most effective way possible to the poorer countries of the developing world and the poorer populations in them.  Our approach has been to try to identify with the priority countries potential areas of co-operation.  We have been concerned that the projects which are developed are seriously needed by these countries and are regarded as priorities by them.  At this stage of our involvement it would seem to be preferable to allocate all available resources to improving the effectiveness of these aid projects in which we are involved rather than to examining the spin-off benefits to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contacts established with developing countries through the Official Development Assistance Programme can result in <Col N="582" /> certain commercial advantages and opportunities.  However, it would be very difficult to identify precisely the benefits which accrue from development work undertaken by an Irish body since in many cases projects are parts of larger schemes undertaken or financed by other donor countries or agencies.</P>
    <P>An assessment of the nature suggested by the Deputy's two questions would be extremely complex and time-consuming. Moreover, it would be impossible to ensure that it was comprehensive.  I would refer the Deputy also to information given in reply to Question No. 432 on 20 February 1980 with regard to payments to Irish bodies involved in projects under the bilateral aid programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: In relation to Question No. 22, is any assessment being made either by the Department or by any of the voluntary agencies, or will the Minister facilitate such a process?  Will the Minister also accept in principle that once a measure of this return benefit of the development aid programme to Ireland has been assessed, it should be discounted from the total aid given in the first place when we are measuring how much aid we are actually giving to the Third World countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Minister agree that, if we stand up and make an attempt to meet our commitments to the Third World and offer aid the bulk of which in reality benefits us, we are not in reality helping the Third World countries at all and that we should at least discount a substantial if not a 100 per cent portion of it and increase it accordingly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: It does not work out that way.  We have tried to identify priority areas in the recipient countries where we can help in co-operation.  We do not apply the commercial type criteria that the Deputy mentions.  Inevitably there is some spin-off benefit but we do not look at the programme in that way.<Col N="583" /></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Since we do not know the extent to which we are benefiting from the bilateral aid programme will the Minister initiate a process to get a measure of the benefit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is better to approach this matter in a pragmatic way on the ground after discussion with the recipient countries and to decide on the best way in which we can help.  Sometimes there is a spin-off benefit and sometimes not, but our main criteria in assessing the project is how best we can help within the resources available.</P>

      <P>: Is the Minister aware that an estimate has been made of the extent to which this aid benefits us and, while accepting that the primary motivation in the bulk of our aid is not that it should produce returns to this country, the fact remains that a great part of it does and that, in determining how much aid we should give, an account should be taken of the fact that the net cost to this country is so very small in view of the return we receive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The question appears to relate to newspaper reports of a further meeting to be held as a follow-up to meetings already held by members of the two representative associations in connection with events surrounding the charging of a man in connection with the death of Detective Garda Quaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy must be aware that the matters said to have been discussed at these meetings concern issues that for a number of reasons cannot properly be the subject of comment by me, reasons which include the fact the the issues relate <Col N="587" /> to matters that are either <i>sub judice</i> or are, to my knowledge, almost certain to become so very shortly, or else are so closely bound up with matters that are <i>sub judice</i> that any public comment would clearly be inappropriate.  It is well to remember that a man stands charged with capital murder.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the issue of matters being, or being about to become, <i>sub judice</i>, I wish to make it quite clear that neither I, as Minister for Justice nor any other member of the Government, has or has had any involvement in the matters to which the question apparently relates.</P>
    <P>The investigation of an individual crime and actions or arrangements related or incidental to such investigation are matters for the Garda Síochána.  I am not consulted about them nor do I seek to intervene.</P>
    <P>Directions as to what charges should or should not be brought and as to the court in which particular charges should be brought are matters for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Again, I have no function in any such matter and the Director of Public Prosecutions' directions are communicated either direct to the Garda or, in some cases, through the Chief State Solicitor's office.  They are not communicated through me or through my Department and any knowledge I might receive of any such directions in a particular case comes only after the event.</P>
    <P>I therefore cannot undertake to make, nor has it ever been the practice of Ministers for Justice to make, any statement about incidents such as those with which the question is apparently concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Recognising the limitations imposed on the Minister by the fact that the matter which is to be discussed at this meeting and has been discussed at other meetings is in part <i>sub judice</i> or might in other respects become <i>sub judice</i>, does the Minister agree that there is grave disquiet amongst the Garda Síochána in relation to the manner in which this matter has been handled and the way in which its handling has been <Col N="588" /> represented to the public at the expense of the Garda Síochána?  In the interest of the morale of the Force it is important that the reasons for the course of action pursued be explained to those concerned so that the confusion which at present exists and which is having a dangerous effect on the morale of the Force can be dispelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister is aware, as I have already said, that it has never been the practice for the Minister for Justice to make statements about incidents of the type we are talking about or anything related to them and more so on this occasion.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that it has been stated in open court, and reported in newspapers, that certain instructions given by the Director of Public Prosecutions, instructions that necessarily were given orally because of time pressures, were, as a result of a misunderstanding, not acted upon.  As a result it was legally necessary for certain remedial action to be taken.  It is not for me to comment in this House as to where, if anywhere, any blame lies in this matter. It is clear to me that we cannot in this House conduct an inquisition as to who said what to whom nor should we attempt to do so.  I understand that there are differences of opinion between those directly concerned on that score.  Indeed, the Government of which Deputy FitzGerald was a member regarded it as necessary to make it clear that the Executive should be clearly seen not to be in any way involved in prosecutions when they set up the office of Director of Public Prosecutions.  Similarly, the Minister for Justice does not have any involvement on the Garda side in relation to criminal charges.  It is inconsistent to seek to get me to become involved when on other occasions if I were involved I would be accused of intervening in such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: My concern is to minimise difficulties that at present exist.  I do not wish to press the Minister to say more than he has said in this House but I urge upon him that a serious problem now exists because, amongst other things, of resentment in the Garda <Col N="589" /> Síochána against this very allegation of failure to carry out instructions.  It is that resentment, and that allegation made in court, which is causing part of the present trouble.  In the interests of the morale of the Force would the Minister consider taking some action to clarify the position with the Garda Síochána concerned, not necessarily here, and to ensure that resentment against this allegation does not lead them to pursue a course of action which is not in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I readily appreciate and understand the type of reaction that arose amongst the Garda as a result of the court proceedings on Saturday morning last.  I understand that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána has had discussions with representatives of the Garda associations involved.  I would assume that the Garda Commissioner would have been able to explain to the association the position as far as he was concerned.  With regard to who said what and to whom and who was right or who was wrong or who misunderstood the direction given by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the telephone to the Commissioner, or those representing him, the Deputy will readily appreciate that I cannot get involved in that as of now.  The Deputy is also aware that the proceedings on Saturday, I am fairly certain, will be the subject of further legal proceedings.  For that reason I would not like to go any further than I have gone now.  I appreciate that what happened led to grave disquiet not alone amongst the Force but amongst the community at large.  I can assure the Deputy that the happenings of last week were of such grave concern to the entire community that everybody was anxious to see that a slip up was not made in any way.  I had better leave the matter at that at this stage because we might be on ground to cause serious problems and may interfere with court proceedings at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Before Question Time I was giving the House a comprehensive account of the developments that are taking place in my Departments, developments which are making a significant contribution towards the economic development of our country.  I was dealing with McKinsey study of the CIE operation.  I should like to state that that study also included an analysis of the underlying financial and operational <Col N="638" /> characteristics of each sector of CIE services covering passenger and freight services by road and rail as well as the social and other non-financial benefits and cost of major services.  Before I conclude my remarks in relation to the McKinsey study I should mention that it has been recognised since as far back as 1964 in this country that a continuing subsidy would be necessary to meet the costs associated with the operation and maintenance at satisfactory levels of the rail network.  The Government in their determination of future rail policy will of course be alert to the fact that operating costs in the case of many services will far outstrip the financial return from the provision of such services.  It will be the Government's responsibility to ensure that an even balance is struck between the needs for such services and the costs of providing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to more immediate matters, Deputies will be aware that work is now well under way on the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban railway line.  This modernisation of the service takes account of the large increase in passenger numbers using the suburban rail services.  In 1970 the daily number of carryings on the service was 12,600 and this has now grown to an estimated 35,700 daily carryings in 1980.  CIE expect that the project, which will cost an estimated £57 million at 1980 prices, will be completed by 1983.  The electrification of the Howth-Bray service includes, of course, the introduction of modern rolling stock which will be capable of rapid acceleration and deceleration.  The new carriages will be used in train sets of two, four or six carriages as demand requires. The signalling system is also being replaced which will eliminate some of the delays which beset the existing services. New stations will be opened on the line in order to cater for the anticipated increase in daily carryings which CIE expect will reach approximately 80,000 in 1985.  At the present time over 130 people are employed on the project by CIE.  The number employed is expected to reach a peak of 280 in the next two years.  The disruptions to services which are being experienced at the present time are a result <Col N="639" /> of the work in progress and are very much regretted.  I can assure the Deputies that everything possible is done to alleviate the inconvenience to travellers.  Unfortunately, a project of this magnitude, involving as it does complex and protracted working on what are probably the busiest railway lines in the country, must give rise to disruptions in services.</P>
    <P>To encourage greater use of the bus services, as recommended by the Transport Consultative Commission in their report on passenger transport in Dublin, a substantial improvement in the standard of the existing bus fleet will be necessary. For some time past now CIE have had considerable difficulties with their bus fleet.  The present Atlantean bus which comprises the major proportion of CIE's double decker fleet has given rise to operating and maintenance problems. CIE's future bus requirements will now be provided from the Bombardier bus building factory at Shannon.  The factory is operated under a management contract agreement with CIE whereby the factory premises are leased by CIE who also own the manufacturing and other ancillary equipment.  Therefore if the agreement were to be terminated.  CIE would be able to operate the factory on their own account.</P>
    <P>Production started at the factory on 1 August 1980 and delivery of the first bus is due on 10 November.  The production plans are for the manufacture of 50 single-deck buses initially, followed by double-deck buses for Dublin city.  Delivery of the first double-deck buses in Dublin is expected to commence in March 1981 and CIE expect to take delivery of about 200 double-deck buses in 1981.  Particular attention has been paid to the design of the buses to ensure that there will be no recurrence of the maintenance difficulties which the company experience with their present fleet.  Before concluding I should like to ask the Opposition to avail of the opportunity of this debate to spell out to me and the Government any or all of the projects to which I have referred today which they believe should be scrapped or put on the shelf.  This is what talk of cut-backs really means.  If some of <Col N="640" /> the projects to which I have referred should not be proceeded with now is the time to say so.  I think that from what I have said Deputies will recognise my commitment to use all my influence as Minister for Transport and as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to assist the Government in their singleminded determination to mitigate the effects of the present recession.  Ours is a developing economy.  Our young and growing population need jobs.  The future growth of economic activity depends on getting the infrastructure right.  This is the Government's clearly stated objective as enunciated by the Taoiseach yesterday.  This is a time for action not for words.</P>
    <P>I have had to cover a lot of ground because many developments are taking place and many projects are being undertaken for the benefit of the development of this economy.  I believe our economy needs them now.  If the Opposition feel they should be deferred, now is the time to say so.  If we put them back they will cost more in the long term.  If the Opposition feel that real cut-backs should be made in this area they should spell it out here and now.  Action speaks louder than words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: If there were to be a prize in this debate for reading I would give it to the Minister because he read to this Dáil, which is supposed to express the views of Members elected by the people, not his own views but views prepared for him by a battery of civil servants from the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the old Department of Transport. He had not even the wit to conceal this fact because Members were handed&mdash;I suspect the press also&mdash;two scripts separated by two green tags, one prepared by officials in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and one by the old Department of Transport.  If this Parliament becomes so base that it is no more than a record of the writings of civil servants&mdash;not that I regard them as base: there is sample opportunity for civil servants to write and present their views&mdash;it is really showing contempt for this Parliament when Ministers come here, talk at machinegun speed through a brief prepared <Col N="641" /> by others and out of 45 minutes give about two minutes of their own thoughts, not particularly brilliant.</P>
      <P>I have been here since morning and I have heard three Ministers speak from briefs which would not be significantly different no matter what Government were in power.  This Parliament has become under Fianna Fáil a place where Ministers come in to read speeches prepared for them by civil servants throwing in the odd naive comment so that they can give expression to wise views when they speak as civil servants and give expression to political mischief when speaking as politicians.  That is not the Parliament I joined more than 21 years ago.  In my 22nd year in this House I speak with grave feelings of disappointment that this House and democracy are becoming more and more debased in our society so that in a general debate which is supposed to consider fundamental principles we have Ministers here talking about the inadequacy of the telephone service and the size and frequency of buses.  We are supposed to deal here with fundamentals and how our economic and social development has gone wrong as it has gone most seriously wrong since the present Government assumed office. While difficult international developments have added to Ireland's problems as they have added to the problems of every other country in recent years, the current recession in Ireland carries the label &ldquo;Made in Ireland by Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policies of the present Government elected every Deputy on the Government benches.  They are the reason why this country is now in the depths of a depression and cannot get out of it.  The cupboard is bare; the real tragedy is that it was never necessary.  What the Government did over the last three-and-a-half years was as wrong as wrong could be.  I do not speak with hindsight of this sad experience.  In the budget debate of 1978 I said that the policy embarked upon by the Fianna Fáil Government and being continued by them was&mdash;and I quote from my remarks&mdash;&ldquo;as wrong as wrong could be.&rdquo;  I should like to amend a well-known <Col N="642" /> dictum that a prophet is never appreciated in his own land by adding &ldquo;until it is too late&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This nation is now undergoing and will for the next couple of years undergo tribulation, a level of unemployment, a level of price increases, a loss of investment in Ireland that would never have been suffered if the Government had been only half sane since 1977.  It will be recalled that at no time&mdash;most unusually&mdash;during the general election in 1977 was it ever suggested that the country was not economically sound.  The present administration inherited a solvent country with Europe's fastest growth rate, fastest growth in employment, investment and production together with a dramatic decrease in the cost of living and a dedicated and publicly announced and fulfilled programme of reduced Government borrowing&mdash;from 16.2 per cent of gross national product in 1975 to 11.2 per cent in 1976 and down to single figures in 1977, single figures unfortunately boosted by a popularity gimmick by those who succeeded us in June 1977, who threw money away in the autumn of that year which now they would dearly love to have.</P>
    <P>We had improved efficiency in the public service to such an extent that for the first time in 25 years there was an increase in the volume of output from every public sector employee.  Although we increased public services, although we increased the amenities made available to the people by the Government, we stopped the insidious growth in the public service of 6 per cent per annum down to a mere 1 per cent, and that 1 per cent included increases in the number of teachers and gardaí, the number of teachers to deal with our growing young population and the number of gardaí to deal with security problems which had been neglected by our predecessors.  Notwithstanding that, we achieved a great economic miracle.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that in 1977 not even our bitterest opponents, and they were not all in the Fianna Fáil Party but they were supporting them, would suggest <Col N="643" /> that the economy was not sound. Today they all know that the economy is direly sick.  That might not be a terrible tragedy were it not reflected in the misery of the unemployed, of the neglected people who are well below the level of what is necessary to attain a decent living standard.  Unfortunately Fianna Fáil know that the people who are most deprived are not the most critical and are not in a position to organise themselves to deal political blows against the popularity of the Government.</P>
    <P>The only criticism offered against us was that when things were sound we were not moving fast enough.  The Cosgrave Government rightly maintained that our policies would have sustained increased employment without extra taxation or unsound borrowing.  I will quote my own words:</P>
    <P>To push the economy faster would only bring an explosion of inflation, ruinous wage expectation, a deficit in the balance of payments, unwise growth in Government borrowing and taxation and restore the flabbiness in the public sector which we have greatly cradicated.</P>
    <P>I am too long in the political tooth to take joy from being proved right, but all of those dismal forecasts that I made if the Government embarked on their spending spree have come true and would have come true irrespective of the so-called oil crisis of 1979-80 which.  I hasten to point out, in price terms is only a quarter of what we, without any previous experience, had to deal with in 1974-75.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Leave aside matters of political consideration and of personal frustration, in the mid-1970s many people made sacrifices here because they were led by a Government who were able to prove to them that sacrifices were necessary, and they made them.  The trade unions and those they represented understood the problems and were prepared to forego what they would have expected as their rightful reward if times were better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> Why has the belligerance of the trade unions exploded in the last couple of years?  It is because we are now ruled by a Government who threw aside the efforts of the National Coalition to achieve equity in taxation, equity in contributions, even treatment.</P>
    <P>The loudest clap I have heard in this House was delivered when it was announced that wealth tax was being abolished, the most benign wealth tax in the world which barely scraped at the surface of the wealth held in this country, and the justification was &ldquo;Abolish it and you will increase investment&rdquo;.  Investment now is lower than in 1975-76.  It is at its lowest level for years.  A spurious campaign was carried on against our efforts to get equity into the Irish political, social and taxation systems, all in the name of encouraging investment which has not come and will not come either from Ireland or from abroad.  Investment from both areas has fallen off.  One thing to be said in favour of wealth tax is that it would encourage people with wealth that was not earning a profit to get rid of such wealth and hand over such property to those who could generate a profit out of it.</P>
    <P>All that has been changed.  We have created in the minds of our people the feeling that the Government do not care, that the Government are looking after the privileged few and not the welfare of the many.  I do not speak as either a socialist or a communist&mdash;I disagree with many of the tenets of socialism and communism&mdash;but I have some understanding of the reactions of ordinary people.  They are sick to the teeth of the economic jargon with which they have been forced to live in the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>When I entered this House I argued there was not enough serious economic talk.  I was a product of the economics school of UCD.  Now we talk economics but we talk little realities; we use the jargon and the jargon has achieved great prominence under this Government.  I do not know if many people have wearied themselves by reading the second national understanding document, particularly the first 2¼ columns contributed <Col N="645" /> by the Government.  They do not refer to 1979 and 1980 because that might be understood by simple-minded people.  In this document the calendar has been rewritten officially and 1979 becomes &ldquo;end-1978 to end-1979&rdquo;, and 1980 becomes &ldquo;end-1979 to end-1980&rdquo;.  There is not a teacher of English, or of an teanga náisiúnta for that matter, who would not fail any child doing an essay for writing a line of such gobbledegook, but the Government's contribution to the second national understanding document has been written line after line in such nonsense.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of the same second national understanding&mdash;I do not regard either the so-called second or first national understanding as being worthy of those titles&mdash;is the use of the phrase &ldquo;It is an integral part of the understanding ....&rdquo; But the first national understanding does not use the words &ldquo;integral part&rdquo;, because of course it is not.  It is a load of political garbage that is not worth sweeping up and dumping because most garbage has at least a fertilising quality, but the garbage of the Government in the second national understanding has not.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's assurance to the people that their policies will generate employment?  Unfortunately I have not the text before me but I do not think anyone will fault my phraseology.  They say that a monitoring group will be set up as was set up under the first national understanding to ensure that the targets will be met.  What is the reassurance there?  The first targets were not met.  We have not had anything but a sad cynical silence from the monitoring group.</P>
    <P>In a healthy democracy people look to the Government to solve their problems. Now the Government of Ireland are the problem.  The Government's annual expenditure amounts to 50 per cent of what the people of Ireland produce.  In other words the Government are lifting 50 per cent of what the people earn and then spending it.  The Government naturally dominate our lives.  Twenty years ago Governments spent only 28 per cent of what the people produced.  That has <Col N="646" /> risen to 50 per cent.  When government is bad, as government now is, our lives obviously suffer.  It is this element which has led people to a tax revolt on a scale never previously experienced.  Much of that tax revolt would not exist if people were convinced that Government money was being well spent.  They do not see it as well spent when it is offered as slush money.  The present Government are unfortunately guilty of the sin of sloshing money around all over the place to buy votes.</P>
    <P>My only grain of hope as an individual Irishman is that there is a rebellion coming against all politicians of all parties who offer more and more dishonestly-called free Government services because the people see again and again that the free public services are dearly paid for by them through increasing takes in taxation.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the switch from non-economic to economic debate.  I do not want to talk about this in jargon only. I am concerned also about it in terms of philosophy, conviction and dedication.  If the people were convinced that their taxation would go to productive purposes, to generating more employment and so on, there would be a willingness to pay tax.  They do not see it going that way but as more and more give-aways not related to work, not related to effort and not related to sacrifice.</P>
    <P>We are really using gentle euphemism when we talk of Ireland being in a recession. Recession is a euphemism for what Ireland is now experiencing, a depression. There is a depression in retail sales on a scale not previously experienced. Any person in the retail trade knows that the fall-off in sales now is much greater than it was in the mid-seventies.  There is a serious depression in wholesale sales because retailers are not prepared to stock shelves with goods which will never be bought.  As a result our manufacturers are reducing their production because they have no sale for their products.  The one ray of hope, the reduction in our imports, is also a direct consequence of the depression in Ireland because the great growth in imports in recent years <Col N="647" /> was to a considerable extent due to people purchasing consumer goods which there is no longer a desire to buy because people are severely depressed.</P>
    <P>The one economic factor which appears to be improving is the balance of payments but that is for the worst possible reason&mdash;lack of investment.  This year while consumer products have declined it is nothing as grievous as the decline in the number of capital goods being imported.  This augurs badly for future employment particularly in 1981 and 1982.</P>
    <P>There is a grievous fall-off in house building reflecting a fall-off in house purchases. If ever there was an economic activity to be stimulated in depression it is construction because it has the smallest element of imported goods and the maximum element of Irish labour.  Yet in this critical area there is a continuing decline with no sign of relief for a long time to come.  The banks are full of money that they cannot lend because people cannot afford to borrow or because they lack confidence in themselves and in their potential.  They see no point in borrowing because they cannot sell their goods and services.  Lay-offs in industry are continuing at a rate much faster than anything experienced since the last war.  There is a continuing postponement of projects and the enlargement of projects.</P>
    <P>While figures from the IDA are still encouraging in the sense that they indicate future intentions the reality is that in 1980 and 1981 the actuality is quite different from what was originally intended. This most depressing picture, which I give without any sense of joy, I give feeling depressed and disappointed because much of it could have been avoided. Nobody will be enthusiastic about or has gone to the gallows about GNP, CPI or margins of growth, balance of payments and so on.  We do not get excited at election time about these things.  That is understandable because they are beyond the ordinary people's understanding.</P>
    <P>This country needs leadership which will enthuse people to a positive way of life and to a realisation that mistakes were made.  I could respect the Government <Col N="648" /> if they admitted that mistakes were made.  They made serious mistakes which made our present difficulties more serious than they need have been.  If that were said by them it would be great for the country.  There is a considerable amount of false satisfaction taken by some people out of the position of the IR£ in the EMS.  When my colleagues and I succeeded to Government we found that no preparations whatever had been made by our predecessors in office to break the link with sterling even if it became the wise thing to do.  I know there are many people today who have a reaction which is unfavourable to the severance of the link because the IR£ stands at 82p against the £ sterling.  Difficult and all as our export sales are today we are selling abroad, particularly in the UK and related areas, because we have allowed our £ to be debased as against the £ sterling.  Irish exporters to the UK now have an advantage of 17p to 18p, 17 per cent to 18 per cent, in price in their exports to the UK.  Where would our exports, which still amount to about 50 per cent, be if we had not got that trading advantage in relation to our exports to Britain?  Our economy would be in a deeper depression than it is.  It is desirable that that should be understood because it is not understood generally that this disappointment that we all feel personally, as we are exchanging currency notes, has not been related to our trading advantage in the UK and, despite that trading advantage, we are still in difficulties with our exports.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, if the British £ was to decline now and our own £ was to remain static it might provide comfort to many people who would think that our economy was about to recover.  I think that the time is not far away when the British £ is going to fall on world markets, because interest rates in London will fall and the significance of oil may be less than it is at present.  However, if that happens there is a danger here that the people would become euphoric that the Irish economy is recovering, but it will not be because the value of the IR£ in the EMS will fall as the relationship between the IR£ and the British £ narrows.  Our <Col N="649" /> exports in Europe, which have increased dramatically in the last seven years would then fall off.  About 50 per cent of the value of the IR£ in the EMS is attributable to sterling.  If sterling falls the IR£ is going to fall in the EMS; therefore, although all our exports to Europe might not fall, the rate of inflation is going to increase.  Therefore, there is no satisfaction at all in the currency situation with the EMS.</P>
    <P>What is particularly disturbing is that so many of the so-called economists who guide our lives far beyond what economists ought to be able to dictate are avoiding the reality of Irish currency, and that is that if it were looked at in its own worth without regard to the EMS, IMF or any of those three-letter multinational safeguards, the IR£ would plummet like a lump of lead in water.  Everything that devalues a currency is happening in this country under the Government's policy with inflation out of control and the Minister for prices, Deputy O'Malley, sanctioning daily further and further increases, seeing as the alternative even more unemployment in Ireland in the short term, while all that he and the rest of his colleagues are living to is the next general election.</P>
    <P>I believe that the IR£ analysed on the international money market will devalue by at least another 10 or 20 per cent when the rate of Government borrowing is taken into consideration.  It is 14 per cent of GNP and our GNP is well below what it ought to be.  We are borrowing 14 per cent.  In this the nearest country to us in Europe is Belgium which is acknowledged in Belgium and across Europe and the world as in a state of economic crisis. Belgium's Government borrowing amounts to 7 per cent, half of what ours is, and a state of crisis is recognised there which has brought down three Governments in nine months.  Our rate of price inflation is three times greater than the average of Europe and our rate of wage inflation, not unreasonably, follows the rates of price increases at a similar level so that it is treble the increase of the average of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> These are the economic realities through which we live.  I was interested to hear Members of the Government side underlining these things.  That is a bit belated on their part.  They denied every one of these economic indices, these economic inevitabilities, throughout the mid-1970s.  I am not denying them here today.  I have never denied them.  What is wrong is that this country is cursed with people who ignore them, who pretend that they do not matter, who say that we will waffle through somehow or other. We have not waffled through.  That is the reality today which too many of our unemployed know.  Young people who cannot get jobs after leaving school know that the waffle, the economic jargon has got them and the rest of the country nowhere.</P>
    <P>We set out upon a deliberate policy, which we announced to the world and to Europe in particular, of reducing the levels of Government borrowing.  We were laughed to scorn by our opponents who produced the fool's alternative to reducing expenditure&mdash;borrowing.  Had our successors followed our policy of a three-year sustained growth in public borrowing much of the inflation, import growth and damage to the country's financial standing would have been avoided.</P>
    <P>The Government's much vaunted programme of job creation is now a burst balloon.  I believe that there would be more people working today and more jobs would have been created since 1977 had we not had the Government's expenditure spree.  I say this objectively in the economic sense and not the political one.  The main consequence of the Government's expenditure spree from 1977 to 1980 was not the creation of jobs in Ireland but an increase in imports, particularly of consumer goods, shoes, shirts, blouses, dresses, garments and textiles, all of which were made in Ireland and would still be made in Ireland were it not for the rate of inflation injected by Government expenditure.  I base that not merely upon Irish experience but on the experience of the world.  The rate of inflation in Ireland would be about 15 per <Col N="651" /> cent less than it is now, in other words we would be 15 per cent lower now in our costs than we are had not the Government engaged in this spending splurge of 1977, 1978 and 1979.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Kelly, very properly quoted today from a respected Senator, Senator Whitaker who was appointed to the Seanad by Deputy Lynch when Taoiseach and I am sure he was appointed there not on the basis of party allegiance but upon the contribution which he could make to the world's economic and social welfare.  Senator Whitaker, in the polite terms that he uses invariably, has condemned the Government for their expenditure spree.  I come back to the modest words I used in 1978 and I repeat them today, that the Government in their policies for the last three years were as wrong as wrong could be. It gives us no satisfaction to recall these now because we know that we will have to face the problem of dealing with them shortly when we come back to Government. I do not want either our side of the Irish political divide or anybody else to delude our people further.  If we do we are going to get them further and further into the mess.  Neither do I want anybody when the day of reckoning comes to blame the IMF for the disciplines which will be necessary to get ourselves right. The worst and most corrupt banana republics in the world all too readily blame the IMF when, just before they sink to the bottom, they have to stretch out for financial aid.  The IMF are not a terrorising ogre that loves to impose penalties on people.  They are an international institution pointing the way to economic wisdom and survival.</P>
    <P>I believe we are moving towards being obliged to refer to the IMF for assistance. It is quite possible, as happened at the time of the last election, that people will make inquiries and find that there are banks in the world ready to lend money. Why are they ready to lend money to us and others now?  Simply because the OPEC countries have billions of surplus dollars which they cannot lend to anybody because of the world slump and they might as well lend to Ireland as to <Col N="652" /> anybody else, knowing that sooner or later economic wisdom, truth and discipline will be enforced upon us because of our need to go to the IMF to bail us out of our obligations to specific bankers.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of the most hungry and deprived nations of the world are much greater than they need be because private bankers were prepared to lend them money from the early seventies until today.  Now the IMF are bailing out those bankers, not the people.  When the not-too-distant day comes when the IMF are called to our assistance it is the bankers who will be bailed out first and the people of Ireland will be asked to carry the burden of the years of economic lunacy in which the Fianna Fáil Party plunged us when they sneaked back to power on the basis of economic untruths in 1977.  We now find ourselves in a situation where other countries are retrenching on borrowing and we are expanding our borrowing. Most of our borrowing is from abroad which means that in relation to interest which we pay on such borrowing there will be no return to the Irish taxpayer. If borrowing is made domestically there will be a return to the Irish taxpayer because the profits will be subject to Irish income tax.  We are now borrowing abroad at unacceptable levels for purposes which are not, as they ought to be, always capital purposes but to a large extent for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>I suspect that quite a number of people sighed with relief when the Taoiseach announced that the excessive cost of the second national understanding&mdash;I always use quotation marks when referring to the so-called &ldquo;second national understanding&rdquo; because it is misnamed and shows a total misunderstanding of economic reality&mdash;would be paid for not by extra taxation but by borrowing.  Borrowing is the fool's alternative&mdash;the knave's alternative&mdash;to taxation and obviously costs more because money borrowed must be repaid with interest.  When one considers that interest payment in relation to what I have said about the probable devaluation of the Irish pound in the near future, one will realise that foreign borrowing is at present an excessively <Col N="653" /> costly item.  Our borrowing is costing about 27p in the pound to the Irish taxpayer and income tax could be virtually abolished in this country if we did not have to repay our debt.  Bad though the situation is now, it will become much worse if the Government continue their present policy and when, as a consequence of that policy, the IR£ is deliberately devalued, if not by us then at least by the markets of the world and by our partners in the EMS.</P>
    <P>In government we became unpopular because we were emphasising the inescapable and unavoidable link between public spending and public borrowing and taxation.  If I were never again to be elected to this or any other assembly I would still insist upon the truth that no Government in any country can engage in increased public spending and public borrowing at the level which has operated in this country without involving more taxation and by more taxation more disincentive to work.  Such disincentives to work have been built into this system for many years and I do not blame the present administration for this.  They were at it before they were ousted from office between 1973 and 1977.  They would never have seen office again if it had not been for the world recession which was, I remind the House and the country, four times greater than what has been experienced during the past 12 months.  They got back to office by confusing the people. This is, perhaps, the reason why recent opinion polls showed that 26 per cent of our electorate do not know how they will vote in the next election.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with party interests now&mdash;I hope I never was, but I suppose they often entered into my thinking. After 22 years in this House and having handled the economy for four-and-a-half years, one is no longer really concerned with which side wins, which flag remains aloft at the end of the battle.  I am concerned with the rising young generation. Thanks to the decline in emigration, particularly under the Cosgrave Government, I am concerned with them and their hopes of living in a country which might be able to offer them something <Col N="654" /> instead of the dismal picture which exists at present.  We cannot offer them anything on the basis of present policies which are geared to increasing the comfort and protection of those who are lucky enough to be well provided for and call for ever greater sacrifices from the people in the middle ground and the under-privileged. We cannot offer a future if we mortgage that future at a rate which is three times greater than the European average.  We have no right for our own personal and current comfort to hang around the necks of future generations a millstone of £2.25 billion external debt and £4.25 billion internal debt.  The great tragedy is that so much of what has been borrowed in recent times has been not for investment in the future in which those people have to live, work and fulfil their dreams but for the winning of the last election for Fianna Fáil and helping them to get over the lump of the next election.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting the abolition of or interference with democracy but it is at times like this when one sees a great and hopeful society brought down to the level of depression which now exists that one begins to wonder what is necessary to prevent the people from being deluded. The Government will say that is not their problem and I accept this; it is our problem in opposition.  The sooner the better we get down to providing the answer.  I say to my colleagues in public as I have said to them in private that we should not try to buy votes with the taxpayer's money but rather tell them the truth.  I believe our people will rally to the cause of providing this country with what it can produce, an economy and society which can be the envy of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad of the opportunity of contributing to this debate on the economy in a positive, progressive, forward-looking and optimistic way.  I listened with interest to some of Deputy Ryan's comments.  All I can say is that his memory seemed to be short for a period.  It extended beyond a particular period but seemed to miss 1973-77.  I do not have to remind the Irish public.  Their memories <Col N="655" /> are not that short.</P>
      <P>I want to contribute in a positive way. Manpower policy, industrial relations and public sector pay policy are the principal areas within my responsibility which are important elements of the economic strategy of the Government.  Concentration on these three areas, each of which interacts with the others, is vital to our efforts to overcome the problems thrown up by the present world recession so that its effects are minimised on our people, our industrial development and on the employment of our young and growing population.  I heard the previous speaker refer to emigration figures.  I do not have them with me but I can certainly contradict what he said about emigration because it was prior to 1973 that, thankfully, our emigration figures turned under a Fianna Fáil Government for the first time.  The reverse had happened again before the Coalition Government's term of office ended.  I am glad to say&mdash;and the statistics will prove me right&mdash;that the trend was reversed yet again when Fianna Fáil returned in 1977.  I say that in reference to our young and growing population because I believe in the minimising of the effects of world recession on our industrial development and on the employment of these young people so that a longer-term policy of continued economic growth and the creation of jobs would be that bit easier to achieve when the world economy begins to expand again.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year we have witnessed yet again a worrying increase in unemployment as a result of this world wide recession.  In Ireland as elsewhere the closure of firms and the resulting loss of jobs has always been a feature of industrial and commercial life. In present circumstances however the excellent results being achieved, particularly through the promotional work of the IDA in the area of job creation, so badly needed here, is counter-balancing to a considerable extent the high level of job losses in our older manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years particular attention has been given by the Government to the <Col N="656" /> problems of firms in difficulties and facing closure.  The objective has been, and will continue to be, to avert closure if this is at all possible and thus reduce if not stop altogether the job losses threatened.  The primary responsibility for the financial soundness and general wellbeing of individual manufacturing enterprises rests with proprietors and managers.  In recent years, there has been a tendency on the part of proprietors and managers to be somewhat slow in bringing to the attention of State agencies the problems confronting their firms.  This is an area which could be improved and is receiving attention. I discussed with the ICTU during the negotiation of the new national understanding, the role which the trade unions can play in averting job losses.  If the firm is threatened, I believe management and unions must work together to avoid closures and save jobs.</P>
    <P>Indications are that the employment creation targets set by the IDA for this year will be achieved.  The targets will draw heavily on our highly qualified and skilled manpower resources.  In anticipation of these demands I have adopted a number of measures to increase the vital supply of people in the necessary skills.  We must remember that the employment of a worker in a key position can create a significant number of other less skilled or unskilled jobs.  The contribution of the Manpower Consultative Committee here has been most impressive. The House is aware of the composition of that Committee.  It has brought a new sense of purpose, co-operation and commitment by industry, trade unions and Government agencies in tacking manpower problems and identifying what further contribution is needed from manpower policy.  As Chairman of that Committee I may say that the co-operation I receive is tremendous.  Progress is worthwhile and my only criticism is that it was not set up before I set it up in 1978. The committee's work is perhaps best evident in the success of the measures taken to alleviate shortages of key personnel in industry without whom our employment growth potential could not be met.  Within twelve months some 1350 key workers have been attracted from <Col N="657" /> abroad and a further 300 additional qualified engineers, technicians and computer personnel have already emerged from the manpower education programme.  By 1984 the programme is expected to supply almost 1,400 additional key personnel annually and the key personnel open up opportunities for other less skilled or unskilled people.  This is the significance of the key worker.</P>
    <P>Other proposals put forward by the committee and acted upon are pilot link schemes in nine areas to help bring schools and local industry together as a means to improving attitudes towards industrial employment.  Regional manpower committees have been set up in three regions and will be set up in the others so that regional labour market policies can be developed and put into effect. This is very important.  A manpower information publication is being published quarterly and I am taking steps to improve labour market information generally.</P>
    <P>One of my highest priorities in Government is to make available substantial resources to encourage and provide employment for our young people.  Last year youth employment schemes provided places for well over 11,000 participants which compares with the figure of only about 2,000 participating in youth schemes in 1977.  It would be true to say that those young people's memories are not short either.</P>
    <P>The indications are that the measures we adopted proved very successful in reducing the level of youth unemployment up to the end of last year.  This year the amount we have allocated for youth employment schemes is similar to the amount spent last year.  This I believe will help to avoid what happened during the 1974-75 recession when the last Government allowed unemployment to fall disproportionately on our young people. We must never forget the terrible social effects of unemployment on school-leavers and the long-term effects their unemployment has on our capacity to compete on the world market with an efficient, committed and young work force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> With this in mind I asked the Manpower Consultative Committee to examine the youth employment situation.  The committee has recently completed its discussions on this problem and will be publishing a report on the problem shortly. The report makes a number of recommendations which I am sure when implemented will contribute to easing youth employment difficulties.  We have also asked the OECD to undertake an examination of our youth employment policies and this will commence next year.</P>
    <P>An effective placement service is a vital link in the set of measures designed to make the labour market function more efficiently.  The basic function of our National Manpower Service is to successfully match job-seekers with available jobs and training opportunities and to help meet employers' staff requirements quickly and effectively.  The absence of such a service would substantially diminish the opportunities and benefits resulting from our major job-creation and training efforts.  Indeed, I believe that the placement service plays a vital role in influencing our job-creation and training policies, because of the service's specialised knowledge of local and national labour markets.  The National Manpower Service are of particular help to new companies starting up and especially to foreign companies whose knowledge of Irish recruitment procedures may be limited. Indeed, the National Manpower Service co-operate very closely and very effectively with the IDA in this area.</P>
    <P>I want to underline also the social dimension attached to the work of the NMS.  This side of their work was well defined in an OECD report which suggested that manpower policy should</P>
    <P>seek to provide each individual member of society with the possibility of attaining the situation which he conceives as the most advantageous in terms of personal satisfaction and real income.</P>
    <P>The work of the placement service is closely interwoven with individual job-seekers and their problems.</P>
    <P>I am totally committed to the work of <Col N="659" /> the National Manpower Service.  When I assumed office I set about getting the resources it so urgently needed.  I am happy to say I have been successful in my efforts.  For example, at the beginning of June 1978 there were 92 placement officer positions.  This figure stands now at 150.  Similarly I have expanded the occupational guidance service and, by the end of the year, I hope that all regions will have at least one guidance officer.</P>
    <P>If I might, with the permission of the Chair, now correct a figure I gave earlier. I understand that I mentioned a figure of 1,100.  I should have said 11,000.  I say that to correct the records.  I was referring to the number of persons in the youth employment schemes last year.</P>
    <P>Between June 1978 and now the number of National Manpower offices rose from 27 to 37.  I plan to open five further offices in country locations, at Mullingar, Tuam, Thurles, Newcastlewest and Letterkenny and four offices in Dublin, in Finglas, Coolock, Tallaght and Ballyfermot, all to help to bring the services closer to the people.  The services provided for employers and job seekers are continuously under review.  At present I am looking in particular at the services provided in the area of professional and executive recruitment.  Deputies will appreciate that a speedy and effective filling of high level vacancies is of considerable importance to the economy.  The systems being operated by placement services in other countries in relation to the filling of such high level vacancies are being examined with a view to developing this type of service here.</P>
    <P>Within the next 12 months I also expect to secure a further improvement of the employment service by computerising its information gathering operations.  This will allow the earlier publication of the most up-to-date labour market information on a national and regional basis. Work is also well advanced on the design of a computer system to assist in the matching of job seekers and vacancies which will speed up the placement process which will mean that time spent by many job seekers in unemployment will be reduced.  I have decided to introduce <Col N="660" /> a computer assisted placement service in the east region by 1982.</P>
    <P>Despite these developments I am not yet satisfied that the National Manpower Service has all the resources and flexibility it needs to maximise its contribution to the formulation and implementation of employment policy and to react quickly to the changing labour market.  I will continue with my efforts to provide this country with a full and effective State placement service as a key element of our manpower policy.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention two other areas of particular interest.  As regards the inner city of Dublin, at the request of the Government's Special Inner City Group my own Department have drawn up a special programme aimed at persuading employers, by means of a generous employment premium, to give jobs to people in the inner city.  The National Manpower Service is drawing up a special register of unemployed persons from the inner city from which employers can fill their vacancies in order to qualify for the premium.  The persons on the register will be those who have special problems in getting jobs.  This I believe to be a most desirable step by Government.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for monitoring progress on the quota rests with me as Minister for Labour.  I am glad to report that steady progress is being made by all agencies involved and in particular I am very pleased to say that the special competition for clerical assistant in the civil service confined to disabled persons is in progress at present.  I am confident that the results of this competition will be available in time to have the first appointments made by the end of this year.  Both of my Departments have been having discussions with the Civil Service Commission with a view to opening up additional civil service grades to the disabled and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on this in the near future.</P>
    <P>Discussions have also taken place between my Department and the health boards, local authorities and other State bodies and agencies and all of them are reviewing their recruitment procedures with a view to opening up more employment <Col N="661" /> opportunities for disabled persons in line with Government policy.</P>
    <P>I am confident that there will be a significant increase in the number of disabled persons employed in the public sector by the end of the International Year for the Disabled and we should be well on the way to achieving the 3 per cent target by the end of 1982.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of our manpower policy is industrial training.</P>
    <P>Over the years the State's contribution to the financing of training has increased substantially, and this has been supplemented by assistance from the European Social Fund.  This year the grants-in-aid to AnCO were increased by 25 per cent over the grants for 1979.  This is made up of current expenditure, which was increased to £16.8 million as against £13.475 million the previous year; while capital expenditure is £5 million as against £4 million.  The Government recognise the significance of training at a time of a difficult employment situation and are committed to providing the finance necessary to meet the increased training demand.</P>
    <P>The proposed new national understanding includes among the list of possible measures for achieving an imporvement in the job situation the &ldquo;maintentance and if possible increase in intake into apprenticeships and training&rdquo;.  Extra money is being made available to AnCO so that they can exceed their original budget this year. This will enable AnCO to take over responsibility for many apprentices affected by the economic recession, for these young people are the backbone of our continued industrial development.  I have no intention of repeating the mistakes of the last Government in allowing the apprentice intake to drop resulting in a future shortage of skilled persons.</P>
    <P>For next year the Government are prepared, as they have undertaken to do in the discussions on the new national understanding to &ldquo;increase the State's contribution to the financing of training to ensure an adequate supply of workers with appropriate skills and to provide for <Col N="662" /> training and retraining of unemployed persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that as we emerge from the present recession progress will not be hampered by a lack of skills.  Here I must point to the primary responsibilities of employers themselves to provide for their training needs.  It must not be forgotten that the principle on which the Industrial Training Act is based is that training is first and foremost the firms' responsibility; the Government are providing the means for training.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to play their part in seeking to ensure that the country will have an adequate supply of the skills required and, given the present economic circumstances, are ready to increase their contribution as I have indicated.  I am already discussing with AnCO and also with CERT their capacities for taking on more trainees.  We must be all concerned however that the training is not just training for its own sake or merely a way of occupying the time of persons who might otherwise be unemployed.  Training, I am sure Deputies will agree, must be relevant to the needs of our economy and the reasonable aspirations of those being trained.</P>
    <P>At a European level the Government have pressed for and obtained increased resources to help with the serious problem of youth unemployment.  New schemes to assist vocational training and job creation programmes have been introduced with the aid of the European Social Fund.  Ireland's receipts from the Social Fund in 1980 will be well over £50 million and increased expenditure on training is planned for 1981.</P>
    <P>Despite the problems created by the recession the Government remain fully committed to the implementation of their policies for economic and social development.  We remain determined to maintain a satisfactory level of progress and will not allow ourselves to be deflected from our economic objectives or deterred by any obstacles, whether internal or external.</P>
    <P>In this context the Government have consistently maintained that the achievement of a further national understanding <Col N="663" /> on reasonable terms is of major importance.  I can say that the Government are prepared to uphold the understanding in all its details and I hope that the other parties concerned will endorse the draft understanding tomorrow.  It is designed to provide a framework within which, with the co-operation of both sides of industry&mdash;and surely co-operation and consultation is the way ahead, particularly in times like this&mdash;an integrated programme on employment, pay, social welfare, education, health and taxation can be pursued.</P>
    <P>The proposals for a national understanding set out the general operational framework, including specific measures and policies, which the Government have in mind to maintain economic and social progress up to the end of 1981.</P>
    <P>The draft understanding, in my view, goes very far to meet the legitimate aspirations of workers as regards pay and conditions over the next 15 months, or so, while providing reasonable safeguards so far as employers are concerned. The pay increases provided for in the draft agreement have, indeed, been described by many commentators as being more than might be prudent on purely economic grounds.  The terms can be justified only if there is a clear and positive commitment by all parties to observe strictly all the provisions of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Government are firmly committed to honouring their commitments under the draft national understanding.  In the interests of the community at large in this small country, which is so dependent for survival on trade and commerce with other countries, I hope that workers and employers will endorse the terms of the draft understanding and that they will all make a concerted effort to ensure that its terms are complied with, both as regards the letter and the spirit.  If there is a positive approach and a spirit of co-operation, they will reap a harvest of more work for our young people and for our unemployed.  In the long term this means more prosperity and a better life for all of us.</P>
    <P>As regards job creation, we affirm our <Col N="664" /> commitment to the earliest possible achievement of full employment.  Indeed, Government expenditure is concentrated mainly on creating new jobs.  Although the scale of such investment relative to GNP is proportionately one of the highest in the world, the continuing rise in unemployment is very disturbing.  The rise in unemployment in recent months must, however, be looked at in relation to the position among our EEC partners. For example, the total number unemployed in the Community rose by 7 per cent between the end of June and the end of July this year, as compared with 4½ per cent in Ireland.  The corresponding increases in unemployment in the UK were over 14 per cent, Belgium over 18 per cent, in Luxembourg 13 per cent, in the Netherlands nearly 12 per cent and in Germany over 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>While the results of present investment and job creation policies are consistent with the early achievement of full employment, the repercussions of the recession on the economy are giving rise to high levels of redundancies and job losses, particularly in the older manufacturing sectors.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Government, within the terms of the proposed national understanding, have undertaken to launch a series of additional measures and to allocate extra resources to boost employment still further and to curtail job losses.  We do not underestimate the magnitude of this task, but we are determined that no effort will be spared to safeguard existing employment and to provide the additional jobs needed to cater for our unemployed and for our young workforce.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the public service is by far the greatest single employment sector in the community and the pay bill is running at nearly £1,500 million a year.  The new pay agreement will increase this massive bill.  Each percentage rise in the public service pay bill throws an extra load of £15 million a year on the Exchequer's finances.  In view of the size of the standard increases under the draft pay agreement, the Government expect that great restraint will be exercised in the pursuit of claims for special <Col N="665" /> increases.  During the past two years the amount of special pay increases which were negotiated over and above the standard increases of the national agreements were very considerable indeed.  So far as the public sector is concerned, the public who have to pay this bill will find it difficult to accept that there should be any further significant increases under the terms of the new draft agreement.</P>
    <P>A key element in safeguarding and expanding employment is our capacity to maintain or improve our competitiveness. This requires a conscious effort to improve productivity.  The Taoiseach in his address yesterday referred to the need for increased productivity as provided for in the provisions of the draft national understanding.</P>
    <P>I would also stress the importance of productivity as an element of our competitiveness in the world market.  It will help safeguard the jobs of those at present in employment and increase the employment prospects of our job seekers. It will ensure the competitiveness and viability of firms and make their products more attractive at home and on the export market.  Increased productivity is an obvious practical way in which every Irish worker can contribute to the preservation of his or her own job.  We will be having consultations with both sides of industry on ways and means of raising productivity as a national objective, so as to maintain and promote the competitiveness and efficiency of Irish producers and manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Another crucial factor affecting employment prospects is the industrial relations climate.  It is vital that the commitment to industrial peace in the proposals be scrupulously followed by both sides of industry.  This will call for a much greater degree of discipline than has been apparent in the past.  The number of days lost through strikes during the first nine months of this year was approximately 375,000.  This figure, while still at an unacceptably high level, shows a considerable improvement on the figure for the same period last year when about 1,400,000 days were lost.  It also shows a <Col N="666" /> significant drop on the comparable figure for 1978 which was over 436,000.  It is in the interests of every individual for the sake of the community as a whole to strive to secure a greater improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>One very serious development which has been noted this year is that unofficial strikes account for a much higher proportion of the days lost compared with previous years.  This trend poses a serious threat not only to the smooth running of the economy but also to the authority and influence of the trade union movement and to authority as a whole.  It goes without saying that, if the production and distribution of goods and the maintenance of essential services are too often interrupted by industrial action, employment will be jeopardised and some jobs irrevocably lost.  Our reputation abroad as a location for foreign investment will be damaged and our own efforts to secure full employment will suffer.  We cannot afford the luxury of self-inflicted, self-destructive industrial strife if we are sincere in our professed concern for the unemployed and the welfare of our community, particularly young people.</P>
    <P>The refusal by some groups of workers to use the agreed procedures or to avail of the services of the dispute-settling institutions and also the tendency to have recourse to strike action as a first instead of as a last resort to resolve disputes cannot be ignored or condoned.  To do so would be tantamount to allowing ourselves to submit to a regime of industrial anarchy.</P>
    <P>Both sides of industry&mdash;the employers and the trade unions&mdash;have always professed a strong preference for free collective bargaining and want the Government to stay out of, and keep away from, the operation of that system.  The attitude of both sides has always been, and still is, that employers and workers should be free to regulate their own affairs.</P>
    <P>If employers and trade unions want no third party involvement in this area then the community at large have a right to expect that both sides will so regulate their affairs that there will be a minimum of conflict and that industrial relations <Col N="667" /> will be conducted in a manner which will advance the common good and impose the least hardship on the community.</P>
    <P>Employers must at all times maintain dialogue with the trade unions and workers to reduce possible areas of conflict. Trade unions and their members for their part must honour agreements freely entered into and abide by the rules and procedures voluntarily negotiated and agreed.  There can be no order in a situation where any individual or self-appointed group can do their own thing and press their own demands by kicking all the rules out the window and tearing up agreements entered into on their behalf.  The removal of this cancer of unofficial action is essentially a matter for the trade unions themselves and trade union leaders must recognise this.  If the trade unions cannot tackle this problem then obviously the Government have a duty to consider their options for dealing with it.</P>
    <P>In a situation like the petrol dispute where an essential service was placed at risk by industrial action there were loud calls on the Minister for Labour to bring in legislation to outlaw unofficial strikes. It is not, however, that simple; if it were, all the western democracies would have promoted such legislation long ago. There is no law that can prevent a worker from withdrawing his labour or which can, compel a man to work if he does not want to.  I am not saying the law cannot help: what I am saying is that legislation on its own will not and cannot provide a solution to unofficial strikes.  Any legislation introduced to regulate our industrial relations must be done with consultation and agreement with both sides of industry, if it is to work.  As part of the proposals in the non-pay section of the national understanding I propose to have discussions with both sides of industry with a view to introducing some amendments to the law to help deal with some problems and deficiencies in the present conduct of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Government consider worker participation an important aspect of relations between employers and workers and we are committed to the promotion <Col N="668" /> of meaningful participation by workers in the decisions affecting their working lives.  Sometimes the real problem behind disputes is the worker's sense of frustration at not being able to relate to or influence his or her working environment. Therefore, any contribution which participation can make to remove sources of discontent and help towards improving our industrial relations would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that my Department published a discussion paper on worker participation earlier this year.  My purpose in doing so was to promote and stimulate all concerned to formulate their views on the subject of participation.  I have extended the time for submissions on this document to the end of the year at the request of a number of interested organisations.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation Act designated seven State-sponsored bodies for employee representation on their boards. Six of these have already held their elections. The remaining company, Aer Lingus, are to hold their election early next year.  I propose to extend the principle of employee participation at board level to additional State enterprises and will be discussing shortly with Congress those companies which are the more suitable for this type of board representation.  The monitoring of the Act so far by the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions and the Irish Productivity Centre will be taken into consideration so that the procedures for election and the role of elected directors can be improved.</P>
    <P>The Government have continued to give attention to improvements in the affairs of women in our society.  A delegation which represented the Government at the World Conference of the UN Decade for Women in Copenhagen in July 1980 included representatives from the Employment Equality Agency and the Council for the Status of Women, two organisations to the forefront in promoting improvements in women affairs. The conference was a very important occasion in that it assessed the progress made during the first half of the decade, <Col N="669" /> and formulated a plan of action for the next five years.  The delegation was led by the Minister of State at the Department of Labour, Deputy Daly.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency is of course a statutory body whose on-going task is encouraging the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equality of opportunity in employment. The Government's backing of a research project on the &ldquo;Sex Differences in Subject Provision and Student Choice in Irish Post-Primary Schools&rdquo; enabled the agency to secure funds from the EEC. The agency, who have commissioned the ESRI to do the research, sees the project as significant in eliminating discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women is representative of over a quarter of a million women through its affiliated organisations and is regarded as the main voice on women affairs in Ireland.  In recognition of this fact, Ministers promoting legislation or issuing discussion documents on matters concerning women will consult the council at the appropriate time.  In addition, the Government have recently provided the council with office accommodation at State expense.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Labour has initiated a review of the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women which have not yet been fully implemented.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women which remains to be implemented relates to the provision of maternity leave.  It is the Government's intention to introduce shortly legislation guaranteeing women the right to a minimum period of maternity leave following which they will be guaranteed the right to return to work. Provision will also be made in relation to pay during the period of leave in question. There are about 60,000 married women in the age groups concerned and the legislation will benefit about 10,000 of these each year. <Col N="670" /> This legislation is important from a social point of view in that married women should not be penalised for the contribution they make to our society as mothers.  There are also strong economic arguments in that the legislation will help to ensure that when women get married their skills and talents may not be lost, as this legislation will provide an incentive for them to return to work should they wish to do so.  My Department have had consultations with both the ICTU and the FUE and there has been general agreement on the general approach proposed.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper containing the Programme for National Development 1978-1981 the Government committed themselves to the principle of using servicetype employment as an instrument for regional development and for reducing the serious imbalances in employment that exist between different parts of the country.  The programme envisaged the transfer of at least 2,000 officers to about eight medium-sized urban areas in the provinces.  In addition, the programme recorded the Government's decision that all new Government-sector services would be located outside Dublin unless there were compelling reasons to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Since then the Government have been giving serious attention to this matter. After full consideration they have now decided on steps to locate a number of specific Government services in some 12 provincial centres.  The number of staff involved will be over 3,200, a figure significantly higher than envisaged in the White Paper.  The desirability of pressing ahead with the programme has been given added urgency by the recession and by the falling-off that has occurred especially in the building and related industries.</P>
    <P>The contribution to job creation that could be provided by a decentralisation programme is, in fact, recognised in the draft national understanding.  For the programme to make an early impact on employment it is essential that construction of the necessary accommodation should get under way as a matter of <Col N="671" /> urgency.  The Government will be calling on all concerned, including local and community interests, for their co-operation in the carrying into effect of the decentralisation programme.  As the programme involves the movement on a voluntary basis of a large number of staff, I must stress the great importance the Government attach to the support the staff and their staff associations can give to making the arrangements go smoothly.</P>
    <P>The Government are confident that this major programme will contribute significantly to the achievement of a more even and equitable development of the less well-off regions in all parts of the country.  The programme should also, together with the many other job-creation proposals already announced, do much in the short term to help the building sector and its ancillary industries.  The creation of so many new jobs around the country will have a multiplier effect on local trade and employment.  Indeed, I would hope that in many centres it would provide the impetus to the provision of rented housing and comprehensive redevelopment. Last but not least, Government services will be brought closer to, and be better integrated with, the people in whose interests they are provided.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already stressed the very large investment required for the various projects and the corresponding need, in view of the existing level of Government borrowing, to encourage the private sector to participate in the funding of these desirable projects.  I am confident that developers and financial institutions will be interested in the financing of the decentralisation programme and I hope that this will enable much more rapid progress to be made with it.</P>
    <P>I have made arrangements for the civil service staff associations to be informed this afternoon of the details of the Government's decentralisation proposals.  I can assure the House that, in making their decisions on the places to which civil service offices will be decentralised, the Government have tried to achieve as broad a geographical spread as possible having regard to the capacity of the various <Col N="672" /> places to absorb smoothly the staff involved and also taking into account all the relevant factors such as housing, schools, amenities, local employment situation and the potential for development. The centres concerned in the decentralisation programme are Athlone, Ballina, Cavan, Dundalk, Galway, Killarney, Letterkenny, Sligo, Waterford and the Limerick-Nenagh-Ennis area.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are also expanding accommodation requirements for staff in public services already located in other centres outside Dublin&mdash;and I should mention Cork as not least among these centres&mdash;which will involve major construction work in these places as well.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the positive approach this Government are taking in the key elements of manpower, industrial relations and its commitment to a progressive social and economic policy which is designed to provide employment and a better living and working environment for all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Having listened to the conclusion of the Minister's speech one would not be sure whether one was at a debate on a motion of confidence in the behaviour of the Government or whether one was at an enjoyable open day at Davitt House.  What the Minister has said about his Department is of interest.  The promise is more than the actual performance, but it does not answer the central question&mdash;the Minister did not try to and that is part of the problem of having prepared speeches to read out&mdash;raised in the debate.  The motion moved by the Taoiseach yesterday is short and straightforward. It states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann re-affirms confidence in the economic policies of the Government and expresses approval of the measures being taken by them to mitigate the effects of the present world recession, to expand employment, to assist the agricultural industry and to promote general economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what is at issue today and not the scattering or decentralisation around the country which has been promised <i>ad nauseam</i><Col N="673" /> but which we have still to see.  It is the performance of the Government that is on trial today.  If the country at large could listen to this debate our people would ask for details of the economic policies of the Government and the basis on which they are to be measured or assessed.  The economic policies of the Government&mdash;we have only had one Government since 1977, albeit a coalition of the two factions within Fianna Fáil&mdash;were set out in the now infamous manifesto.</P>
    <P>That manifesto stated that it &ldquo;has been carefully put together and costed for implementation in Government by a new team under Jack Lynch as Taoiseach&rdquo;. The manifesto further stated:</P>
    <P>The action programme outlined above is designed to produce a major improvement in our economic fortunes. It will lower inflation, cut unemployment dramatically and then restore stability to the Government's own finances through a crash programme for raising output, and boosting home and export sales of Irish made products.</P>
    <P>The promises in that contract document were unveiled on 20 May 1977.  That document stated that unemployment would be reduced successively by approximately 80,000 over three years.  That should mean that if Fianna Fáil had maintained their contract the unemployment level should be 30,000 to 40,000 persons. The manifesto claimed, promised and contracted the Government in a carefully costed document&mdash;to quote the document&mdash;that prices would only increase by 5 per cent, that economic growth this year would be about 5 per cent and that borrowing requirements by the Government in order to finance this programme, expressed as a percentage of GNP, would be 8 per cent in 1980.</P>
    <P>There was no mention in the proviso that the promises were subject to world recession, subject to the Ayatollahs of this world and bearing in mind the arbitrary nature of some unofficial strikes. There was no such caveat in that carefully costed document.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> The position today is represented by a very hard and cruel balance sheet.  If the Government had delivered what it promised it would be able to point to an unemployment register of 30,000 or 40,000; instead, seasonally adjusted it stands at 110,000.  Economic growth instead of being the 5 per cent promised is only I per cent.  Prices are up 50 per cent in the period since the Government came into office.  Finally, borrowing as a percentage of GNP instead of being the 8 per cent solemnly and formally promised in this document now stands at 14 per cent. Either the English language means something or it does not.  If it does mean that if somebody promises to do something on the basis of a series of economic policies and proposals and after a period of three years when a review is made of the effectiveness of those policies and we can measure the starting point from which those policies were inaugurated against the present situation and measure the forecasts solemnly put about by the various supporters of the Government&mdash;first in Opposition on 20 May when this thing was unveiled&mdash;up to now, we are left with absolutely no rational alternative but to conclude that the economic policies of the Government by their own criteria have manifestly and dramatically failed.</P>
    <P>I suggest formally to the next Government speaker that instead of reading out some civil service drafted script he might actually respond to that debating point because this is an economic debate in a legislative chamber and not in some gallery for the parading of press scripts.  We are being formally asked to give a vote of confidence at 3.45 p.m. tomorrow to a Government that claims that its economic policies have worked despite all the evidence.  It promised something quite specific; we can measure the gap between what was promised and what is there and that gap is enormous.  If this were a court of law and we were disputing a contract between a contractor and a client the court and jury would have no option but to deem that the contractor, the Fianna Fáil Party and Government, had grossly defaulted on their contractual obligations.  In fact, the judge would have to direct the jury so to find.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> In that context I find it extraordinary to have sat through and listened to the waffle of the Minister for Labour who did not address himself to the central problem. In a sense this debate is a year too late; it is of a year past.  In reality this very economic debate took place around this building and if we believe what we read in various monthly magazines, in various hotel bedrooms, foyers and bars in the autumn of 1979.  This debate took place within the Fianna Fáil coalition itself in private and behind closed doors. Despite the public pronouncements of somebody like&mdash;and he is in the House today&mdash;the Minister of State, Deputy McEllistrim and despite the guerilla raid on the Republican credentials of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, the real debate that took place in Fianna Fáil this time last year was not about helicopters flying over the Border in County Monaghan; it was about the failure of the economic policies of the then Finance Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Government. The farce is that there was a vote of confidence at this time last year and the Ministers of the day lost it and the people who voted them out&mdash;if we can believe press reports&mdash;like the Minister of State opposite&mdash;actually voted against the then Minister for Finance and his colleague the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and in apparent rage fired them or enabled them to be fired. Having done that, they will come in here tomorrow at 3.45 and vote fundamentally and diametrically in a direction opposite to that voting which took place in the Fianna Fáil Party this time last year.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach displayed his confidence in this manifesto by firing the Minister for Finance from Finance to the post of Energy, by firing the Minister for Agriculture, by firing the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and abolishing his Department and by firing the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  Subsequently, in drawing up the membership of the election committee for the Fianna Fáil Party for the coming year and the coming general election he very publicly and decidedly excluded from membership <Col N="676" /> of that committee the person who was very much identified with the 1977 manifesto and the pre-election preparations at that time.  I refer to the ex-general secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>That is some confidence&mdash;four Ministers gone, one Department abolished, the general secretary who came up with the manifesto idea gone.  According to himself in an interview about the time of his enforced resignation he had put the idea of the manifesto in the first place to the then Leader of Fianna Fáil.  He is removed from the election committee for the forthcoming election.  A majority of the Fianna Fáil Dáil Members voted no confidence themselves in their own economic policy.  We on this side of the House are being asked to vote confidence in that policy at the end of all this charade. When the corridors of power from here to Mount Street are littered with casualties of last year's palace revolution or alternatively are crowded with the State cars of additional Ministers of State, we are being asked to vote confidence in that economic policy.  It would be amusing if it was not terribly sad and ironic if it were not very costly&mdash;because we shall have to pay for this nonsense and the Irish public are now paying for it.  Instead of some kind of honest response admitting mistakes, recognising that there are factors over which no Government in an open economy has control, we get the PR screed of nonsense we have just had from the Minister for Labour in which the central issue of this economic debate was not even touched on.  Instead we get more crumbs such as decentralisation to Letterkenny and last but not least, to quote his own phrase, to Cork&mdash;where else?</P>
    <P>The contract as promised in 1977 was endorsed enthusiastically by every Fianna Fáil party member&mdash;some of them never thought they would have to implement it, which probably meant that they endorsed it less critically than they would have done otherwise&mdash;and significantly endorsed by the present Taoiseach on RTE 1 on the Sunday before polling day.  That manifesto bought the votes of the Irish people unwittingly or wittingly&mdash;perhaps out of a sense of <Col N="677" /> despair or depression feeling that having come through one depression with the 1973-74 oil crisis anything would be better than returning to the black days of that experience.  Consequently they were made an offer they could not refuse, to quote a phrase used.  Rather than being the solution to our current problems, that manifesto has been adjudicated by independent economists and observers as being an additional cause of our existing structural problems.  In an article by Paul Tansey in <i>The Irish Times</i> today it is stated:</P>
    <P>The unnecessary fiscal expansionism of Fianna Fáil from 1978 onwards was the consequence of that party's successful bid for the loyalty of the electorate during the 1977 General Election. Again, very large budget deficits were funded by still further borrowing.</P>
    <P>The EEC Commission's report deals with the outlook for this year based on the performance of economic policies announced in the manifesto in the last three years and states:</P>
    <P>The outlook for growth in Ireland in 1981, as in the Community as a whole, is not encouraging.  Although the current account of Ireland's balance of payments improved in 1980, the deficit is still expected to be large.</P>
    <P>It goes on to argue that the borrowing requirement, expected to be 13 per cent of GNP&mdash;we know now it will be much higher&mdash;is too high and should be reduced significantly.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is fairly clear to every economic adviser and everybody here that the level of borrowing that we have taken upon ourselves or voted ourselves into has reached an unacceptably high level, not as Deputy Ryan said because there is something intrinsically wrong with the principle of borrowing but because of the way in which we are utilising the funds we borrow.  The day of reckoning must come for this economy and consequently for our people.</P>
    <P>Can this Government learn from the failure of their economic policy in the last <Col N="678" /> three years?  Is there any evidence to suggest that the Fianna Fáil majority coalition in this House have learned anything more than simply to depose one leader and replace him with another and depose one set of economic Ministers and replace them with others but maintaining basically the same policies, or endorsing the same policies?  Has anything been learned by the Government from the fiasco of the past three years in terms of the current state of our fiscal borrowing?</P>
    <P>One of the saddest things I have had to see in my time here was the object defence by Deputy O'Donoghue of the economic policies of the Government. Deputy O'Donoghue himself having been sacked for trying to implement those policies in the first two years.  If we cannot learn from the mistakes that have been made and the pressures that must inevitably strike at a small open economy like ours over which a sovereign Government cannot be expected to have any great degree of control, we will have wasted a major opportunity in this debate.  It is up to the Government speakers, particularly the closing speaker, to give some indication that the bitter lessons to be learned from this experiment have been learned and that some remedy will be employed in the future.</P>
    <P>The Leaders of Fine Gael and Labour made their critical analysis of the performance of the Government.  Both suggested possible short and long-term remedies that could be employed.  However, proposals have not come from the Government. We have not heard from them specific short-term proposals as suggested in Deputy Cluskey's speech. There have not been suggestions about areas in which there could be reformation or restructuring.  Instead, we have been given the public relations brief delivered by the Minister for Labour and the Public Service who spoke about more decentralisation and more job programmes, without dealing with the problems confronting us now.  If we do not learn from the Government's economic failure we will be poorer as a nation.</P>
    <P>One matter that must be examined sharply and deeply is the use to which <Col N="679" /> finance borrowing is being put in the economy.  We have reached the stage when apparently we are borrowing simply to pay wages and current account costs but we have not got any evaluation of what the productive return will be on that borrowing.  There seems to be a desperate recourse to borrowing by the Government every time their expenditure appears to get above its revenue.  Rather than re-introducing some of the taxes they abolished in their regrettably successful effort to buy votes, rather than extending or broadening the tax base to make it more equitable, or to collect taxes more efficiently, every time the country is hit by increased costs, whether from external or internal factors, or a combination of both, the solution seems to be to borrow from external sources in the hope that somehow everything will turn out right in the end.</P>
    <P>In addition to borrowing to cover the current account deficit, there has been borrowing for capital programmes, some of which are in the public sector.  Approximately £400 million has been borrowed by various semi-State bodies, which in effect means that the State must pay because the State must act as final guarantor even when the State companies borrow directly themselves.  In terms of economic competence or good management there is no evidence to suggest that the Government have the capacity or the willpower critically to evaluate the viability of the capital programmes put up by the State sector and the probable rate of return that will result from moneys borrowed.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies are investigating the performance of NET in the Marino Point saga.  There is no evidence there that the Government are effectively monitoring the way in which capital moneys are being expended or the viability of the capital projects which by their nature and their size will require recourse to borrowing both at home and abroad.  I should like to think that the economic community in this country, and by that I mean the journalists and commentators who have attempted to force upon decision-makers <Col N="680" /> like ourselves the recognition of the very major crisis confronting our public finance and in particular our fiscal policy, would recognise that something will come out of this debate other than haranguing from this side of the House or public relations type speeches from various Ministers about their Departments.  Beyond and above those two inevitable components in a debate such as this perhaps there will emerge a commitment within the House to evaluate critically the use to which borrowed capital sums are being put.</P>
    <P>In many cases the whole performance of monitoring and evaluation is extremely uneven in those sectors of the economy for which the State has direct control.  It is doubly important that this be done.  It is important to ensure that no more major mistakes are made.  There must be no unnecessary waste or no waste at all if that is possible.  Secondly and more fundamentally as far as the Labour Party are concerned, it is important that this lesson be learned because if it is not, the credibility of the State sector as a major agency for economic growth and development will be undermined not by people on the left, not by a socialist administration attempting to implement socialist policies, but by incompetence from a right wing capitalist administration. That would be the worst of both worlds.  That prospect is a real one because it has happened already.  That lesson should be carefully studied and learned.</P>
    <P>Three years ago when this House came back after the last general election in the euphoria of having gained 84 seats and in the natural enthusiasm coming from an election victory and the attainment of office by individual members.  Fianna Fáil unanimously and enthusiastically supported the economic policies of the then Ministers for Economic Planning and Development and Finance.  In essence that policy was to cut taxes including the wealth tax which was not promised in the manifesto, to borrow heavily and scatter the money throughout the economy particularly in the private sector in the hope that it would generate economic growth <Col N="681" /> that would enable that borrowing to be repaid.</P>
    <P>At that time the Labour Party, and I as one of its spokesmen, repeatedly said that there was no factual evidence to suggest that the economic policies pursued by the Ministers for Economic Planning and Development and Finance with our money would create such growth. The economic recovery from the first oil recession had started to take place and there was no need for that kind of gross expenditure within the economy on the scale envisaged and implemented by the manifesto.</P>
    <P>At a subsequent stage there was the failure of the housing programme to provide houses particularly in the local authority sector for those who needed them.  I recall speaking in a debate with the then Minister for the Environment. We agreed that the industry was overheated and this was done by Government policy with borrowed money to the extent that the private sector had inflated the price of labour and some materials to such an extent that lumping was the norm of the day on building sites and wage rates were in telephone numbers as far as some individuals were concerned.  The detrimental effect of that policy was that the local authorities were not able to get contractors to complete their contracts in time because of a scarcity of labour and people who could not afford the inflated prices of private housing were left for longer on the housing list.</P>
    <P>What has been the effect of the overheating in the construction industry at that time?  It is now in a worse state than it was in 1977.  The collapse this time of some sectors of the private house building industry is more critical and fundamental that it was in 1977.  As someone in the business I know that 1977 was a bad year for the private house building sector.  The Government policy of throwing borrowed money at the problem in the hope that some of it might stick and generate some kind of growth has had disastrous effects in some areas.  In the building industry it has caused grave disruption. Many house builders who went through the inflationary impact of the last <Col N="682" /> boom in the industry are now confronted with major problems which the Minister for the Environment has got submissions about.</P>
    <P>If one can take any reading from the plans across the divide of the House the demotion of the Minister for the Environment to the Department of Defence can be seen as an indication within Fianna Fáil that that Minister's performance was far less than what the country and the industry required.  That view has been expressed by many loyal supporters and members of Fianna Fáil who happen to be in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The theory of borrowing money from abroad or within the economy and having a deficit is based on the idea that one borrows in bad times in order not to deflate the economy too much and to cushion the impact, but one repays or reduces to zero borrowing in good times in the hope that over the full cycle of economic swings and roundabouts, particularly those that affect an open economy such as ours, one will have maintained an even balance.  Instead this Government with their professor of economics sought to put that generally accepted theory on its head and borrowed, as Paul Tansey said, at a time when the economy did not need an additional injection of capital.  The net effect of that is that we can no longer effectively borrow on the scale needed to cushion the impact of the recession.  Our economy has been damaged to the extent that the debt liability per person is enormous and the servicing of that debt will be difficult.</P>
    <P>On top of that relatively simple economic proposition the level which our borrowing has now reached in terms of its proportion to the size of our economy is such that the value of our own independent currency is beginning to come under considerable stress and the decline in the value of the IR£ cannot be ruled out.  That decline will be forced upon us by its downward movement within the EMS.  As Deputy R. Ryan pointed out, when the £ sterling starts to readjust to a more realistic level of value for itself, that in turn will reduce the value of our own £.</P>
    <P>One side effect of this Government's <Col N="683" /> in the main non-productive borrowing has been that we can anticipate&mdash;without being optimistic about it because it is not an optimistic prospect&mdash;that our own currency will be forced to devalue.  That in turn will mean, particularly for our foreign borrowings, that we will have to pay back more than we anticipated paying in the first instance because of the reduced value of our own currency.</P>
    <P>I have five or six minutes left and I would like to conclude by saying to the Government Ministers present that much of our problem set out now and discussed&mdash;not necessarily by me in a partisan manner&mdash;has been brought about by the belief in this nonsense document of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  That worked in terms of winning an election and nobody can argue with that.  It got the votes and it won back power for Fianna Fáil, but it was not then and is not now a credible economic policy.  I urge strongly that, rather than hanging on for another 18 months pretending that they are still following it out and having the spectacle of a sacked Minister for Economic Planning and Development pledging loyalty to a man who fired him and abolished his Department less than 12 months ago, the Fianna Fáil Ministers, Government and majority in this House will not do further damage to the economy by carrying on for another year and a half.  Whoever comes back into office after the next general election is going to face a very bare cupboard.  The Members opposite have demonstrated their political inability to grasp nettles, to increase or extend the taxation base in order to get additional revenue for services that the public want.  They have refused to do that.  In the obsession which the Taoiseach has with not only being popular but with winning every kind of dog fight and election the temptation to promise more, to borrow more and to expend more, supported enthusiastically by the majority faction within the Fianna Fáil coalition, is going to be considerable.  I say solemnly to the House that the money that they borrow and spend is not their money, it is ours.  It belongs to the Irish <Col N="684" /> people and it is borrowed in our name and is spent by the Government in order to buy the Irish people's votes.</P>
    <P>If the Government, having fired the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development less than 12 months ago, are so confident of their present economic policy, why not take it to the people immediately?  Why not tomorrow evening, when 82 or 83 Deputies vote in favour of this motion, dissolve the House and instead of having a by-election on 6 November and let us have a general election on 6 November and let the people decide whether the confidence which Fianna Fáil undoubtedly will express in the economic policies of this Government tomorrow evening at 3.45 p.m. is shared by the people?  That is the real measure of just how confident they are in the economic policies being pursued now and enacted over a period of three years by this Government.  If they are so confident, the test is not taking the minority and majority factions in a display of loyalty up the staircase here and into the Tá lobby.  That has already been signalled in a rather sad performance by Deputy O'Donoghue yesterday and it will be no surprise.  The real test of confidence is to continue walking out of this House into a general election, and they should do that without any further delay. The real vote of confidence on the economy took place inside the walls of this building less than 12 months ago when the author of the economic policy, the then Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were ousted from power by the majority faction in Fianna Fáil who were not fighting about republican issues but fundamentally and ultimately were concerned with the then perceived failure of the economic policies of the Government and they wished to change them.  The economic vote has already taken place within Fianna Fáil.  If they have the courage of their own convictions they will carry this vote out of this House to the general public and put it to the true democratic test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mac Sharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose to confine myself to the agricultural sector and I intend <Col N="685" /> to deal in particular with the problems being experienced by that sector as a result of the current economic recession and with the steps that the Government have taken and will be taking to deal with those problems.</P>
      <P>Before I do there is one matter I wish to raise.  Yesterday in this House Deputy G. FitzGerald referred to some newspaper reports that the leaders of the farming community were threatened and intimidated when they met with members of the Government last Friday.  The Deputy stated that they were warned that, and I quote, &ldquo;there would be no more goodies for them unless they behaved themselves between now and November 6&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's information and for the information of the House, I was one of those present at that meeting and I can categorically state that no such threat, or indeed any threats of any kind, were made there.  I challenge Deputy FitzGerald to check his facts with any farmer representative who attended that meeting. Our Government does not resort to the type of actions which seem to occupy the imagination of the Opposition.  Deputy FitzGerald enjoys the reputation of being an honourable and a fair man.  I would ask him now to have the honour to withdraw his remarks of yesterday.  I would further ask him to apologise to the leaders of the farming community for the implied naivety with which he credited them by suggesting that they would succumb to threats, veiled or otherwise.  In my many dealings with the farming sector I have found their leaders most diligent and motivated by a genuine concern for the farming community.  This concern is shared by the Government.</P>
      <P>To return to the motion before the House, let me emphasise that the Government are neither unaware of nor insensitive to the problems being experienced by the farming community.  They readily recognise that there are problems and in the various measures announced over the past month they have shown in a positive way what they are prepared to do to help farmers to overcome their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> The current year has been a difficult one for farmers; both the physical climate and the economic climate have been unfavourable.  The wet summer had two major consequences: first, the amount of winter fodder was affected and the quality of much of it was below normal standard: secondly, the cereal harvest was badly affected with a lot of grain being harvested in very wet condition.  This again has led to quality problems.  In relation to the fodder difficulties, the Government met the farm organisations and then took swift and effective action. The fertiliser, silage and fodder subsidies which we introduced in August have been most successful, and many farmers who would otherwise have been badly caught for winter feed are now in a much happier position.  Fertiliser use increased substantially and there was a big increase in the number of farmers making autumn silage as compared to last year.</P>
    <P>The weather problems of recent months have accentuated the economic and financial difficulties.  These difficulties have their origin in the general world economic recession and in the fact that our rate of inflation here has been much higher than the price increases that have been realised by farmers.  The prices farmers have to pay for their inputs and their costs generally have continued to rise, and there has been an inevitable cost/price squeeze on the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that real and tangible progress has not been made in the agricultural sector.  Much of this progress has gone unnoticed in the current debate on farm incomes.  We have forgotten very quickly the situation we were confronted with before and during the prices negotiations at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of the common agricultural policy is to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community.  I do not honestly think that there is anyone who will dispute the fact that the CAP has brought considerable benefits to Irish farmers through improved and unrestricted access to markets, and participation in the Community's price support system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> It is worth noting that prices in the Community are considerably higher than those available to producers in most third countries which have to rely on world market returns for their produce.  Now, however, with the increasing pressure from consumer interests and the preoccupation of certain member states with the level of the Community's expenditure on agriculture, increases in prices at EEC level are not easily secured.  This was certainly the case with this year's price negotiations which were long and extremely difficult from our point of view.</P>
    <P>In the end, however, the compromise package which emerged was a reasonably satisfactory one under the circumstances. It did not give us all we wanted or sought in the Council but compared with what seemed likely at one stage, it represented a significant improvement.  The Commission's original proposals were for an overall increase of 2½ per cent in prices with an even smaller increase suggested for the milk sector.  Even though the final price rise agreed was less than what I would have wished for, it nevertheless represented a considerable advance.</P>
    <P>Equally important from our point of view were the Commission's proposals for dealing with farm surpluses and restraining budgetary expenditure. These included measures which, if they had been implemented, would have had a particularly serious impact on our agricultural industry and stifled its long-term development.  The super levy on milk would have had major implications for our dairy industry.  It would have discriminated against us because our dairy industry, with its low milk yields, has not attained anything like its full potential.</P>
    <P>The proposals to suspend beef intervention during the summer months was also most disturbing.  I have often said that I deplore over-reliance on the beef intervention system and I have urged our factories to concentrate their marketing efforts to a much greater extent on commercial outlets.  Nevertheless, a complete close-down on intervention buying for the considerable period proposed would have been a drastic step and would have <Col N="688" /> had a most unfavourable impact on prices to cattle producers.  That is why I flatly opposed these proposals with the full backing of the Government, the agricultural industry and the farmers.</P>
    <P>On the structural side the price negotiations brought some real gains.  The western package was adopted by the Council of Ministers and represents a very substantial injection of assistance for agriculture in the western counties.  It means that up to £300 million will be spent in the area over the next ten years. I am confident that this scheme will entail real progress for agriculture in the west of Ireland and will ensure that by improving infrastructure the standards in agriculture can be raised to levels more comparable with those in other parts of the country.  Work is well advanced on the preparation of a detailed programme for submission to the EEC Commission and consultations are taking place with interested organisations.  My intention is to have the new programme in operation from 1 January next.  Indeed the higher FEOGA grants for processing and marketing projects in the west have already been introduced.</P>
    <P>The new programme will cover such aspects as improved water supplies, the development of rural electrification and the provision of an adequate network of roads.  Schemes are also being worked out to encourage land improvement through commonage division and reclamation. Attractive grants will be provided for these purposes.  It is also intended to provide encouragement to beef producers in the west to improve production through a calf to beef system. Furthermore agricultural education facilities in the area will be expanded and a programme of forestry development will be introduced.</P>
    <P>Already one aspect of the package has been introduced.  EEC grants of 50 per cent are now available under the FEOGA Scheme for processing and marketing projects in the west of Ireland. This compares with a grant of 25 per cent under the existing scheme and is in addition to the national grant of up to 25 per cent.  Thus a project can be grant-aided <Col N="689" /> by as much as 75 per cent.  As I have said, this package represents an impressive package of measures for the development of agriculture in the west.  The beef suckler scheme, to which I will refer later, was also negotiated as part of the price settlement.</P>
    <P>Recent developments at EEC level have seen the completion of the common policy for sheepmeat.  This policy has been the subject of long and sometimes acrimonious debate extending over several years.  During that time our sheep industry suffered from uncertainty although our access to the French market in recent years was of immense benefit. The completion of the sheepmeat policy represents a very definite achievement. It means that our sheep industry can now face the future with greater certainty and confidence.</P>
    <P>Sheep farmers who have hitherto been at a serious disadvantage compared with producers of other products are now on an equal footing with them.  They now have as good a support system as applies to other products.  In addition, there is provision for a special support to compensate producers for any reduction in prices that may result from the opening up of the Community market.  As I announced last week, this will take the form of a headage payment on ewes which should amount to about £7 per ewe in a full year.  There will be no limit on the number of ewes eligible for the premium and it will be paid without regard to the producer's income.  Apart from this there will be unlimited access to all EEC markets and there will be improved opportunities to develop exports to third country outlets.</P>
    <P>In my view, the outlook for the sheep industry is now more satisfactory than at any time over the past few years and I look forward with confidence to an expansion in production.  In particular I see improved prospects for the mountain sheep producers especially where adequate attention is given to management and feeding practices.  I would urge mountain producers to concentrate on improving the management and feeding <Col N="690" /> of their flocks.  With greater attention to these aspects they can derive substantial benefit from the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The support for sheep meat provides for private storage and for intervention. The question of having or not having intervention was one of the most hotly debated items.  Some countries, looking at the cost of intervention for products such as beef and and milk, were reluctant to have intervention for sheepmeat and it was only after long argument that they agreed.  This again reflects the very difficult budgetary situation being faced by the Community.  I would hope that the market will remain sufficiently strong to enable us to avoid intervention.  Incidentally, when intervention is used there has to be a cut-off in the amount of the ewe premium; in other words, the compensation through the ewe premium would have to stop at the point where the interventon would take over.  However, if intervention has to be used, used it will be, but I do hope that our hopes for a continuing good market will be realised. The first reports we have to hand from the market this week show a heartening increase in producer prices.  I hope that this position will be maintained and indeed improved further.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to some criticism of the arrangements which the Community have made with third country suppliers such as New Zealand and Australia.  Any such criticism is not well-founded. It was essential to have agreements with these countries.  Otherwise, we could not have had a lamb regulation. The first essential in any common market system for a product is protection for Community production.  Because of a GATT agreement made in the sixties imports of lamb were guaranteed for third country suppliers in unlimited quantity and with a bound customs duty of 20 per cent as the sole frontier charge.</P>
    <P>The enlarged Community had to accept the same obligations.  To enable a common market system to be introduced it had to be possible to limit the quantities coming into the Community and so it was agreed with the supplying countries that they would voluntarily restrict their supplies. <Col N="691" /> In return the Community undertook to reduce the duty from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  Also these countries are agreeing not to send their lamb into sensitive markets in the Community, that is, into France and Ireland.  These arrangements with third country suppliers are also due to be reviewed in four years time.</P>
    <P>The new regulation also provides for refunds on exports to third countries.  I am anxious that these should be available and I am continuing to press the Commission for them.  However, it is only fair to say that in the negotiations with overseas producing countries regard had to be had to their fears that subsidised Community supplies would hit them in their traditional markets.  This is a sensitive aspect and we have to be careful about it.</P>
    <P>Before finishing on sheepmeat I should like to say again how glad we are that we have at last achieved a common market system.  It is a workable and useful system and with the benefits it provides Irish producers and processors can look forward to an industry increasing in volume and in prosperity.</P>
    <P>We continue to make progress in reducing the incidence of bovine TB and Brucellosis.</P>
    <P>At this juncture, the advances made in eradicating brucellosis look particularly encouraging, and in the light of recent trends I have recently decided to extend the full compulsory eradication programme to the entire country.  The results from the current round of testing in the 17 counties of the free and clearance areas show the herd incidence to be 2.8 per cent and the animal incidence at 0.39 per cent.  These compare with 4.5 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively at the end of the last round.  I am satisfied at this stage that we can look forward to the virtual total eradication of brucellosis from the national herd within five or six years.</P>
    <P>The progress in eradicating TB is less spectacular.  The first results from the tests now in progress show a marginal improvement on the last round.  Nevertheless, the indications are that the last <Col N="692" /> residues of TB could prove difficult to eradicate.  An all-out effort on the part of all concerned will, therefore, be necessary during the next couple of years to get on top of this disease.</P>
    <P>I have been keeping the operation of the eradication programme, and particularly the 30-day pre-movement test, under continuous review.  In this context the first consideration at all times must, of course, be to ensure that there is no disruption of our export trade in cattle and beef.  The 30-day test is enshrined in EEC Directives relating to trade and it is not, therefore, open to us to drop it unilaterally. Member states whose own disease situation is much better than ours are entitled to protect themselves against the risk of introducing disease.  On this account it is not possible for us on our own to contemplate dropping the 30-day test at this juncture.</P>
    <P>I did in fact take a hard look at the 30-day test shortly after I became Minister for Agriculture and decided then to ease the problems being encountered in some cases, especially by exporters of live cattle, because of the 60-day interval required between retests for TB.  I reduced that interval to 45 days subject to certain conditions and this has proved a useful concession.  I undertook also to ensure that the results of brucellosis blood tests would get back to farmers with the minimum of delay.  In so far as the work at my Department's laboratories is concerned that undertaking has been met.  There is no delay and the system is working well.  I am aware, however, that in odd cases problems are still occuring for various reasons such as delays in despatching samples to the laboratories. I will be taking these problems up again with the veterinary profession to ensure that the interests of herdowners, particularly those wishing to sell cattle, are protected.</P>
    <P>I hardly need to emphasise again that the eradication of TB and brucellosis is vital to protect our exports of cattle and beef.  Since time is running against us, we have no room for complacency.  If, however, we achieve the progress that we ought to achieve we could then consider <Col N="693" /> the possibility of securing some relaxation of the tight regulations that are necessary at present.</P>
    <P>There have been other significant developments on the domestic scene.  I have shown my concern for the plight of the small farmers by, for example, increasing the level of headage grants. Indeed, as I shall be indicating in more detail later, I have made two increases in the headage rates this year.  Early in the year I announced the re-introduction of the Mountain Lamb Extension Subsidy Scheme and here again the rate of subsidy was increased recently.  It was in fact doubled&mdash;going from £1.50 to £3.  The producer price of liquid milk was also increased by 5p per gallon during the year.</P>
    <P>As regards the current difficulties in farming, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I have had a number of meetings with the leaders of the farm organisations.  We have not shirked the issues in any way.  The measures we have introduced are the real evidence of our commitment and determination to help the farmers in their present difficulties. In particular, we are concerned at the implications these difficulties have for producer confidence, and for future development and expansion of this vital sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Within the existing financial and other constraints, the Government have provided for a range of measures to alleviate current difficulties and to promote renewed investment and expansion in the industry.  A major objective of these measures is to encourage expansion of the national breeding herd, particularly in the western counties.  This expansion is essential to the future well-being of agriculture and the economy as a whole. Arising out of the Government discussions with the four associated banks about the present position of farmers' indebtedness, the banks indicated that they will take a constructive and positive approach to the restructuring of existing loans on a case by case basis where farmers are faced with serious repayment problems.  The banks consider that this, coupled with the recent reductions in <Col N="694" /> interest rates, should substantially ease the position.  Following an approach from the Government, the ACC are reviewing the situation of farmers with serious repayment problems and restructuring existing loans, where appropriate, on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>At the same time, in order to increase the incentive and facilities for productive investment in agriculture, the associated banks, arising from discussions with the Government, are making available up to £50 million from foreign borrowings. This will be lent to farmers at variable interest rates currently in the range of 13 to 13½ per cent.  The types of investment covered will include additional working capital where the farmer's own funds are seriously depleted, the financing of increases in breeding stock, land reclamation and drainage, fodder storage and building for additional livestock and assistance to young farmers taking over holding for the first time.  This new scheme, together with that already in operation by the ACC, makes available £100 million for the development of agriculture at rates well below those prevailing today and will give a substantial boost to farmers investing in farm expansion programmes.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that these schemes work effectively, two liaison committees are being established between the farm organisations and the banks and with the ACC.  It will be the task of these committees to ensure that the schemes for restructuring and for productive investment operate in practice in accordance with the spirit in which they have been set up.</P>
    <P>Investment under the Farm Modernisation Scheme and the Western Drainage Scheme has continued at a high level this year.  The Government welcome this as showing confidence by the industry in its future and as a valuable source of employment.  The continuing high investment has inevitably put pressure on the system.  As much as £15 million extra has been provided to meet outstanding claims for grants which had been approved and for which the work had been completed.  This will bring the total <Col N="695" /> expenditure this year to £51.5 million, an increase of more than 50 per cent on last year.  All the indications are that interest in the scheme is being well maintained. In fact, the level of approvals so far this year is appreciably higher than for the same period last year.  In the first nine months of 1980 the number of approvals issued for new buildings and land improvement projects was 35,700 involving an investment of £126 million as compared with 32,400 approvals representing £112 million investment in the corresponding period of 1979.  The substantial increase indicates that farmers have faith in the future of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The improved rates of grants which I announced on 1 August, under both the Cattle Headage and Beef Cow Schemes, have recently been increased a second time by £10 to £32 and £28.  The new rates will apply to this year's headage payments and are approximately double last years rates of £17 and £13.  They will provide a strong incentive to expand the beef-breeding herd and so counter the downward trend which has applied for the past six years or so.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, a beef suckler subsidy was approved as part of this year's price package.  This scheme has now been introduced.  A grant of £13.18 financed by the EEC will be paid on cows in beef suckler herds in all parts of the country with an extra grant of £12 paid out of national funds on each additional cow in a beef suckler herd.  These new measures constitute a further significant encouragement to expand the suckler herd. These measures should ensure a greater degree of security for our beef industry as regards the procurement of raw material. Taken together with the headage grants a farmer in the disadvantaged area can now get as much as £57.18 for an extra beef cow.  This is certainly a worth-while incentive.</P>
    <P>There is great need for farm relief services especially for dairy farmers.  With a view to encouraging the provision of such services on a more organised basis, the annual grant to Macra na Feirme will be increased for five years to enable that body to organise and co-ordinate the <Col N="696" /> establishment of local farm relief services on a group basis.  Part of the grant will be to provide for central organisation and administration and part will be to assist the formation of groups at local level. This will help generate new jobs in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The package announced last month also doubled grants under the Mountain Lamb Extension Scheme, as I have already mentioned.  This scheme has been of considerable benefit in getting lambs off the mountains for feeding in the lowlands.  I believe that the vast bulk of the mountain lambs have in fact been sold off.  The package also provided for assistance towards this year's campaign against the warble fly, and is enabling farmers to have their cattle dressed for the same charge as applied in 1979.</P>
    <P>Strong representations have been made by the farming organisations about the difficulties of farmers, particularly those in the £40-60 rateable valuation category.  As a once-off measure, because of the decline in farmers' incomes the Government have arranged that for farmers in this category the second moiety of this year's rates will not be collected.  Also for farmers in other categories, the local authorities will adopt a sympathetic attitude towards individual farmers who clearly have temporary difficulties in meeting their rates liabilities.</P>
    <P>These various measures show the determination of the Government to see that the agricultural economy develops in all its sectors.  As well they reflect the Government's concern for the farmers' current situation and their willingness to do what is possible to help.</P>
    <P>While the prices fixed in Brussels determine the general level of the EEC market, they are subject to the efficiency with which products are processed and are sold in the market place.  It is in these latter respects that we will have a substantial leeway to make up.  The prices realised for Irish farm products are below those of many of our competitors in the EEC.  Of course, our geographical situation imposes additional costs on us, but these do not account for all, or even the larger part, of the difference between <Col N="697" /> prices for Irish farm produce and those realised by farmers in other member states.  I am not happy with this situation in the context of our membership of the EEC.  The discrepancy in prices is consistently too wide and it is unacceptable that Irish prices should be so low.  It is my intention to raise this matter at EEC level in order to eliminate any factors in the management of the CAP which contribute to this situation.  On the other hand, some of the difference is directly due to the practices followed at farm level&mdash;for example, in the types of beef cattle which we produce.  There is also the question of the efficiency with which the produce is processed and marketed.</P>
    <P>The main farm products are exported either directly through marketing bodies on which farmers are represented, such as Bord Bainne and the Pigs and Bacon Commission, or are subject to promotion and market development through a semi-State body such as CBF, again with farmer representation.  It is vitally important for us to improve our marketing as we need to gain the maximum value from our produce in view of the increasing difficulties in securing adequate price increases at EEC level.  No matter how efficient production is at the level of the producer much profit is lost if marketing is not efficently done.  We have some examples of efficent marketing and when I say efficient I have in mind, in particular, centralised marketing.  We have the case of Board Bainne which engages in centralised marketing in a very efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I make this point in order to contrast that situation with the situation in regard to pigmeat.  Here I am sorry to say that we have a marketing system which leaves very much room for improvement.  Our total availability of pigmeat for export is quite small but nevertheless there are people in the processing industry who insist on exporting comparatively minute quantities of bacon as an independent exercise and without any effort to co-operate with the majority of processors who are willing to conduct centralised marketing.  I might also say that those who insist on going it alone are quite <Col N="698" /> prepared to reap on the home market the benefits gained from the co-operative effort of the majority of processors.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to those people outside the centralised marketing system to join in the system which is, of course, entirely voluntary.  By so doing they would be helping the whole industry not only in regard to the maintenance of the present trade but in efforts to change over to more added-value types of products.  The pigmeat industry has been going through a bad time.  The main export market in the UK has been weak and the industry has been suffering from the problems that I have referred to earlier about marketing. It is a very important industry and over the years has undergone considerable change especially in the level of pig production.</P>
    <P>Production is concentrated nowadays in large intensive units.  Similarly on the processing side there has been some rationalisation, though I would add that there may be room for more in order to improve the efficiency in processing.  I am very much alive to the present problems of the industry and in recent weeks I have had a number of meetings with the various interests.  I have been considering ways and means of helping the industry over its current difficulties and I shall again be meeting all the interests concerned at the beginning of next week.</P>
    <P>With a view to furthering the drive for increased agricultural exports, the Agricultural Exports Co-ordinating Group was set up in 1978.  The group supplements and co-ordinates the export promotion activities of the existing agricultural export agencies and acts in liaison with Córas Tráchtála.  The Government have made available a sum of £75,000 this year to finance suitable promotion projects and this sum has been matched by an equal contribution from the agencies themselves.  Most of this money is being used to pay for advertising campaigns for Irish food products in two countries&mdash;France and Germany&mdash;in which the group had already carried out surveys.  Other projects are at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>Dairying is the sector in which there <Col N="699" /> has been the greatest development over the past decade.  Productivity and output have expanded dramatically with the result that dairying now rivals beef in its contribution to total agricultural output. The value of dairy exports at over £600 million a year is a clear measure of the vital importance of the sector to the economy as a whole.  The dairy sector has not, however, been any more immune than other sectors to the adverse effects of recent economic difficulties.  High interest rates and inflation affect dairy farmers in the same way as all others.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an additional consideration arising in regard to the milk sector.  More than any other group, the prosperity of milk producers is affected by the decisions taken in regard to the Common Agricultural Policy.  Unfortunately, the substantial surplus in the milk sector&mdash;to which admittedly this country contributes only marginally&mdash;is causing severe problems and is a major factor in pushing the level of Community expenditure towards the limit of its present resources.  It still has some way to go before the VAT limit of 1 per cent is reached but the pressure of milk expenditure is nevertheless greatly influencing the drift of policy.</P>
    <P>The only real solution to these problems lies in the restoration of a better balance in the milk sector on the one hand and a re-organisation of the Community's financial base on the other. These developments must eventually come, but in the meantime more short-term and cruder solutions are likely to be put forward.  In the price negotiations last spring, I opposed the imposition of a superlevy on creameries which increased their intake or on farmers who increased their deliveries, but an increase in the general levy had to be accepted.  This was somewhat less for producers in the disadvantaged areas and the overall effect of the settlement was a net price increase for the industry generally.  However, the basic problem in the milk sector remains and, therefore, we can expect further proposals to deal with it.  The Government fully appreciate the need to solve the surplus problem but in our view <Col N="700" /> remedial action should not penalise or discriminate against our underdeveloped industry.  We cannot and will not accept artificial barriers to the development of the dairy industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Moreover, action to restore balance should not be confined to Community producers alone.  It should also apply to imports from outside the Community.  In other words, all suppliers to the Community's market must share the burden of solving the milk surplus problem.</P>
    <P>With that approach, I believe it will be possible to reach decisions at Community level which will not frustrate our development aspirations.  Accordingly, if we keep our own house in order, we can look forward to renewed expansion in the industry.</P>
    <P>For a large majority of Irish farmers dairying remains by far the most profitable farm enterprise.  All the information available to us proves that by somewhat better management and higher stocking rates we can dramatically improve output and incomes in the dairy sector.  The Government will continue to do all in their power to ensure that the environment, both externally and domestically, is such that this improvement is encouraged. With a sound processing and marketing base, I believe that we can expect substantial development in the industry in the coming years.</P>
    <P>This year the problem of obtaining a realistic price for farm products has become much more acute.  Prices for most farm products are not as satisfactory as we would like, in spite of all the efforts we have made to realise an improvement. Cattle prices have, however, held firmer in the past month than at this time last year, and I hope that this position will be sustained over the coming months.  The level of activity in the cattle and beef industry is higher than last year.  So far cattle disposals are up by 36 per cent.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year the cattle market generally is, of course, affected by the seasonal increase in supplies of finished animals.  This year there have also been the effects of the economic recession. In particular these adverse conditions have affected the price of heifers. On top of these, there have been the <Col N="701" /> British animal health controls which hit the traditional export trade in blue-grey heifers.  Because of these factors, some action to help the heifer market was called for and so pending the necessary clearance of the EEC Commission for the resumption of intervention for heifer beef I decided recently that heifer slaughterings by the meat factories should be allowed to count in the weekly calculation of the amount of beef taken into intervention.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this alternative measure will have the effect of strengthening the market price of heifers and indeed of steers also, as well as boosting producers' confidence.  It is intended only as a temporary measure to alleviate the current weakness in the heifer market.  I have made it clear that in taking this step I am conscious of the need to discourage the slaughter of any potential breeding stock.  The heifers likely to be slaughtered over the next few months would, however, be slaughtered in any event and would not be used for breeding.</P>
    <P>Farm incomes depend upon not only the level of prices and costs, but also the level of output.  For this year the present indications are that net output will increase significantly, possibly by 8 per cent to 10 per cent or so and thus regain all the ground that was lost last year.  This would come from a small increase in gross output and a substantial saving in the use of inputs, particularly feedingstuffs. While farmers will be seeking to reduce unremunerative inputs, it will not solve our problems if they go too far in adopting low input/low output production systems. The higher net output would, of course, help towards overcoming the problems faced on the prices side.</P>
    <P>As regards EEC prices, the increases in recent years have not been at all adequate to compensate for farmers' cost increases.  This situation cannot continue. Farmers should receive returns for their products which would maintain their incomes and enable them to keep their enterprises operating at proper levels of efficiency.  I can assure the House that I will be insisting on substantial price increases for the coming year.  I am confident <Col N="702" /> that there will, in fact, be a more realistic attitude in Brussels on this issue. Several other Ministers of Agriculture will have the same interest as I will have because the current farm income problem is not confined to Ireland but indeed affects most of the Community.  At the same time we ourselves must strive to improve efficiency and productivity at all levels from the farm to the market place. The introduction of new grants for ewes and beef cows together with the much higher headage payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme provide a strong incentive to increasing beef and sheep breeding herds.  I have no doubt that farmers will respond and increase the numbers of breeding stock.  This is crucial if we are to expand output over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Considerable investment and improvement has taken place at farm level in recent years.  Individual farmers are better geared than ever to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.  The investment must be properly applied and not left idle.  As I have already said, there has been a substantial increase in applications under the Farm Modernisation and Western Drainage Schemes this year.  This shows that there is underlying confidence in the future of the agricultural industry and that farmers are prepared to demonstrate that confidence by investing their own money in the improvement of their holdings.</P>
    <P>The establishment of ACOT marks an important development in agriculture. This new organisation is intended to give a greater degree of cohesion and direction to our advisory and education service. I am confident that it will succeed in providing a top-class back-up service to farmers.  I have mentioned that we must improve productivity.  This can be done by improving yields, the quality of grassland, husbandry methods and a general raising of standards in the whole range of farming activities.  ACOT is the ideal organisation to inspire and initiate this transformation.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing a great deal recently about the alleged need to reform the CAP.  There is always scope for <Col N="703" /> improvement and adjustment of such a comprehensive and complex policy as the CAP but I see no need for radical changes.  The policy should go forward, not backwards.  Forward progress would, of course, involve some improvements, such as eliminating the remaining monetary compensatory amounts and increasing the degree of preference on the market given to Community producers as against their competitors in the outside world.</P>
    <P>The day-to-day management of Community markets is the responsibility of the Commission in Brussels.  They are trying to carry out this formidable task in a prudent way within the limits of the financial resources available to them.  It is right and understandable that they should do so.  But there have been instances where undue restrictiveness about market management threatens to conflict with a basic objective of the Common Agricultural Policy, namely that of ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural community.  In such instances the welfare of farmers and the need to maintain their incomes at a reasonable level should not be compromised by an over-cautious approach to market measures.</P>
    <P>Those who demand basic changes in the Common Agricultural Policy are not thinking of progress.  They are thinking rather of dismantling the CAP and reducing its impact to a point where it would no longer have any chance of fulfilling the tasks assigned to it by Treaty of Rome.  Some opponents of the CAP are basically opponents of the whole idea of European integration.  They would like to see agricultural spending shifted from the Community to the member states and indeed even a return to a cheap food policy based on imports from abroad. Much of this is wishful thinking.  The days when Europe could exploit overseas agricultural exporting countries are over.</P>
    <P>With the steady increase in world population the day may come when food productive capacity will be as valuable as oil resources.  The opponents of the CAP conveniently ignore the effects the realisation of their aims would have in splitting <Col N="704" /> the Community.  Even more seriously, they ignore the integrity of the Community's achievements.</P>
    <P>It would be very childish to assume that, if farm spending were to be re-nationalised, the free market for industrial goods could remain intact or the powers of the European institutions untouched.  Those who seek to shake the pillars risk bringing down the roof; history would judge them harshly.  The best interest of Europe&mdash;and of Ireland&mdash;demand that the wreckers be opposed.  Of course, there are problems to be resolved in relation to CAP. Nobody denies that.</P>
    <P>At present the inflexible upper limit of 1 per cent VAT contribution restricts the Community's total expenditure.  That limit has become a serious barrier to the progress, and even the proper maintenance of the CAP.  There is only one answer and that is to raise the expenditure ceiling, thereby providing for improvements in other Community policies as well.  Amputation is not a response to growth.  The Community's resources will have to be brought into line with its real needs and dimensions.  Indeed, it would be irresponsible of us to set up a community of twelve without first having taken this essential action.</P>
    <P>The resolution of the problem of Community resources will take some time. This factor will complicate the 1981 farmprice negotiations in Brussels, as it did this year.  It is clear, however, that a substantial price rise will be needed to help Irish farmers to meet the income difficulties that many of them are experiencing. I will also want to see a significant cut in positive monetary compensatory amounts next year.</P>
    <P>We in this country have adjusted the green rate for the Irish pound so that MCAs no longer apply on our side.  But our exports to markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom are still subject to monetary charges in those countries which maintain green rates that are well below their market rates.  This position has arisen because of the strength of their currencies and I would hope that as part of the price settlement there will be some worthwhile adjustment which will reduce <Col N="705" /> the MCA charges on Irish exports to those countries.</P>
    <P>The need to revise land policy to take account of current and future needs has been a preoccupation of the Government for some time.  Changing circumstances in the agricultural sector, particularly since Ireland's accession to the EEC, have highlighted shortcomings in the present land settlement programme and have indicated a need for re-assessment of existing policy.</P>
    <P>Preparation of a White Paper outlining the Government's thinking on the necessary reforms is at an advanced stage and I expect that publication can take place within the next few weeks.  It is my intention to have discussions with all interested parties on the White Paper and to introduce legislation in the Dáil by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to underline once more that the Government fully appreciate the importance of agriculture.  We are genuinely concerned with the current difficulties being experienced by farmers. We are very keen to find acceptable solutions to these problems.  We have had high level discussions with farm leaders on the situation and we have announced a series of significant measures to provide relief.</P>
    <P>The Government are keeping the situation under continuous review and assessing fully the various proposals for alleviating the difficulties.  This is being done within the national and EEC context. The Government intend to match their concern for agriculture with as much action as is possible within their capacity. We share a desire with farmers and the agricultural industry as a whole to see agriculture develop and expand for the good of those directly concerned and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not propose to deal at length with the long statement of the Minister for Agriculture.  However, I would refer to his opening remarks in relation to Deputy FitzGerald's comment yesterday in the House relating to what went on at the meeting with the farm organisations.  I would point out that Dr. <Col N="706" /> FitzGerald was reporting what he read in newspapers which, by the way, had gone undenied up to now by the Minister or by any of the farming groups.  I welcome the belated denial by the Minister of any such pressure being brought to bear on farm organisations.  In the circumstances there is no reason for the Minister to demand an apology from Dr. FitzGerald or anyone else on this side of the House. I am now commenting on the fact that the Minister for Agriculture has denied this allegation belatedly, because it has been in the newspapers for some time.</P>
      <P>A debate of this type affords this House an opportunity to discuss the many aspects of the economy affecting every one of us.  We have been treated by members of the Government to three-quarter-hour dissertations on what Fianna Fáil have done and what they now plan to do in a kind of vague statement. The Minister for Agriculture has treated us to a long dissertation on what he has been doing in his Department.  What our farmers need, first of all, is a recognition of the pitfalls and the problems, an admission of failure where something has been tried and failed and, more importantly, the offer of some solutions to those problems having recognised them. This is where the Minister has fallen down.  He has not been able to offer the kinds of solutions that would satisfy the farming community.  Indeed looking back through the sheaves of scripts of Government Ministers since yesterday one is struck by the absence of the kinds of solutions necessary if we are to get over our present economic crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of debate affords us an opportunity to discuss these things and make constructive suggestions as to what might be done in an atmosphere of co-operation and understanding.  We are talking here about economic and social ills, educational problems, industrial problems, problems across the whole spectrum of the economy affecting every one of us in this House and indeed every Irish citizen today.  Hopefully I will concentrate on two main issues concerning the economy, that of financial management which includes prices, and the industrial sector which would cover <Col N="707" /> unemployment and job creation.  On the question of prices let me say that this Government undertook three-and-a-half years ago, in a famous document known as the Fianna Fáil Manifesto, sub-titled &ldquo;Action Plan for National Reconstruction&rdquo; to introduce measures which would control prices which they maintained had not been done by the National Coalition Government.  For a short period that Fianna Fáil Manifesto was a prescribed document which every Fianna Fáil Member of the House&mdash;and I am sure outside it&mdash;was expected to read and indeed possibly commit to memory.  That was in the prescribed days.  For some time now we have entered the proscribed days in which I do not think it is now the done thing in Fianna Fáil to refer even to this document known as the Fianna Fáil Manifesto. Let me say that every Member on those benches opposite is there because of that document and the promises contained therein.  They are now endeavouring to discard everything in it hoping that the electorate will have memories as short as theirs in relation to that document. For example, on prices, there was a full chapter devoted to how Fianna Fáil, in government, would ensure their control. They would restructure the National Prices Commission making it more effective. Government policy would be directed towards discouraging increased costs and prices in all areas where they had control or influence.  Not only have the Fianna Fáil Government failed to exercise that control and influence where they have had it but have gone out of their way, through their policies, to add price increases, to increase inflation.  The example is known to everybody in this House and outside it&mdash;a 4 per cent increase in inflation brought about by domestic policies adopted by Fianna Fáil in their last budget.  Nothing in that 4 per cent can be put down to increases from outside, in the case of oil costs and so on but rather to purely internal domestic policies adopted and pursued by them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in this House my colleague, Deputy L'Estrange, elicited from the Taoiseach a reply in relation to price increases of the list of commodities <Col N="708" /> included in the CPI, increases from mid-May 1977 to mid-August 1978.  Looking down that long list one cannot but be struck by the vast increases which have taken place despite the assertions made in the Fianna Fáil Manifesto that measures would be taken to control prices and ensure that nothing slipped through that was not proved to be essential to the well-being of whatever industry sought the increase.  In that period, for example, the price of bread rose by 71 per cent, flour by 46.1 per cent, butter by 24.1 per cent, fresh milk by 63.2 per cent, tea by 42 per cent, coal 65 per cent, bottled gas 80.7 per cent and mortgage interest rates by 66.5 per cent.  Indeed there are higher ones than those but I do not want to go through the entire list.  Those are but a few of what I regard as the basic necessities of life which our people are forced to purchase to survive.  Yet the Fianna Fáil Government are prepared to allow massive increases take place.</P>
    <P>Confronted with the same problem when the National Coalition were on that side of the House five years ago what did they do?  They introduced subsidies. Indeed Fianna Fáil boasted that it was they who forced them into the introduction of such subsidies in 1975.  I have heard them shout that from the roof tops, that only for Fianna Fáil the National Coalition would not have introduced those subsidies at that time.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil gave, as the two basic reasons for the introduction of the subsidies, the falling standard of living and a large increase in inflation.  When Deputy O'Donoghue was Minister for Economic Planning and Development on at least five or six occasions I have heard him give the reasons why in 1977 and 1978 the removal of subsidies was appropriate and the introduction of further subsidies was then wrong because there was at that time a falling inflation rate and a rise in the standard of living.  Now we have the reverse.  The very factors which Fianna Fáil at that time said were necessary for the introduction of food subsidies are present.  We have had inflation of over 20 per cent this year, although now it is just under 19 per cent.  We have falling real <Col N="709" /> incomes and a reduction in the standard of living.  Yet, what do Fianna Fáil do? They allow increases of 40, 50, 60 and 70 per cent on the price of basic commodities necessary for survival.  No talk now about subsidies.  If they were on this side of the House, they would be shouting from the roof tops.  Have they any intention of reintroducing the subsidies, subsidies removed by them, to alleviate the hardship on our poor and less well off who are suffering severe hardship because of the enormity of the increases being allowed by a Government who said they would control prices.</P>
    <P>On the question of financial management, Fine Gael, commenting on the budget in February last, stated that the Estimates for receipts and expenditure on which the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, based his calculations were suspect.  Now, with threequarters of the year gone by, it is painfully and regrettably obvious that these suspicions were only too well grounded.  We now find the economy in worse shape than ever before in the past 25 years.  We have inflation running at 19 per cent, unemployment on the increase&mdash;something about which I shall talk later&mdash;and a severe loss of confidence in industry, agriculture, fisheries and any sector of the economy one cares to mention.</P>
    <P>A national understanding has recently been negotiated by the social partners which seemingly will do nothing to improve either inflation or employment and, indeed, little to restore the confidence which is so badly needed for our economic recovery.  On that issue of the understanding, on 25 June 1980 the Taoiseach, speaking in the adjournment debate in this House said:</P>
    <P>The single most important economic decision facing the community today is the level of incomes we agree to accept over the next 12 months or so.  This decision is central to our whole economic and financial future.  We cannot carry income increases which are out of line with those which have been accepted in Europe generally.</P>
    <P>Has the level which has been negotiated <Col N="710" /> been the same as that obtaining in Europe generally?  I suggest that it is much, much higher.  Indeed, let me say that our workers are entitled to their pound of flesh, but we cannot have jam on both sides of our bread.  If the Taoiseach says we cannot survive in the hothouse of European competition unless we bring down our demands to the levels obtaining elsewhere and then literally bulldozes his way through the social partners to get an agreement at any cost, then somebody must pay the price.  This national understanding will, unfortunately, do little for either our inflation rate or employment.</P>
    <P>A Taoiseach who can say that and three months later pat himself on the back in a PR exercise on television for having pushed this understanding through himself because he wanted it for his own glorification does not inspire confidence, since he says one thing and does something else.  The effects of what we see happening now will, in the long run, cause severe hardship to many thousands of people.  Our rising costs, as a small country, will&mdash;as is well known to industrialists, employers and employees &mdash;blunt our competitive edge.  Economic growth, for example, this year will be around 1 per cent and the present prediction for 1980 hovers around the 1 to 1½ per cent level.  What this means, in practical terms, is continued unemployment.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment, we have had promises at regular intervals about what the Government are doing to generate employment.  Yet unemployment continues to rise.  The manifesto said that tens of thousands of jobs would be created from the exploitation of natural resources.  One is at a loss to know where these jobs have gone to.  Last Sunday I was at a church gate in the Donegal area listening to a senior Minister telling his audience that the Government were now creating more jobs and that more people than ever before were being employed.  The Minister was telling this to people whose sons, daughters, wives or fathers were becoming unemployed or were going on a three-day week in a <Col N="711" /> certain Donegal town.  These are the kind of unconvincing arguments which are being made and this is treating the electorate with contempt.</P>
    <P>When the new Taoiseach took office he raised expectations because his track record was such that it was felt he could do something.  Since he has become Taoiseach there has been a downward trend of 27,000 jobs.  There are over 107,000 people unemployed and yet the Ministers will go around Donegal in the next few weeks and tell us how rosy everything in the garden is.</P>
    <P>The announcement of an increase in our exports has been turned around to show that the industrial sector is in a very healthy state.  It has been correctly said that there is a 20 per cent increase over the past eight months in industrial exports.  There has been a 20 per cent increase in value.  What we have not been told is that translated into volume terms that becomes an 8 per cent increase and we were not told that 8 per cent is made up of two sectors in the economy, the export of meat and live animals which showed a 43 per cent increase, and the major increase in the export of electronies. If these two sectors are taken out of the whole spectrum of industrial exports there will be a decrease in the rest.  In relation to the export of live animals and meat it is well known that we are exporting more than we are producing and the net result will be a drop in our national herd so that in 12 or 18 months' time we will reap the bitter harvest of that export. The Minister has the gall to tell us that the farmers are showing confidence in the Government.  The farmers are selling their stock not at a reasonable price but at cut price just to survive and the Minister says that confidence is being restored.</P>
    <P>On the question of imports, we were told with fanfares loudly screaming that our balance of payments has come into line.  On scrutinising that figure one will find that the balance of payments is reducing and that the gap between exports and imports is closing only because the investment is not there, as has been said by at least two Members in <Col N="712" /> this House today.  Industries are not purchasing machinery, raw materials for further production or half-processed materials. At any given time those two sectors would account for something like 60 per cent of our total import bill.  Our import bill is down because activity in these sectors is not what it might be.  In industry we have what is called capacity utilisation. If industry is at full capacity it is using 100 per cent utilisation.  For the past three months industry has been working to 60 per cent of capacity.  Up to May of this year it hovered around 65 per cent to 70 per cent but now it has shown signs of dropping.  That means that industry is working at less than two-thirds of its capacity.  That explains the closing gap in our import-export bill.  That is serious, yet the Taoiseach and the Ministers will appear on television and dish out figures to an unsuspecting public about how well we are doing without any clarification or explanation as to why the figures are as they are; but explained they will be. There is no growth in industry at the moment except in electronics, which is a new industry.  That had to grow because the pace was so slow that anything would have been an improvement.  However, that industry is in a healthy state.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments is reducing for the reasons I have mentioned, and worse still, if we look further into the figures we will find that while the lack of machinery, raw materials and half-processed materials for further processing is there, it is absent in our import bill.  What is increasing, albeit by a small margin, is finished products, consumer durables. They are going up and that means we are importing more of them.  Because of our reduced disposable real incomes within the country we are buying less of them at home.  That is another reason why our capacity utilisation in industry stands at 60 per cent and is dropping.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industries, the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been consistently warning us of the importance of competitiveness in foreign markets.  The Taoiseach warned us of this <Col N="713" /> and pointed out the lunacy of seeking pay increases which would help to blunt that competitive edge.  There are firms who can afford to pay this and stay within the terms of the national understanding but we must remember that of the 4,600 firms operating here 4,100 of them employ fewer than 100 people.  Those small firms who even in normal circumstances have cash flow problems will be the victims of this level of agreement that has been negotiated.  That will lead to further unemployment.</P>
    <P>The IDA, as they have always done, will do their utmost to ensure that at the end of the day there will be a net gain of jobs on the ground.  Last year the IDA succeeded in putting something like 1,000 jobs on the ground, jobs created as against jobs lost.  This year it is unlikely, unfortunately, that the IDA will succeed in showing a net gain because since Deputy Haughey, of whom so much was expected, took over job losses have been running at the rate of 3,000 per month. That level of job losses has persisted through the summer months at a time when seasonally adjusted figures should level off.  However, this year they did not.  For example, in August, there was a 3.8 per cent increase in employment and roughly 4,000 job losses for that month.  We can expect that to accelerate, judging by past experiences over the winter months.  I have no doubt that the IDA will reach their target in 1980, but even if that happens and the IDA succeed in creating 30,000 jobs the net result will be a minus at the end of the year because job losses will outrun job creations.</P>
    <P>What is being done to curb this downward trend?  I recall earlier this year, when interest rates were 20 per cent plus, appealing to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, and the new Taoiseach to take immediate action to ensure the retention of jobs.  The Taoiseach, in the course of his statement on the adjournment debate on 25 June last, mentioned that he and his Cabinet were considering the prospect of relieving the pressure on industry. At that time at least 20,000 jobs had gone down the drain.  Many of those jobs could <Col N="714" /> have been saved had the Taoiseach and his Cabinet introduced some form of relief scheme to reduce the burden of exorbitant interest rates.  At the time of the budget we were told that this year regardless of any pressures that came to bear on the Government, borrowing would be brought into line.  As far as I can recall, the budget figure was about £890 million which was needed to carry us through this year.  However, we now find that the figure will be exceeded by about £200 million.  In other words, we are talking about a miscalculation of about 22 per cent by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised at that miscalculation because there is no comprehensive economic plan.  I listened to Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Health and when he was in Opposition demand a comprehensive economic plan. He felt that such a plan was necessary if we were to keep our finances in order and push forward in the right direction. What did he do on assuming the position of Taoiseach?  He sacked the man who was appointed to introduce an economic plan.  Deputy O'Donoghue was fired by the new Taoiseach and, to add salt to the wound, the Department of Economic Planning and Development was abolished. If that is not a U turn I would like to know what is.  It is because of the lack of such a comprehensive plan that the Taoiseach and the Government are stumbling from crisis to crisis week in and week out.  One week they have to meet representatives of the farming community because the pressure is getting too hot and the next week they must meet some other group.  They stumble from one crisis to the next, but to pay for their incompetence and bungling we must borrow.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Government realised how serious things are.  They should draw up a plan that will alleviate the pressure on certain sections of the community. The pressure which now exists extends across the whole spectrum of Irish society. For example, I have yet this year to meet any sector or any individual in it to tell me that he is happy with the performance <Col N="715" /> of the Government.  Yes, the diehard Fianna Fáil supporter will tell you that they have problems but of course Fianna Fáil have no control over the cost of oil or the cost of imports.  He will try to make excuses but he cannot deny that there are terrible problems that are causing him hardship.  We have gimmicks. For example, the Minister for Agriculture spoke about the confidence now to be seen in the farming community.  We have restructuring of loans for farmers. He said:</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Government discussions with the four associated banks about the present position of farmers' indebtedness, the banks indicated that they will take a constructive and positive approach to the restructuring of existing loans on a case-by-case basis where farmers are faced with serious repayment problems.</P>
    <P>That does not mean anything and the Minister knows that.  The Minister for the Environment six weeks ago announced that he was asking county managers to take the same reasonable and constructive view of farmers who could not pay their rates.  That message was never brought down to county managers' level. That was six or seven weeks ago and there is no county manager today who is carefully and reasonably examining the problems of ratepayers in his county because his job is to collect rates.  I wonder what the message to bank managers means on this case-by-case basis.  At the end of the day they have discretionary power to say: &ldquo;In your case we cannot restructure your loan because of A or B or C&rdquo;.  That means nothing, as the Minister knows.  We have the Minister praising himself about the zeal with which grants are being paid despite the increase in applications.  Every member of the House is aware of the kind of letter emanating from the Minister's Department saying that because of pressure of work there will be some delay in the payment of grants.  Yet we are told today by the Minister that everything in the garden is rosy and that confidence is being restored.  What does he think we are?  We had the Minister of State who is <Col N="716" /> now in the House announcing an airport per week in principle but of course he made no commitment in money terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Deputy saying he does not want these airports to materialise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want money to show your commitment to what you are saying. Let us forget about &ldquo;in principle&rdquo;.  I want commitment in money terms, not in terms of principle.  I am not surprised at the current economic and social mess that we have.  The Taoiseach was looked upon by many thousands of people as the saviour of the country but he is finding it very hard now to save his own skin because in his management team, the Cabinet of which at least two-thirds did not vote for him to become Taoiseach, he cannot open his mouth without looking over his shoulder to see the reaction. There is disunity, disharmony and dissension in that Cabinet.  He cannot grasp the nettle because it takes too much time to save his own skin.  That is the problem that is at the base of our current crisis.</P>
      <P>It is very strange that last Sunday one of his Ministers spent at least two minutes of his five-minute speech trying to convince the public in Donegal as to how unified the Fianna Fáil Cabinet was. Unless there was some disunity in the Cabinet why should he spend 40 per cent of his time in this way?</P>

      <P>: There are seven million people unemployed in the European Community as against five million in 1975.  Our unemployment figure has not reached anything like the figure reached during the last period of Coalition Government. Whatever Opposition Speakers may argue, since we came back to office certain categories were put on the register that were not there before and they have helped to inflate the unemployment figure.  We are not comparing like with like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is interesting to note that inflation here has not risen to anything like the level it reached in 1975 when it was around 26 per cent.  When a recession hits the rest of the EEC and when we have seven million unemployed against five million in 1975 we see that we have weathered the storm better under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have always been very proud of being the best defenders of the less well off sections of the community. They always fared better under Fianna Fáil than under any Coalition Government.  In three years of Fianna Fáil Government the real value of social welfare benefits has increased by about 25 per cent.  People who depend on social welfare have also benefited from many improvements along with this.  We can certainly hold our heads high when we say that we are protecting the weaker <Col N="718" /> sections.  In contrast to our 25 per cent real increase in the standard of living, there was no improvement whatsoever during the 4½ years of Coalition Government because their increases were swallowed up by inflation.  During their 4½ years, inflation was 100 per cent whereas inflation has been only a little more than half during our 3½ years.  Therefore, the standard of those depending on social welfare has continued to rise.</P>
    <P>As far as the workers are concerned, under Fianna Fáil their living standards have been protected by pay rises, tax cuts and increased social welfare benefits under the national understanding, in contrast to the period of the Coalition when living standards fell, in some cases drastically, particularly in the case of skilled and middle income groups.  The wage agreements in 1976 and 1977 provided for pay rises which the cost of living increases rendered worthless.</P>

He has been suggesting that Deputy Haughey has not the support of the party, that he was only <Col N="719" /> elected by such and such a percentage. The Leader of his own party spoke here yesterday and there were not more than six Fine Gael Deputies to hear him.  If he had heard Deputy Ryan here this evening he would have thought that Fine Gael had two leaders.  We on this side have been playing down many of these things. We know they exist and so does Deputy O'Toole.  The Labour Party also have their problems.  I have always said that we need an Opposition that could provide a good alternative government if called on by the people.  Unfortunately, the people do not have such an alternative, fortunately maybe for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>: Deputy O'Keeffe, the king of the interrupters, has arrived.  The main theme of the speeches from this side of the House has been the need for stable industrial relations, something which everybody should be encouraging. Unfortunately we get comments outside from Fine Gael and Labour members trying to harm the work we are doing. They are mocking the national understanding yet they will say when the agreement has been signed that they are very glad, that it is for the good of the country. They should be encouraging the Government in their work and wishing them well.  When we were in opposition we put up alternative policies to the then Government which very often they acted on, but six months after they should have acted, as in the case of the devaluation of the Green £.  Every day I meet people&mdash;I have always prided myself as being very close to my constituents&mdash;but I have not found anywhere anything like the anger that was expressed during the reign of the Coalition Government because of the way they mishandled the economy.  I am not being unfair when I say that individuals of the Coalition Government were hated by some people.  They could not go anywhere without being boohed or heckled. There are no hated figures in Fianna Fáil.  Unfortunately that cannot be said in this House because we all know that Deputy Cluskey seems to have a fixation on the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>: I always like to bring a little sparkle into the debate.  In the recent oil drivers' dispute everyone was champing at the bit for the Government to do something, but the Government went through all the procedures a Government should.  All the industial relations machinery that could be gone through was gone through.  It was seen by <Col N="722" /> the public and the trade union movement that when the Army were finally brought in the Government had no alternative. Congress was satisfied that the Government were justified in the circumstances in bringing in the Army.  There was extremely close co-operation.  I am very proud of the industrial relations this Government have with the trade union movement and workers generally.  This has always been so, but we have seen it more in action this year than any other.</P>
      <P>One of the exhortations which has come from this debate to the people is that in the new national understanding they must abide by the agreement that has been reached.  There must be full use of all the industrial labour machinery. There must be full co-operation with the unions.  Last year unofficial strikes cost us £100 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is rubbish and they will be the first to tell you in due course.  The prophets of gloom are all very busy.  As stated yesterday by the Taoiseach, we have a population that is growing seven times faster than the average for the European Community.  While most of those populations are static, and in some cases dwindling, ours is increasing. About 50 per cent of our young people are under 25 years of age and that presents a formidable task for whoever is in Government.  We are conscious of our responsibility to these young people. There are many work programmes to help them which were not available during the period of the last Government.</P>
      <P>In relation to the cost of fuel, this year we spent between £250 million and £270 million more on importing oil.  Such a figure would have bought all the oil the country required in 1973.  That is a very sobering thought.  The ESRI recently brought out another of their gloomy forecasts.</P>
      <P>This is a body which over the years has been extremely inaccurate.  For example, in regard to growth in GNP for 1975, in October 1974 they predicted a nil growth. By March 1975 they had changed that to ¾ per cent growth.  By June 1975 they had changed to minus 1½ per cent growth and by October 1975 they had predicted a drop in GNP of 3½ per cent.  In January 1976, looking back on the last year, they predicted that when the figures were published it would be about minus 2¾ per cent.  The actual figures were an increase of 0.3 per cent.  The significance is that they were over 1,000 per cent wrong in their predictions.  These forecasts made every few months are notoriously inaccurate and have a way of being either up or down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the problems we have with economists.  They are always saying if this or that happens.  They never deal with realities but reckon on perfect conditions. My late father used to say that figures cannot lie but liars can figure. Anybody can do anything they like with figures, but what counts is when the figures <Col N="724" /> are published.  When the latest ESRI report came out it made the headlines. This was the big story.  I have no faith in their predictions at all.  I am basing that lack of faith on their previous history.</P>

In a market which is going through a slump in OECD and EEC countries our phenomenal growth rate is something of which we should be proud.  Deputy O'Toole tried to belittle the fact that we had electronic industries.  We are glad to have them and to have young people with the education and talent to go into these industries.  We are proud that foreign industrialists can come in, build factories and invest money here.  Compare that to the time of the Coalition when investment was at a standstill.</P>
      <P>The creation of new jobs in the present climate is nothing short of a miracle and great credit is due not only to the Government who set the guidelines but also to the IDA who have done a wonderful job selling the country and letting people know what is available.  What we want badly is for the word to go out that Ireland is a good country to come to because we have stable labour relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister for Energy here today referred to the development of alternative fuels as sources of supply for this country.  The people must be absolutely clear in their minds, and I am quite sure that they are, that this Government <Col N="726" /> have embarked on a policy of trying to reduce their dependency on oil.  They have embarked in a very vigorous manner on energy saving.  I have some suggestions which I hope the Minister might incorporate as part of his policy.  First of all it is very important that a register of heating contractors, central heating firms, firms who instal solid fuel boilers and so on should be set up.  I am aware that there are a number of charlatans going around taking money from people who can ill afford it to convert their heating systems, and their work is not very good.  This is one of the first things that the Minister should consider and I hope that very soon he will have a register of these heating engineers and that any persons or firms will have to be authorised before they can offer their services in this regard.  The heating engineer who installed my heating system told me that some of the cases he has come across are pityful.</P>
      <P>We need also a fuel advisory service in Dublin and in most of the other major centres where people can seek advice regarding the burning of fuel.  This practice exists in the UK where it is very successful and where advertisements advise people to go to their local fuel advisory centre.  This is very important and a lot of money can be saved by people who are burning the right fuel and learning how to conserve their heat.  At the moment the only advertising that I see on television here in this regard is by the ESB advising people to lag their pipes and so on.  But the ESB are saying, &ldquo;Buy from us&rdquo; and I consider that in many instance the ESB provide very unecomomical form of heating because they are the biggest users of oil in this country. We must try to reduce that dependency on oil by using as little of it as possible. It is difficult for a company like the ESB to sell their products while at the same time trying to conserve oil.  The Minister for Energy has referred to the converting of some of the existing stations and building of new power stations to use heat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated his interest in fuel efficiency and he has set up at the Department of Energy a section which will be dealing with sectional utilisation <Col N="727" /> of fuel, such as use of energy in industry, agriculture, services, public buildings and particulary in the home.  That &ldquo;particularly in the home&rdquo; is important and I ask that the Minister will translate that into a fuel advisory office.  There should not be any great difficulty in getting a place in Dublin for this purpose.  One section of the IIRS which is not really developed is the home heating section.  They have been giving good advice and when I was converting from oil central heating to solid fuel I got very helpful advice from them, but they are not really geared to that.</P>
    <P>The figure is up this year over last year and we have no guarantee that the price of oil is not going to go up next year, and there is not a thing that we can do about it.  We have no influence with OPEC or any of the big countries and we all know that each will be fighting for his own corner.  It is extremely important that we are at all times preparing for the worst to happen.</P>
    <P>Another policy of this Government which has had an effect much greater than people expected was the setting up of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation. It was very opportune that they were there in the recent crisis in which they played a very important part.  It is fair to say that the Opposition did support the Government when they announced the setting up of this and I am willing to give them credit that they did not oppose it.</P>

      <P>: The inflation rate is moving downwards and it has come down very rapidly.  The increase last quarter of 3 per cent was the lowest such increase since the November quarter of 1978. Inflation will be going down to around 18 per cent for this year, and this is very desirable.  If we are not subjected to further increases in the price of oil and, following on that, pay increases to try to make up the difference&mdash;Deputy O'Keeffe was smiling at my slip of the tongue.  He will recognise that it was a slip of the tongue in the right direction.</P>

Deputy O'Keeffe has reminded me that inflation here is still lower than that of our neighbours across the water in spite of their North Sea oil and, goodness knows, they have not felt any pinch from the increases in the price of oil from OPEC countries.  Their pound is very high and this helps us considerably.  There have been critics who have said that if only we had stayed out of the EMS and remained tied to sterling we would see how much the IR£ would be worth.  The IR£ has more than held its own against the other European currencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not.  I am satisfied that we have a Government who are experienced and capable of handling the present situation.  I am satisfied we have a leader who will not panic.  This is important. This Government are aware of the economic climate.  They know where difficulties are being experienced and they are assisting in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of 1980 we said this would be the toughest year from a recession point of view.  Sometimes economists talk in such high-flown language that it is very difficult for ordinary people to understand them.  Perhaps I could explain what happens in a recession. Every time there is a recession I dig out this story.  In 1966 when I was going on my first trip to America my late father gave me some tips as to what I should say.  He said if I was asked if Ireland was going through a recession I should tell them that when he was visiting the United States in 1956 he too was asked that question. His reply was that only rich countries <Col N="730" /> had recessions; Ireland was too poor.  He said that I could tell them that Ireland had prospered so much in the last ten years that we were experiencing our first recession.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows, as prosperity grows the greater the recession.  One does not have to be a trained economist to know that that is a fact of life.  During the next six to 12 months while we are going through the worst of the recession, the people should exercise more self-discipline; wage demands must be kept within certain levels; deals made in the national understanding must be kept by all; and the trade union movement must ensure that unofficial disputes are quickly sorted out.  They should impose the authority which the people except.  The Government too recognise they have a vital role to play in this area.</P>
    <P>Many people feel unofficial disputes should be outlawed.  I share that feeling but it must be done in a certain way.  The penalties imposed on the unofficial striker must ensure that there is no profit for him.  For example, his union card could be torn up, under law he should not be able to get another union card and no union should accept him.  That could be one possible solution.  We are not putting the man in gaol, merely warning him in advance that no union will allow him to become a member if he has been expelled from another union.  I am not sure when we will have calmer times to introduce legislation in this area.  I have always been told that times of difficulty are not always the best times to impose new laws because people tend to be much more emotional.</P>
    <P>I hope this time next year we will have come out of the recession.  The Government said they are in a position to take full advantage when the recession is over. Foreign industries are still being set up here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: I heard a Labour Deputy tonight call for a November general election instead of a by-election.  He made a good case as to why there should be a change of Government, but what frightened me was when I looked at the alternative. When thinking about the last three years in office of this Government, one cannot forget that the rot that is now so evident had started a few years earlier.</P>
      <P>This Government must take the rap for the present situation.  The new Fine Gael leader, despite all his publicity and travelling all over the country, has made only destructive criticism.  While that might be all right for a backbencher like myself, it is not good enough from the leader of the main opposition party who, if the present Government were displaced, would be the alternative leader of the new Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we have a general election I would like to see a very much improved operation by the present Government. Whether they admit it publicly or not, I am sure they know they can and should be able to perform better than they are at the moment.  Not only would I like to see that happen in the next 12 or 15 months, but I would like to see the leadership offering the alternative Government presenting some concrete, positive proposals that could be demonstrated to be capable of curing the ills of which he is so rightly condemnatory.  I might not have made these comments were it not for the fact that I find myself in the rather awkward position of having ten minutes here this evening and of having to continue tomorrow for thirty-five minutes, a fragmented situation which leads one to speak, perhaps, too quickly and not in enough depth.  While it would appear that there is a legitimate reason for a Labour <Col N="732" /> Member to suggest that there be a general election instead of a by-election the leadership that would be the alternative offering is not putting forward proposals that would cure the ills for which the Member concerned has condemned the Government. For the benefit of the country as a whole I should like to see, within the next 12 to 15 months, an improvement and a greater effort on the part of the Government to show better form than they have been showing in recent times and also more positive proposals and less destructive criticism from those who would put themselves forward as an alternative Government.  In particular there might be less personal abuse of the leader of the Government at a time when there is so much more work to be done.</P>

      <P>: The task facing us requires the best efforts of the people on the front benches of all parties.  That is the sort of effort that is required even if, from a party political point of view, it might not be in the interest of some of the parties. I say that such an effort is required in the light of the unemployment situation and of the signs once again of emigration, emigration that the Minister of State opposite and myself know all about.  I remember emigration in its worst possible form and I remember also the unemployment of those times.  The situation was so bad then that the unemployed person who could raise enough for his fare out of the country was considered to be the lucky one.  However, that is a situation that has not been evident for some time, particularly during the past 15 to 20 years.  We had reached a stage where the lack of confidence which was evident in our people and which was due, perhaps, to our history and to the almost dire poverty not only of decades but of centuries, had disappeared.  That inferiority complex began to disappear only in the mid-fifties and from then on there was gradual progress with, of course, the ups and downs that are experienced at such a time.  But I fear that if we continue to operate as we are operating now, we will slide gradually downwards.  Indeed <Col N="733" /> all the indications are that that downward trend has begun.  If this trend is not reversed the bad days of which I have been speaking may be experienced again.</P>
      <P>People on the Government benches have used the argument that there are seven million unemployed in the EEC. Perhaps if I were on those benches I would make better use of that argument but when one has regard to the situation in these countries&mdash;I am referring to the mainland of Europe rather than to the UK and ourselves&mdash;one finds a much higher level of wage structure and as a result a much higher level of social welfare structure and, consequently, a capacity for those peoples even when unemployed, to weather the storm for longer periods than is the case in our country.  All of these other countries are better off than we are and they have been in that position for a long time.  That is why they are better able to cope with an unemployment situation.  We do not have the fat on our backs from which to draw when times are bad.  Any fat we had has been used up with the result that we are now in the position of having to borrow to meet the repayments on previous borrowings. I am not against borrowing as such but I am totally against it for the purpose of paying the housekeeping costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: Luckily we are not living in the situation of 50 or 60 years ago when the attitude during a depression was that the workers could starve but for how long will the contributions of those who are fortunate enough to be at work continue to be adequate to provide for those who are out of work?  For how long will the employed be able to bear the tax burden that must be imposed on them because of the unemployment situation?  I think we have reached the crossroads in that regard.  We are borrowing for current expenditure purposes.  In substitution for <Col N="734" /> this borrowing I would suggest that we borrow for capital development.  This is being done already but too much of the money is being used to cover the cost of the housekeeping with too little being devoted to capital expenditure.  I appreciate that valiant efforts are being made to build up various industries despite the problems that beset our economy, but the inflow into the bucket is leaking out because of there being a hole in that bucket.  Therefore, we must not only increase the inflow but endeavour to stop the leak or, at least, to reduce it substantially so that the net change is upwards and the balance is in our favour.</P>
      <P>I should like to have seen the overtarget figure of £279 million being borrowed for the construction industry, a course that I advocated during the election campaign of 1977 and which I have advocated in various places since.  I am advocating it even more strongly now though it may be too late.  When one considers the numbers who are unemployed and when one considers also the skills and the expertise at our disposal, one realises the scope we have for such projects as public buildings, school extensions, road construction, water and sewerage schemes and so on, all of which, while they would entail some additional imports, would cost less than most of the other ventures that we could embark on and could not only put a great number of our unemployed to work but would provide the infrastructure that will have to be provided anyway in the years ahead when the cost will be much greater.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive information concerning the number of physically disabled children and adults is not available. Arrangements are being made for the compilation of detailed registers in each health board community care which will provide this information.</P>
      <P>In so far as the physically disabled in institutions are concerned the information sought is not available.  Apart from the Cheshire Homes which cater mainly for a number of the physically disabled in the younger age groups, there are no institutions which cater solely for the physically disabled.  They are cared for in longstay institutions, hospitals and homes&mdash;both health board and non health board.  A survey of physically disabled persons in residential care, which is under way at present, will provide the information sought.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The available information on the total number of mentally handicapped persons together with details of the numbers in <Col N="596" /> institutional care are given in replies to questions Nos. 348 and 356.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(iii) Physically and Mentally Handicapped</i>:</P>
    <P>The 1974 National Census of the Mentally Handicapped found that 763 or 9.3 per cent of the total of 8,138 in the mild, moderate, severe and profound range of mental handicap in residential care were also non-ambulant.  The census also found that 360 or 7.4 per cent of the total of 4,863 persons over the age of four in the moderate, severe and profound range of mental handicap, who were not in residential care, were also non-ambulant.</P>
    <P>A further census of the mentally handicapped is to be undertaken in 1981 by the Medico-Social Research Board.  This census will give comprehensive up-to-date information on the various categories of mentally handicapped.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the conditions necessary for qualification for mobility allowance: whether certain disabled persons are excluded by such conditions; if he will give details of the numbers in receipt of such allowances and the annual cost to the Exchequer (i) of the scheme at present and (ii) if the excluded classes were included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The scheme of mobility allowances for handicapped persons applies to persons in the age group 16 to 66 years who are living at home.  However, an allowances once granted will be continued after pensionable age as long as the person meets the basic criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a means test similar to that which operates for the purposes of the disabled persons maintenance allowance, that is, that by reason of disability the applicant is unable to provide for his <Col N="616" /> maintenance and his spouse, if any, is unable to maintain him.</P>
    <P>The basic medical conditions to qualify for payment of the allowance are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The applicant is unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or is in such a condition of health that the extra exertion required to walk would be dangerous.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The applicant must not be forbidden for medical reasons from being moved.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The applicant must be in a position to benefit from a change in his surroundings.</P>
    <P>The total number in receipt of mobility allowances at 30 September 1980 was 655.  The annual cost of the allowances for this number is approximately £100,000.</P>
    <P>I am not clear what excluded classes the Deputy is referring to.  If he has in mind persons otherwise eligible who are in residential or institutional care, it is estimated that the additional cost, if the scope of the scheme was extended to them, would be approximately £30,000.</P>

    <P>The 1974 census of the mentally handicapped enumerated a total of 3,882 mentally handicapped persons in centres not catering solely for the mentally handicapped.  A breakdown of this figure between children and adults and also by health board area is not readily available.  Preparations are at present underway for a further census of the mentally handicapped to be undertaken by the Medico-Social Research Board in 1981.  This new census will give a breakdown of the various categories of mentally handicapped still in these centres.</P>

    <P>The total number of mildly mentally handicapped persons in the State is not known.  The 1974 national census of the mentally handicapped did, however, enumerate a total of 1,845 mildly mentally handicapped persons in residential care.  There are numerous problems associated with counting mildly mentally handicapped persons.  For instance, mild mental handicap with borderline mental handicap, merges into the normal population in such a way that it is difficult to separate them.</P>

      <P>: The general position with regard to the nature and location of further community workshop facilities for the handicapped is under review at present in the light of the substantial expansion of such facilities over the past five years.  The situation in the Dublin area is being specially examined at health board level in consultation with the Rehabilitation Institute.</P>
      <P>As regards provision for the mentally handicapped, further training and sheltered workshop facilities are planned at the following locations: Dundalk, Cootehill, Portlaoise, Athlone, Tullamore, Drumcar, Bray, Celbridge, Tralee, Limerick and Letterkenny.</P>
      <P>The time-scale for the provision of these new facilities will depend largely on the availability of funds for capital developments. The major new residential developments in planning or building for adolescent and adult mentally handicapped will also include training and workshop facilities.</P>

      <P>: Daily signing on each of the five working days of the week is the statutory requirement for claimants who live within two miles of their nearest local office of the Department.  This may be relaxed from time to time where the situation in the local office does not allow of its full implementation.  Daily signing, however, is in operation in almost half of the Department's 122 local offices and is widespread throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in County Donegal is in line with the practice in the rest of the country.  Daily signing in County Donegal is in operation at four of the eight <Col N="632" /> local offices.  In the remaining offices relaxed signing arrangements are in operation under which claimants living within two miles are required to sign on four days of each week.</P>
    <P>The frequency of signing at local offices is kept under constant review and modified from time to time where circumstances so require.  The normal daily signing on five days a week was reintroduced in two local offices in County Donegal, where signing arrangements had been relaxed due to the postal dispute and its aftermath, in October 1979 in one office and in January 1980 in the other.  In September 1980 four days a week signing for persons within two miles was introduced in two local offices.  This represented a reduction from five days a week signing in one office and an increase from two days a week signing in another.  In all these cases the changes were made in the light of the number of claimants and of the particular circumstances at each local office.</P>
