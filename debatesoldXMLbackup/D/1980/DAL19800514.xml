      <P>Yesterday by way of Private Notice Question I tried to raise the matter of the present dispute in RTE which is affecting certain television services. I was refused permission to raise that matter and I should like if the Taoiseach or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister for Labour would intimate the moves being made by the Government to settle the dispute. Will the Government make a statement on the matter?</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that it was the Government's proposal that the White Paper be taken with this debate on the Finance Bill.  At two hours notice it was put to us that the White Paper should be discussed and, in those circumstances, I presume the Government will deal with some of the points in it.  It is reasonable to ask when.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has suggested that the proposal in relation to the discussion on the White Paper did not come from the Government side but my understanding is that an official on the Government side put this to us and proposed it.  It was not our suggestion.  In those circumstances the Government have an obligation to deal with the White Paper in one way or another.  The Taoiseach seems to have been misinformed about this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I dealt with the question of interest rates and their effect on the commercial life of the country. Unless action is taken with regard to escalating interest rates we will have ever-increasing unemployment problems. Businesses that are committed to expansion on the basis of certain interest rates are now finding they cannot meet their commitments.  We are all aware of the number of concerns that have gone to the wall and those that are threatened with closure.  The situation is catastrophic.  It is obvious that there is a split in the Cabinet in relation to this matter because the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism spoke of taking action regarding the banks while the Minister for Finance felt it was outside his control.  The latter Minister expressed the view that he was not in a position to do anything.  We have a mixed formula in regard to interest rates and no definite policy to cope with such a serious problem.  Something must be done to help business concerns that are committed to expansion.  We are all aware that once one gets on the slippery slope it is hard to recover.  High interest rates also result in an increase in the cost of living index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government seems to be standing aimlessly by without any leadership, letting things happen around them.  One instance is house prices which in the past year have gone up 24 per cent.  In the public sector housing programme, in the largest local authority area, Dublin, we have an increase of roughly 7 per cent. House prices are up 24 per cent and there is an increase of 7 per cent, and from this one can see the dramatic cut-back in public sector housing.  One is told that house building and construction are going ahead but in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning the head of the construction <Col N="1549" /> industry, who would not be called a critic of this Government is now very critical and talking about a collapse in that industry.  This is because high interest rates are crippling expansion. Unless something is done in this sector there will be very serious unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is no use in blaming other sections of the community.  The Government have a responsibility.  There are areas in which they can act but are taking no action whatever apart from some cosmetic exercises.  The Minister spoke of a radical improvement in regard to income splitting.  That was not something of the Government's making but was imposed on them.  One must consider this seriously.</P>
    <P>To qualify for an SDA loan one must have less than £5,500 a year but the repayments over a 30-year period are £1,500.  One must earn little and yet pay very high interest rates.  I am surprised that there is no provision in the Finance Bill for some form of low rise mortgage scheme that would tide people over the few critical years in which they have to borrow.  Apparently, no thought was given to that and consequently we are rushing head on into very serious problems.</P>
    <P>Wage negotiations were mentioned by the Minister who said he hoped the demands would be modest and that there would be no inordinate pay increases. We all hope that sanity and good sense will prevail but it has to be a two-way exercise. Unless the Government show goodwill and positive leadership and are prepared to take action where necessary to control escalating costs and high inflation, there is no point in them lecturing here.</P>
    <P>When one of the backbench rural Deputies on the Government side was speaking yesterday I wondered if it was the policy of the Government now to send in people to attack the trade union movement.  On several occasions that movement was used as a whipping boy. We were told the trade union movement <Col N="1550" /> should be responsible, that it should be this and that as if there was only one side to any problem.  Of course there are two sides.  Trying to use the trade union movement as a whipping boy for the Government's problems is wrong and dishonest and will not be tolerated.  It is not in the best interests of trying to achieve a national understanding if we have this type of attitude created.  We see today industrial disputes in which the Government could involve themselves but are not doing so.  They stand by; indeed, some of their actions are responsible for a measure of the industrial disputes we have at present.  I very much resent anybody here putting the finger on one side only of industry.  This is the kind of talk that will set up divisions and make it harder for people to get together in the best interests of the country. Wherever I find this happening I shall attack it.</P>
    <P>The same speaker said that all we did in this area was complain bitterly without making any concrete proposals and if we all worked together the country would be better.  I remind the speaker and the House that this party brought out a policy on industrial democracy and industrial relations working together and this was lauded by the trade union movement and by industry.  We are playing a responsible role as Opposition and responding very much to the needs in this area.  I am surprised at such an attack from the far side of the House.  Who prompts it and is concerned with it?  I find it hard to accept attacks, whether direct or by innuendo on the trade union movement.  Trade union bashing will have to stop.  We must get people talking so as to sort out existing problems.  Let us not isolate a particular group and say they are responsible for all our ills when we knew well that is not so.  We know where responsibility rests.  It ill behoves the Government to send in Deputies to engage in that sort of activity.</P>
    <P>This Government will be known as a Government that acts only when it has to.  When pressure comes on it responds to events whether a High Court decision or action by some other body.  They will <Col N="1551" /> then bring in legislation.  Until that happens they seem to be prepared to indulge in public relations exercises without any real, positive programme for economic development.  Deputy Kelly tried to raise the matter of the White Paper but that White Paper now seems to be ditched and to be an embarrassment to the Government and not what they want.  If only we knew what they wanted we might be able to help and advise but we do not know what the Government want.  They set up an inter-departmental committee who published a very comprehensive report dealing with the malaise, the social, economic and educational problems of Dublin inner city, and which could be related to all the other cities and major urban towns.  It was a very good and refreshing report. The members of the committee put their finger on the problems.</P>
    <P>Last year an amount of money was allocated for development.  This indicated that something might happen. This year there is no mention of any money being allocated for that development. Therefore, it would appear that the question of urban renewal, or inner city development, or doing something for the people who reside there to improve their prospects of employment and education and their prospects for decent housing is not being dealt with.  This all seems to be cast to one side.  This is a very serious situation.  We also had reports from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation on related issues.  The gardaí and sergeants also issued a report on how to deal with certain problems in the inner city.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to have no sense of direction.  People will become cynical about committees and commissions if they are set up to procrastinate. If that is what they are set up for, it would be better if we did not set them up at all.  It would be better to say we are doing nothing.  It is better to do nothing than to raise people's hopes and expectations and then dash them.  It is farcical to appoint commissions to put off the dreaded day hoping that in a couple of <Col N="1552" /> years there will be an election and that will get the Government over the hump.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thinking we have from the Government today.  They are not watching the country.  The country is of little relevance.  They are wondering when the next election will be held and how they can best prepare for that day. That seems to be the Government's preoccupation.  That is sad when there is so much to be done and when we need to channel the goodwill of people and organisations to prime our economy to take off and eliminate our unemployment problems and the social ills which are a consequence of unemployment. That is not the question.  It is a question of how the Government can get by and work on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>This type of insincerity is bedevilling politics in Ireland.  We have had experience of it since the last election.  This rubs off and people tend to treat this House with total disregard.  It brings odium on this House and people lose confidence in it.  This should be put right. We can do that only if we are honest and forthcoming and let people know the hard facts.  If the solutions are thought out and packaged properly with the right type of incentives, the Irish people will respond.</P>
    <P>Since the last election the Government's attitude has been that their job is to give handouts and to give people what they are looking for.  They cannot hope to get any response to that because people feel they have been deluded with false promises and let down.  There is no point in lecturing them now about their responsibilities when the Government are not taking their responsibilities seriously.  That is why we have the problems we have and that is why we are not getting a response.  There is a wave of materialism in our society.  People tend to make demands.  Can we blame them when that climate was created for them?  I do not think we can.  The blame rests on the party who inculcated this attitude into the people's minds.  Now they have to live with it and face the consequences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> As a result of cutbacks the whole area of local authority activities is totally under-financed.  Yesterday mention was made of potholes.  They are one symptom of the general breakdown.  In a Dublin area 200 jobs were at risk because of the cutbacks.  They have been saved because of pressure from the trade union movement and the opposition parties here and in the corporation.  As I say, 200 jobs were to go by the board, but political pressure was brought to bear and the Government changed their minds.  This is the type of politics we are getting.  This is the type of government we are getting, government by response. They take a decision and wait for a response.  If there is no response, they go ahead.  If there is an adverse response, they do an about turn.  That does not get us anywhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a positive policy on economic thinking in a White Paper so that we could make constructive proposals from this side of the House. There are no proposals.  The Government do nothing in the hope that things will get a little better, but they are not getting better.  This morning the head of the construction industry was talking about a decline in the whole building industry. If the building and construction industry is in decline that is a barometer showing that the whole economy is in decline.  The Government seem to be prepared to sit back and take no action.</P>
    <P>The serious cutback in the public sector housing will be felt.  This year we got an increase of £2 million on the £30 million we got last year which is infinitesimal. The rate of inflation is 24 per cent and we get a 7 per cent increase. One need not be too bright to understand the effects that will have on the major building works.  Interest rates will have serious effects on any development. Therefore, proposed developments will be put back until interest rates are more tolerable than they are.  Without wishing to be a prophet of doom, the situation as I see it is very grim.  If we are to have regard to the Minister's brief we may take it that it is not his wish to talk about the White Paper because all his brief <Col N="1554" /> contained were some remarks on sections of the Finance Bill.  He has no blue print for the economy and this situation is leading us into very serious trouble.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Finance Bill to export sales relief for the construction related service industry. This is an industry that we have been building up for some time and in which we are doing quite well in selling our expertise abroad, particularly in Middle-East countries. Will this industry be included in the special export tax relief arrangements until 1990 or will it be covered within the 10 per cent corporation tax?  We need this information in terms of the future of any new company that may become involved in this industry.  Any such company would need to know what incentive they will get.  The development of this type of company is a fairly complicated business.  The company must draw on various aspects of engineering, electronics and so on.  As a relatively new nation we can be proud of our success in this area so far.  This service industry has a two-fold effect because, apart from the selling of the actual expertise, the people involved are also selling the country in terms of our export potential.  Those people who buy the expertise from us will realise the high technology that is available here and, consequently, would be likely to look to us as a country capable of exporting to them some of the goods and services they need.  Having regard to these various factors, I will ask the Minister to ensure that provision is made for the construction-related service industry by way of tax relief.  However, this is a matter that we can go into in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another area of our economy that is in trouble is the tourist industry.  This is mainly because of escalating costs here. It appears as if this industry will be hit hard this year.  The Government, therefore, must examine the whole situation thoroughly with a view to ascertaining what can be done in this area.  While there is something to be said for asking our people to spend their holidays at home, if our tourist industry is to survive <Col N="1555" /> and be successful we must attract people from abroad.  The fact that more Irish people may spend their holidays at home may help the economy to some extent but it involves only a patching-up process and we need more than that.  The general attitude of the Government in regard to prices is having an adverse effect on the industry.  This is regrettable especially since it is an industry with such a high employment content as well as bringing into the country much needed currency. In view of our very serious balance of payments situation we should be doing everything to improve the tourist industry which might be regarded as one of our invisible earnings but prices are getting out of hand all the time.  People are scared by this situation.  In these circumstances it is imperative that special concessions be given in respect of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>If our escalating prices situation is not taken seriously and dealt with properly we will price ourselves out of every market.  We are living in a very competitive world but unless our price indexing is right and unless we can control inflation we shall continue to be faced with high wage demands and high interest rates, all of which will leave us increasingly less competitive on world markets.  This would lead to a serious situation in terms of employment.  The ESB have told us that we may expect a 10 per cent increase in the cost of electricity and the price of gas is rising continuously. The same applies to building costs and to food prices.  To take a small example, in the past week a bottle of orange increased in price by 20p.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that people are punch drunk or that there is so much discontent in industry?  There is no stability. Without stability in prices there can be no stability in the industrial relations area.  It is natural that people would want to maintain the standard of living to which they are accustomed and not see it eroded.  At present it is being eroded with consequent demands being made for wage increases, thus causing further industrial relations problems.  Unless the <Col N="1556" /> Government get the whole problem of price increases under control, no progress can be made.  They talk about the Continent but never mention continental inflation rates.  Had the Germans a 20 per cent or 25 per cent inflation rate they would have industrial relations problems but they have not because they are careful and monitor what is happening. They can control their incomes because they have controlled their inflation. We cannot control our incomes because we cannot control our inflation. The onus rests fairly and squarely with the Government who must respond to this challenge.  I accept that there must be certain price increases but the present rate of acceleration is getting totally out of hand, rendering money values useless and thereby creating more unemployment.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for not discussing his White Paper.  I suppose he cannot stand over it, or indeed anything written last year, because the Government have not made any real effort to come to grips with any development whatsoever.  They are living merely on a day-to-day basis hoping that the other side of the coin will reveal some improvement. This will not happen automatically.  We must ensure that it happens.  We must change our attitude, ensuring that we get our own house in order, that we are competitive, that we keep our inflation rate down, when wage demands will be less, which in turn will such time as the Government undertake some active policies in this respect we shall continue in this sad, weary way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Opposition speakers are having a field day.  They are forecasters of gloom.  Perhaps some of their criticism is justified, but it should not deflect us from our efforts to develop and expand agriculture and industry.  Credit institutions must be confident that they can invest in these areas, particularly in the export-orientated industries so necessary to keep the country going.  The Opposition are doing an amount of harm by referring to this gloom throughout the country.  This is a good little country <Col N="1557" /> with enormous potential for development. We must instil confidence in our people, reassuring them for the future, pointing out that the only way in which we can make progress is through increasing our output thereby lowering our production costs and rendering ourselves competitive on world markets.</P>
      <P>All aspects of taxation have been gone into in great detail in this Finance Bill. Many long hours were spent before the budget emerged and now the Bill itself. As an example of how thorough was the study in these areas, it was discovered that tax was being paid on matches with none on cigarette lighters, even though a substantial number of cigarette lighters have been purchased in recent years.  It is indeed heartening to see people putting such effort into the establishment of equality of taxation in as far as such is possible.  The Commission on Taxation set up will be reporting on this matter.  I suspect that by the time their work is completed we shall have an equitable system of taxation here.  The cause of most of the trouble in this area is that it is felt some people get away with paying no tax while others pay for them.  This Bill constitutes a first step towards equalisation.</P>
      <P>The last speaker mentioned the building industry being in a bad way at present.  When builders were given a free hand in the past couple of years house prices shot up.  At the end of last year when the certificate of reasonable value was introduced there were certain restrictions on the upper limit, which was £30,000 for building society loans.  Then the sky became the limit in house prices. When those restrictions were imposed the price of houses came down somewhat, in some cases by as much as £3,000, as was stated in a report published at the end of last year.  This time last year there was free access to money for bridging loans when the banks issued practically their whole allocation, which was an increase of 18 per cent on the previous year.  Some building took longer than expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their guidelines this year&mdash;14 per cent higher than the 18 per cent to which <Col N="1558" /> I have referred&mdash;they are being more rational, ensuring that people can get loans.  The money is there but they will ensure that it is spread over the entire year.  It is unfair to criticise institutions endeavouring to meet their commitments, as directed by the Government and the Central Bank, and which are also endeavouring to keep costs within reasonable limits.  Many builders who formerly built a normal-priced semidetached house when they found they could built luxury type houses without having issued a certificate of reasonable value moved into that market.  Prices escalated and it became fashionable to buy a house in certain areas without purchasers realising they were paying through the nose.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to farmer taxation.  In this budget the farmer with a £40 valuation is being brought into the net.  It has always been accepted that a £50 valuation farm was an economic one and that anything below that valuation was not.  It should be welcomed that the Minister is giving farmers with valuations between £40 and £50 the option of having simplified forms of accounts they can manage themselves and which will be accepted by the inspectors of taxes.</P>
    <P>Many people in the bracket of £40 to £50 valuation are really worried regarding extra rates that they fear they will have to pay.  If they simply add 10 per cent to last year's rates, that is what they have to pay this year.  In most cases, this would range from £100 to £150, perhaps as high as £200 according to their county and this amount can be offset against their tax.  Most farmers knew that the valuation would eventually come down to £50.  There is the need to pay an auditor but some will be exempt.  It is unfair to talk about how much extra farmers will have to pay, being in the tax net and a target for the inspector.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be complimented on providing a mobile unit service throughout the country to eliminate the farmers' fears.  Farmers are very conservative and are afraid of what they do not know.  If they know exactly the position, <Col N="1559" /> then it is not too bad; they realise how much they must pay and calculate accordingly. People should take advantage of these mobile units in asking for helpful information.  The staff will not be taking down details to be used against the farmer at a later date when he supplies his tax return.  These are completely different people.  The farming organisations are doing reasonably well in their dealings with the Minister and with the Revenue Commissioners regarding the problems which concern farm valuations.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition Government were in office and cattle prices went up roughly £100 a year, in their last three years, a farmer had the same number of cattle on his land but had that much extra capital tied in.  That extra £100 was counted as income and he was paying tax on what was really capital that went into the increased price of his stock.  He was not paying tax on what he had earned. The difference between what was sold and what replaced it is counted as the farmer's profit margin for income tax purposes.  The Coalition Government did nothing to relieve the farmers of that burden.</P>
    <P>This Bill is bringing in a 30 per cent limit on free depreciation.  The Opposition Members, and very often the farming press, have not spelt out in detail what is involved.  Before this one could completely write down a tractor in one year, just as an industrialist could write down new equipment or machinery completely in one year.  The idea of giving this facility to the industrialist was to create more employment.  New equipment would normally last from ten to 15 years, at least.  In the case of a tractor which is used quite a lot, it would be used up in perhaps three years, possibly four, through heavy work.  People began to use this as a tax avoidance system. They bought tractors and machinery, like combine harvesters, just to evade tax.  All those machines were imported, which worsened our balance of payments. One tractor bought by a farmer in 1978 has not yet had its second service. <Col N="1560" /> If it were a car, it would be serviced every thousand miles.  This tractor was bought purely and simply to avoid paying tax.  A person with only 100 acres of corn bought a £20,000 combine harvester, just to evade tax.</P>
    <P>One thing which has not been spelt out is that if you depreciate under normal circumstances, 25 per cent for a tractor and so on down the line to 12½ per cent for ordinary machines, you can exceed that limit.  This year the Minister has brought in a higher rate of depreciation for farm buildings and land drainage.  Both of these are labour intensive and will give higher production.  Cattle will thrive during the winter and more land will be made available for higher production through drainage.  That is the way this Government are trying to increase farming output under this Finance Bill and it is important that this message be got across to the farmers.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a farmer at the Maynooth sales last Monday who said he had arranged a development programme and had stopped it because he did not know the position as regards cattle for the present year.  He did not realise that our Minister was fighting a battle to get an extra 5 per cent which, in effect, would mean 3p in the £ at the end of the year.  He did not realise that farmers were paying too much last year for their cattle.  He said that he had bought a few cattle and asked his normal buyer what he thought of the cattle.  He was told that they were very nice cattle and would do very well for export but that £100 too much was paid for them.  That was in 1979.  He asked why that was and was given a simple reason.  English farmers at that time were unable to buy cattle here because they were priced out of the market.  That would result in a surplus of cattle towards the end of the year, with a resultant lowered price.  This position was aggravated, to a certain extent, by our factories in November dropping prices completely so as to get farmers to buy 8 cwt cattle, feed them in their yards and then put them out on grass so that the factories would have these cattle in June and July of last year. <Col N="1561" /> The people in the mobile advisory office who supply the information will be able to alleviate the anxiety which people have because we need to get confidence in agriculture and in industry.  This is the only way we will be able to make our country into what we would all like it to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the budget increased the figure liable for capital acquisitions tax from £100,000 to £150,000 in relation to land.  If a farmer signs half of his farm over to his wife it means that his son can inherit up to £300,000.  Any person inheriting more than that in land should pay a certain amount of tax.  We have to remember that in the case of inheritance tax it is the person who gets the money who pays the tax.  One son may get the property and other members of the family may get smaller portions.  If they are liable for inheritance tax they will only pay it on what they have actually received.</P>
    <P>In the case of farm land there should be some basis of valuation on the PLV. In the case of the capital gains tax there is a percentage increase for each year. Something like this should be worked out in the case of the inheritance tax.  I know of a farmer who is two years trying to get his farm transferred to his son. He is travelling between the Valuation Office and the Land Registry trying to get the matter cleared up.  This man was very disheartened it was taking so long to settle.  We should have the same system for capital acquisition tax as we have for capital gains tax.  A person like that farmer should have the option of going for the PLV or the real value of the land.  He would then know how much he could legally hand over without paying tax to his son who might be getting married and has an interest in the land. A farmer likes to know exactly what he can do.  He hates the haggling which can go on for months between solicitors and the Valuation Office.  Sometimes this can be caused by an inflated price because of ten acres or even 20 acres sold nearby at a very high price.  That may be quoted to the solicitor and the valuer, who is usually the local auctioneer.  Although <Col N="1562" /> there are discrepancies in the PLV it is about 95 per cent accurate.</P>
    <P>I ask the press to stop publishing the amount which people leave when they die as it gives a false impression in relation to town and country.  People in towns think that farmers are worth very large sums of money.  The press should only publish the idle cash which estates have, which is usually quite small.  When the value of estates is published the amount of money bears no relation to the income those people are getting.  I can give an exaggerated incident in relation to this matter but it is a true one.  I refer to a farm of approximately 200 acres.  About six years ago the family had a lot of sickness and the farmer came to me and said they were unable to meet the bills.  I approached the health board and said I felt that those people were entitled to a medical card.  The health board allowed that family a medical card for a year.  The farmer was doing very badly on the farm.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy?  I see the Deputy's point but I remember last year a farmer who had 80 acres won a big prize in the Sweep.  When RTE went to him to ask him how he felt about winning £250,000 plus £20,000 which his wife won for selling him the ticket his reply was that it was not a lot of money nowadays.  How does the Deputy expect city people to take seriously what he is suggesting when they can hear that over the radio?  Apparently an 80-acre farmer does not think £270,000 is much money.</P>

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Kelly later.  That family were under the health board for a few years.  Two years ago that man had a very bad heart attack and died.  His will was published last year and it said that his estate was worth £300,000.  Since I had met him and the date when it was published all the stock on that farm had been sold off to try to meet living expenses.</P>
      <P>The land was all set as well.  This goes to show that a will does not give a true reflection of a person's income. This type of thing creates bitterness between town and country.  The town people think that the farmers are rolling in money on account of the amount of property often left on the death of a farmer and they do not realise that the farmer's job was not giving an income any higher than the industrial worker's income.</P>
      <P>When the value of the farm was set, land prices were at an excessive level, £3,000 or £4,000 an acre.  At present land prices are a lot less.  It must be remembered that a farmer never counts the value of his farm, he just counts the income that he gets from it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must remember that 86 per cent of Irish farms are transferred to immediate family. Only about 2 or 3 per cent of farms are actually put on the market.  A person does not value his farm.  The Deputy said <Col N="1564" /> that a city person cannot accumulate capital.  A young person who gets married and buys his house will accumulate capital because his house appreciates in value as the years go by.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a freedom there and legislation could not be introduced to press people not to do it in the interest of having better relationships between town and country.  Idle money, money on deposit, in stocks and shares should be published but the property should not. <Col N="1565" /> I am a PAYE taxpayer as is everybody else in the House but I am also self-employed. A self-employed person has to give an account of all personal spending, on a car, on food and clothing to the inspector of taxes.  This involves a considerable amount of work.  For the PAYE worker the money is taken at source and they do not have to bother about that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>I know that leasing to industry has tremendous advantages but the Minister might consider making an amendment in the case of firms who are leasing cars. This system of leasing to industry has been helping to keep capital in industry and it must remain but a person working in a company can have the use of a leased car and can put it down to expenses whereas a person slightly lower down the ladder also paying PAYE has to provide his own car.  The owner or the partners in the company can avail of leased cars where the ordinary worker has to use his own.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill provides people with a structure within which to work to expand in industry and agriculture.  A number of previous speakers said that credit was restricted but credit is restricted only for certain personal items and in cases where it is best for the individual if he does not get credit.  Credit is restricted for certain reasons particularly in cases where, on account of the high interest rates a person may not be able to meet repayments.  Last year many people planned for interest at 10 per cent but when it came to 18 per cent at the end of the year they were in trouble.  When certain people cannot get credit they say that there is no money available.  It may be of interest to note that for every pound a farmer deposits with the ACC £3 is invested by city or town people. That goes to show that there is not the money people think there is in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good living for people in farming but we must become more professional, increase output and be more efficient in the way farms are run. People working on farms will then be able to be paid the same as those in industry <Col N="1566" /> as is the case on the Continent. We must be careful that farmers do not lose confidence.  Figures which I have show that in good years the amount of fertiliser used increased but in the period of 1974-75, which was a bad year for farming, there was a decrease in the amount used.  There was also a cutback in the amount of meal used to feed animals.  When we are in a bad position we should be trying to give more feed to cattle and increase our use of fertilisers to increase production instead of cutting back.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister are to be complimented in setting up the commission to work out an equitable tax system.  Every section of the community should pay their fair share of taxation and should be seen to do so.  It will help to get town and country working as a whole.  Credit is not available for personal spending.  It is worthwhile encouraging people to purchase our own products.  We buy more from abroad than we do from Irish industry and that should be the other way around.  Credit is available for industry and farming.  It has been increased by over 14 per cent since last year and will be spread over the whole year.  If credit is refused it is nearly always because the repayment would be too heavy on the person concerned. Because they were refused credit people should not go out and say one cannot get money now.  It is available for productive purposes and things that will get our country going.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill sets out to alleviate our tax problems.  There will be reports from the commission and in the next two budgets we will see emerging an equitable system of taxation that will meet the needs of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill and the budget which preceded it can best be described as a fly now pay later.  The questions we must ask ourselves are: who will do the flying and who will do the paying?  Are the same people who fly now going to have to pay later or will they be two different categories of people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> When we look at the small print in the Bill we come to the unmistakable conclusion that the people who will fly as a result of the provisions in the Bill are those who have always flown&mdash;the comparatively wealthy section of society. The people who will pay, and they will be lucky if they only have to be pay later and not now as well, are those who have always paid for some of the alleged improvements in our income tax and overall taxation arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is a truism that much financial management by Governments involves transferring resources from one sector of the population to another.  It is not widely realised that those transfers are often regressive.  There is an assumption that the job of Government is wholly involved with taking money out of the pockets of the rich, like Robin Hood is supposed to have done, and putting it into the pockets of the poor.  There is still not a widespread realisation of the fact that the process can quite easily be the reverse.  Sometimes it can be neutral and transfers can be effected from one sector of the population through the taxman's hands back to that same sector.  There is an in-built resistance on the part of people who have control over resources in our society to giving away or surrendering any more than they can possibly avoid.  I am not someone who believes that altruism is entirely absent from human affairs or economic behaviour but we would be unwise to assume that it is the sole or major motivating force behind the actions of people who control wealth and the political power that tends to go with it in our society.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk first of all about the provisions of the Finance Bill in relation to tax and income.  Here it is plain that in some respects the tax provisions of the budget will provide substantially greater cash benefits to the better off sections of our population than they do to the poorer sections.  To some degree this is inevitable as long as you have tax rates which fall short of 100 per cent. Those who earn more money will take <Col N="1568" /> home more money, and any easing of the tax bands and improvement in the allowances will increase these people's take home pay by a larger amount than it will increase the take home pay of the people lower down in the income scale.</P>
    <P>The Government will point out that the percentage increases in their take home pay or the percentage that they pay in income tax will be a smaller gain to them than the percentage gain to the persons on lower incomes.  That is true, but all Governments will use percentages when it suits them and will use cash figures when it suits them, and it is no consolation to the lower income earner whose take home pay has been improved by £150 in the year to be told when he looks at his neighbour&mdash;hardly his near neighbour&mdash;on two or three times the income whose take home pay has been increased by £600 or £700 a year, that his percentage improvement is 100 per cent and the percentage improvement of his richer neighbour is only 33 per cent.  Percentages do not mean much when things have to be paid for, because things have to be paid for in cash and not percentages.</P>
    <P>The principle of income splitting which the Government have adopted in this Finance Bill is not one with which I quarrel greatly, subject to some reservations which I will talk about later, but first of all the way in which it has been applied has been regressive in some respects in that it confers little or no measurable benefits on that one-fifth of our population whose taxable income falls into the range of £1 to £1,000 or £1,100.  If our tax system were genuinely progressive one would hope that the cash benefits of real reforms would be felt more markedly at this level than they would at the higher level, but the reverse continues to be the case.  Secondly, in many respects this is an illusionist's Finance Bill and for some people, single people in particular, ostensible increases in take home pay very often can mask real problems which will surface later on during the year in the wage negotiations which various individuals and groups of individuals will be undertaking.  <i>The Sunday</i><Col N="1569" /><i>Press</i> of 23 March 1980 carried an article by David Pyott, with whose general thesis I am not entirely in agreement, which included some simple calculations about the effects, not just of the budget but of other Government strategy as well, on the purchasing power of individuals during the year ahead.  He gave the example of a single person on PAYE earning £7,000 gross in 1979-80 who had no special tax allowances.  His take home pay in 1979-80 was £4,708.  His take home pay under this Finance Bill in 1980-81 would be £4,816, a gain in take home pay of approximately £108.  We cannot ignore the fact that the goods and services which this woman or man is going to have to pay for out of his or her wages will not cost the same in 1980-81 as they cost in 1979-80.  They will cost substantially more.  Mr. Pyott writes:</P>
    <P>...if this taxpayer buys exactly the same goods and services in the coming year as he did in 1979-80, he will be socked for a total 22 per cent more in the coming year, namely a total of 5,743.76 pounds or 1,035.76 pounds more than in 1979-80.  He needs a gross pay increase getting on for double&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>because of the tax band</P>
    <P>the 1,035.76 in order to produce a net increase equal to the latter. Thus the gross increase, (£1,965) required by this taxpayer just to stand still&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Pyott means in terms of purchasing power</P>
    <P>is 28 per cent of his present gross salary.  The possibility of a salary freeze must be extremely worrying for him, and the consciousness of the difficulties represented by these figures must be very worrying for his employer.</P>
    <P>That states the situation very clearly and if it is so bad for a single person on £7,000 a year, how much worse is it likely to be for somebody whose disposable <Col N="1570" /> income is two-thirds or less of that figure?</P>
    <P>The Government cannot logically produce a set of figures which have this effect and allow other increases in the cost of goods and services which have the effect of increasing the demands on take home pay, and at the same time appeal for moderation.  We are all in favour of moderation but if the Government want moderation they might start by putting their own house in order and by declining to introduce positively, as they have done, taxation changes which will add to the accelerating trend of inflation in the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to income splitting there is one set of points that I would like to bring to the Government's attention and they relate to retrospection. Prior to the date of the High Court decision last October it could be argued that the Government acted in good faith in collecting tax on an aggregated basis from married persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would argue that since the date of the High Court decision the Government have no right to continue such an unconstitutional practice in respect of the PAYE sector.  We have had more Christian charity from the private landlords of this country who are not evicting for non-payment of increased rents after the <Col N="1571" /> High Court decision in their favour than we have had from the Government in relation to a High Court decision affecting the constitutionality of their tax gathering system.</P>
    <P>How can the Government now be right when they say blandly in relation to PAYE people that the scrambled egg cannot be unscrambled?  How can they now continue to argue brazenly that tax which was overpaid in this period, overpaid only because it was unconstitutionally collected, is not now recoverable by the PAYE worker?</P>
    <P>The situation is even more anomalous when we look at the position of the self-employed who only pay their taxes at the end of the financial year.  The Government must admit that they have not a right, constitutional or otherwise, to demand such money from them retrospectively. The anomaly is further compounded when we look at the people who are in the fortunate position of owing money to the Revenue Commissioners.  Now they apparently can invoke the High Court decision and indirectly gain from it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems that only the PAYE sector, who have dutifully paid their taxes following the High Court decision may as a result of their somewhat involuntary integrity find themselves suffering a substantial loss compared with those who are either self-employed or fortunate enough to have owed money to the Revenue Commissioners. I am surprised that the Government in their parade of generousity to the PAYE taxpayer should have been so mean to the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a particular problem in relation to the Bill's proposals.  It refers also to the Supreme Court decision.  That decision was based effectively on that Article in the Constitution relating to the family.  The effect of the Government decision in this Bill, on the other hand&mdash;I look forward to Deputy Kelly's comments on this&mdash;is to apply the benefits of the Supreme Court decision to all married persons irrespective <Col N="1572" /> of whether they have children.  The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines &ldquo;family&rdquo; as members of a household, parents, children, servants and so on, set of parents and children or of relations living together.  It does not define a family as husband and wife but as parents and children living together or other relations living together.</P>
    <P>Effectively, we are now dealing with a situation in which a lot of the benefit that I would imagine the Supreme Court intended to be applied to families, in this definition of the term, may be expended on persons who have not yet started families.  I do not want to be taken as arguing against the right of every taxpayer to be treated as an individual, because I believe that to be fundamental, but I find myself puzzled, to put it mildly, by the application by the Government of the definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; in a rather arbitrary way.  For example, the Government's definition in the Finance Bill includes a married couple living together but not the parents of children.  It does not include other types of families in the context of the Oxford Dictionary definition, for example, a widow or widower living with a wage-earning child.</P>
    <P>I will take the last example of family, a widow or widower living with a wage earning child.  They will be seriously disadvantaged compared with other families unless the income of both the wage earners is more or less identical. When there is sharp disparity between the income of one partner and the other, the family of a husband and wife living together, with or without children, is infinitely more advantaged, assuming they offer for joint assessment, than the kind of family I have just described.  Indeed one could argue that the overall thrust of this Bill and of the Government's financial and economic policy to date conspicuously has not been pro-family in that, as the recent NESC report pointed out, the financial burden of having and caring for children has become progressively greater for parents whether one or both have been wage-earning over the years because of failure to adjust <Col N="1573" /> children's allowances fully in line with inflation or indeed to sort out the relationship between children's allowances and tax allowances for children.</P>
    <P>Another major way in which this Bill is regressive is that it puts an increasing amount of emphasis on indirect as compared with direct taxation.  It is true that direct taxation accounts for a smaller proportion of the total tax take in this country than in many other countries, but we would be unwise to assume that this means that people are undertaxed on their incomes in Ireland.  One of the problems, simply stated, is that the wage earning sector in Ireland is small relative to the dependent sector if we compare our situation with that of many other European countries.  The two dependent sectors, the very old and the young consume a vast amount of expensive social services, and the wage earning taxpaying sector in the middle basically have to provide a substantial supply of the money needed to pay for the services. The problem is that the wage earning sector is smaller, comparatively speaking, than it is in other countries and therefore the burden falling on the wage earning sector is proportionately greater.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances one would like to have seen the Government looking around for a more progressive form of taxation than heavy reliance on indirect taxation which is featured in this Bill. For some reason or another it has been decided not to do that in spite of indisputable evidence from the Central Statistics Office that the incidence of VAT and indirect taxation in general is about three times as heavy on the disposable income of lower income families than on higher income families.  The Minister and the Government cannot buy us off with talk about discretionary expenditure.  It is one thing to have discretion&mdash;everyone has a fair share of it&mdash; but all the discretion in the world is of no use if you do not have an income worth being discretionary about.  In particular, we must fault the Government for their failure to introduce in the Finance Bill any realistic form of new or renewed direct taxation such as the <Col N="1574" /> wealth tax and for the failure of the Minister for Finance to accept, in response to questions by me in the Dáil the need to introduce an equitable system of taxation.  We will never have an equitable system until we make some effort to find out where the resources are that can and should be taxed.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a statement by Deputy Kelly some years ago to the effect that most people here had very little capital accumulated and that if they were told that their modern possessions were amassed as a result of the grinding of faces of the poor they would be horrifed or amused.  I do not have the exact quotation, unfortunately, but I am sure Deputy Kelly will recall the occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I got a terrible going over from some of the Deputy's friends about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that not to give the Deputy a terrible going over but to point out that there are dangers.  It is a comforting enough idea if we do not have the factual information about the distribution of wealth and resources of the country because it implies that there are real inequalities of income or capital that are not due to native wit and endeavour. It implies, although I do not ascribe this position to Deputy Kelly, that if people's good fortune and access to wealth and resources is a result of their own unpaid efforts that also people's ill-fortune is in some sense the consequence of some personal defect in them.  I hasten to add that I do not ascribe that position to Deputy Kelly but gain currency and credence in our community and against which we should guard.  Even the most consertative estimate of the distribution of wealth in Ireland by the ESRI scientists indicates that 5 per cent of the population control about 66 per cent of our resources.  It is a theoretical and inadequate model.  We are all agreed on its inadequacy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Deputy may say it is absolutely wrong but, unfortunately for him, he does not have any better way of proving it is absolutely wrong than I have any way of proving it is absolutely right.  We are going on the basis of what we think about the calibre of the social scientists of the ESRI.  Another point I should like to refer to is the doubling of the mortgage relief in the Finance Bill from £2,400 to £4,800.  The effect of this can only be regressive.  It will benefit a tiny minority of people who have incomes or access to credit sufficient to enable them to take out mortgages of up to £32,000 for a house.  It will be added on to the price of houses.  Its influence on our social policy and the availability of low cost housing will, I suspect, be very marked.  It will be in sorry contrast in terms of a <i>per capita</i> benefit basis to the £1.6 million that is being paid out in a subsidy to help keep mortgage interest rates down.  In relation to the proposal for the resource tax I should like to state that it must be virtually unique that almost the same newspaper which announced the birth of the resource tax should have announced its obituary.  It has been brought in and it is being taken out again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an example either of political cowardice by the Government or of ineptitude which the public relations people have not been quick enough to hang around the neck of the Taoiseach.  A resource tax on agriculture is based on a simple and totally sustainable belief that the land of Ireland is one of the principal resources of the country, together with the health and strength of its people, and that that land must be productive to the maximum possible extent.  We have heard enough lectures from the Government directed at industrial workers to the effect that they will get only a few more bob from their employers on the basis of productivity. If productivity is to apply to the industrial worker it should apply to the <Col N="1576" /> land owner and land holder also.  I disagree with Deputy Crinion's touching innocence in the belief that publishing details of wills in the newspapers is something which creates a rift between town and country.  If there is a rift between town and country it is on the facts of the situation and not on a couple of lines in a newspaper.  I fail to see why we should not have much greater disclosure about the modest holdings of Deputy Kelly, myself and the majority of Members as a fair <i>quid pro quo</i> for a more general disclosure of the real concentration of wealth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That would only be the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the other end of the iceberg.  It would be a fair <i>quid pro quo</i> for a disclosure of the real concentrations of wealth and resources in our society.  The way this economic system works has two major effects.  First, it supplies very few limits that cannot be avoided, legally or otherwise, on the accumulation of resources.  Secondly, it makes it easy for people who accumulate resources to conceal from the prying eyes of the general public, to PAYE taxpayers, small farmers or whoever, exactly the degree to which their wealth has been accumulated.  In other countries income tax returns are public documents.  I do not see why a genuine radical government here might not take a somewhat similar line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of company taxation in the Bill are very dangerous.  We are now down to the 10 per cent rate.  There is only 10 per cent to go before the Government effectively remove virtually all taxation from companies.  What happens then?  I am all in favour of providing jobs but not even the greedy multi-nationals will be ultimately convinced of the sanity of a Government who are operating in this way.  In relation to bank profits, the leasing loophole whereby the major trading banks here are being permitted to reduce their taxation liability almost to the point of invisibility is scandalous.  It should have been tackled in the Bill and the fact that <Col N="1577" /> it has not will only add to the outcry that is mounting for much more effective and greater public control over the activities of these private profit-making institutions. I would argue that the Bill can be summed up as follows: fly now and pay later.  The people who are being given a licence to fly are not the people who will be asked to pay.  The rest of us will have to do the paying either in terms of increased prices, lower take home pay or, worst of all, a remorselessly rising unemployment total when the chips are finally counted.</P>

But we are in a difficulty when the Taoiseach has not indicated in this House anything about his view of the shape that the other Ireland might take.  As to whether we can support him on this, we would wish very much to support him&mdash;I would certainly&mdash;in a constructive way if we knew what it was that he was putting forward and that it was something that could command support.

These matters are entrusted to us, for better or for worse, and we propose to handle them as we think best in the overall interests of the nation and the people of both North and South.  It would be totally unusual, even unheard of, for me at this stage to indicate what precise line I propose to follow in my discussions with the British Prime Minister.  On the other side I think it would be equally absurd if the British Prime Minister were to disclose that on her part.  I am afraid that Deputies on both sides of the House will have to await the outcome of the discussions.  I have already given a broad outline of my approach and my philosophy in these matters in my Ard Fheis speech.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I <Col N="1586" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>While it is envisaged that the form of question on marital status as used in the 1979 Census of Population will be retained in the forthcoming 1981 Census, and this would include the category &ldquo;Other Status&rdquo; as referred to by the Deputy, it is not considered appropriate to include in a census further questions designed to obtain information on marital separation.</P>
      <P>I am aware that representations have been made by some social scientists with a view to having information made available on this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some very good and obvious reasons, one being that this is not an imposition.  It is a census.  Every protection should be given to the person who is unfortunate enough to have a marital breakdown and the enumerator should not pry into their private life.  The enumerator discusses the paper with the people who are filling it in.  We do not want to probe into the very depths of their lives.  We have some figures on marital breakdowns in other areas.  I have made inquiries and so far as I could find out no other country in Europe includes this question.  It is considered that a great many people would take offence at such a question being included in a census of population and would regard it as an unacceptable intrusion into their private affairs.  It must be borne in mind further that during the census enumeration in very many instances enumerators give assistance in completing the questionnaire and the inclusion of a question of the kind suggested could lead <Col N="1587" /> to verbal exchanges between the enumerators and the householders on this very sensitive subject.  Taking all aspects into account it is considered that the inclusion of such questions would give rise to adverse reaction and publicity which could have a serious disadvantageous effect on the census as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Minister's reply might be misinterpreted, perhaps in his official capacity he would confirm for the public record and for the Press Gallery that all the information collected in a census is treated in the strictest confidence. The suggestion that this item might not be treated with the same degree of confidence or would be open to a slightly different interpretation is highly damaging to the census process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has answered his own question.  The very fact that this information is highly confidential and must be guarded like all other information means that to include the Deputy's suggestion would destroy that.  I know the Deputy does not mean to do that, but that is what he would do.  The enumerator would not appear as a friend or an official.  He would probably be regarded as a grand inquisitor trying to probe into the private lives of men and women.</P>

If the Minister and his Department and the Taoiseach's office have some reservations about a particular phrase or adjective, would they consider suggesting a less offensive one with a view to obtaining the same basic information in a more conciliatory way having regard to the dignity of the people involved?</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say whether, when the work concerned has been done, it will be possible to reduce the time taken to contact the Dublin operators having regard to the fact that if one wishes to phone Donegal now one must wait at least 20 minutes before getting through to the operator in Dublin?

      <P>My Department have in recent years given increased attention to all aspects of philately.  The number and variety of special and commemorative stamps have been increased and planning, design and marketing efforts have been strengthened.  Improved foreign sales have been sought by the appointment of agents to promote and sell Irish stamps in the USA, Britain and Western Europe, by advertising widely in leading philatelic magazines and journals and by sending information in multi-lingual form for each new stamp issue to more <Col N="1594" /> than 20,000 people overseas, including 300 journalists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he will outline what relation the Task Force on transportation will have with the planning authority of Dublin City Council, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council in regard to transportation provisions, particularly road transportation in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Having considered the report of the Transport Consultative Commission, the Government decided to establish a Dublin Transportation Authority with overall responsibility for ensuring the integrated planning and operation of transportation in the Dublin region.  The Government also decided to establish a task force to take the necessary steps to establish the Authority.  Pending the establishment of the Authority, the task force is also being given responsibility for traffic management and for the further evaluation of road and rail investment plans in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following have been appointed to the task force: Mr. D. B. Fitzpatrick <Col N="1608" /> (Chairman) Assistant Secretary, Department of Transport; Mr. Tom Power, Principal, Department of Transport; Mr. Colm Ó Dochartaigh, Assistant Secretary, Department of the Environment; Mr. Michael Neville, Assistant Secretary, Department of Finance; Mr. Liam Breathnach, Assistant Secretary, Department of Justice; Mr. John Keane, Assistant Secretary, Department of Labour; Deputy Commissioner Laurence Wren, Garda Síochána and Mr. John Prendergast, Dublin Assistant City and County Manager.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious to make progress as rapidly as possible towards solution of Dublin's traffic problems.  It was felt that in the short term the best way to make progress was through an action group such as I have now set up. No statutory functions are being vested in the task force.  In the period prior to the establishment of the Authority the task force will function on the basis of the existing statutory functions vested in the various bodies represented on the task force.  It will be a matter for the task force to evolve the most appropriate working relationship with these bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  To ensure that I heard him correctly, did he indicate in his reply that one of the functions of the task force will be to evaluate road and rail plans for the Dublin region?  Do I take it that this body will have the final say in evaluating and consequently recommending the road proposals for the Dublin region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, in my reply, further evaluation.  The position at the moment is that any evaluation which has taken place and any decisions that have been made, or are on the point of being made, will be taken into account by the task force and they will operate within those constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the local authority within the functional area of the task force proposes to omit or include a particular road proposal, has the task force as presently constituted the power to <Col N="1609" /> reimpose or to exclude such a road proposal from a development plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is no.  The City Manager and the man who now represents him on the task force are fully aware that the task force are not considering plans that are on the point of being decided.  They will be considering future road plans for Dublin, the situation being that if the Dublin City Council decide on a particular proposal the task force will operate within that framework.  If they decide not to take that decision the task force will be in communication with the City Manager to know what future plans they have for roads in the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if there has been Government response to the EEC Commission's memorandum on the Development of Air Services in the Community, and the measures he intends to take in support of the Community's efforts to reduce the level of air fares in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC Commission's memorandum referred to by the Deputy was published in July 1979 and the Governments of all member states, including Ireland, gave their initial reactions to the memorandum at the Council of Transport Ministers' meeting in Brussels on 6 December 1979.  The Government welcomed the memorandum as a discussion document which contained a comprehensive presentation of important issues in the sphere of air transport and outlined possibilities for a community approach to the development of air transport services.  The memorandum is now being examined by a special council working group on which Ireland is represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the interest of the industry as well as the travelling public that air fares <Col N="1610" /> be as low as can be sustained, having regard to the need for the economic viability of the airlines.  This is my policy on fares and I am prepared to support any new services directed towards this end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government support that section of the memorandum which sets out to reduce air fares into Europe?  If so, have they publicly declared their support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if a report that he has required an airline (details supplied) to charge the IATA cartel fare between Shannon and Amsterdam is correct, although the airline is not a member of the cartel, and if he considers the higher fare promotes the development of Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Transamerica Airlines filed a current fare of £179 return for the Shannon/Amsterdam route.  This is the fare that I have approved.  The IATA corresponding current fare for the route is £209 return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the airline in <Col N="1611" /> question, Transamerica, were prepared to charge a lesser fare but were not allowed to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The fare they have filed with me is £179 and that is the fare I have approved.  The question asked by the Deputy was if I had instructed Transamerica to charge the IATA fare for the Shannon/Amsterdam route.  The fare I approved was lower than the IATA fare and that is the fare they filed with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there a request from Transamerica to charge a lower fare than £179?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why they would ask for a lower fare than £179 because that is the fare they filed and that is the one I approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister sure there was not a request for a lower fare?  My information is that there was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the fare they filed.  I am surprised they did not seek a lower fare if they wanted one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  I will come back to the Minister again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he has recently required United States airlines to increase air fares to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the talks with the US authorities in March last both sides agreed that the incentive group fare and bargain fares including the stand-by fare should be adjusted upwards from 1 June by one of the US scheduled airlines operating to Shannon. Fares to Ireland by the other US airline are not affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an important objective of our air transport policy to secure regular and stable air services on a year-round basis. This is essential for tourist development, especially the extension of the season, and for the development of business and <Col N="1612" /> trade between Ireland and the US.  To secure year-round service requires that fares be pitched at a level which will offer attractive travel opportunities for the public and at the same time cover the airline's costs.  The upward adjustments agreed at the recent talks were necessary because of the uneconomic nature of the fares in question and their likely diversionary and destabilising effect on the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take as being correct the statement of an executive of Transamerica Airlines that they were looking for a lower fare between this country and the US but the Minister's Department would not allow this lower fare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the statement the Deputy refers to.  I would remind him that those fares were agreed at the bilateral talks between the US and the Irish authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which I refer was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 10 April last.  As there has not been any contradiction I presume that this statement is correct that their airline had to charge a higher fare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport why he has not permitted an airline (details supplied) to operate a Cork to Gatwick air service this summer although such a service has the wide support of Cork business and tourist interests, and was supported by Aer Rianta spokesment at the Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he is aware that the commercial manager of an airline (details supplied) stated last month that his airline would be prepared to charge cheaper fares on the Irish services but that these would be unlikely to be approved, and if he will ensure that such approval will be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The fares filed by Danair for their cross-channel services are in accordance with IATA rates and have been approved by me.  While I am always willing to examine any filing on its merits I would not be prepared to approve any fare which would tend to undermine the economics of cross-channel services and militate against the operation of year-round services on the present extensive network of Ireland/UK routes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to tell the Deputy that in recent letters informing us of Danair's cross-channel designation the Department of Trade in the UK told us that Danair's tariff and cargo <Col N="1614" /> rates would be in accordance with IATA rates.  Presumably this information was supplied to the UK Department of Trade by Danair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport why he has sanctioned the £99 air fare from Dublin to London and if profits from this route are used to subsidise other Aer Lingus activities or services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet formally approved the increase in the normal economy return fare on the Dublin/London route to £99.  However I will allow this fare to be applied unless I disapprove it.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, a range of fares available apart from the normal economy fare.  For example, the excursion fare available to those who stay for six to 30 days is £82 and there is also an advance purchase&mdash;that is APEX&mdash;fare available at £64.</P>
      <P>Normally all cross-channel and European services operated by Aer Lingus recover the direct cost of operation and make some contribution to control charges and overheads.  This contribution varies from route to route.</P>
      <P>I should add that the charge per mile on the Dublin/London route is lower than that on comparable international routes in Europe.  This was confirmed recently in a report on travel costs and services between Britain and Ireland published by the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information available I am not in a position to say to what extent the revenue from particular routes such as the Dublin/London route may be said to subsidise other Aer Lingus activities or services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister's reply may be correct that the Dublin/London fare is comparable with other European fares of the same length, is he aware that it is three or four times greater than comparable fares in North America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Deputy that the increase on the London <Col N="1615" /> route is 16 per cent and the average increase on the UK provincial routes is 23 per cent, the continental routes 23 per cent and the North Atlantic routes 17 per cent?  That speaks for itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>It is a little over 24 hours since the Opposition parties were told that by agreement it would be possible to discuss in conjunction with the Second Stage of the Finance Bill the White Paper on the economy which was issued in January and which was part of the planning cycle which the Government announced on their being returned to office in 1977.  When I raised on the Order of Business yesterday the propriety of expecting the Opposition, at a little over an hour's notice, to do justice to the White Paper which has been published for four months, but a debate on which had been refused up to this.  I was told that I was not really minding my business and that if I had been pursuing it properly I should be ready to debate it at any time.  We will see how the Government side are prepared to deal with the White Paper which is supposed to expose the Government's planning strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance rose to his feet just after what I have described and delivered a speech which made not a single reference to that White Paper. Either this is a debate on Government planning operations or it is not.  Either we are allowed and supposed to bring into the scope of the debate what the Government's large scale plans are for the economy, or we are not.  I take it that we are supposed to do it because on the Order of Business yesterday the House was told so.  Why, then, did the Minister for Finance not refer to it in any shape of form in the course of his speech?  The answer is that he was taken by surprise too.  The notice was a bit short even for that genius who is supposed to have the economy at his whirling fingertips.  It was a bit of a tall order even for him to be expected to defend a White Paper at an hour's notice.  Other speakers <Col N="1631" /> followed, Deputy Keegan and Deputy Crinion, and as far as they are concerned there is no White Paper.  It has been written out of history as though it was something which appeared in an old edition of the Soviet encyclopaedia but which political expediency required future editions to omit.</P>
    <P>We were in a sense on notice that this line would be taken about the White Paper because the White Paper carried in a sense, its death wound within itself. It said in its introductory paragraph, and the preface is not signed by anybody that:</P>
    <P>Since the White Paper was finalised the international outlook and the domestic situation have worsened, particularly in regard to the price and availability of energy.</P>
    <P>In other words, the situation has worsened enough in order to justify this disclaimer being especially printed and put in between being finalised, rolled off the press and published.  The White Paper was released generally on 11 January 1980 but it is possible to make an informed guess about when it was finalised because on 4 December the previous Taoiseach was asked by Deputy Cluskey about this White Paper.  The report is as follows in volume 317 of the Official Report of 4 December 1979 at column 616:</P>
    <P>Mr. Cluskey: When it is proposed to publish the White Paper on the economy?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: Hopefully next week but certainly very early in the following week.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cluskey: Hopefully next week and possibly the week after?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: Possibly.</P>
    <P>The view of the Government, as it was then constituted, was that the latest date on which this might have been expected from the press was not more than ten or <Col N="1632" /> 12 days after Deputy Lynch had spoken. I am within my rights in assuming that the thing was finalised when that exchange took place on 4 December.  What happened?  What international or domestic convulsion occurred between 4 December 1979 and 11 January 1980? Was there another Iranian revolution? Did the Iranian revolution develop a new dimension of unparalleled seriousness? Were the American hostages suddenly seized in that period, and even if they were would it have been possible to read into that an economic dimension for this country that would justify a qualification of this kind in a solemn annual White Paper?  What happened in those five weeks?  One significant thing happened which I would regard as a serious deterioration in national affairs and that was the change at the top of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That was the event, not anything on the international scene or on the domestic economic scene, which obliged this paper to come out carrying an apology for its own existence around its neck.</P>
    <P>It is not as if the White Paper, which nobody has taken much notice of, did not contain any gloomy scenario.  In fact it is a fairly helpless production and even had it been presided over by Deputy O'Donoghue as a Minister, it would still have been a fairly feeble production, the most feeble of all the ones we have seen since 1977.  At least a certain amount of caution had overtaken the Department of Economic Planning and Development and they were willing to outline four alternative scenarios.  One was a pretty gloomy one.  It was scenario four of paragraph 2.18 of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Finally, a view of economic prospects based on both unfavourable external conditions and the assumption of an inadequate domestic response can be sketched.  Such a scenario would involve a rapid movement towards unsustainable external and public sector deficits which would have to be quickly corrected necessitating severer measure than envisaged in the scenario (2).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> An average annual growth rate of no more than 0.5 per cent in the period 1983 could be expected while total employment would decline</P>
    <P>In other words, this document was produced within &mdash;here is another public sector word&mdash;the parameters of a bad scenario.  This document is supposed to have answers even for this highly unfavourable scenario.  It was within those parameters that this little thing with its curious emblem, the only innovation it contains, was supposed to take even that very gloomy scenario in its stride.  But, gloomy though it was, it was not gloomy enough for what happened on 7 December when the Fianna Fáil Party, smarting from their defeats in Cork, ran into the desperate expedient of abandoning the affable incompetence associated with their last boss and going for the affable unscrupulousness associated with their present boss, hoping that would save their electoral face.  It will not.  It was just a pit for Deputy Lynch.  More than half the party dug a trap for him, covered the trap with branches and pushed him into it when he was not looking.</P>

      <P>I am trying to identify the devastating event on the international or domestic scene which is alluded to in the introduction to this document as being responsible for the revision of targets. The document contained already a very gloomy scenario indeed, scenario No. 4, and it was within those parameters that it was produced and there was no reason to disclaim this document except that Deputy Haughey wanted a fresh start. He did not want to be encumbered with the plans, good or bad, of the administration which had just got rid of their leader and put him in charge instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The paper itself is a vague, bleating paper.  It is indefinite and inexact.  It expresses <Col N="1634" /> vague optimism.  It has almost no concrete plans in it.  It has even fewer than the next worst White Paper, that of the end of 1978, which at least promised six different points in its course to tighten up State control of tax evasion. Not even that much resolution is displayed by this one.  Nonetheless, a couple of things in it are worth nothing, apart from this little emblem on the cover.  Let me draw the attention of the House to that.  We do not very often get excursions into heraldic adventurousness in this country and I am surprised that when we do it should come from the planning section of the Department of Finance.  The State harp is superimposed on a little medallion, as the art historians call it, of green enamel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy with his legal mind will agree that that little emblem does not form part of the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a poor reflection on the genius in that section if that is the best they are able to produce by way of novelty in a White Paper.  There is a dimness in this White Paper&mdash;although it is not notably more dim than previous ones, it is only a matter of degree&mdash;and by no means deserves to be ranked in the same class as the original programme for economic expansion over which Senator Whitaker presided which, humble and unpretentious though it was and written in English and not in Merrion Street jargon, distinctly identified realisable targets most of which were reached subsequently. There is nothing of that kind in this and I have had to remark that about all the White Papers which this Government have produced.  I quote from Page 34, paragraph 3.10:</P>
      <P>In the natural resource-based industries the main emphasis will be on the processing of beef, timber, daily products and fish.</P>
      <P>Let me concentrate on timber and then ask the House to look at page 44 paragraph 3.34.  Regarding forestry we read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> New initiatives for the release of land for state afforestation and for the development of partnership arrangements between farmers, financial interests and possibly the State are under consideration.</P>
    <P>They were under consideration at the time of Arthur Griffith.  Where are these new initiatives?  Where will be the focus of this emphasis?  We have been hearing for years from everybody except the Department of Forestry about the difficulties which were inherent in the forestry business and the timber processing business.  We know what the difficulties are about land acquisition and in regard to the market for chipboard, wood pulp and so on, but this country imports enormous quantities of wooden material.  It is the biggest single commodity that we import next to oil, although there is a big gap there.  Some of that timber is hardwood which we cannot grow ourselves, but there is an enormous scope here for forest produce and sawmill produce.  I am sick of hearing about the difficulty of land acquisition. I know that farmers do not like to part with land and that it cannot be required compulsorily because all that is required is a man with a match to put an end to your investment.  One unhinged, malicious compulsory acquiree and your investment is over.  I know all that.  We are sick of hearing about it and nobody is going to get marks for wisdom by knowing about it.</P>
    <P>Umpteen other things have been suggested, for example that the State might lease land from farmers and that the State would pay them not when the forestry comes to fruition in 15 or 20 years' time, or sooner with some of the faster growing species, but would pay them a steady annuity like a rent in regard to this lease.  That would cost the State something in the early days but the State would reap the benefit later when the thinnings would arrive and the forest finally would be ready for harvesting. Why is that not happening?  Why is there not even a plan about that in this White Paper <i>Investment and National Development</i><Col N="1636" /><i>1979-1983?</i>  It is pitiable, and the same kind of remarks could be made about the rest of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Another example can be found in the section dealing with the economic infrastructure. There is another darlin' word.  Far from infrastructure we were all reared.  Anyhow, in a nutshell, it means the roads and the telephones.  The roads and the telephones come in for some attention here.  There is one useful and interesting suggestion which is not exactly new but I am glad that it has not been lost sight of, and that is in regard to the possibility of replacing the broken electricity connector link with the North of Ireland by a connector link between Wales and Wexford.  Leaving that out of it, all that we read in regard to telecommunications is a set of targets.  These are targets of a kind about which we heard Deputy Reynolds here a few minutes ago giving a far from creditable performance as a Minister in dealing with Deputy Harte's question.  This reminds me of his utterences at his party's Ard Fheis a couple of months ago. Paragraph 4.13 of the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of this programme&mdash;</P>
    <P>the telecommunications programme</P>
    <P>&mdash;will result in the achievement of the following minimum standards:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the meeting of 98 per cent of all telephone applications within two months and 90 per cent within six weeks;</P>
    <P>When is it going to result in that?  I get many such applications from my constituents. I see Deputy Andrews up there not letting me out of his sight.  I am sure that he gets as many representations as I do, if not more from people who have been waiting for four and five years for telephones and who cannot even get a transfer in under three or four years. That is not only from people who are in new housing estates, green field estates that have sprung out of the earth.  They are in established zones.  All their neighbours have telephones and they are waiting two, three or four years for a <Col N="1637" /> telephone.  This White Paper is not published once in a millenium.  It is supposed to be published annually, and it is supposed to have concrete targets.  The Green Paper should appear in the middle of the year, but there was none in 1979, and there is no word as yet of any in 1980.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper is thinking aloud, the Government in their leisure wear and their slippers, sitting back in front of a log fire, puffing rings of smoke and talking about how society might be shaped. The White Paper contains the concrete decisions, the tacks, the nails and the bolts.  What do we get under infrastructure and telecommunications&mdash;these two words which were never used here until five or ten years ago?  The promise that it will result in 98 per cent of telephone applications being filled within two months, and 90 per cent within six weeks.  When is it to happen?</P>
    <P>I would prefer a concrete promise from that Minister or whoever subsequently holds his post that all outstanding telephone applications will be met by the end of this year.  I am not asking for two months or six weeks.  I want the outstanding ones dealt with, and I want them dealt with now.  Even a certain number of zones cannot be promised.  It cannot even be said that the outlying Dublin suburbs or, for all I know, the outlying Cork or Limerick suburbs, will benefit from a speeded-up programme.</P>
    <P>Where is the reality in talking about a White Paper which is supposed to map out and track national development on the economic plane for the coming year, or so, when you find this kind of raméis in what is supposed to be a White Paper?  The road situation is not better. It simply refers to the road development plan for the eighties as published in May 1979.  Paragraph 4.21 states that the primary objective of the plan is to make adequate provision for traffic using the national routes with particular emphasis on freight transport, industrial, agricultural and commercial; implementation of the plan will yield a significant improvement in the country's infrastructure <Col N="1638" /> of roads.  It will, when it gets implemented.</P>
    <P>I would far prefer if a document like this would say honestly: &ldquo;Look, let us keep our feet on the ground.  It costs about £3 million per mile to build a dual carriageway these days.  We have not got that kind of money, but we will say what our priority is, and this year we will try to build a by-pass for the town of Athlone.&rdquo;  I am not saying that because I have any information that it is particularly bad, but I think it is a bad spot. &ldquo;That will be our achievement for 1980. It is not much but it is something.&rdquo;  That is what one would expect to find in a White Paper.  It is very relevant to industry. Industry is the sector which has been identified by this Government above all&mdash;not that we neglected it; but this Government have gone far out on a limb, as far as ever the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism went with nuclear power&mdash;as the one thing which held out hope for full employment and for getting ourselves permanently on a reliable growth path.</P>
    <P>Industry is black in the face complaining about the extra costs the state of the roads represents to them.  The CII put it in very simple language.  They say our competitors are able to travel a distance with their trucks equivalent to the distance from Dublin to Cork in two-and-a-half hours.  It takes us three-and-a-half hours or four hours.  Our competitors are able to travel a distance equivalent to the distance between Dublin and Galway in an hour-and-three-quarters on their roads.  It takes our trucks carrying our raw material imports and our exports nearly twice that length of time and, on Friday afternoons or on wet evenings, it takes far longer than that.  That has direct implications for industrial costs. We should not have to lecture the Fianna Fáil Party about that, because they never tire of lecturing us about it. They never tire of bleating and begging the people to do their job for them.</P>
    <P>I do not need to emphasise the state of the roads.  They are getting worse by the day, not better.  Everybody here knows that.  I do not suppose I drive a fraction <Col N="1639" /> of the mileage you drive, Sir, because you have to drive from Enniscorthy, or which the Minister drives coming from even further.  The roads are in a worse condition than they have ever been before.  Except that I remember parts of the country where there were no metalled roads, since I was a child I cannot remember a time when the state of the ordinary roads was as bad as it is now.  It would not consort with the Fianna Fáil ethos, with the Fianna Fáil soul, to be humble, to be practical, to be realistic and say: &ldquo;We will do a little at a time and we will tell you now what we will do.  If we succeed in doing a bit more than that, we will ask for credit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the Fianna Fáil mentality. That is not their way of doing things. That is not their style.  Their style is to produce something which is all glitter. When the rain and the wind fall on it, the glitter falls off and the rotting cardboard substructure is revealed to the vulgar gaze at last.  As long as the glitter is there, it attracts the children and they are there in their T-shirted myriads.  There is no one there to clear up the dirty pasteboard afterwards and the eyesores, until every now and again another Government get into office and have to soldier along for a few years making themselves unpopular, as I believe any Government who do their job in this country are fated to do.</P>
    <P>The social development which the White Paper mentioned is too large a subject to go on to at the moment, but I will just mention one thing which is very germane to the whole question of industrial and economic development. There is a section on education and training, and rightly so.  The report mentions that we suffer very badly here from a lack of skills in certain areas inasmuch as there are many hundreds of jobs vacant for which there are not enough trained Irish people to fill.  There is one thing which this section says nothing about to which the Confederation of Irish Industry has more than once drawn attention, that is, our lamentable standard in the teaching and learning of European languages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> I am not saying this as an academic.  I am thinking in terms of developing Irish exports and getting jobs for Irish people. In their second last bulletin&mdash;I have got only a photocopy here and I cannot read the date&mdash;the CII complained about the figures returned by the Department of Education.  Of students presenting themselves for leaving certificate in 1977-78 only 3.3 per cent of the boys&mdash;in other words 3.3 per cent of some 26,000 students&mdash;were learning German.  Over half were learning French.  I intend no insult to our French friends in saying that, for reasons for which the French are not to blame Germany is a far more important trading partner and investor on the Irish scene than France.</P>
    <P>That should not of course be the factor determining either educational policy generally or the course which an individual child takes.  Naturally he must be allowed to develop his own bent and follow his own inclinations.  I recognise also that traditional patterns have played a part and that a lot of this depends on the availability of teachers.  Many people like myself tended to be taught French as the first continental European language. I see the reasons for this all right.  All I am saying is that it is lamentable.</P>
    <P>As always the situation with the girls is somewhat better.  Just as they perform a great deal better in the leaving certificate so their spread of subjects is a great deal better here too.  The percentage of girls learning German in school is roughly twice that of the boys, but it is still far too low.  It is 6.46 per cent only. The overall total is just 5 per cent.  One school leaver in 20 has some competence in the German language.  These are only the people who present themselves.  I do not know what proportion of them fail. No doubt some of them will fail so probably one could halve that figure to get the number of people who have any serious competence&mdash;perhaps one in 40. That simply is no good.</P>
    <P>I am not in any sense trying to encourage or make a case for emigration, but I want to remind the House that we are in an economic community one of whose purposes is to provide a free <Col N="1641" /> movement of labour as well as capital and trade, in every sense of the word, labour.  That is meaningless unless Irish people can go anywhere from Jutland to Sicily to work if they feel like it, and that they will be treated on the same basis as Danes, or Italians, or Germans, or French, or anyone else.  There are many attractions in living on the Continent.  It is not any longer a case of the Queenstown wake and saying goodbye to a family you knew you would never see again, barring a miracle.  You can be back and forth to these places inside a day at a cost, in spite of the passage between Deputy Deasy and the Minister a few minutes ago, which, depending on one's grade at work, represents a week's wages or two week's wages at most.</P>
    <P>I call attention to the fact that there will be job opportunities on the Continent for Irish boys and girls who may prefer to work there.  Perhaps some people wishing to work on the Continent will wish to visit frequently with their families at home.  Perhaps they may even maintain an establishment of their own here but we are not doing anything to help them in this regard.  In addition to the Irish school system turning out lamentably poorly educated boys and girls in the continental languages there is this imbalance between people who are relatively less important and those who are relatively more important to us.</P>
    <P>To this extent there is involved an important national economic function as well as an educational one.  The White Paper has not one word about that and I must say I do not recall any White Paper having mentioned the matter either.</P>
    <P>I have passed the two-thirds point in my time, I have an enormous amount of ground still to cover and I am not going to succeed in doing it all but I want to draw attention to the fact that this Finance Bill&mdash;since the White Paper has not been expressly disclaimed although we know the realities&mdash;must be looked at as ultimately the product of political thinking of which the budget also was an integral part.  The White Paper which was supposed to map out the course of <Col N="1642" /> the economy for a year ahead and which was published in January together with the budget and now the Finance Bill, are all supposed to belong to a coherent whole, but when we look at the budget and at the Finance Bill which has given effect to it, what do we find?  We find, first, the Confederation of Irish Industry are complaining, and complaining in tones which they have not used for many years to my recollection and I believe never used when the National Coalition were there, about the burden which this budget represents for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister here yesterday, in introducing the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, awarded a certificate to himself when he talked of achieving these aims of reducing Government borrowing and so on while at the same time protecting the sources of economic growth.  The main source has been identified by him and his Government as the industrial sector.  That is the main source of economic growth but what does industry say about this budget?  They point, first, to the hydrocarbon tax which though estimated variously from one day to the next, has put £45 million or £50 million additional cost on industry. Let us point to Britain.  God knows I often complain about the idiocy of always looking over our shoulder at the British, but here unfortunately, unhappily, is a case in which it is possible for reasonable persons to recognise that the British have refrained from inflicting a burden of that kind on their industry. The CII have repeated this.  At least we should exempt industries which are highly energy-intensive and which depend on oil but this extra tax represents a very substantial increase in their costs.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of the CII said, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 April, that: a large number of firms are more energy-intensive, that oil accounts for 20 per cent of product cost and that there are a small number of manufacturing firms where oil and electricity together account for over half of total product cost.</P>
    <P>For some of these firms the recent tax increases on industrial oils is 5 to 7 per <Col N="1643" /> cent of total product cost.  This is the sector that Fianna Fáil was going to lift out of depression.  It was almost like one of these dramatic semi-political statues that you see in cities in central Europe showing a large maternal female figure beckoning to the sky with one hand while supporting a failing infant with the other.  This is Fianna Fáil supporting Irish industry.  This is the party who see themselves in that heroic guise.</P>
    <P>The CII are black in the face and, of course, they are no different from the rest of the country, about the effect of the credit tightness on business, the effect of the gross Government over-expenditure, all, needless to say, necessitated by this anxiety to buy popularity before the 1977 election and requiring promises on which they had to deliver&mdash;as many of them as they were able to deliver on with mere money rather than with brains.  The consequence of that grossly excessive public expenditure, grossly excessive swelling in particular in the public service, is that credit for everybody else, even for the productive industrial sector, is very severely tightened.  I have given similar figures before and I have some updated ones.</P>
    <P>Would the House credit that in spite of all the talk about cutting Government expenditure the civil service has grown since January 1977 by 5,500 workers.  It has, presumably, grown by a few more hundred since then.  The local authorities have grown in the last 12 months in their employment by 2,000 people.  The health boards have grown since June 1977 by nearly 6,000 people.  I am all for having as many nurses as we need.  I am all for not skimping on anything but all I am observing is that this is being done by and under the authority of a Government who are simultaneously bleating about the necessity for restraint.  Where is the restraint?  The truth is that they cannot bear an instant of unpopularity. It is like the touch of holy water to the devil to them to feel that they are alienating anybody but of course in the end they have to because the rope runs <Col N="1644" /> out.  In the end they have to do things like issuing the statement which they issued yesterday in regard to the curtailment of the school bus services.  That is deeply unpopular.  It is not felt at all in my constituency but it is deeply unpopular in the constituencies which have thin populations and in which there is a rural school bus service on which people have come to depend.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry at the same time have repeatedly said that this credit tightness is resulting in job losses, not in job growth, and in redundancies. On 19 April 1980 <i>The Irish Times</i> again reported a survey which they had carried out with 500 graduates in business administration courses who were in management jobs throughout Irish industry and the consensus, I am not saying a 100 per cent consensus, but the large consensus among these 500 graduates was that the budget was unlikely to create jobs.  Of these people 37 per cent said that the budget would result in an actual reduction of employment in their firms that year.  That was the view of nearly two out of five of these business managers.  Only 1 per cent said that employment would rise as a result of the budget measures.</P>
    <P>That is the budget and this is the Finance Bill on the back of it that we are supposed to accept and support and praise as being an encouragement to our economic growth.  Even the builders, and God knows it takes a lot to make that particular horse turn over, are up in arms.  Mr. Reynolds, the Chairman of the Construction Industry Federation, is reported today as strongly attacking the stop-go cycle of boom and bust induced in the building industry by erratic Government policies.  I know what he means by boom and bust.  He said that the extent of ignorance at Government level of the economic importance of the building industry was extraordinary. That is very strong language for a builder about the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Today, also, there is an exemplification of exactly what he means in a report on the business page of <i>The Irish Times</i> regarding the calling in of a receiver at <Col N="1645" /> Avonree.  Here was a thriving little business in Kilkenny with 70 employees making pre-fab houses but the slump in the building industry deliberately produced and provoked by the party represented by Deputy Daly opposite have put those 70 men out of jobs and have closed down that firm as they closed down O'Connor and Bailey and others.  The party opposite in their sick greed for power and their Leader in his sick greed to get in and stay in is closing factories and firms down all over this country.  There is no depth or bucket of economic recession caused internationally to blame for that on the building side.  That excuse was genuinely available to us in 1974-75 and we were laughed at for saying so, but there is no such excuse available today. There is not an international recession at the moment.  There are international difficulties, I admit them very freely and I make every allowance for them, but we are not in the trough of a recession now comparable to 1974-75.  Yet for the first time since those days seasonally unadjusted unemployment was higher at the end of April than at the end of January.  I have got no more recent figures than that, naturally, because we do not have weekly figures any longer.  But nonadjusted, in other words, unemployment not discounting the seasonal factor, was actually higher at the end of April than at the end of January.  When did that happen before?  When is the last year that that happened?  It only happened once in the 1970s and that was in the trough of the depression in 1975 when the rise then was a absolute marginal one whereas the rise on this occasion is in the thousands.</P>

      <P>We are not out of the wood even having established that.  We have not even painted the extent of the mess in which this Government have left us.  It is not given for man to run this country properly and be popular; it cannot be done. Some of the blame for that must be carried by all sides, because we have <Col N="1646" /> always treated the people with lollipops, never told them enough of the truth enough of the time, giving them too many easy answers.  I cannot disclaim some of the blame for that on my side as well.  But there was some limit in our case.  We did not rashly make promises which we knew we could not redeem on. We did not throw away manoeuvering room for future years in order to win an election.  We could overnight have run up a set of promises which would have been even more extreme and extravagant than the ones made by the party opposite in 1977.  But we did not do it even at the cost of going out and I would not do it again even at the cost of going out and being out for ever.  I am sorry to be singing this song so often but it cannot be sung often enough.  It is tedious and very disagreeable for the people opposite to have to hear.  The syndrome which they have called into being&mdash;it is a very ugly syndrome and was not present in the same shape or form under the National Coalition&mdash;consists in run-away public expenditure which has to be cut back too late and too painfully.  Because it has been built up on fantastic borrowings, it is necessarily accompanied by the payment of interest on loans which absorbs almost a quarter of the State's revenue now just to keep down the debt service. That has left us in a situation, combined with the expectations of the public, where there is nothing ahead ultimately, as far as I can see, but a devaluation of the currency.  Whether or not that comes about this year most certainly there will be a second and very severe budget with all its deflationary effects and negative effect on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his budget speech in March allocated £100 million for unforeseen or for extra rises in public service pay.  Eighty million pounds of that, if I understand the Estimates correctly, has now been bespoken by the increases for which the nurses have been waiting so long.  In other words, it is going to cost £80 million to meet the nurses' claims&mdash;if they accept it, which is not certain.  That leaves £20 million for everybody else.  The Minister opposite may not be aware of this, but last month <Col N="1647" /> the public service served notice&mdash;reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 26 April&mdash;of a 30 per cent rise right across the board. The old mathematics said that for every one point rise in public service pay the State would have to dig into its pocket for £10 million.  That figure has since risen to approximately £15 million, partly because of the higher base and partly because of the greater number of public servants.  In other words, that 30 per cent claim&mdash;if conceded, and I do not suppose it will&mdash;implies additional expenditure of £450 million.  I know that Deputy Daly lives in a constituency where money is flung around like chaff on enormous generating stations. Perhaps that does not mean an awful lot to him.  But it is a huge amount of money by the standards of this country and is absolutely outside the capacity of this Government to meet.  It has put itself in the position where it has simultaneously generated these expectations and left itself incapable of meeting them, or capable of meeting them only by borrowing money in such volume that the productive side of the economy is squeezed for the credit it so desperately needs.</P>
    <P>I very much doubt if Deputy Daly would want to hear the rest of what I want to say, or what I would have had to say.  I will condense it into a few words. Frankly, I thought when this budget appeared in March that it was intended to keep the option of an election open, because it did have the effect at once of stilling momentarily criticism on the PAYE front.  I concede that and nobody would deny it.  It represented a substantial concession to a large number of PAYE earners.  When I saw that, although it seemed to me that it could not be paid for immediately, I thought to myself: this is intended to keep an election option open.  I believe that the Government are backing away from that option because all the other signs are so unfavourable.  The net effect is that they have now paid out even more rope, left themselves with even fewer options, given themselves even less money to subsidise products in order to keep some <Col N="1648" /> control on the grotesque inflation rate. They have left themselves with less manoeuvring room to allow the private sector credit to expand.  They have done all the wrong things and not even for the right reasons.  They have done the wrong things for the wrong reason and the devil mend them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill advances a stage further the many proposals and the taxation changes announced in the 1980 Budget.  As the Minister said yesterday, this Bill incorporated also a number of additional concessions.</P>
      <P>Now that the dust has settled somewhat on the 1980 Budget, despite what Deputy Kelly has said, the many taxation changes and new concessions announced, the various improvements to which this Bill gives statutory effect&mdash;overall the measures have been welcomed by the public.  For employees perhaps the most pleasing aspects were the suggested improvements in the income tax code, the various alterations involving higher allowances, income-splitting and the changes in the tax bands.  These measures went beyond the expectations of most people&mdash;the introduction of income-splitting went even further than the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These concessions and improvements have not yet been passed on to the PAYE earner.  Therefore, their benefits have not been felt as yet.  The Minister and the Government took very positive action in implementing the concept of income-splitting for all married couples. I contend that that was only right and proper.  Otherwise, an injustice would have been perpetrated against the pillar of Irish society, the wife and mother who remains at home to run the house.  In recent modern times emphasis has been placed on the role of the working wife, the facilities with which she should be provided in order to look after her children and so on.  These have all been covered in depth in recent years.  I make no criticism of these.  Indeed, in these modern times of inflation, higher home costs and so on the necessity for the wife <Col N="1649" /> to work is often enormous.  But the position of a wife and mother who remains at home to look after the home and her children&mdash;unfortunately a tradition always taken for granted&mdash;is a good one.  Therefore it is fitting and appropriate that her position has been recognised finally and that the benefit of income-splitting has not been restricted solely to couples with two incomes.  The benefit of the tax reliefs will help all households to a considerable degree and will increase substantially in many different ways their purchasing power.</P>
    <P>The special commission set up by the Government, as announced in the Minister's budget speech, to examine the whole structure of taxation will be followed with more than normal interest by the public.  A very good beginning has been made in the evolvement of equity into the taxation code.  In this area the Minister is to be complimented for having moved so quickly and decisively.</P>
    <P>This is considered to be fair by the wage earner who felt he was carrying an unfair burden for far too long.  It is true to say that most people dislike having to pay income tax, but any fair tax system will be accepted.</P>
    <P>The PAYE worker has no room to manoeuvre as far as his tax is concerned. His tax is deducted at source, unlike that of the farmer, the professional, the self-employed and so on.  It is unfortunate that the taxation issue resulted in somewhat of a clash between rural and urban, the farmer and the wage earner. Farmers' representatives have repeatedly indicated that they are anxious to pay a fair share of tax.  We all accept this, but when a system is devised they all seem to knock it loudly and emphatically.  This, in turn, causes cynicism among the PAYE earners which is understandable. If equity is to be seen to be there at all, no other section should seek to choose the system of taxation that they wish or that they want.  PAYE workers have never had that privilege or that opportunity and nobody else should.</P>
    <P>The savings in the additional taxation allowances will, however, be seriously eroded if the spiral of wage and price increases <Col N="1650" /> is to continue.  I am seriously concerned, as indeed are most people, at the continued apparent loss of responsibility on the part of a small minority within our community.  We are all familiar with the sudden unofficial strike weapon which is now used far too frequently to force big wage settlements. This is the new form of blackmail and is normally directed against a community service, causing a great deal of hardship and inconvenience to everybody.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael front bench spokesman said here today that Government backbenchers were being sent in here to slate and to criticise trade unions.  The words used were &ldquo;a trade union bashing campaign&rdquo;. That remark is typical of the bluffing contributions that come from the benches on the far side of the House. Anybody who has followed the progress of the present Minister for Labour will recall, without any difficulty, the efforts he has continuously made to give trade unions every possible support against those who will ignore their own trade union officials.  The Government have at all times bent over backwards to give their unqualified support to strengthening the trade union image.</P>
    <P>What this country needs most of all&mdash;and this is recognised&mdash;is a strong trade union organisation, strong enough to control and if necessary take effective action against those breaking the rules of their own unions, ignoring the decisions taken by officials and generally turning their backs on their own trade unions. Unofficial strikes are the greatest evil in this country today and accounted for 75 to 80 per cent of the work days lost last year.  Lock-outs follow on unofficial strikes and cause a general decay and a complete breakdown in relationship between trade union, employer and trade union member.</P>
    <P>In situations like this how can we be competitive in attracting foreign industrialists to our country?  We need to do our utmost to attract foreigners to invest in this country, to create more jobs. This, however, is extremely difficult in view of recent circumstances.  Competition in world markets is stronger than <Col N="1651" /> ever before.  European countries particularly are competing strongly against each other to attract investment.  The IDA have done an extremely good job over the years and have been very successful in attracting industrialists from different parts of the world.  When there are so many unofficial strikes, who would blame foreign industrialists for thinking twice before coming into this country to invest their money and to take their chances?  What is the answer to the problem?  It is difficult to know, but workers and employers must come to a realisation of what is good for the country and for the future and must work together.  Otherwise, there is very little prospect of job creation in the future for young people.</P>
    <P>As we all know, we have an exceptionally large young population who within a few years will be seeking their first jobs.  Those jobs must be created, otherwise our young people must emigrate.  The present situation of breakdown in discipline within trade unions means economic suicide.  Unless something is done very soon to correct that situation, we shall have difficulties in the not too distant future as far as creation of additional jobs is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is often found that those seeking larger increases come from sheltered occupations. They are already in receipt of reasonably good incomes and often with pensionable jobs with no possibility, or little possibility of losing them.  I appeal to those workers to reconsider their attitudes, to think of the weaker sections of the community because those are the people who are suffering and who will be the losers in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government since taking office in 1977 have created in the region of 45,000 new jobs.  Quite frequently Opposition Deputies made rather snide remarks in relation to our manifesto and particularly our commitment to creating jobs as contained in that manifesto.  Nobody will agree that the Government have failed in this direction. They have created over the past three years the greatest number of jobs <Col N="1652" /> ever created in the history of this State. That is some achievement particularly against the background of strong competition from other countries, particularly within the EEC, to attract foreign industrialists.  We are not the only country nowadays with incentives for foreigners.  They are all over the world and quite often the investor will consider the stability of the work market before making any decisions.  This is an important area and something that we should consider.</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday referred to the alarming demands coming to the surface for higher pay rises in excess of that envisaged when the budget was being planned. It is very interesting, indeed, to note that the wage settlement in Sweden this week was 7 per cent.  This has been one of the biggest there for several years.  We have to consider the type of demands being made here at present of 15 per cent, 20 per cent and perhaps even more.  I think that many of our people are in cuckoo land.  They must bring their feet down to the ground and accept that increases of that sort are not on.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare recipients received quite substantial increases in the budget last February of 25 per cent.  These increases can be eroded by price rises. Some control must be put on this.  If we are to have higher pay we must have higher prices.  One follows the other.  You cannot have one without the other.  The weaker sector of the community must be protected against higher inflation.  I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare will keep this section of our community in mind in the coming months and during next year.</P>
    <P>Chapter 6 of the Bill refers to tax relief for companies manufacturing in Ireland and exporting abroad.  In this context, no incentive can be too great for manufacturers who are successful in selling to world markets abroad.  I feel that one of our greatest failures so far has been the lack of successful impact in selling Irish made goods at present.  For some years now, we have had a very strong campaign to promote the sale of Irish goods. It has been stated on many previous occasions <Col N="1653" /> that if we were to sell an additional 2½ to 3 per cent of Irish made goods in our stores it would creat an additional 10,000 to 12,000 jobs.  Surely such a target is worth while.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand why the Irish are not more sensitive to this and put greater effort into purchasing to create these additional jobs.  I know that many of our leading stores are doing a very good job to promote the sale of Irish goods but, on the other hand, there are many more very large stores who not only fail to promote in any strong way the sale of Irish goods but do not even display Irish goods.  If they display them in a small way they do so in an unattractive way and certainly in a manner that it not attractive to a prospective purchaser. Consequently golden opportunities are lost.  It is not possible I understand to take a stronger stand with purchasers and buyers of stores who are dealing in a free enterprise, but I would like to see a stronger programme directed particularly at stores rather than at the shopper.  It is all very well directing the campaign at the shopper but if the goods are not available it is difficult to blame the shopper for not purchasing.</P>
    <P>Good displays sell goods.  The displays must be attractive and the promotion must be there also.  There must be a real desire to sell Irish goods.  If we can do that we will have gone a good way towards achieving many thousands more jobs for our people at home.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said regarding cut-backs to local authorities.  The comedy of potholes has probably gone off by now we have heard so much about it.  It must be remembered that in this particular year of discreet spending an additional 10 per cent has been given to every local authority in the State.  This is somewhat below the rate of inflation but it is not today or yesterday that our roads got into bad condition.  Our roads have deteriorated over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Many of the Deputies who often criticise the Government for the poor state of roads and cut-backs to local <Col N="1654" /> authorities and so on, are local councillors. I suggest that they refer this matter to their local councils because the deterioration of our roads has been happening over a period.  If county councils have not been taking this matter up before this budget they have been neglecting their duty at local level.  It is all very well to score political points but nowadays the public do not fall for that sort of thing.  We must be a little more realistic and a bit more general in our criticism.  If we are to have criticism let us have justified criticism not something, as I have mentioned about potholes and pennyhalfpenny things which have been happening for quite some time.  The Deputies who have been blaming the Minister for Finance because of the budget this year on the condition of roads and for potholes are following a wrong course.</P>
    <P>In the inner city of Dublin which is referred to now and again by various Deputies there are problems.  These problems have been there for some years.  So far as the housing programme in Dublin is concerned last year nearly 2,000 houses were built by Dublin Corporation. Dublin Corporation would find it extremely difficult to build any more houses even if they had double the grants and double the money.  They are bedevilled by labour problems, and I understand that the city council did not spend their full grant.  In many councils throughout the country, there was a rush at the last minute to spend what money was left in the kitty.  This does not suggest that emergencies have been created by the lack of funds.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is a good Bill.  It seeks to do something genuine for the PAYE earner, it gives additional incentives for harder work and indeed an incentive to everybody, the employer, the worker, and the trade union to use this budget and Government proposals to throw off the old problem that we have been bedevilled with in the past.  I appeal to all those particularly in industry to look to the future and to try to make the future brighter for young people.  That way, we can have improved economic <Col N="1655" /> development which will benefit everybody at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Listining to Deputy Brady I found it difficult to ascertain if he was really serious in some of the comments he made concerning local authorities and the amount of money that was nearly unexpended because they had so much of it, and also in his comments on job creation.</P>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with the implementation of the financial resolutions which came before this House in the budget.  Since the budget we have had expressions of mixed feelings in respect of the provisions in the budget and the provisions in the Finance Bill.  The verdicts on what is contained here are anything but clear cut.  They range from a guarded welcome to outside dissatisfaction depending on who is saying what at any given time.</P>
      <P>The provisions now being implemented by the Finance Bill were described at various times as a new approach by no less a man than the Taoiseach.  Some Fianna Fáil Deputies have described the provisions as having a caring aspect, others defined the budget as having the stamp of social justice.  We have had descriptions of its breaking new ground, of its being a new approach and so on. Yet we had statements from the former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, and the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development asserting that this budget was nothing more or less than a continuation of the ideas promulgated by them in their time as Taoiseach and Minister for Economic Planning and Development respectively.  I fail to see where the logic is to be found in this assertion.  The statement made by the latter pair mentioned however is much more accurate than the assertions of new furrow-making and new ground breaking so far as this budget and this Finance Bill are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax concessions lauded by Government speakers, under closer scrutiny do not seem to be what people thought they were when first announced. <Col N="1656" /> One of the features of this budget was in the 1979 budget.  It took most of the year to discover what was being given and taken away and for people to find out exactly what was contained in these provisions. We are now halfway through this year and many thousands of people are still at a loss to know what exactly the provisions of the budget were and what is contained in the implementation of these measures through the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector took to the streets last year.  We had a reaction to that which initially convinced these people that all their marching was for nothing. Yet as time goes on those same people who felt that they had done something for their members and for themselves a few short months ago are now pointing out that many of the so-called concessions are illusory in so far as they are concerned.  <i>The Irish Times</i> on 10 March of this year carried a headline which read &ldquo;Sleight of Hand Magic in Budget Sums&rdquo;.  Here was a correspondent of a newspaper who had not a political axe to grind giving what he and his paper thought were factual information and a factual assessment of what was contained in the budget.  One lesson that could be learned from the facts as ascertained in that article was that a person with an income of £5,000 in 1980, when all the sums have been calculated and an answer has been found, finds himself financially worse off this year than he was in 1979.</P>
    <P>As was said from this side of the House from the very beginning when the provisions were made known, the overall strategy contained in the budget seemed to favour the higher income groups to an exorbitant extent.  One would expect that in the normal way because if a person has a higher income he would benefit that much more because of that, but those benefits would be in direct ratio to his income.  It so happens that under the provisions in this budget now being implemented by the Finance Bill that ratio is weighted heavily in favour of the person in receipt of £14,000 or £15,000 plus per annum.  In this country at this time that kind of approach or philosophy cannot <Col N="1657" /> be justified or justifiable in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>The person with £1,700 now finds himself not liable for income tax.  A couple, each with an income, are free of tax up to £3,400.  On paper that looks like an improvement, but going further into the details which are thrown up we find that the imposition of indirect taxation quickly erodes illusory concessions which these people thought they had got.</P>
    <P>A long established accepted fact which it now would seem was accepted in error was that indirect taxation was an equitable and fair means of extracting revenue from the public.  It has been shown scientifically beyond any shadow of doubt that the imposition of indirect taxation across the board is anything but equitable or fair, for the simple reason that it has been shown and proven that it imposes greater hardships on those who are less well able to face this imposition&mdash;the less well off, the unemployed, the lower paid, people in receipt of old age pensions and so on.  They are obliged to spend a greater portion of their disposable income on essential goods.  The person in the higher income bracket will spend his own share on essential goods as he sees fit, but there is a limit beyond which he would not go simply because he does not need to go beyond that limit.  At the end of the day anybody looking at the two sets of figures will find that the lower paid person is spending a much greater proportion of his disposable income on essentials than is his better off neighbour.  For that reason the imposition of indirect taxation hits him harder.</P>
    <P>The one word which comes to mind through the budget and through debates on the Budget is the word &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo;.  This word has taken on added significance in the past couple of months.  We were told that the indirect taxation imposed was on non-discretionary items.  That is very fine language if it is true.  But everybody knows, including the Minister for Finance, that if you have an imposition of indirect taxation on so-called non-discretionary items&mdash;petrol was said to <Col N="1658" /> be a non-discretionary item&mdash;the end result is that you have indirectly a consequential increase in a vast area, in fact on possibly 99 per cent of all other items. This is because of the fuel input into their manufacture, their transport and so on which indirectly hits at the person who can never afford or aspire to owning a car.  The taxation of so-called non-discretionary items has the unfortunate indirect result of imposing this severe strain on the finances of people who can least afford to meet that strain.</P>
    <P>The income-splitting saga has now gone on since last October.  Deputy Brady tried to maintain that it was time that this inequitable system of taxation which did not allow income splitting was terminated.  Deputy Brady must know, as does every employee in this country, that it was not the Fianna Fáil Government who introduced income splitting.  It was the High Court and subsequently the Supreme Court who did. The Government of the day, which happened to be a Fianna Fáil Government, were forced into a position by law where they had to make this provision and allow this facility to people where a man and his wife were both employed.  Making a virtue out of necessity does not cut ice with anybody.  It is simply a fact of having had to introduce this facility.  The Government had no option in the matter.</P>
    <P>My overall view of the budget is that it is weighted in favour of the better-off sections of our community.  That is one major fault which must be found with the budget and the Bill that now implements its provisions.  The other aspect which one must comment on critically and, indeed criticise severely, is its lack of commitment to employment.  Fianna Fáil got into power on a long list of promises, one of which was a drastic reduction in unemployment.  To their eternal credit they put on paper what was to them an achievable target in reaching their goal of full employment.</P>
    <P>There is a double think here.  Deputy Brady has fallen into the same trap as many others in trying to promulgate the idea that targets have been achieved in <Col N="1659" /> reducing the unemployment figures, but in fact they have not. The Fianna Fáil manifesto was very categoric in its assertion that it would reduce the unemployment figures by X, Y and Z numbers per annum.  A new tune is now being played about job creation which is as far from reducing unemployment figures as one can imagine.  One simple example will illustrate what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>In 1979, the number of jobs created by the efforts of the IDA amounted to something over 23,600, a very fine achievement in job creation.  On the other side of the coin, during 1979 we had 14,900 plus redundancies, giving us a net reduction in unemployment figures of 8,700.  That is the important figure for Members of this House and for the people who are looking to us to provide the framework within which they can get jobs.  The figure of 8,700 is an achievement, but it is a far cry from the target of fewer unemployed 25,000 set in the manifesto.  While it is correct to say that 45,000 jobs have been created since the assumption of power by Fianna Fáil in 1977, let us not confuse that issue with jobs on the ground and people working in them.  That is what was promised in 1977 by the Fianna Fáil party who came into power as a result of their promises.</P>
    <P>In the budget and in this Bill there is no indication of a continued commitment to that job creation programme.  I appreciate that the Government will say they have fallen in bad times, that things are not what they might be, or what they were expected to be by then at the time they made these promises.  Surely they should be honest enough to stand up and state what the realistic position is at the moment: they are not reaching their target for employment.  There may be valid excuses for that, but a blind denial of the facts will not cod anybody.  Things have taken a very serious twist downwards in the recent past.  Only last week in this House figures were literally winkled out of a Minister which indicated that the trend in job losses and redundancies has taken a very severe dip for the worst.  In fact, for the first three <Col N="1660" /> months of this year that dip amounted to a 45 per cent disimprovement in redundancies. That is a very severe trend and there seems to be a degree of whistling past the graveyard by the Government in that regard.  They do not admit it is there.  If they do, they are not prepared to confront the issue and to find some solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Conferation of Irish Industry, who are an independent group, publish commentaries on a regular basis on trends in the economy.  The most recent figures published show that industrial output expanded by 6.7 per cent in 1979 over 1978.  It can also be shown that no growth whatever took place in the latter half of 1979.  This can be shown from the figures in the joint report by the CII and the ESRI.  The no-growth trend has persisted through the first three months of 1980.  This is unfortunate but it must be said.  Yet the whistling past the graveyard goes on.</P>
    <P>The value of total exports for the first quarter of this year was up by 27.8 per cent <i>vis-à-vis</i> the same period for 1979. But major contributory factors to that increase were in the meat industry and electrical products.  If they were taken out, one would have a 16 per cent increase in value.  If one applied that to volume one would find there is a very slight increase in the volume of exports.</P>
    <P>A further disturbing factor concerning industry is that the total imports increased by 28.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year.  If fuel is excluded the total imports grew by 22 per cent in value which indicates a very moderate increase in volume.  The indications to be drawn from that particular trend is that industries, and we must remember that two-thirds of our total imports are made up of raw materials for industrial production, are not importing raw materials to the same degree as they used to.  That does not augur well for our industrial output for the remainder of this year.  In fact it has been shown in the same data that there was no growth at all in volume for the month of March in imports which means there was no <Col N="1661" /> growth in volume of imports which would be essential to our industrial expansion. That is a matter for serious concern.  Yet the requests made to the Government to alleviate some of this pressure, to seek solutions to some of these industrial expansion problems have been ignored.</P>
    <P>The expansion and the state of our industry are very closely related to our capacity to employ people.  Trends for increasing unemployment and for a reduction in industrial output will go hand-in-hand also.  The Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Burke, only last week was quoted as saying that of the 1,700 exporting companies about 200 are dangerously marking time.  That is an admission by a Minister in a Department whose responsibility it is to ensure that these 200 industries should not be marking time, that steps ought to be taken to get them out of their trouble. We have had a spate of closures, albeit all in vulnerable, sensitive areas, in the past couple of months&mdash;textiles, footwear, clothing and so on.  In my own area only last week a factory which was in a very healthy state laid off 80 people or half its work force.  What I would like to know is what is being done to halt this slide down the slippery slope.  Times are tough.  We have had industrial problems.  When I hear Government backbenchers stating that the Minister for Labour has done a tremendous job since he came into office two-and-a-half years ago, one is forced to put the facts on record.  These are that 1979 was the worst year on record for lost man-days through industrial action and today we have flash-points in different areas of the country and in different industrial sectors which could have far-reaching consequences on our future development as a nation.  Far be it from me to provoke or incite trouble by people who, in some cases, ought to know better.  There is no point in saying that Sweden's solution was found through a 7 per cent increase in wage demands when we are faced with an inflation rate which will possibly be in excess of 20 per cent by the end of this year. The Leader of my party, Deputy <Col N="1662" /> FitzGerald, was castigated, and at the time it was stated that he was less than patriotic, when in 1979 he questioned budgetary calculations.  Unfortunately, Dr. FitzGerald was proved correct by the end of 1979.</P>
    <P>He was again taken to task a few months ago for suggesting that the inflationary input by the budget itself, plus economic and domestic features within the country, would lead this country this year to possibly an inflation rate of 22 per cent.  I hope Deputy FitzGerald was wrong but unfortunately as things stand so far this year, I am afraid that Deputy FitzGerald will be proved right.</P>
    <P>The industrial expansion of this country is something to which we must look if we are to achieve any degree of affluence or indeed of economic survival in the current economic climate internationally. We have heard repeated requests by interested parties for an undertaking that the Government would underwrite the exchange risk of foreign borrowing.  Just as often we have had that request refused on the grounds that it would be inappropriate to expend public moneys on this kind of operation. To my mind the only circumstance in which such expenditure would come about would be through devaluation of the punt.  There is vehement denial of any such intention on the part of the Government.  Indeed I would hope that they would persist and that this would never happen.  But, if there is no devaluation in prospect, then there is no expenditure under this underwriting scheme sought by industry.  Therefore the logic escapes me as to why there is such reluctance to underwrite this risk.  Even though it is only a small thing it would help to relieve some of the pressure now facing these people&mdash;the high cost of interest rates, the imposition of extra duty on industrial oil, which now stands at 7p a gallon.  And one must remember that Irish industrialists are competing in the same market place with industrialists from other EEC countries who have not got one cent duty to pay on industrial oil.  There is one country in the EEC where there is no duty whatever, others <Col N="1663" /> are paying 1p, 2p and 3p.  We are top of the league in so far as duty on industrial oil is concerned&mdash;7p per gallon as against 5p paid by our neighbours in the UK.</P>
    <P>On the cost of oil and energy in general, on the evening of the budget I was amused to see and hear a television commentator describe it as an energy-conscious one.  I will give him the benefit of having been in the very heated and excited atmosphere of a TV studio when possibly his better sense ran away with him.  The budget may have many characteristics and there may be many adjectives that would describe these adequately but there is one thing that this budget could not be called and that is &ldquo;energy-conscious&rdquo;.  I say this because, prior to the budget, we had the abolition of the one tangible commitment to energy conservation there was, that was, the solid fuel conservation grant.  To rub salt into the wounds we had an increase in VAT rating across the board when the 20 per cent rate of interest was increased to 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>In that category there were items such as cylinder jackets.  This energy-conscious budget increased VAT on one item obviously meant for the conservation of heat in a domestic or an industrial hot water supply.  In this country we have something like 800,000 domestic dwellings, of which it is estimated only one-third are adequately insulated. That means that over half a million houses in this country are inadequately insulated at present.  Yet this budget imposed extra taxation on what must be regarded as energy-saving, energy-conservation items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall atmosphere at present is one of gloom.  This Bill does nothing to dispel that gloom.  If there is one thing we need here at present it is confidence.  If one looks anywhere around the country at industrialists, farmers, fishermen, any group, one will find that they are just <Col N="1664" /> wallowing in semi-darkness, not knowing where they are or where they are going, and nobody can tell them.  The job of a government is to lead.  I am afraid that is not happening now.  I happen to be a member of a local authority.  It may appal this House to know that the local authority to which I belong cannot even pay its statutory demands this year to its health board or to the Office of Public Works for maintenance and drainage; they are statutory demands.  When I asked the question as to what would happen I was told that both the Department of Health and the OPW would get their pound of flesh next year before the allocation was sent down to us by the Department of the Environment; it will be deducted at base.  So heaven help us next year getting what we probably will have to get as an inadequate allocation, minus the deduction made by those people, who have a right in law to do so.  But there are certain services grinding to a halt.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening education got a further chop.  Of course it was inevitable. But the Minister, Deputy Wilson, has persistently stood there and denied that there is a cut-back in education, when he knows, we all know, anybody who can add two and two knows, that there is a cut-back.  Any hope that extra money might become available has now been dispelled in one particular area at least, and a very sensitive one, that is, in school transport.  We now have severe cut-backs in school transport.  We have allocated £16 million to a service which cost £16.5 million last year.  Instead of making up a shortfall to meet increased costs of 20-plus per cent, which is £4.5 to £5 million, the Minister has actually reduced the service to bring it within the ambit of this £16 million expenditure.</P>

      <P>I know this Bill has a formal legislative function to provide for the implementation of budgetary provisions.  I say, more in sadness than in anger, that the consequences of the actions of a Government who bought their way into power were inevitable.  The only sad thing is we are all now reaping the bitter harvest of that foolish act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  As might be anticipated, I do not agree with the measures incorporated in it and shall endeavour to elucidate my objections.  The new Government&mdash;on the somewhat changed Cabinet in basically the same Government&mdash;have changed the strategy of the previous Government to some degree, principally in that, when Deputy Lynch was Taoiseach, we had Government by remote control.  Disputes and legislative matters were let drag on without any apparent urgency to solve problems which arose.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey, as Taoiseach, endeavours to give the impression of being a man who gets things done.  He honestly hopes that this reputation will create an impression and result in improved economic performance on the part of the Government and a more balanced situation in industrial relations.  We need that balanced situation very badly.  Unfortunately, the endeavours so far have been of a stop-gap nature.  We have not seen any cohesive or comprehensive plans, especially economic plans, for the years ahead.  Policies are designed to solve problems on a very short-time basis and that is not the type of Government which leads to the desired stability and economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area with which I deal as spokesman for the Fine Gael Party involves transport, technology and telecommunications.  It is an area which has been plagued during the past three year by a whole series of strikes and industrial action, and which have cost the country vast sums of money and probably many new jobs.  These areas involving <Col N="1666" /> the essential services which are so vital to industry, whether established or intended.  Repeatedly, we read of industrialists complaining about our inadequate telecommunication system and about our inadequate road and rail system.  We also read about people who had intended to come here but were diverted because of these inadequacies in such basic services.  Any Government with such a strong mandate as the present Fianna Fáil Government have should be in a position to provide an adequate telecommunications service and not to allow disputes to erode the confidence of industrialists, and to prohibit industrialists from coming to provide tens of thousands of new jobs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the promise made by the Government and, in particular, by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of the expenditure of £650 million in an endeavour to bring our telecommunications service up to the existing standard in other parts of the European Economic Community.  We wholeheartedly support the type of expenditure envisaged and hope that the announced five year plan will proceed according to schedule.  It is poor consolation for people, whether they are private individuals, business people or industrialists, who have to utilise our present telecommunication system to think that £650 million will be spent on improvements when the present system is so utterly inadequate and unworkable in many instances.  The public and the industrialists would like to know how soon the present problems will be overcome.</P>
    <P>We have had three years of Fiánna Fáil Government and have been promised an improvement consistently during that term.  We are now promised a five year plan.  Some of us are quite sceptical as to whether that five year plan will materialise.  I fully support the plan, because it is what we need.  We will be watchdogs in the Dáil to see that that plan is carried out for whatever length of time this Government stays in office&mdash;whether it be two months or two years.  We have not been unduly critical up to this juncture.  We are prepared to <Col N="1667" /> give the Government an opportunity to implement those plans and to wait to see if the promised money will be forthcoming and will be spent.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Dáil question today the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs told us that £20 million was being spent immediately in providing badly needed additional equipment.  That is a start.  Of course, if you divide 20 into 650 you come up with something like 32½.  That, to me, does not seem to fit in with a five year plan.  I would hope that the level of expenditure for 1980 would be in the region of £125 million or £150 million for this very basic facility which, as I stated, is being roundly criticised by industrialists and business people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Industrial estates on the fringes of Dublin city are not being adequately serviced for telecommunications.  Every week when I come up to Dublin I am inundated with calls from business people and industrialists who have been advised by the IDA to move out from the congested centre of the city to these new industrial estates on the fringe and they are very sore because many of them have failed to get a telephone installation within a year and in some cases within two years of moving out from the city centre.  If the Minister of State or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wish to dispute that point I can supply them with names and addresses, facts and figures of people who continuously tell me that their employment factor is being threatened by inadequate communications, by the non-provision of cables for telephone services.  That surely is not a good start to the £650 million modernisation scheme about which we read so much.</P>
    <P>There is obviously also a need for extra staff in the main exchanges in Dublin because any of us who endeavour to make a call to an exchange in the country operated on a manual basis find that the delays in getting through are inordinate and must surely be due to a lack of manpower at the exchanges in question. This, again, is a matter of finance.  I <Col N="1668" /> would like to see a major drive to recruit and to train new staff and to provide better working conditions for existing staff. The numerous industrial disputes and strikes within that section, whether they are on a long-term basis such as we had in 1979 or whether they are on a short-term basis such as we had last week with the operators operating the cross-Channel service, indicate that the industrial relations section of this Department leaves a great deal to be desired. We await the fulfilment of this promise of vast sums of money to provide us with as good a telephone service and telex service as in any other part of the EEC.</P>
    <P>On the transport front the problems are no less, probably much greater, probably much more long term and obviously requiring much more money than is being given at the moment.  If one reads the recently publicised road plan for the eighties one can only applaud the ambitious plans.  It is obvious that the money is not being provided to implement those plans because the road work estimates of the various local authorities for 1980 show that the amount being provided this year is in many cases only 50 per cent of the total required to implement that scheme in its embryo stage.</P>
    <P>Our roads are totally inadequate.  We do not need to be experts to know that. We do not have to go to Britain or the Continent to see the dreadful comparison which our road system makes with national road works and road schemes in other countries.  How realistic is this road plan for the 1980s?  Is it just another promise or will there be a real effort to carry it out?  The figures provided for 1980 indicate that it is only pie in the sky.  Not only are we not capable of expanding our road network with the present financial allocations but we are not capable of maintaining them in a proper condition.</P>
    <P>I do not want to over-emphasise the point that is made here repeatedly at Question Time when people are asking questions of the Minister for the Environment. It is obvious that the roads are breaking up and deteriorating at a shocking rate.  The reason is simple <Col N="1669" /> enough.  It is not all the Government's fault.  The volume of traffic is greater and the size and the weight of the vehicles being carried on this road network are also much greater.  The speed at which vehicles are travelling is such that our antiquated system could not possibly hope to stand up to the type of abuse it is receiving.  There will have to be vast sums of money injected into our road works.</P>
    <P>The Government have been remiss in not seeking EEC aid on any scale up to the present.  I know for a fact that the British Government for 1980 have got 15 million units of account from the EEC for infrastructural roadwork schemes.  That approximated to something like £30 to £35 million.  On the other hand I believe we have not got any money for similar type infrastructural road network from the EEC.  I wonder if we have applied at this stage. Our Commissioner in Europe has brought proposals before the Commission for the expenditure of billions of pounds on road networks and rail networks throughout the EEC.  The Commission will listen to reasonable proposals for the improvement of these networks, but I am not aware that we have requested money for any such major schemes.</P>
    <P>There obviously is a great need for improvement of the main arteries leading from Dublin to the provincial capitals. The roads to Cork, Galway and Belfast, while reasonably good, have very poor sections which need to be updated.  The main arterial road to Waterford is a disgrace and urgently needs the expenditure of a considerable amount of money to bring it up to the very basic requirements for a main road.  Above all, the structure of the roadways will have to be strengthened, because I am told that a 20-ton truck travelling at speed can do as much damage as approximately 150,000 motor cars doing the same speed. I find that figure incredible but an expert has told me that it is a fact.  It is not uncommon when driving along the Naas dual-carriageway to be passed out by a juggernaut travelling at 75,80 or even <Col N="1670" /> 85 miles an hour.  Therefore, the damage that is being done must be immense.  It is long overdue that we implement the laws which exist to see that such traffic be contained within the speed limits specified.  I have not seen in the public or local press for many months any prosecutions of laden trucks of that nature for exceeding the statutory speed limit.  I would like the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice to pay particular attention to those matters. Our roads are not made for this traffic and we should see that they are given the type of protection which is there by law which is being flouted openly every day.</P>
    <P>I am an advocate of private enterprise being involved in all spheres of what is known as the public sector when that private enterprise can give a comparable service and especially when that private enterprise can provide a service at a reduced cost to the State.  Many of what we have come to recognise as State-sponsored or semi-State bodies were set up in an economic climate entirely different from that which pertains today. Many of them were set up in the twenties, thirties and forties when economic recession was a by-word.  We now live in a day of free enterprise, international trading and buoyant economic markets. We live in a day when businessmen, people with enterprise, can go out and operate systems which could not be operated profitably 30 or 40 years ago. We should change with the times.  If our semi-State or State-sponsored bodies have become outmoded and out-dated, have outlived their usefulness, are costing the taxpayers vast quantities of money and the service which they were set up to provide can be provided at no cost to the State in a superior manner by private enterprise, then the time is long overdue to give private enterprise an opportunity to get involved.  The Minister opposite is shaking his head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people operate the most meagre provincial runs available because CIE have a monopoly of all the better runs, especially those runs between the major population centres.  It is only in those areas where CIE could never even in their days operate economically, that the private operators have been given an opportunity.  It defies description and it defies argument how we can snub private operators or how we can deprive them of competing against CIE on the better runs, when they can make a handsome profit on the runs which were abandoned years ago by CIE.  It does not make sense.  If these people proved themselves in such poor circumstances, on such a bad wicket, why should they not be given an opportunity to provide the same service in areas which are presently loss-making under the auspices of CIE which as a result are costing the taxpayers because CIE is a taxpayers' subvented body?  Why should we have to pay through the nose for something which could be provided at no cost at all to the State and, from what I have seen of this kind of operator, in a much more efficient manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there would be outcry from the unions represented in CIE.  It is only natural that people feel that their position is being threatened if the system is going to be changed.  That need not necessarily be the case.  All types of guarantees of employment can be given in the event of such a changeover from public to private enterprise.  Many of the people who presently would feel endangered if such a proposal were pushed forward would find that their terms of employment and pay would improve dramatically if they were operating in a system run by private enterprise with accompanying guarantees which would <Col N="1672" /> have to be given by private enterprise on the assumption of private enterprise of the role presently being operated by the State and semi-State bodies.  I do not limit myself to CIE when I speak in this vein.</P>
    <P>There are other semi-State bodies which similarly could be examined. Where there is a reasonable case that a State body which is not making a profit could be operated on a non-loss making and possibly on a profit making basis, then it should be investigated. I cannot understand the reticence of successive Governments to probe into this matter.  The tip of the iceberg is shown in a report published today by the National Economic and Science Council which points out that there is an inhibiting factor in these State-sponsored bodies, that because of the over-rigid control exercised by the civil service, there is a blunting of initiatives, a blunting of ambition and a resultant reduction in the level of performance by the employees at whatever level.  As one goes up in the managerial structure that blunting of ambition and that thwarting of ability is evident.  If that continues as it has been over recent years, of course we will have loss-making public bodies.  That is all the more reason why people with ability and ambition must be given an opportunity to operate these services.</P>
    <P>I am not totally against the operation of those services by semi-State or State-sponsored bodies but in the present climate in which they are being operated I do not see anything but further increased losses and a further reduction in the quality of service.  That is what we have had in recent years.  From where have the major strikes emanated?  They have been in the public sector.  There is dissatisfaction obviously with working conditions; there is dissatisfaction with office promotional opportunities; there is dissatisfaction because there must be poor personnel relations and working conditions within those units.</P>
    <P>Something drastic will have to be done to improve that situation and the NESC <Col N="1673" /> report published today put its finger on the point which is most relevant, that is that initiative is not rewarded in the public sector.  If it is not rewarded, one either changes the system or else one does something to see that it is rewarded. That creates problems because one may have to go outside the terms of the relevant national understanding to reward that initiative.  It is not an easy problem to overcome.  I do not profess to have the answer but it is an area which will have to be explored.  We see it all around us, whether it is the local authority engineer or the civil servant in the Department of the Environment or the Office of Public Works.  People who inherently probably have the highest standard of education in the State and also the highest level of intelligence are put into jobs which are terribly restrictive where their imagination and their creative abilities are not let run their full range.  The frustration of these people is obviously great and you cannot have a very satisfactory working relationship under those circumstances between the people employed in those services and the public with whom they are dealing.</P>
    <P>A whole new look will have to be taken at the structure of pay levels and working conditions in this country.  We are employing in dead-end jobs people who have abilities which far outreach the importance of the positions they fill.  For too long there has been fumbling of the best academic and technological brains of this country into humdrum positions in too many of the major employment sectors or even the public sector be it in State or semi-State bodies.  More thought will have to be given to the provision of employment for people with such ability in jobs and positions where they can show their imagination and their initiative. There will have to be proper pay levels for people according to their qualifications and their innate intelligance and not according to the number of years that they are in a job.  It is time that these barriers were broken down and that promotion was not automatic and based upon years of service. Highly intelligent young people are <Col N="1674" /> inhibited in their efforts to progress and in that inhibition they eventually end up frustrated and merely work out the rest of their days waiting for their pensions and certainly not making any endeavour to show initiative, because that would be construed as kicking over the traces. That is the type of quality which is not invited in the public sector and that is where our problem lies.</P>
    <P>Until the Government take the whole situation by the scruff of the neck, improve industrial relations, and put the best people into dealing with personnel relations, matters will not improve and we will have continuing industrial action. We will have simmering discontent among the public at large.  We must have a proper pay structure which will ensure that people who have university qualifications, especially on the technological side, are properly recompensed. We must not let people who leave school at 14 years of age and get into very rigmarole jobs eventually end up with wage and salary levels which outstrip the people who have gone to higher institutes of education and universities. I am not saying that people who leave school at 14 as a general rule should not be allowed attain to greater heights, but the pay structures generally are not adequately geared to meet people's qualifications.  For instance, some of the present industrial unrest in the country is caused by the very factor&mdash;I am sure the Minister of State knows what I am talking about&mdash;that qualified people with five or six years' training are being paid less than unqualified people who have walked into jobs probably at 15, 16 or 17 years of age.  This present unsatisfactory wage and salary structure will have to be reviewed from top to bottom.</P>
    <P>I was talking a little earlier about the need for more latitude for private enterprise. The case I have in mind which was well publicised in today's newspapers is the problem of school transport.  How can anybody be so lacking in imagination as to think that when there is a shortage of cash the only way to solve the problem which arises is to reduce services? <Col N="1675" /> We the Irish, are supposed to be the most creative, the most flamboyant, and there is no better man than the Minister of State himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to fulfil that word. The Messiah himself, they say in west Mayo.  We pride ourselves as a people with flair, but when it comes to prices or lack of finance the invariable solution is to chop, to reduce the services.  The time has come to get away from that simple, stupid solution.  If the Minister is, as he claims, the Messiah he might do something magical or supernatural.  My suggestion is quite simple, practical and reasonable and does not entail a reduction of services.  Why should CIE be allowed to operate a school service when the vehicles they are using to run those services can be utilised only for that one purpose?  Is it not time to allow the private sector to work to its full potential in this area?  Private operators would gladly take over the running of school transport if given the opportunity and could do so at a reduced figure to that at present being demanded by CIE and there would be no need for a reduction in services.  There would be no need to reduce the age for qualification to avail of that service.  There would be no need to reduce the distance that the child lived from the relevant school.  There would be no need to increase the fee per term. Why are we so lacking in imagination and initiative that we have to carry out those petty, mean little cuts when there is an alternative?  Why can CIE buses not be used to carry people to social functions, whether to a football match or to bingo?  Why do they have to be parked from ten o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the evening at the side of the road and thereafter from five o'clock until the following morning at 8.30? Private enterprise is not shackled by the same limitations, so why should it not be allowed to run the school transport system in its entirety?  I fail to see the logic.  People in the private sector would <Col N="1676" /> vie with one another to have the opportunity to run those services for the money which at present is being paid to CIE.  If they can do it, then I say by all means let them go ahead.</P>

      <P>I am talking about structures to replace the present outmoded, unsatisfactory, unworkable and highly unprofitable system.  I suppose the majority of the Members of this House are members of local authorities and, whereas barristers and solicitors monopolise this House because they understand legislative measures which are passing through far better than we laymen, when it comes to matters involving the Department of the Environment and, in particular, matters relating to local authorities, Deputies who are members of local authorities are entitled to speak.  It is unfortunate that the powers of local authorities have been eroded to such an extent.  Power seems to fall back into the hands of the civil servants.  That is an erosion of local authority powers which we have seen in recent times, and it continues.  As this Government hive off local sources of revenue which return to the local authorities, and are utilised by the local authorities, then the powers of the local authorities become more and more inhibited. Surely it is time for a return to local democracy in the true sense.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will have opportunity to speak afterwards, which he and his colleague have been slow to do this afternoon.  It is a pity that the moneys being funnelled into the Exchequer cannot be applied locally.  It is a pity that the local authorities concerned are not given an opportunity to decide how those moneys will be spent.  There seems to be too much dictation from the Department.  The cutbacks we have had to endure this year in particular make our jobs as local representatives unenviable and difficult in the extreme.</P>

      <P>We have seen a shortfall in the current year in the provision of money for water and for sewerage, not to talk of the elimination of reconstruction and solid fuel conversion grants.  It has been a bad year and it will be a bad year for local authorities generally and the people who give so much of their time, so much of their effort to improving conditions for their constituents, their fellow men and fellow women. They are not being given the opportunity to make the very basic facilities of housing, water and sewerage available.  There is a vast cut back in local authority housing, and the Government should wake up to the fact that since 1977 there has been a downward trend.  There is a threat of large scale unemployment in local authorities.  There is a threat that 100 county council workers in Donegal may be let off from their jobs.  As well as that, funds for amenity schemes, some of the desirable and necessary little schemes to provide tourist facilities and attract tourists, have been eliminated. This is a very sad state of affairs.  What are the people getting in return?  The only real movement I have seen as regards finance at local authority level in recent months, and recent weeks, is in the wrong direction&mdash;an enormous increase <Col N="1678" /> in rents for local authority houses. Up to the present, a major concession was given to recipients of social welfare benefits who rented council houses.  This has been eliminated.  All local representatives and Deputies have a stream of callers who are being asked to pay twice and three times the rent previously charged.  This is a most reprehensible step.  I should like the Minister for the Environment to have another look at this huge increase.  It has hit hardest the people who can least afford to pay.  There is a determined effort to squeeze the last penny out of the poorer classes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the very limited time available to me my contribution will be brief.  I would like to avail of this opportunity, as we discuss the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, to voice a very genuine grievance which is continually coming to my notice as a public representative and continually being conveyed to me by the very many workers who live in the area I represent and who must, of necessity, commute to and from work each day.  I speak about the thousands of workers who must either travel by bus or use their cars to travel to work.  This is not a new case.  It has been made in this House before, but I make no apology for making it again. The grievance is a very real one.  It comes to my notice each time I meet a group of workers.  No allowance is made under the income tax code to workers in that category, the ordinary industrial service workers, for any form of transport he or she may use to and from their place of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who would have us believe that all workers are in some way militant or over-militant in some cases. They have shown incredible forbearance in the light of this injustice, which I do not lay at the door of any particular Government.  It has been there for quite some time and has been raised here in the House already.  This year there has been an astronomical increase in petrol prices, brought about by direct action in the budget itself and by forces outside our control.  There has been a consequent increase in bus fares.  With the <Col N="1679" /> very unsatisfactory bus service we have it is a very usual experience for anybody driving on a road leading to one of our major towns or cities to see buses broken down.  We have occasion to meet very many of the workers to whom I referred this evening who get on their bus, pay their fare and find after going a few yards or half mile of the road that they are left there to make their way to work, however they may.  Then they are docked wages when they get to work.  I am personally aware that there are many from whose pay packet up to £10 per week goes on these fares alone.  We are all aware that the more favoured sections of the community, higher officials, business executives and so on, if they are not provided with a car, at least have a transport allowance.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think it is just that these workers, many of them lowly paid, many of them inadequately paid, should have no concession whatsoever allowed to them in terms of fares so far as their tax is concerned.  Nor should they have this basic justice denied to them year after year.  I have raised this in the House before.  It is a grievance which I come across very often and I feel it is incumbent on me as we discuss the Finance Bill this evening to say once again that I think this year above all others there ought to have been a concession made to this section of the community in so far as taxation allowances are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government have expressed themselves as satisfied with the tax concessions that have been given but I would argue that inflation has taken care of those concessions already.  They will not be anything like what they seemed to be when first announced.  This particular aspect of workers' taxation is one that ought to be tackled, and it must be tackled for the future if we are to do justice to the hundreds of thousands of people in our society who get no allowance whatsoever for this very necessary cost of transport.  It is a particular grievance in the area I represent on the industrial side, in Cork harbour, where so many workers must commute <Col N="1680" /> long distances to work and it is one which I am becoming more aware of.  Its existence is one which must be taken into account by legislators in Finance Bills of the future.  I do not know if it would be too much to expect, where cutbacks have been made in such vital areas, that injustice such as this would be diminished this year.</P>
    <P>When I talk about so many vital areas one area that comes to mind is school transport.  It is incredible that something so fundamental as eliminating discrimination at its base, which is in education, should be tampered with. School transport was a method to some extent of eliminating some of the discrimination that existed against rural children.  It is a service which was never perfect but it should not have been cut back on.  Instead, it should have been expanded. It was a very short-sighted view for the Government to tighten up in this area of school transport.</P>
    <P>In this year, too, cuts have been made in the whole area of local authority work.  I wish to refer particularly to housing.  With regard to the total area for which local authorities have responsibility, to limit the increase in expenditure to 10 per cent in a year when inflation is running at 20 per cent must only result in a cutting back of services and there are such cut backs at local authority level in all respects.</P>
    <P>This is particularly obvious in the area of housing.  In the past year or so I have noted that in schemes that have been begun there is a tendency to produce houses which are not visually up to the standard that was the case up to now.  I understand the high cost of housing, I understand the inordinately high cost of land, under the speculative system we have with regard to building land, but I still do not think this is an excuse for producing houses which are jammed more closely together, which have less ground space and which must represent a deterioration in the living standards of the people who live in them.  We talked in another debate about violence in our built-up areas.  We talked about the quality of life generally there and we <Col N="1681" /> talked about the necessity of recreation areas but the hope of realising our ambition at local authority level to build worth-while houses with proper recreational areas for small children looks far from being realised with the present curtailment in money for local authority purposes.  The huge numbers of people on the books of the local authorities for every housing scheme that is announced or advertised leads us who are representatives of local authorities to have a very basic realisation of the need for housing that exists not alone in our major cities but throughout the towns and the country areas.</P>
    <P>From my own experience at local authority level any scheme that becomes available in the satellite towns, the vastly growing areas around Cork city, will throw up a list of applicants at least three or four times greater than the number of houses.  Indeed, it is not unusual to find 200 or 250 applicants for 20 houses. These are not people who want to apply for a local authority house for the purpose of changing their residence.  They are people who are in dire need, people living in unfit and overcrowded houses, living in difficult, strained conditions with in-laws, people living in caravans, people who by any stretch of the imagination need houses.  We were never satisfied with the extent to which the housing programme was going ahead but there can be no doubt in any of our minds that there is a cutback, and that the starts in housing in the next 12 months will not match even those which took place last year.  There is a definite slowing down at all levels with regard to housing and with regard to all activities of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government this year to discontinue local improvement grants was very shortsighted and very unjust.  I have known since this happened a number of people, most of them elderly couples, who have lived all their lives in vested county council cottages or some similar buildings, the roofs and the structural condition of which have now deteriorated but which the people concerned <Col N="1682" /> are not in any position to rectify without the aid of a grant.  The grant scheme had a very important social effect. It was a total disregard for the needs of a very vulnerable section of our community to have discontinued that scheme.</P>
    <P>We have, too, cutbacks in vital areas such as school buildings, hospitals and so on.  It seems to me that in a year when all of that is the order of the day it might be futile to voice once again the demand of workers for cash concessions for their transport to work but I feel it is my duty to do so.  It is something that constantly comes to my attention and about which workers themselves are justly aggrieved. I would appeal to those who are framing a taxation system to take that aspect into account and to give the basic justice that is given so freely to the more favoured sections of the community to the average industrial and service worker and to those on low wages who have no other means in this situation of getting to work.</P>
    <P>We live in a country where transport is by no means sophisticated.  Getting to work from a distance outside a town or centre of industry in many parts of Europe and in many parts of the world is a very simple thing where there is a sophisticated transport system, a single fare payable for any distance one wants to go.  Not so here.  Here it is an expensive business getting to one's place of work.  It makes quite a sizeable impact on the worker's wage packet and it is something for which he should be given consideration when it comes to tax.  It is something which workers in the future will demand to be taken into account in their tax assessment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to speak about many inadequacies we are experiencing at present. Firstly, I would like to refer to the most topical information available, that is in connection with school transport.  I can well remember when the school transport buses were introduced.  At that time cars were becoming more numerous with greater danger facing our young <Col N="1683" /> children.  Greater confusion and frustration faced the fathers and mothers.  With so many cars using those by-roads and main roads there were still children left without transport, particularly those whose parents could not afford a car.  It is frightening to think of our children being at the mercy of so many drivers at present.  I am being critical of drivers because I believe that proper precautions are not being taken for children's safety. In the interests of children there should be greater penalties imposed for speeding.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State asked what would Deputy Deasy do if he were confronted with the problem of school transport.  It is a good question.  The reduction in this service is an indication of the present shortage of money.  In my wildest dreams I cannot understand how any Government would stoop so low. Before the Minister of State posed the question of where the money would be got I had a suggestion to make.  I would be inclined to effect cuts in the Ministerial area.  I think five Ministers of State have cost the country £500,000. Nobody requested those Ministers and I do not think they were needed.  Can one imagine a man looking out on a bad morning seeing a Minister pass in his State car while his child remains at the mercy of modern traffic because the Government say they have no money.  It would be very hard to justify that.</P>
      <P>We have not a new Government.  We have the old Government, a few Ministers having been demoted, a Taoiseach demoted and that ex-Minister for Economic Planning and Development removed from office.  Recently I came across a statement of Deputy O'Donoghue when he said inflation would be 5 per cent in 1979.  My recollection is that it was four times that, so that at least there was a fairly good reason for telling that man to take a holiday. But it is unfortunate that our people have to suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we find ourselves without a penny in the kitty.  First there was the abolition of food subsidies introduced at <Col N="1684" /> a time when money was not too plentiful. Never in the history of this State were food subsidies more valuable or more needed than at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal now with the subject of health.  I come four miles from the Regional Hospital at Dooradoyle, County Limerick, where there are numerous people in the corridors without room even for patients' visitors. Can one imagine the embarrassment of those people in corridors, being gazed at as people pass, again because the Government have no money.  I would not mind any Government running into difficulties.  But these were the people in 1977 with all the answers, the people who told us that there was no problem, that the position then obtaining was only because of a bad Government.  I ask you what has become of all their solutions?  It is no solution to problems to fire Ministers.  It is no good blaming Deputy Gibbons and saying he was the man, or that Deputy O'Donoghue was responsible. That is no answer to our people.  All <Col N="1685" /> they are concerned with is the fact that the Government have failed them.  This is nothing new to Fianna Fáil.  I remember in 1973 when we went into the EEC at the top of the league with 73,000.  Even at that time it was remembered that the emigrant ship had done a wonderful job in the previous 50 years, people being employed in industries in Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We want money.  I would like to pay a tribute to the IDA who are doing a very good job.  Speaking as a rural Deputy I feel more industry should be moved to rural areas.  Here the Minister of State will agree with me because there are some in his area.  First and foremost it would save a lot of dear petrol about which the Minister used talk at one time.  Petrol is now very expensive and it is very difficult for people to commute to and from their place of employment. As a matter of fact it has been proved that it is better for a man to remain at home, drawing the dole than pay for petrol for a journey of over 50 miles a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another disadvantage in rural Ireland, that is, the lack of an automatic telephone system.  In one area of my constituency Newcastlewest, the capital of the county, we have lost a number of industrialists because they had not an adequate telephone service.  They had no automatic service.  This was particularly acute during the long telephone telecommunications dispute, a time when the Minister's party sat, looked on and did <Col N="1686" /> nothing about it.  I suggest that the automatic telephone system, if at all possible, be introduced in the near future in the interests of the people and of the industrialists who definitely need it as a very essential service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

You are paying treble the amount.  The house is gone out of reach.  I know well how you feel about it.  Then we come to roads.

      <P>We have no money for roads.  We have holes in the road that would cover children going to school.  If the school transport is going to go I do not know what is going to happen the children because they will not have the road to walk on.  I know there is no money.  Speaking of roads, I am going to say something unusual.  It was bad for this country, and this applies to all Governments, that we were so quick to close the railways.  I think we were too fast off the mark.  The very minute the station was closed the tracks were taken up the following morning.  One of the fastest things CIE ever did was to remove the rails.  It was a poor day that happened.  I would love to see the heavy traffic taken by rail.  It would avoid a lot of congestion.  It is only right when the money is not available that contribution should be made.  That is the only solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strikes are a headache at the moment. There is no doubt about it.  I say, in fairness, that the Minister has improved <Col N="1688" /> the situation.  Over the last four years, the man seemed to be immune to strikes. He is under probation.</P>
    <P>The housewife can see how her wages are being eroded.  I remember the last election when the shopping basket was taken around.  I remember the last Taoiseach going around with a little shopping basket.  As a result, he lost his job.  The position is that never in the history of the State has a housewife got as hard a deal as she is getting at present. Tax concessions are no good.  They are also being eroded.  The Minister of State is quite convinced that I am right. He knows, but he san say nothing.  If we take a medical card, we find that people are not able to pay for doctors' fees at the moment.  In no way can a man with £60 or £70 a week and a wife, pay doctor's bills.</P>

Farmers who were reasonably comfortable, who had an incentive to develop, went to the bank seeking a loan and were well received by the bank managers.  The bank managers held a seminar to teach them how they could borrow money. The bank managers are now having seminars of their own to know if they are going to catch the farmer who cannot pay the rates.  That is the present position. I remember what happened when income tax was introduced on a modified scale in 1975.  All the rural Deputies were lined up.  There is no rural Deputy here tonight.  The Minister was picked out here tonight to defend it.  The backbenchers are in hiding.  I am sorry for the Minister.</P>

      <P>As this is my first opportunity in the House, I publicly congratulate the new Minister and wish him well in his job.  Having congratulated him and wished him well, may I also say that I would like to give him a little bit of advice?  He would be well advised to be a little bit more tolerant and listen more than he is doing.  He is not in possession of all the facts and all the details. Perhaps what the Minister would hear might be of some advantage to him. Having said that, I would like, first of all, to mention the portfolio of the Department for which the Minister is responsible.  If I am not correct, the Minister may correct me.  I believe he is responsible for tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was responsible for tourism.  I was just going to mention it while he was.  I shall switch to transport.  We have heard Ministers and speakers generally throughout the country talking about conserving energy, which is a very important matter. I believe that our transport system is geared for nothing else but to waste very expensive energy and needs to be modernised and fully equipped to deal with demands that would be there if they were fully equipped and modernised.  This could conserve energy.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with CIE buses in particular. I live in an area where a number of people from my town travel to and fro each day to work in Cork city, approximately 25 to 30 miles away.  The vast majority of those workers would avail of a transport system, first of all, if it was reliable&mdash;it is not because you never know when you got on a bus whether it will reach its destination or whether it will break down&mdash;and secondly, if they could bank on its being on time for their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency there are people driving in cars with one or two people in <Col N="1690" /> each.  If you are travelling to an early train or to an early bus in Cork you will find that the road is very busy with teachers, vets, workers of all sorts going to work, each day driving his or her car. The only reason they do not avail of public transport is because it is not reliable and because the transport system is absolutely chaotic and appalling. We see buses on the road which are not roadworthy.  It is a regular feature of every day life to find CIE buses broken down on the roads because they are old crocks.  Seats from the buses are placed in front and behind to indicate a breakdown.  I mention that to the Minister because he claims he is in charge of transport.  He would be well advised to devote his energies to that area which is very much in need of his attention.  May I say with all the sincerity in the world that I wish him well because this is certainly an area which demands improvement.  This is one of the things to which the Minister and other Ministers have refused to listen.  It is important.  I am serious about this.</P>
    <P>I often hear the Minister for Education publicly and otherwise saying &ldquo;There are no such cutbacks in my Department&rdquo;.  I hear the Minister for the Environment, supported by his Minister of State and by backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies, saying the same thing.  Yet everybody in the country is well aware that there are serious cutbacks in all areas, that the services are being restricted every other day because of financial constraints on the people charged with the responsibility of providing those services. The Minister can shake his head and disagree with me if he wishes but that is a statement of fact which everybody knows.  One of the things which disturbs me more than anything else is that the most vulnerable are the first to pay.  The children being transported to school are the first to pay.  The people who are the most vulnerable in every area of services are the people who are the first to pay the piper.  That is the disaster and that is the problem in an economic crisis.  Surely the Minister cannot deny that.</P>
    <P>I can give another example.  In Cork <Col N="1691" /> County Committee of Agriculture we have received a notice from the Department that as a result of some investigating committee on staff problems all temporary staff must go.  We are also informed that certain constraints are imposed on us in relation to the filling of vacancies for permanent staff and that they will go.</P>

I have given the example of the school-children. I have given the example in the agricultural sphere as well in relation to what I have already mentioned.  There is no scarcity in other areas.  We had one Minister for Agriculture, we have three now.  Can the Government justify that to people down the line when they have informed the local CAO and the county committees of agriculture that they cannot appoint staff?  The Minister for Agriculture has been given two more Ministers of State.  There are not any restrictions imposed on the appointment of Ministers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> When it comes to the provision of health services the position also is that it is the most vulnerable and those who are most in need, who are the first to suffer, those who are medical card holders, and the recipients of disabled persons maintenance allowances.  There are more stringent investigations into their qualifications and they are the first to go. You will never see the CEO or the people in the higher income bracket suffering. It is the same with the local authorities, whom Deputy Harte mentioned today.  The curtailment and the retrenchments will start with the roadworkers.  You will not see the county manager sacrificing a part of his income because of financial constraints.  Neither will you see the county engineer, the assistant county engineers or any one of the staff having to do that.  It starts with the unfortunate road worker.  That is the worst thing that could happen and it is something to which the Minister would be well advised to listen.  I could go on and on like that about education, agriculture, the health services and local government.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the agricultural industry.  No matter on what side of the House we sit and no matter what our occupations in life are, we must accept that our agricultural industry is vital to the economy.  It is vital that we would continue to encourage expansion of the industry for the provision of badly-needed jobs.  We are not giving the incentives which are necessary.  I believe also that the Minister for Agriculture, who is involved in the European scene, has not used sufficient muscle to finalise the farm prices for this year.  We are now approaching the end of May and we still have not our farm prices for this year.  I believe it is important that confidence is restored to the agricultural industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I outlined the problem facing consumers of bottled and town gas in relation to the massive price increases that have been allowed in the recent past.  One might admit and confront the reality that there are external factors involved but the solution to the problem must be found within our shores and action must be taken by the Government. The litany of increases which encouraged headlines like &ldquo;now gas prices rocket again&rdquo;, &ldquo;price shock for bottled gas consumers&rdquo;, &ldquo;a further 3.8 per cent rise in the price of Dublin gas&rdquo;, &ldquo;another 9 per cent on gas at least&rdquo; will have to be stopped at some stage.  We realise that the rising cost of raw materials is beyond our control but we must find a solution. We cannot allow this trend to continue. If price increases are allowed to escalate at the same rate, by 1984 the price of the average 25 lb. gas cylinder will be approaching £20.  Even to think about this is ludicrous but that is the reality starting us in the face unless somebody intervenes on behalf of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We introduced a system of substantial subsidies in somewhat similar circumstances because we felt it was the only way possible for us to cushion consumers against the impact of the then large increases even though they were not as large as those that have taken place in the recent past.  The people who use most of the town gas are people in <Col N="1696" /> old houses and the people using bottled gas in many cases are the people whom the State were unable to supply with power.  We are talking about a category of people who would normally be described as being in the low income group.  If we accept that, and there is no reason why we should not accept it, surely the intervention of the Government in the form of a realistic subsidy is the only answer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has in the past been very critical indeed on the national radio network and publicly about town gas suppliers and Dublin Gas in particular, in a way that one normally does not hear in relation to this type of company.  The Minister may or may not be telling the truth in relation to the management, control and services given within the industry. However, that is the Minister's view of gas suppliers.  At the same time the Minister allows them price increases which indicates that while he says that he does not condone their actions, he condones their actions in a practical way by allowing increases which allow them to persist in their inadequate service, as he described it.  The whole thing seems rather ludicrous.  While there is now a suggestion that we would have a national gas grid making gas supplies available from Kinsale to Dublin in particular, the question of what happened in the interim must be faced, because of the nature of the demand and the length of time it will take to provide a service.  Are we to allow consumers to stagger on under this enormous burden, facing shock after shock of further price increases?  If we are, it is unfair to them and the burden of this commodity for people who have to use it exclusively is becoming intolerable and is out of line with the burden of other sources of energy by their neighbours.  Until such time as they get an adequate supply of natural gas, their situation should be reappraised realistically and the appropriate level of subsidy should be made available.  The ratio of the subsidy to the cost of the product has been halved since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>We have had long lectures and dissertations <Col N="1697" /> from Government benches on the whole principle of subsidies and on when and how much should be applied and in what circumstances.  Using the Government's definition there is no time more appropriate than now, because all the characteristics and all the circumstances that would necessitate the introduction of a subsidy are now present to an extreme degree in the case of inflation, and in the case of economic trends and falling living standards.  We must be realistic and while the Government may have to face economic stringencies, one section of society, gas users, particularly the people who use town gas supplies and are stuck with them, should not be discriminated against because of external factors.  We all realise the economic stringencies which were given very practical expression to in budgetary calculations and in the Finance Bill.  However, if any group in the country were singled out for harsh treatment because of external factors, the Government would be justified and would be expected to move in and cushion them from the hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with interest the transcript of last night's proceedings in relation to the motion being debated and listened again this evening to Deputy O'Toole's contribution.  I noticed the dearth of constructive suggestions made by the Opposition speakers.  I cannot let pass without comment some of the baseless allegations made last night and again tonight by Deputy O'Toole in relation to the Government's attitude to price control with particular reference to the operation of the Dublin Gas Company. In the course of his speech last <Col N="1698" /> night Deputy O'Toole referred to the attack made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism on the performance of the Dublin Gas Company while at the same time he had consented to price increases by that company.  This type of garbled rhetoric is typical of that emanating from the Opposition who do not have to face the reality of the present situation.  It is true that the Minister has had some hard things to say about the operations of the Dublin Gas Company and has pointed to the fact that the company were being bolstered by the payment of an annual Exchequer subsidy in the region of £4.5 million.  It is worth noting that the town gas industry review committee have concluded, following a detailed assessment of the Dublin Gas Company's operation, that neither the technical nor the organisational conditions for the acceptance of natural gas are being met by the company at present. Last night my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Meaney, gave the reasons for the increase in the Dublin Gas Company's prices which were announced on 2 May 1980.  He pointed out that this special price increase was granted to prevent further trading losses and to fund capital expenditure which was designed to achieve significant improvement in feed stocks utilisation.  The Government saw no alternative to granting this price increase which had been recommended by the NPC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government recognised that the granting of this special price increase was not the total solution to the company's problems.  Accordingly, as a condition to the price increase, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Colley, has asked the Dublin Gas Company to prepare within six weeks a detailed development programme aimed at securing the long-term viability of the company. To put it bluntly, without this special price increase there was a real danger that the Dublin Gas Company would have faced possible closure.  In such an eventuality I have no doubt that Deputy O'Toole and his colleagues on the Opposition benches would be tabling motions condemning the Government's inactivity and asking why efforts had not <Col N="1699" /> been made to save the company.  If I am to follow Deputy O'Toole's logic, then the Minister while he is critical of the operation of the Dublin Gas Company should not approve any price increases for the company.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might be interested to know that during the past 12 months the cost of naphtha to the Dublin Gas Company on an annual basis has increased by approximately £7.5 million.  Bearing in mind that the company incurred losses in 1979 and but for the special price increases to which I have referred, would have incurred further losses in 1980, there is no possible way in which the Dublin Gas Company could have financed the purchase of their basic raw material without compensatory price increases. Without these compensatory price increases the company would have been long since out of business.  The question I must ask then is, am I to understand that Deputy O'Toole would wish to see price control operated in this manner?</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy O'Toole accused the Government of using the NPC as a shield against criticism of various price increases.  On numerous occasions I and some of my colleagues in Government have praised the work and commitment of the NPC.  The amendment to the present motion tabled by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism refers to the stringent price control exercised by him on bottled and town gas. However, in view of Deputy O'Toole's statement it is highly desirable that the record be put straight and that I outline for the House the role of the NPC in relation to the operation of the Government's price control system.  I propose to demonstrate clearly to the House that this Government have lived up to their commitments on price control.</P>
    <P>Deputies no doubt are aware that the NPC were established by a Fianna Fáil Government in October 1971.  The commission are a statutory body whose principal function is to keep under review the prices of commodities and the charges for rendering services and for carrying <Col N="1700" /> out work or processes, and to advise the Minister in relation to such prices and charges.  Therefore, it is clear that the commission are merely an advisory body with no powers to grant or refuse price increases.  However, this Government accept that, being representative of the interests of industry, traders, workers and consumers, the commission can in exercise of their statutory functions take a broad view of the factors at issue. There is a real danger, however, that the public at large will expect too much of the commission, and this aspect was adverted to by the commission when they were established in October 1971.  Their first report stated explicitly that in the area of price control there are no miracles.  Prices must bear some relation to the cost of production, a point which has been lost apparently on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>When examining price increases the commission work within a set of guidelines laid down by the Government. In the case of labour costs the commission must have regard to specific Government guidelines on labour cost, and increases in line with the terms of national wage agreements and the national understanding must be allowed. Incurred unavoidable increases in raw material and overhead costs verified by documentary evidence must be allowed for price compensation purposes.  If price increases were not to be conceded at all, then increases in costs would have to be met either by improvement in efficiency or from profits.  Profits cannot be allowed to fall below the level necessary for the survival of the applicant firm if very necessary employment is to be maintained.  We should not delude ourselves into thinking that there is much scope for higher costs to be absorbed by profits.  In this regard it is worth noting that the commission have on a number of occasions expressed alarm at the generally low rates of return earned on sales and on capital employed by most firms applying for price increases.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I have referred to the fact that attention invariably is focussed on the price increases recommended <Col N="1701" /> by the commission because they are regarded as newsworthy, and not on that part of the price increases sought that was prevented from occurring. While Opposition Deputies, as is their right, will leave no stone unturned to browbeat the consumer with stories of never-ending price increases, little prominence is every given to the substantial savings which have accrued to the consumer as a result of this Government's stringent price control system. However, I should like to attempt to put the record straight in this matter this evening.</P>
    <P>In the 12-month period from February 1979 to January 1980 the commission considered price increase proposals from 541 applicants.  They claimed increases totalling £441.9 million on an annualised basis.  Of this total, £360.5 million was actually allowed.  This means that as a result of the proper operation of price control procedures as laid down by this Government the prices of the products and services covered by these 541 applications rose by about 22 per cent less than they would have risen if the applications had not been subject to detailed price control. This is something that we are proud of.  In monetary terms it means that because of the strict operation of the price control mechanism by this Government there was a saving to the consumer of almost £80 million in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>At the outset when speaking of the National Prices Commission I pointed out that the commission was an advisory body who made recommendations on price increase proposals.  This means that the final say on all price increase proposals rests with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  Unlike his predecessor, the present Minister has not shirked his responsibility on price control matters.  While appreciating the excellent work being done by the commission the Minister accepts that the ultimate decision on price increases must be made by himself and the Government. With this in mind the Minister, on assuming office, initiated a review of the <Col N="1702" /> operations of the National Prices Commission which resulted in a far more vigorous examination of price proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister's concern and interest in price matters is also demonstrated by the fact that a number of recommendations by the commission on essential commodities such as bottled gas, milk, flour, building materials and petroleum products have been reduced or cut by him.  Finally, on this point I should like to correct a totally misleading and untrue statement made by Deputy O'Toole last night when he said that press statements issued by the Government Information Service on the occasion of the publication of the National Prices Commission's monthly report merely say that the price increases have been recommended by the Prices Commission and no mention is made of the Minister's function in this matter.  Press statements issued in relation to the monthly reports of the commission state clearly whether or not the Minister has accepted the recommendations of the commission in relation to price increase proposals.  In cases where the Minister has refused or cut back on price increase recommendations by the commission this is also clearly stated.  I have here copies of the press statements issued in relation to the most recently published reports of the commission and I shall make these available to Deputy O'Toole or other Deputies if he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government cannot exercise control over what the media may publish but I assure Deputies that the Minister has not abdicated and will not abdicate his personal responsibility for price control whether in gas or in other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various questions were raised by Deputy Enright in this debate about the Gas Committee Report on the town gas industry.  He indicated his wish that the press release dealing with it should be explained to the House.  I do not consider it <Col N="1703" /> appropriate to deal with these matters in this motion; they are matters which are the subject if the Deputy wishes, of a separate debate but, with the permission of the Chair, I shall deal briefly with certain of them.  Deputy Enright asked why the pipe grid was dependent on the Dublin Gas Company.  The answer should be evident.  It is universally accepted that consumption of gas by direct burning rather than for electrical generation is a much more economic and appropriate method of consumption.  The Dublin area is by far the greatest single town gas unit in the country.  With over 156,000 consumers and very considerable potential for expansion it is clear that the pipeline must cover this if it exists at all.  But that is not to say that other areas on the route of the pipeline or within economic reach of it will not be considered.  Quite the contrary, as the Minister for Energy, Deputy Colley made clear at his press conference.</P>
    <P>A town, whether it has or intends to have a town gas supply, which would lie within criteria to be decided upon and which can show that it can handle a supply of town gas effectively and economically, will be considered.  The cost, of course, will be evaluated as an accretion of the cost of a Cork-Dublin pipeline.  Bearing in mind the massive cost involved&mdash;over £100 million in 1979 terms&mdash; and the quantity of gas which it is envisaged should be utilised in this way it is not conceivable that the project should go ahead if there was not a supply of natural gas to Dublin City.</P>
    <P>The House should also bear in mind that the question of the lay-on of natural gas to Dublin in the first instance, and to qualifying towns on the route, is a very important element in an overall national energy policy.  Peak loads on electricity required to meet the cooking hours for the Dublin area imposes a serious burden on electrical generation.  A natural gas lay-on will shave off these peaks while at the same time allowing the ESB to devote less to peak load servicing and more to base load servicing.  That is a <Col N="1704" /> much more useful employment of capital and resources for the ESB also.</P>
    <P>The energy policy also takes into account security of supplies and control over distribution which would arise with the product in question.  Seeing that this debate is concerned with the cost of energy, particularly both pipe and bottled gas, let me say that there is little future, save at virtually unbearable cost, for a town gas industry anywhere which is based on using naphtha which is the current feedstock.  The skyrocketing and highly volatile prices of this feedstock are the root cause of this discussion. While no one is promising cheap gas, at least stability and a less volatile price situation and probably considerable containment of price rises should ensue from the lay-on of natural gas.</P>
    <P>While we are talking of costs and of capital outlay on the project I should like it to be clear that these are not the only costs involved.  At the receiving end of gas there is the question of the strengthening and refurbishing of the mains systems, with the extension of the system itself to new customers, new housing estates and so on, and the changeover of the gas burning appliances which, because of the different nature of the gas, will require adjustment. There are significant capital costs involved to any gas utility in carrying out these changes.  It is well that these facts should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright said that the cost of the changeover was not substantial.  I hope he is right.  It is true to say the cost of the conversion of gas appliances is not very substantial, but that is only a small part of the picture.  Bearing in mind the considerable gains in the short and medium term for consumers, and bearing in mind the very much higher cost which would have to be borne in gas utilities run on other feedstocks, those costs should be economic and worth while.</P>
    <P>The interim period for town gas utilities will strain all our ingenuity, that of the Government and the industry in general.  I need to do no more tonight than quote the words of the chief executive <Col N="1705" /> of the Dublin Gas Company in yesterday's press interview.  He indicated that without this prospect the Dublin Gas Company could not carry on and would have to close.  The underlying financial situation and current loss rate would force this conclusion on any sensible person.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that a gas utility almost on the same scale and in the same circumstances as that of the Dublin City utility has been the subject of the Belfast city council's decision to close it.  In the case of Limerick we have another critical situation.  It is so critical that it is doubtful that even the prospect&mdash;and I underline that it is only a prospect&mdash;of a supply of natural gas would be sufficient to avoid its closure in the very near future, as has been announced.</P>
    <P>In Limerick the broad picture is that costs and loan servicing charges are bearing so heavily on the small-scale Limerick utility that a price increase of the order of well over 100p per therm would be needed to bring the company to break-even point.  It is hardly to be expected that the consumer could meet such an increase, or that the Limerick Gas Utility could sell any gas at that increased price.  A very fundamental and thorough examination of the whole situation is being undertaken.  I can say, however, that the problems are so serious that only a very radical approach will avoid a closure.  The harsh conclusion must be faced that there would have to be a very good and sound justification in economic terms before a decision to close could be avoided.  The Minister for Energy and his colleagues in Government, together with the Limerick Corporation who operate this utility, have the task of assessing in all its aspects the question as to whether this utility can or should continue in existence.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the laying on of natural gas, should it prove to be economically and technically feasible on the criteria which will be laid down, is not to be seen as a simple panacea.  It affords nothing more than one hypothesis on which a plan to deal with the problem might be <Col N="1706" /> devised.  In the last analysis, there will still remain the hurdle, as for any other gas utility seeking natural gas, that a full productivity development and marketing plan justifying the supply of natural gas will still have to be produced and accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate the view that effective price control cannot mean rejection of all price increases while cost increases continue to occur.  To say otherwise, as has been said by the Opposition, is engaging in mere rhetoric.  The measures adopted by the Government with a view to curbing the rate of inflation have been evolved in response to the actualities of our economic situation, with due regard to the requirements of social justice.</P>
    <P>The counter-inflationary policy, therefore, allows for a fair measure of freedom for market forces while seeking to ensure that only the absolute minimum levels of cost increases are reflected in prices.  At the same time, the policy must be such as to ensure that imported raw materials, so essential for our continued industrial growth and improved standards of living, are available. The price control policies adopted by the Government, and continually reviewed by them, are geared to meet this objective with the minimum of inconvenience to any sector of our community.</P>
    <P>When I refer to imported raw materials, it is interesting to note that in the 12 months period up to February last, of all price increases, over 60 per cent were attributable directly to increased costs of fuel or raw materials. This can also be passed on into greater percentages in the cost of gas.  To enable our industry to continue, this industrial base which we have striven so hard to provide for the people and the industrial jobs we have striven so hard to provide, at the rate at which we would wish it to continue and, to be fair, at the rate at which the Opposition would wish it to continue, we must deal with the problem of imported raw materials and energy costs.  We have to face the situation and we have to be prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>There is no point in trying to run away and say, as the Opposition have <Col N="1707" /> said, that we should reject all price increases while allowing cost increases to occur.  That is a recipe for redundancies and job losses at a time when, as a Government and as a community, we should be very much involved in the business of job maintenance as well as job creation.  It is vitally important that we enable our existing industries to survive and continue to prosper.  The line taken by Deputy O'Toole and Deputy Enright and other speakers would suggest that this basic reality has not been grasped by the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are prepared to do our duty by the Irish people. I have no doubt the Irish people will recognise the task we have undertaken.  I also have no doubt that when members of the House consider the facts I have outlined tonight, and which were outlined by my colleague, Deputy Meaney, last night, the amendment moved in the name of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism will be carried, and the motion put down by the Opposition, which comes to us on a regular basis about once every three months, will be rejected as was the fate of its predecessors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to job maintenance, a subject that is connected very much with prices and with national pay agreements.  I am comparing the miserable record of this anti-social Government with the record of the government of social justice, in other words, the National Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What amazes me is that on every occasion on which a few jobs are created by the IDA we have the Minister making the relevant announcement at press conferences but he is never here to tell us <Col N="1710" /> when price rises occur or to defend any such rises.  If the Minister is an concerned about job maintenance as he says he is, he might think in terms of subsidies.  For instance, subsidisation to the extent of £10 million would go a long way to easing the problem while £20 million would make a tremendous difference.  Neither of these amounts is huge in terms of Government spending.  Indeed, they represent only a small part of total national spending.  The 100 per cent price increases in the past couple of years in respect of gas have proved a penal imposition to the captive market of consumers who have no alternative to gas. The recent budget increased prices by between 4 and 6 per cent and general prices rises are now heading towards the 20 per cent mark.  More than 75 per cent of the problem is due to domestic factors. These factors are lack of Government control and misguided Government policies.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had come in and told us that the Government are really concerned about the poor and that, consequently, they were prepared to agree to subsidisation to the gas users to the extent of £10 million, the people concerned would have been relieved.  They would have been thankful for such a small mercy but there has been no indication of any such concern on the part of the Minister.  This is an appalling indictment of the Government especially when one thinks of their actions in other areas involving the well-to-do.  The Government have abandoned the poor.</P>
    <P>Another area which is connected with the whole energy problem is the area of home improvements especially in terms of insulation and of conversion to solid fuel heating.  There are many people who are in a position to undertake such work without any help from the Government but there are many others who are not so lucky.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important link and the Minister's concern is obvious <Col N="1711" /> when he refers to it as being a tenuous link. There are many thousands of people living in local authority houses without fireplaces built by Fianna Fáil, under their cheap housing policy, who have now been robbed of the grant to convert from gas&mdash;which is the only heating in these houses&mdash;to back boilers, and the Minister says there is a tenuous link&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have been placed in that position because of misguided Fianna Fáil policies in the past and they are being clobbered because of present misguided Fianna Fáil policies.  Up to a few weeks ago some of them might have said: gas prices are rising enormously; we had better go to the credit union to get a loan&mdash;the Government will give us £600&mdash;and convert to a back boiler. They cannot now do that, the £600 subsidy having been abolished.  These are undeniable achievements of Fianna Fáil. They have plastered the poor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it has to do with the price and the use of gas.  I would ask the Minister of State to take back to the Minister of Energy the hope that he will consider what the lack of house improvement grants does to the consumption of gas; that we could reduce dramatically <Col N="1713" /> the use of gas if we had reinstated a home improvements grant of some sort, perhaps confined to this area of insulation and conversion.</P>
      <P>Another area in which something could be done about the overall consumption of gas and its adverse effect on our balance of payments is that of current house design.  Are we still designing houses, or approving housing grants with gas heating?  Should we not be looking at that question?  I would ask the Minister of State to draw the attention of the Minister for the Environment to that point.  Having said that, the fact is there are thousands of homes captive to gas; they must use gas for cooking or heating, or both.  This week it was hinted that the Dublin Gas Company might not continue in certain circumstances.  If that implied threat were to come to pass it would have a devastating effect on thousands upon thousands of people.  I should like to have an absolute gilt-edged guarantee from the Government that, come hell or high water, a Dublin Gas Company of one form or another will continue, that the Minister will guarantee the security of supply of town gas in the Dublin area; that, if necessary, the Government will nationalise the Dublin Gas Company, or allow the local authorities to municipalise it to ensure security of supply.  We did not hear any such assurance from the Minister this evening.</P>

      <P>What the Minister of State said last evening and again this evening regarding the Government's policy on stringent control of prices and the reasons associated with such increases as have been implemented since Christmas&mdash;which in fact are a cut-back on what the National Prices Commission recommended&mdash;illustrate that the Government are very conscious of these matters.  The fact that energy prices have risen so substantially, the fact that Opposition Deputies have managed successfully to forget the words naptha, butane and propane, products used in the formation of gas, has been very convenient for them.  It is only right to bring them back to some of the realities of 1974, 1975 and 1976 when prices rose by 17 per cent, 21 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the years this Government have been in office in an endeavour to justify his arguments. The fact that the price of Arabian crude oil which was 12.95 US dollars in January 1978 has risen 100 per cent and is now about 26 US dollars shows the massive increases which have occurred. The matter was raised that when the Coalition Government were in office the increases were only 25 per cent and that the percentage increases in the cost of living in those years were very substantially higher than at present.  This defeats the purported argument.  Mention was made of the damage we were doing to the social welfare classes.  This year the increases were bigger than ever&mdash;between October 1979 and April 1980 amounting to 31 per cent.  How in the name of commonsense can this argument be put forward by Deputy Mitchell who then leaves the House rather than listen to the reply from the Government side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had to attend a front bench meeting, in fairness to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Deputy Mitchell knows that the argument put forward does not stand up and his front <Col N="1716" /> bench colleague must realise that.  I am as aware as anyone else that price increases have damaging effects for the community.  The Government do not lack any awareness on that score and are not oblivious of the feelings of the constituents among whom they stand for election.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to put on the record of the House that the Government have put control on price increases in the last few years which were four times more in the Coalition period.  In the last few days the Minister for Energy has given detailed recommendations to improve the situation of the Alliance and Dublin Consumers Gas Company.  He is putting pressure on that Company, which is accepted by them, to try and improve the situation and there have been detailed plans, involving a number of Departments, in trying to overcome the problem of the gas company and prevent them from closing down.  The increases given, as Deputy Mitchell appears to forget, were to prevent the closing down and to allow time for examination.  These are the facts.  It is too easy to come in here and say that this Government have done this, that or the other.  They are tackling this problem in a sensible and well-organised fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer briefly, as everyone else seems to have done, to the work of the Minister for Energy and to the findings of the inter-Departmental committee on the question of the allocation of natural gas to the Dublin area, which takes up 90 per cent of the gas requirements of the entire country, and the various ways in which the Minister hopes the use of natural gas will improve the situation. He mentioned that a more effective and efficient use of natural gas could be got, instead of the alternative usage which is electricity generation.  Over the last number of years during the Coalition period and during this Government's term in office it is clear that energy costs have increased substantially.  These are outside factors which, because of our small economy and the fact that we do not have at present our own energy resources, create difficulties which must <Col N="1717" /> be dealt with in the best way possible. Any way which can be found of using natural gas to cut the cost of electricity generation will be of obvious benefit.  The Minister for Energy and the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism made it clear that this would have to be looked at in detail.  Nobody can jump in and say &ldquo;Here is the solution.  Now we shall put it into operation&rdquo;.  The cost of bringing natural gas from Kinsale would be very substantial and if the market is not there to ensure a viable and feasible package, there is no point in doing it.  The Dublin Gas Company realise this and for their own future must achieve something in the next six weeks while their position is being examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy said that the significant net saving on required energy investment of capital in respect of gas and electricity would, it is hoped, be cheaper with natural gas rather than with electricity plants.  Naturally, the significant saving on the import bill and our energy products and the effects that they would have on the balance of payments must be taken into account.  Any way in which the use of natural gas will improve the balance of payments in regard to energy cost would be of benefit.  A significant saving would arise from the eventual closure of the town gas industry, if that were to be the case, and all these factors including flexibility and diversification in meeting the country's energy requirements can be achieved if it is possible to bring natural gas to the city.  I am sure that the Minister for Energy will look at all these areas and that the cost to the consumer will be of prime importance in any decision made on the use of natural gas.  The town gas consumption in 1979 amounted to something like 7,500 million cubic feet.  Consumption in Dublin accounts for 90 per cent of this.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mitchell has said, of course, it is of prime importance to this city that nothing happens to the gas industry. I reiterate Government policy on bringing in natural gas to the city.  Price increases were granted to the Alliance <Col N="1718" /> and Dublin Consumers Gas Company to bore for gas.  Some increase had to be allowed to keep the company viable.  It is unfair of any Deputy to be critical of the Dublin Gas Company.  They were dealing with something that could not have been predicted, massive increases in the cost of naphtha.  If the price of component parts of any product increases, it is only fair that that increase should be handed back to the firm otherwise you go into the massive subsidisation which Deputy Mitchell was talking about, which is unfair and leads to taxation. Subsidies are discriminatory.  They are given to people whether they need them or not.  This year almost £6 million was given in subsidies, so subsidisation has not been eliminated.  The increases in the social welfare benefits are putting money back into the pockets of the people who require it most.  Those who can afford pay.  This has been Government policy all along.  The increases of 25 per cent and 31 per cent which I have mentioned were higher than the increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Any allegations that the National Prices Commission are not strictly and stringently dealing with every application and only allowing increases which are necessary for the viability of these firms is unfair.  It is clear that the policy of the Opposition party is, as is their duty, to put down these motions continually. However, they also have a responsibility to accept that if there are large outside increases it is impossible for companies to deal with them and continue on without increasing the cost of their product.  It is unfair not to put this fact across, particularly about energy costs which are affecting every country, with the exception of the oil-producing ones.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Departmental report is examined in further detail and when the technicalities concerning people like the IIRS are dealt with, It should be possible to bring natural gas from Cork.  This should allow gas consumption in Dublin to increase fourfold, which is necessary for the Dublin Gas Company to continue as a growing concern.  If this is not <Col N="1719" /> possible, it is something that will have to be faced up to at that stage.  The gas company feel that if the projections that have been based on the inter-Departmental Committee findings are followed they should be a viable concern. I would like to praise the Minister of State for the control he has endeavoured to keep on price increases. Time and again prices lower than those recommended by the Prices Commission have been granted.</P>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Mitchell said about the grants I am sure every Deputy in the House knows that people who were considering changing to alternative forms of energy had their applications in prior to the closing date.  It was left open to people to have some time to get their applications in and get the work done at a later date.  It is wrong to say that all this work was cut-off.  Deputy Mitchell knows that as well as other Deputies from the amount of correspondence they have with the Department of the Environment and the number of applications that particular ruling brought in.  I am sure that it will probably be well into 1981 before the companies concerned get around to doing the work.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Government are looking at the whole area of energy and how best the price of energy can be controlled within the limited control we have over it.  I know, in relation to the price increase of gas that the Minister has examined this matter and has allowed only what is essential to keep the Dublin Gas Company in business until the overall review takes place.  I know that then the Government will do everything possible to protect the consumers of that particular company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion I tabled yesterday on behalf of the Fine Gael Party is a reasonable one.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in 1977 there was a subsidy on Dublin town gas of approximately 33 per cent. The gross price of a therm of cooking gas in 1977 was 66.23p and there was a subsidy of 21.20p on it.  The net price of <Col N="1720" /> a therm of cooking gas at that time was 45.03p.  It was a very significant subsidy and it made the price of gas reasonable. The gross price at the moment is 126.43p with a subsidy of 16.70p leaving the net price at 109.73p.  The subsidy now is approximately 12 per cent and has been reduced from approximately 33 per cent.</P>
      <P>This is a very significant reduction, but the subsidy on cooking gas must be restored to what it was.  If this was done it would mean that a therm of gas would cost approximately 84p.  In the view of our party a similar subsidy should be brought in on the heating rate also.  This would significantly reduce the price for the heating rate also.  It is also necessary to provide a subsidy for bottled gas, because the price of a cylinder of bottled gas is frightening.</P>
      <P>Gas is used mainly by elderly people, people with large families, people in flats and houses where there are no other cooking or heating facilities.  While gas is used in some wealthy homes, the vast bulk of gas supply is used in the houses of ordinary working people, widows and pensioners.  I believe the Government's argument that the subsidy would only help the better-off people is a wrong argument.  I ask the Minister to consider this in the near future, because I believe if he looks at it seriously he will see the merit of what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in rural Ireland and I visit many of the homes of elderly people.  Many of them use briquettes and timber, but the vast majority of them use bottled gas for heating and cooking.  The price of a cylinder of gas for those people is a major hole in their incomes.  A 25 pound gas cylinder costs £4.33.  When we add to that the delivery charge it makes the price of this gas enormous for those people. In thousands of flats and houses around this city there are no cooking or heating facilities available except gas. The Government are speaking about everybody using energy as if it was a real luxury.  Every person who switches on a gas fire, burns briquettes, burns oil or petrol is not using it as a luxury.  The Government should realise that the vast <Col N="1721" /> majority of people need to use gas, petrol, oil, briquettes and timber because they have no choice.  They need it for cooking and heating.  If the Minister provides a subsidy it will not mean that everybody will turn it on waste it and use it as a luxury, it would just help to alleviate the difficulties and the hardship which many people are experiencing. Many people, particularly in the city, are unable to pay the increased price for gas. Old people will have to face a hard winter because they will not be able to afford to pay for the gas.  Many of them will end up in hospital suffering from pneumonia and that will cost the State money.  I know the Minister does not want that to happen.  This is a serious matter and is a cause for concern.  If it is not dealt with it will have frightening repercussions.  Young families also will suffer because of the scarcity of hot meals and heating unless the Government alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House calls upon the Government to take steps to reduce the price of gas to consumers. The Government could do a number of things.  They could restore the subsidy to the rate of approximately 33 per cent as it was when Fianna Fáil returned to office. The Minister could remove the duty payable on town gas.  The 22p duty that is being charged on bottled gas could be removed as well.  That would be a start, and it would bring the price of gas to approaching a normal level if a reasonable subsidy were introduced along with these improvements.  I do not blame the Minister for everything, but he is to blame for a certain amount of it, and that is the reason why this motion was put down.  I hope the Government will try to get back to some sort of a realistic price.</P>
    <P>I know the House is concerned about the frightening escalating cost of fuel, particularly gas.  The price of briquettes has increased too, and I understand that Bord na Móna have an application in for a further price increase.  Petrol prices have also gone up, but that is somewhat different.  All heating fuels including briquettes, turf, gas and coal have been increased, <Col N="1722" /> and it is important that the Government realise the seriousness of this.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, and I am just asking that it be published in full. Today's <i>Irish Independent</i> says that the gas link to 150,000 Dublin homes is threatened.  The paper says that the Dublin Gas Company face closure if imately 100 feet high.  The lift was in-from Kinsale Head.  This report concludes that the future of the town gas industry in general hinges largely on the future of the Dublin Gas Company, which accounts for over 90 per cent of the sales of the industry excluding Cork. That is very important.  From that it appears that it is only if the Dublin Gas Company can adapt that this natural gas <Col N="1723" /> supply will be provided for the country.  I would ask the Tánaiste and the Government to clarify that situation.</P>

      <P>Approximately £70 million was the figure quoted 12 or 18 months ago to supply a pipeline from Cork to Dublin.  The cost now is around £100 million.  The provision of natural gas for cooking and heating should not hinge solely on the Dublin Gas Company. There should be a supply of gas in the larger centres of population, in towns like Galway, Limerick, Wexford, Dundalk, Portlaoise, Tullamore and Birr. The Confederation of Irish Industry in last Monday's <i>Evening Herald</i> called for the construction of a £100 million gas pipeline to carry the gas not only to Dublin but throughout the country.  Gas can and should be provided to all of these towns throughout the country. <Col N="1724" /> Holland is an example where this has been done.  It has also been done in Japan, and Britain have divided their country into 12 different parts to facilitate the supply of gas throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We have a challenge to meet in regard to this.  When Bord na Móna was first established, Russians came across to County Offaly to see our briquette factories working.  That was an example of what we could do with initiative. Similarly the ESB have given us an example and Bord Gáis, given the strength and the personnel, can meet the challenge facing them in this area and it will have enormous repercussions for everybody.

      <P>I am raising this matter to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that at Ardnacrusha, near Parteen, in County Clare a serious situation has obtained for the past four months or so.  The fish pass there has been out of order during all that period.  The pass is a type of lift which the ESB use to raise salmon above the dam which is approximately 100 feet high.  The lift was installed <Col N="1727" /> approximately 15 years ago to enable the salmon to get above the dam, something which would otherwise be a physical impossibility for them.  When the dam was built originally the ESB had to open the sluice gates to let the fish through at times, but they found this difficult or impossible, and this is why the pass is there.</P>
      <P>I was approached by fishermen in the midlands and asked to raise this matter in the House because they are concerned that it has taken approximately four months to have the work carried out.  I have been inquiring about it for some time and on each occasion I have been told that it would be fixed up in a while or something like that.</P>
      <P>If the present situation continues without the lift being put back into working order salmon will be unable to get up along the Shannon and through Lough Derg up to the Little Brosna, through the Brosna proper and all the other rivers. Over a period of perhaps two years this will have a serious effect on salmon spawning.  The spring salmon, salmon coming in in January and February, have been unable to get through the dam.  I understand that once or twice the gates were opened but this has not been satisfactory.  Also, if we were to have much rain at present it would cause difficulties.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am bringing the matter to the Minister's notice.  He is the person on whom responsibility rests and he can use pressure to ensure that this work is completed at the earliest possible opportunity so that this lift will be put back into action.</P>
      <P>A sizeable number of people are very involved and interested in fishing and they are seriously concerned at the length of time it has taken to have this work carried out.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the fish pass is repaired immediately.</P>
      <P>I am handing over to Deputy White for the remainder of my time.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that stocks have been declining for some years in the Parteen fish pass.  Stocks there have been very unsatisfactory for some years past.  I am sure the Minister is just as concerned as we are.  We would like to thank Deputy Enright for bringing this to the Minister's notice.  It is disturbing to both sides of the House if the lift, the means by which the fish can get through the Parteen fish pass, has been out of action&mdash;I understand there is such a thing as a lift into which the fish go and are then brought up under control and put back into the river&mdash;has not been working&mdash;I hope the Minister will tell us this in replying&mdash;for the past three or four months.</P>
      <P>I have criticised the ESB in the past and I have to criticise them again tonight because I think the time has come when everything should be under the control of the Minister for Fisheries.  I would hope that if the fish pass had been under the control of the Minister of Fisheries this matter would have been attended to immediately.  If it was under private enterprise control, or if, as I hope it will be, it was under the new Central Board or the regional boards, there is no reason it or any other lift should not be fixed within a matter of hours or, at most, days.  It would be very difficult for us to prove the true figures of salmon going through this fish pass unless the lift is actually working.</P>
      <P>It will serve no purpose for the Minister to say that this lift will be in operation in a week or ten days.  This fish pass should have been fixed immediately. I am very disappointed that the Minister has not seen his way to have that done.  I hope what we have brought to the Minister's attention is not true.  If it is true, it is a very serious accusation against the Department of Fisheries and the ESB in particular, since it is under their control, that they have not seen fit to get this pass fixed immediately.</P>

      <P>Perhaps some background geographical and historical information would be helpful in explaining the <Col N="1729" /> problem that worries Deputy Enright and Deputy White.  The Shannon Scheme started in 1925 and was completed in 1929.  This involved the diversion of the river by a weir at Parteen Villa four miles below Killaloe.  The water was diverted through a canal seven-and-a-quarter miles long to the power station at Ardnacrusha.  A fall of 100 feet approximately is obtained here at the dam and the water flows by a tailrace one-and-a-quarter miles long to meet the old watercourse at St. Thomas's Island two miles above Limerick.</P>
      <P>Navigational locks for boats were provided at Ardnacrusha and a pool type fish pass was provided at Parteen Villa weir to allow fish ascending the old river channel to surmount the weir.  Since 1929, salmon have had two chances of going up the Shannon.  First, they could enter the tailrace or, secondly, they could go through the old channel, as many did, up the old water course, some into the Mulcaire River and others through the fish pass at Parteen.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Enright said, that system was not entirely satisfactory as the fish were inclined to enter the tailrace and lie about there.  They would not use the navigational lock and they were not inclined to go back down river one-and-a-quarter miles to the old channel.  So another system was devised to enable fish to get over the dam.  It was a very novel and elaborate fish lift, and it came into operation in 1959 and proved to be very successful ever since.  It appeared to be attractive to the salmon coming upstream.</P>
      <P>During the recent annual maintenance work to this fish lift it was discovered that faults had developed in the roller system of the gates.  These required major repairs and replacements, which are being carried out as quickly as possible. I can assure Deputy White that this is not something you can replace or repair in a day, nor can I tell him that it will be repaired tomorrow.  I believe the repairs will be completed within the next three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am as concerned as both Deputies <Col N="1730" /> that the gates in the fish lift will be operating before the main run of salmon in June, and I have impressed on the ESB how vital it is to have the work completed as soon as is humanly possible. In the meantime, instructions have been given to keep the area under constant observation and to operate the locks as a regular procedure to allow salmon to escape upstream.</P>
    <P>I should say there is no large scale concentration of fish yet at Ardnacrusha, nor is it possible in operating the locks to see how many fish escape. Because of the depth of the water it is not possible to see them unless they jump.  I do know, however, that salmon are passing through the Parteen weir, and five salmon went through last week. This should indicate that the main run of salmon has not yet commenced.  It should also convince Deputies that salmon have an option of going up river by taking the old water course and going through the Parteen weir.  In a nutshell, salmon have three options open to them to ascend the Shannon.  Two are operating at Parteen and at the navigational lock.  The third and most important is being repaired and will be ready before the main run starts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright mentioned that the fish lift had been out of operation for four months.  I have no evidence that that is correct.  He said he has been drawing attention to this fact and nothing has been done.</P>

A query to me or my Department would have elicited the information I have given tonight in a much easier way for everybody concerned.  I regret the hold up due to the wear and tear to a fish lift which has operated successfully for 21 years.  As the song says, 21 years is a mighty long time.  Even the Fianna Fáil machine gave a little wobble after 16 <Col N="1731" /> years in 1973 but we corrected it at the very first opportunity and brought in a record catch of 84, if I remember correctly. I trust both Deputies will accept that the fish lift in Ardnacrusha will be fully <Col N="1732" /> operational as soon as possible.  In the meantime, every help will be given to the salmon to escape upstream to spawn.</P>

      <P>I am aware that criticisms have been made in recent months about the level of charges at Irish airports. Such criticisms, when based on comparisons with charges at US airports, must be treated with reserve.  The economic and organisational environment of US airports is different and also varies from one US airport to another depending on ownership, traffic density and other factors.</P>
      <P>Charges at Irish airports are reviewed annually by Aer Rianta in consultation with the airlines and then submitted for my approval prior to implementation. Bearing in mind that Irish airports are in competition with UK and continental airports for North Atlantic traffic, especially transit traffic, my practice in considering proposals for increased charges at Irish airports is to take into account the competitive effect on Irish airports <i>vis-à-vis</i> their UK and continental competitors.  On the basis of such comparison, Irish airports are considerably down the league table.</P>

    <P>Apart from the foregoing special project, the possibility of using forest materials and timber waste from existing sources for electricity generation is also being examined and tests are being carried out.  If these tests are successful up to 50 mw of additional power could be generated in the reasonably short term, in addition to the 20 to 40 mw, already mentioned.</P>
    <P>These projects are part of the general programme which I am promoting to achieve a co-ordinated approach towards evaluating the potential of all renewable courses of energy including biomass.  This programme has a high priority in my overall policy to achieve the most efficient use of all available enetrgy sources in the national interest.</P>

      <P>The assessment of differential rents of local authority dwellings in accordance with the terms of the national differential rents schemes is a matter for each local authority concerned.  The schemes are national scheme and apply uniformly throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The income to be taken into account for differential rent purposes in the case of employed tenants is basic income less income tax and pay-related social insurance appropriate to that income. Such income is, in general, the normal weekly rate of remuneration exclusive of shift allowances, bonus and overtime payments and as such should apply to the various categories of workers referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the delay in deciding entitlement in this case was that when the person concerned claimed benefit he had no Irish social insurance contributions in the period governing his claim and his insurance in the United Kingdom, where he had previously been employed, could not be reckoned under the EEC regulations until he had first been insurably employed in this country subsequent to his return.  As a result of certain inquiries, which were somewhat protracted, had to be made into his employment situation since his return and into his efforts to obtain employment as it is a condition for entitlement that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>As a result of these inquiries, a deciding officer has held that the person concerned was not available for and genuinely seeking employment during the period of his claim.  Consequently he is not entitled to either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance which he also claimed during the period in question.</P>
      <P>He may appeal against this decision and the necessary form for doing so may be obtained at his local office.</P>
