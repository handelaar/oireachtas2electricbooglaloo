    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> The Chair refused this question on the grounds that it was an internal matter for CIE and not for the Minister.  I remember as Minister answering questions regarding CIE.  If the Minister looks up Volumes 307, 308 and 309 of the Official Report he will see that the present Minister for Defence answered questions relating to CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Protection of Young Persons (Employment) (Section 4) Order, 1980,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 21 May, 1980.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to seek the approval of the House for a draft order to continue in force for a further period of 12 months from 4 July 1980, subsection (3) of section 4 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides that this section was to remain in force for two years only from the date of commencement of the Act unless continued in force by an affirmative order.  The two-year time limit expired on 4 July 1979 and last year, with the approval of the Dáil and Seanad, I made an order extending the section for 12 months from that date.  Since then, a full-scale review of the Act, with a view to its amendment, has been taking place in my Department.  It would not be possible, however, to complete the <Col N="828" /> review before expiry of the existing order in July 1980.  I am satisfied that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained until the Houses of the Oireachtas have an opportunity to consider possible amendments of the Act.  Accordingly, I am seeking approval of the draft order which would continue section 4 (3) in force until July 1981.</P>
    <P>The position under the 1977 Act is that there is a general prohibition on the employment of children under the school leaving age which is at present 15 years. However, the effect of subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 4 is to permit children under 15, but over 14 years of age to be employed in light nonindustrial work for limited periods outside school hours, provided that the work is not harmful to their health or normal development or that it does not affect their capacity to benefit from school.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Act imposes obligations on employers in regard to the employment of young people, including those between 14 and 15 years of age. Before employing a young person, an employer must require the production of a birth certificate or other satisfactory evidence of age.  The written permission of a parent or guardian must also be obtained. An employer must maintain a register or other satisfactory record showing, in regard to young persons, the name, date of birth, times of starting and finishing work each day, the rate and the total amount of wages paid.  The employer is also required to display an approved Abstract of the Act at the principal entrances to the place of employment in such a way that it may easily be read by the employees.</P>
    <P>There is no disagreement about the obligation we all have to ensure that young people are given every opportunity to benefit fully from their attendance at school and that their education is not disrupted in any way.  I can well understand the viewpoint of those who maintain that there should be a total ban on the employment of children under 15 years of age during school term and I accept that their concern is for the health, <Col N="829" /> education and moral welfare of young people.  However, the experience of my Department in the enforcement of the Act since it came into operation almost three years ago, has not revealed evidence of any significant degree of exploitation of children in employment during school term or at any other time. On the other hand, there is some evidence that the withdrawal of the right to engage in employment without the strict limits laid down in subsection (3) of section 4 of the Act could be contrary to the wishes of many parents who consider that a limited period of work outside school hours can be useful experience for young people in the process of deciding on careers.</P>
    <P>While the intention, when the Act was being enacted, was that section 4 (3) would lapse after two years unless kept in force by affirmative order, the legal position, as now ascertained, appears to be that in the absence of section 4 (3), children under 15 years of age would be allowed to work during the school term but without the protection which section 4 (3) provides by way of limitation of their hours of work.  For this reason, it is necessary to keep section 4 (3) in force.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the members of the Dáil and Seanad will have an opportunity to consider fully the future long-term position when the proposed amendment of the Act comes before the Oireachtas following the completion of the current review of the Act by my Department.  Meanwhile, I would ask the Dáil to approve the making of an order to continue in force for a further 12 months from 4 July 1980, subsection (3) of section 4 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The placing of this order before the House affords me an opportunity to express my concern at the lack of enforcement in this area of employment of young people.  The Act was designed to protect young people and forbid the employment of those under 15 years with the exception that those between 14 and 15 years may be employed <Col N="830" /> for restricted hours in any given week as laid down by the section which this order seeks to extend.  However, as will be seen in a report in today's <i>Irish Times</i> in relation to this question, the Act is almost completely unenforced.  There is no enforcement worth talking about.  Could the Minister tell the House if there are any steps he can take to see that this Act is enforced?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the notice which should appear at the entrances to places of employment.  We all know that in pubs in this city and throughout the country many young people are employed. I cannot recall seeing at the entrance to any pub the notice which the Act requires.  I have also seen children under the age of 14 years employed in those pubs.  Every day in the week we see young children, whom some people refer to as young urchins, much younger than 14 years, even younger than 10 years in some cases, selling newspapers.  I have no doubt that in some cases those children are selling newspapers in order to help their poverty-stricken families but very often they are working for newspaper sellers.  I understand that newspaper selling is a very profitable business.  Newspaper sellers have their job to do and it is very important that they sell newspapers at places where people want to buy them.</P>
      <P>We have not entered into the spirit of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act.  We have not enforced it. In the review of the Act which the Minister indicated is taking place does he propose to give attention to enforcement? It is scandalous that we allow children to be employed for very long hours.  How can we expect to control the drinking of alcohol among young people if we allow a situation to continue where children are employed in pubs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am gravely concerned about this matter.  There may be problems but my wish is that we can prohibit people under the age of 18 years working in pubs.  I understand that 18 years is the minimum age for drinking in pubs.  If we do not stop children under 18 years working in pubs what chance have we got of discouraging <Col N="831" /> them from drinking?  This has become a major problem.</P>
    <P>The criticism I have in relation to newspaper selling is that it is usually very young children well under 14 years who are selling newspapers in all kinds of weather and in dangerous traffic con-ditions. I hope that in the review which is taking place the Minister will give attention to the enforcement of the Act and also to raising the age for those who work in pubs to 18 years.  When does the Minister expect to bring before the House the review of legislation which he has promised?  I hope it will be some time this year.  I accept the point the Minister made that if we did not pass this order today we would remove all protection from young people.  This party support the Minister's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker on behalf of my party I reluctantly accept the extension for 12 months of section 4 (3) of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  We expected this to be a genuine piece of legislation but unfortunately this Act is only a facade and might be described as a window-dressing operation because the protection in the Act and the conditions in it are not being genuinely enforced. The newspaper report to which I have referred is frightening because we must realise that the youth of today will be the men of tomorrow.  We may complain about vandalism or about terror gangs roaming the streets but in some instances such behaviour may be attributable to those young people having worked as 14 or 15 year olds in environments, and not necessarily public houses, in which the seeds of their conduct were sown because, perhaps, of what they saw in those places.  I have known of the employment of young people that could only be described as Fagin-like where they were overworked, underpaid and working generally in conditions that were more like conditions that would have prevailed in the last century.  There are times when parents are of the impression that a short term in employment is a good experience for a young boy or girl <Col N="832" /> but this genuine interest can be abused by employers.</P>
      <P>We are told that it would not be possible to complete the review before expiry of the existing order in July 1980.  We are not prepared to accept the situation of a motion being brought forward again next year for the purpose of seeking a further extension because in the three years that have passed since the legislation was passed, whatever small amount of that legislation that has been invoked has not been used to offset the inroads being made on our young people by employers who do not deserve to be called employers.  Reluctantly we are prepared to agree to the extension on this occasion but we would oppose vehemently any effort to seek a further extension in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, section 4, subsection (3) of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, provides for the employment of persons under 15 for a maximum of two hours per day during school term.  The Minister and the Department will be aware that the ICTU opposed this section strongly when that Act was before the House.  As a compromise an amendment was agreed at the time by the ICTU and by the Minister for Labour and this was supported by the Labour Party.  That amendment provided that paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of section 4 would remain in force only until the expiration of a period of two years beginning with the coming into force of the Act unless it should be continued in force by an order under subsection (5) of section 4.  It provided that the Minister might by order at any time under section 3 provide that the subsection should continue in force for a period not exceeding 12 months from the date of the commencement of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall also that the ICTU wrote to the Minister for Labour in May 1979 regarding subsection (3) of section 4 of the Act requesting that it should not continue in operation.  This morning the Minister has given the House a reaction that is almost identical <Col N="833" /> to his reaction to that request from congress, that is, that inspections carried out by the Department's inspectors in enforcing the Act and in investigating complaints have not revealed any widespread exploitation of children in employment during school terms and that there is evidence that the withdrawal of the right to engage in such limited employment would be contrary to the wishes of many parents who consider that strictly limited periods of work outside school hours is a good experience for young persons.  As a result of these findings the Minister has decided to make an order for an extension for a further period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the views of the inspectorate.  I know that they are a very conscientious body of men and that they have increased in number down through the years but even on a superficial examination of the situation I am sure that many Deputies would point to the fact that these examinations are not usually carried out between, say, 7 p.m. and 12.30 a.m.  As a public representative I find that in the south-Dublin area where I am obliged to attend meetings that are held in licensed premises, many children between 14 and 15 and a large number of young adults between the ages of 15 and 17 work in those premises from 7 p.m. at weekends and work through until 12.15 a.m. or later.  Invariably, these young people live close to the premises in which they work so that there is no problem in regard to their transport home.</P>
    <P>I am not singling out licensed premises particularly but a fact of life to which we as public representatives must advert in very strong terms is that there are a number of factors involved in young people working in such premises. First, it is socially undesirable in the worst possible sense that a young person of 14 or 15 should be employed in the culture and in the social climate of what we refer to as the lounge bar society. Naturally, I have no objection to people older than 18 drinking in such places. That is their social privilege but where young people work in licensed premises <Col N="834" /> it happens frequently that after the customers have gone and the cleaning up has been completed, a young person is given his first pint of shandy and this can be the beginning of the development of very serious drinking habits.  I do not wish to sound alarmist on this but it is an experience to go into such places and to meet some of these people and to be met with a blank refusal and with some embarrassment on their part when they are asked their age.</P>
    <P>The second point in that regard is that the rates of pay of such young persons is usually about £1.25 per hour plus whatever tips the customers might feel like giving them as the evening becomes more boozy.  Unfortunately, there are parents in Ireland, as there are in all countries, who do not care very much where their children work.  Nowadays one often finds 15 year olds in licensed premises who look mature enough to be 17 or 18.  There should be a fairly savage crackdown by the Department of Labour and the inspectorate on that situation.  The rate of profit on alcoholic drink is generally assumed to be 100 per cent, at the minimum.  Where young people are employed in these circumstances, where employers do not have to pay income tax for such persons, burying it in the petty cash, where they do not have to pay pay-related social insurance for such young persons and where employment records are not kept, then there should be a crackdown.</P>
    <P>There are other areas at which the Minister should take a sharp look.  The inspectorate cannot go chasing around here, there, and everywhere but some garages employ young people from 8 o'clock on Saturday morning, right through to midnight on Saturday night and on Sunday.  There children working on petrol pumps are only 14 or 15 years of age.  These are very big consumer trading outlets.</P>
    <P>The hotel trade is fairly rigorously policed, generally by inspectors; the restaurant trade has a sharp eye kept on it.  If a young person of 14 or 15 does a couple of hours' work in a supermarket <Col N="835" /> packing bags, that is a lot better than dishing out trays of drink to people on Saturday afternoons in the smokey atmosphere of a lounge bar.  The criticism which the continuation of this order has evoked here this morning is to serve notice on the Minister, who is quite genuine in his response to a continuation here this morning, that a review of the Act has to go through.</P>
    <P>We do not oppose the order.  Straight opposition of it might lead to a less desirable situation than exists at present. The section of the Act does require a fairly reasonable technical amendment. That should be possible and the Minister in that regard will, I am sure, meet the ICTU and will check the situation.</P>
    <P>To conclude, there are enormous pressures on families who want the extra few bob for household expenditure. There are enormous pressures on 14 and 15 year olds who genuinely want the sense of independence, to earn their own pocket money and to be in an earning situation even at a young age, because this is the culture of society around them.  We must strongly ensure that they are protected and that society is kept under control, and healthy in its climate. The Minister must say, not just to his inspectorate but to the parents&mdash;who, after all, have the primary responsibility for allowing their 14 and 15 year olds out into that kind of employment situation where they could be exploited&mdash;that they should desist, and resist temptations in those areas.  As a result, the need for public expenditure on enforcement would be reduced, a better society would develop for these young people and a better climate would ensue in that regard.</P>

      <P>While I accept the extension order of section 4, I have some reservations about it.  Half a loaf, I suppose, is better than no bread.  When this section is not being enforced, there is no point in being more ambitious and looking for increased legislation for another year.  I would ask the Minister to make every possible effort to enforce this section for the sake of our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> There is no doubt that young people of 14 and 15 can be innocent victims at the hands of exploiters.  We live in a materialistic society, with many heartless capitalists and opportunists who are willing at any time to take advantage of these children who, naturally enough, cannot see through this type of person. One cannot put an old head on young shoulders.  If the Act were enforced, many of these young people would not be exploited in 1980 and this is what I would ask the Minister to do.</P>
    <P>There are many children who find work more rewarding than going to school.  This is something which needs to be looked at.  Naturally enough, the gratification brought about by work is more immediate than that brought about by study.  To a child, £1.50 an hour is very rewarding; he or she can buy a lot straight away.  There is no such immediate reward in schooling.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this time next year an amendment should be made which would ensure that school will come first and work second, because in some cases work is coming first and school second. The working out of an appropriate amendment in this area will be difficult.</P>
    <P>There is also the danger that where young people are in receipt of a lot of money, they are exposed to many more temptations than would the ordinary school-going child.  They are able to afford more entertainment and will not be as interested in their school work.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael accept the extension of this order, but it should be enforced in the coming year.  It needs to be enforced very strongly.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed for their support of this motion as moved by me this morning.  I wish to make a few points on some of the matters raised.  Firstly, regarding enforcement, we have had some successful prosecutions.  Some more are pending, the papers being with the Chief State Solicitor and there are other cases of possible, or indeed probable, prosecutions pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Deputy Mitchell said that he accepted that the enforcement of this Act is more difficult than with some other acts, which is true.  There are difficulties regarding enforcement.  My commitment is no less than the commitment of those who ask for greater enforcement, but the Deputies will appreciate that this Act presents certain problems for the factory inspectors or any inspectors involved.</P>
    <P>Despite some of the points made by the Deputies, not once since this order was placed last year&mdash;or, indeed, even before that&mdash;has any Deputy of this House brought to my attention, or to the attention of the Department or the inspectorate, a suspected breach.  I did say then that if such alleged breaches were brought to my attention I would have them pursued.  I make that offer to Deputies today.  One has to question the sincerity of people who stand up here and make such statements and yet did not respond to my offer of a year ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss Barry Miss Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to Deputy Barry at all.  I was referring to people who refer to their visits to different places.  To Deputy Barry's credit, she was not here when I made that offer so she cannot be blamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss Barry Miss Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is the responsibility of all TDs to bring this to the attention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I say to Deputy Barry that if a Member of the Oireachtas suspects an alleged breach of any Act, particularly of an Act where young peo-ple are being exploited in any premises, it is the duty of that Member to bring such a suspected breach at least to the notice of the Minister responsible.  That would be his or her duty as an elected representative of the people and a Member of the Legislature of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, there have been prosecutions and there are some difficulties. Deputy Mitchell asked a question and it is our hope that we will have <Col N="838" /> the review of the Act during the next session of the Dáil when any of the comments made by the Deputies opposite will be taken into consideration, as of course consultations will have to be held. The review will not be confined just to this section and there are other aspects also.  For example, Deputy Ryan referred to the abstract of the Act. Another possible amendment there is that we will insist on the abstract of the Act being shown in all employments by all employers irrespective of whether young people are employed by them, because sometimes that can create difficulties for us.  However, these are areas upon which obviously consultation and discussions would be held.</P>
    <P>The question of newspapers was raised.  Under the Act close relatives are not covered and this may well be a question of a close relative.  Public houses, lounge bars and so on were mentioned and there are problems here.  On the other side of the coin, we hear that we have complaints from the publicans themselves saying that the problem arises for them because apprentices under 18 years of age cannot work in public houses after 10 p.m.  This will be looked at in the review.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make was raised by Deputy Desmond regarding how this amendment came into being.  The legal advice now is that if that amendment were implemented, in other words, if this subsection was allowed to lapse after the two-year period, it would worsen the situation and would weaken our control and the enforcement of the regulations in respect of the 14-15 year age group.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for supporting the motion.  We will be having the review of the Act and I hope the report on that will be before the House in the next session. Any points made here this morning will be taken into consideration when this review is being carried out.  I am aware of the parental attitude to which Deputy Desmond referred.  There are problems from a parental point of view which are not always justified but the co-operation perhaps is not forthcoming, as <Col N="839" /> it has to be in certain aspects particularly regarding the birth certificate.</P>
    <P>I did not mention publicity.  We had very useful brief details of the Act supplied to all the schools, to the credit of particularly of one school to whom two copies were sent and they wrote back asking for 200 copies.  We could renew the publicity to some extent.  We have also the abstract which is displayed by some employers but not by all, and we will have to examine this when the Act is being reviewed.  Regarding enforcement, it is my intention and the intention of the inspectors to carry out enforcement as far as is possible.  Some cases have been brought successfully already and some are in the process of being brought forward&mdash;again successfully, I hope&mdash; but it presents certain difficulties and problems.  Again I say to Deputies that I would expect that, if they know or realise or suspect there are breaches of this Act, any complaints about such brought to my notice will be investigated immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister of State a question which I cannot answer off the top of my head.  I would be glad to be reassured by him about it. Is the expression &ldquo;Department of State&rdquo; defined in any statute such as the Interpretation Act in such a way as to remove any ambiguity about what it means?  I guess that the answer is yes, but I would <Col N="840" /> like to be assured because the definition of this section does not contain a definition of &ldquo;Department of State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We come across the definition in another section later on that will get rid of any ambiguity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, later on is a list of Departments of State over which the control of the ombudsman applies and a list of bodies excluded from that, but there is no definition in the Bill of a Department of State as such.  I suspect that it exists somewhere else but it might be no harm if the Minister were to make that point clear or get it cleared.  I do not mean off the top of his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 (2) should satisfy the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure.  It is not a definition.  It is circular.  Section 1 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Save where the context otherwise requires, reference in this Act to any Department of State include references to the Minister of the Government having charge of that Department of State...</P>
      <P>All it tells us is that this entity, for the purposes of this Bill undefined, is to include the Minister having charge of it; but as far as this Bill is concerned it remains an undefined entity.  I am saying for the third time that it may well be that the expression has in another Act a statutory definition which will apply equally to this.  I mention it so that the Minister can look the point up in case there is any substance in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputies to accept the section and we can move on to section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if it is done that way and I am not finished on section 1.  If the Minister of State will look at section 1 (3) (a) at the bottom of page 2, he will find reference to a Department of State in which certain business and functions are comprised and to &ldquo;the <Col N="841" /> Minister of the Government having charge of that Department of State&rdquo;.  I am not sure about &ldquo;Department of State&rdquo; but I am as near sure as I can be that the expression &ldquo;Minister of the Government&rdquo; has no standing in our legal system.</P>
      <P>There is such a thing as a &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo; but the expression &ldquo;Minister of the Government&rdquo; is not a constitutional expression and I am not aware that it has any status which the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; by itself does not have. I think the expression &ldquo;Minister of the Government&rdquo; is unprecedented and I would ask the Minister to ask his advisers if I am wrong&mdash;as I well may be&mdash;because if there is no precedent for the expression &ldquo;Minister of the Government&rdquo; it should not be casually thrust into a Bill where it does not fulfil any special purpose.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the expression &ldquo;Minister of the Government&rdquo; occurs at all in the Constitution.  If it does, it occurs only once or twice.  Certainly, the designation of the 15 people who sit in the Government, everywhere in the Constitution where they specifically are referred to, is &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo; not &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.  If what is meant here by the Minister's Department is the member of the Government in charge of that Department this paragraph should read &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo;.  It is bad drafting practice and will sooner or later cause trouble casually to insert phrases which have no constitutional or statutory precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the end of the matter as regards this paragraph because, while I see in a general sense what is meant by identifying the Minister with his Department for the purpose of the ombudsman operation, the section seems to me to leave unclear the situation where, as is constantly the case nowadays, Departments are created and then extinguished, or their titles are changed in order to make them grander, as in the case of the Department of the Environment, or sections of a Department are switched from one Minister to another as happened <Col N="842" /> with the Energy section, which was until December under the control of Deputy O'Malley and since then has been under the control of Deputy Colley.  I am not trying to make empty difficulties but merely pointing out to the Minister of State that if he wants a good Bill to leave this House it might not be a bad thing if an additional paragraph were inserted here to say that where a Department is extinguished, as happened with the Department of Economic Planning and Development&mdash;although I think that has not yet been given statutory force&mdash;or, if it has been given statutory force, there is another mistake, because it is specifically mentioned in the Schedule.  I think it has not been given statutory force yet, and that the Schedule is right from that point of view.  We should have some provision making it clear where the responsibility will now lie.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach when announcing his intentions originally to the House did indicate that the planning function, between which and himself he was so anxious to put a distance, since it had collapsed all around him, would now be transferred back to the Department of Finance.  But it does not say in this Bill that a citizen's complaint, if such could be imagined, against the former Department of Economic Planning and Development now falls to be dealt with or becomes the responsibility for ombudsman purposes of the Minister for Finance.  Commonsense tells me that it should be so, but the Bill does not say so. Nor does the Bill make specific provision for a case where either a Department in its own right is constituted out of what was formerly only a section&mdash;as is the case now with Energy&mdash;or where the reverse happens and the Department which was one in its own right is incorporated in another.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases the matter may be of no significance but it might cause a certain amount of pushing and pulling where the act complained of occurred before the change and the complaint is raised afterwards.  It might very well be not just in a Coalition Government but even in a Government which <Col N="843" /> consists of the uneasy factions facing us here across the floor, some of them not even speaking to each other let alone agreeing with each other.  It might easily be that it did not suit Minister X any longer to be responsible for the act which at the time the complaint arose was a responsibility of Minister Y.  Again, commonsense tells me that the complaint should follow the function, that a complaint raised against an old section or old official should now be dealt with by the Minister now in charge of that official whether or not he was in charge of him, or whether or not the administrative arrangements were the same, six months earlier.</P>
    <P>If that is what is intended it should be spelled out here in so many words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy covered many points in his submission many of which had nothing to do with the Bill. Basically, in relation to the abolition of the Department of Economic Planning and Development, any action, as the Deputy probably knows, can only be taken under this Bill from the date the Bill is passed.  It cannot be taken in respect of anything that happened before the passing of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only giving it as an instance. There is no guarantee that a similar instance will not arise in future.  I am not sure what the status of the Department of Economic Planning and Development is.  There is no longer any Minister with that title.  I do not remember a Bill that disestablished the Department&mdash;there may have been one. Perhaps the Minister should be able to tell me whether there still exists a Department of Economic Planning and Development under that title.  If not, and if the Minister is right in saying that complaints fit for the ombudsman can only be brought in respect of things that happened after the passage of the Bill, what is this reference to the Department of Economic Planning and Development doing in the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  But, having said that, I shall try to answer some of the Deputy's queries.  Any Act or orders transferring functions from one Minister or Department to another will transfer all the Minister's functions, liabilities and so on.  As the Deputy said in his speech, commonsense should tell him that all these functions will be transferred.  It appears to me that any complaints about the old Department could be taken to the new Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree about the commonsense of it, but we are not talking about common sense today: we are trying to make a law which lawyers will make a living by arguing about.  They will argue about every comma in it, because that is what they are there for.  I do not expect the Minister to tell me offhand&mdash;I may have made a mistake myself and got the wrong end of the stick&mdash;but I am asking the Minister only to look at this particular point, that the <Col N="845" /> way paragraph (a) at the bottom of page 2 is drafted does not seem to cover in such a way as plainly to identify, for example, the Minister for Finance, in a situation in which a Department has been completely wound up and its functions integrated elsewhere, perhaps not necessarily integrated into one Department.</P>
      <P>Let us see what happened to the Department of Transport and Power which does not exist any longer.  These Departments are now flying around like snuff at a wake, or atoms in a molecule. It is impossible to keep track of them. All one can see is a continuous inflation of titles going on without much activity to justify it.  The Department of Transport and Power once existed.  The late President Childers occupied it as Minister, and subsequently in our term Deputy Peter Barry occupied that Department.  The Department was redistributed in 1977.  The Power element of it was assigned to the Department of Industry and Commerce, I suppose under the name of the Energy section and the Transport section of it went elsewhere, to the Department now called Transport and Communications&mdash;I cannot even be sure of that but I think that is what it is called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose one has a complaint against the old Department of Transport and Power and one is not able to identify easily whether any particular section in that Department is the one responsible, for example, in regard to promotions&mdash;I do not want the Minister to tell me that these are excluded from the Bill because they ought not to be excluded&mdash;or a complaint from a contractor dealing on the outside with that Department for the supply of newspapers, stapling machines or typewriters, where is he now to look for redress?  In whom, for ombudsman purposes, are the functions of that Department vested?  It may be that they are vested in another Minister for a different purpose, but in whom are they vested for ombudsman purposes?  We should not have to look through a series of other Acts to find the answer.  I mention <Col N="846" /> this point so that the Minister can look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise the Deputy I will look at it between now and Report Stage.  As he is aware, Acts or orders transferring functions from one Minister or Department to another will transfer all the Minister's functions and liabilities. If, for instance, a section of a Depart-ment was transferred to another Minister, the new Minister would be responsible for any liabilities or functions. I presume the ombudsman could make his complaint to the new Minister. The Department of Economic Planning and Development have been extinguished by order and reference to it will be deleted on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point about this, and I am sure lawyers being paid to do so would find answers to these points, probably contradictory answers, but I am pointing out that the wording of paragraph (a) does not seem to cover the contingencies I have been outlining and law, unfortunately, is a matter or words, as many a litigant has found to his cost, or to his advantage when he did not deserve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two or three points about this section.  Is it the intention ultimately to invite applications for this office?  In other words, will the public at large be invited to apply for appointment as ombudsman, or will it be the case that the first we will know about the ombudsman will be when his name is presented by the Government in the form of a motion for a Dáil or Seanad resolution?  That point arises in connection with subsection (2) which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of a person to be the Ombudsman shall be made by the President upon resolution passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann <Col N="847" /> recommending the appointment of the person.</P>
    <P>I would like to be assured that the public will be invited&mdash;naturally only a small section of the public will be either interested or competent&mdash;to apply because any Government might be glad to have a list of the people who would be interested in appointment, and this might include people whose names would never occur to the Government.  I am not in any way trying to imply that this will not be a proper appointment because I am certain every Government will do their best to produce an overall generally acceptable appointment.  I do not suspect the Government's possible intentions in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says and I am sorry I cannot give a definite answer because the <i>modus operandi</i> has not been decided.  Taking into account the recommendations of the all-party committee and the fact that the Government could not accept fully their findings because of the Constitution, I can assure the Deputy it is the Government's intention to reach agreement with the leaders of the Opposition before a resolution suggesting a name would be put before the House.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the feeling of the all-party committee and, as far as the Government are concerned, I want to assure him that we too would like it to be seen that the man to be appointed will be neutral and acceptable to all sides of the House within the constraints of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The all-party committee recommended that the appointment should have a two-thirds majority of the House and the Minister said that cannot be done for constitutional reasons.  There is no reason why we should not set up an all-party committee and a two-thirds majority of that committee could make a recommendation to the House and this could be accepted.  That would meet the wishes of the original all-party committee and it would be seen that the ombudsman was not a political appointment. <Col N="848" /> The ombudsman could submit his reports to the all-party committee who could make recommendations to the House.  A two-thirds majority of a select committee, or a committee of this House, would raise a constitutional problem, but the setting up of such a committee could lead to a very worthwhile operation.</P>

I am acutely aware of the need to make certain that this is not seen as a political appointment.  With that in mind, it will be the Government's intention to reach agreement with the leaders of the Opposition before any resolution is put on the floor of the House.  That is going a long way towards getting over the Deputy's objections. That is all I can agree to at this stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister says and I agree that while a political appointment would be worse than having no ombudsman because he would not enjoy general confidence, the Government are right if they propose to consult the Opposition before any ap-pointment is made.  I only wanted the Minister to consider that the list of possibilities in front of any Government might be defective.  If they only make inquiries in their own circle or from their own contacts they may be missing people who would be even more suitable in that short list who, had they been invited to apply publicly or had they been encouraged to feel that a letter from them would not be regarded as something out of the way, would have applied to be considered.</P>

Let me reassure the Deputy that the Government have an open mind on the procedures.  We are prepared to consult to ensure impartiality because I agree that an ombudsman who did not have <Col N="849" /> full backing would be worse than no ombudsman at all.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister propose to put that into the Bill?  I accept the Minister's assurance that there will be consultation.  But if we are appointing an ombudsman at another time, in view of the way the Bill is worded it could be done by a simple majority.  I would like to see something in the record to provide that this could be done in future only after consultation and agreement with the leaders of the Opposition.  I know that the Minister's word is accepted here but this would not necessarily apply to another Minister at another time.  I would like something to be inserted to meet that.</P>

      <P>One of the things in contention here is the procedures of the House.  We cannot fetter these by amending Standing Orders in this Bill.  I assure the Deputy that as far as this Government are concerned, taking into account what both Deputies have said, there will be very detailed consultation before any appointment is made.  I am sorry that I do not seem to be able to meet the Deputy's wishes by writing it into the Bill but, as far as I am concerned and as far as the Government are concerned, we shall be more than willing to have consultations to ensure that the person appointed will be, as far as possible, agreed by the vast majority.  There is no way that everybody will be in agreement but the Opposition will have a chance of consulting with the Government in relation to this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two more points I wish to raise on this section.  Subsection (3) (b) contemplates the removal of the ombudsman by resolution of both Houses, and the grounds on which he can be removed appear to be inspired, partly at least, by the provisions in the Constitution about the removal of the President himself, stated misbehaviour or incapacity; or bankruptcy.  It seems that in that provision in regard to the President himself, in article 12 of the <Col N="850" /> Constitution, there is a lacuna because it makes no provision for what is to happen where the President is inadvertently absent for a prolonged period.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that it should be possible, in the year 1980, to mention such a thing but I would ask the Minister to consider, for example in connection with the President but also in connection with the ombudsman, what happens if he is kidnapped. What happens if the ombudsman is kidnapped and disappears for a long period while work is piling up?  What happens in a much less dramatic situation, where he is suffering from an incapacity but it is not such as would make it fair to remove him from office?  I can see that an ombudsman who becomes very severely physically incapacitated, through a series of strokes or something like that would probably resign, if he were lucid enough to do that, and it would be no reflection on him if he had to be removed because he was physically or mentally incapable of forming the wish or expressing the wish to resign.  But let us suppose he had a serious operation which knocked him out for four or six months.  It would be agree that it would be hardly fair to remove him, particularly if he were a man who enjoyed a notable public confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am putting to the Minister of State is, and he might ask his Department to advise him, that he might consider including in this Bill provision for a temporary ombudsman who would, during the duration of this incapacity, exercise the same powers as the ombudsman. To make a short end to it in regard to the rules of appointment, my own suggestion is that the President, who has very few functions of his own, might be allowed to appoint a temporary ombudsman, after consultation with the Council of State or having taken the opinion of the Council of State, for a period on which there would have to be a ceiling of perhaps 12 months.  It would get over not just the outside possibility of the man being kidnapped but just absenting himself&mdash;not necessarily in a context which would make it misbehaviour&mdash;or being ill in a <Col N="851" /> setting in which it would be unfair to him and perhaps undesirable in the public interest that he should actually be removed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being willing to bear that in mind.  The last point I want to make is something which might be no harm to clear up in the Bill if the Minister of State thinks fit.  Subsection (5) (b) provides that:</P>
      <P>a person who is for the time being entitled&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein,</P>
      <P>(ii)  under the rules of procedure of the European Assembly to sit therein, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  under the standing orders of a local authority to sit as a member thereof,</P>
      <P>shall, while so entitled, be disqualified for holding the office of Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Strictly speaking that ought to mean that the Government could decide to appoint a Member of this House with agreement between the parties.  What would happen in that situation?  What would be the position if, for example the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or a Member of the other House were decided upon?</P>

      <P>No one would ever suspect it.  What is in my mind is that, while technically it is possible for the Government to say that they are thinking of offering some Deputy or Senator the post of ombudsman and that the Deputy or Senator should decide for himself whether he wished to resign his seat in the House in which he was entitled to sit and in which case the disqualification would have disappeared, I am anxious that the Bill would make it clear that somebody who was a Member of this House is not disqualified from applying or from being considered for appointment. I appreciate that the Bill as it stands does not literally exclude the appointment of someone who now is a Member of this House or the other House but I can imagine perhaps not this Government but some future Government that may be advised by attorneys general of lesser quality than those presently or lately in office, not adverting to the strict sense of the words here and more or less making up their mind that the purpose of the Act, when it becomes an Act, is to exclude from appointment anyone who is a member of a local authority or a Member of this House or the other House or the European Parliament, and that cannot be the intention.  It ought to be made clear that while he may be disqualified from holding office as ombudsman he is not disqualified from being appointed, provided that on accepting appointment he is deemed to have vacated his seat in either House or in the European Assembly, if it is competent for this House to legislate for the European Assembly, or his seat on a local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that is clear.  The Minister and I have thrashed out this point and we are not in any doubt about <Col N="853" /> it.  However, some future Government may be advised to take the view that the Act was intended to exclude from appointment people who are at the time in positions which normally have a political complexion and it might be argued that the very purpose of the section was to keep politicians out of the ombudsman's job.  That may be very desirable as far as 99 politicians out of 100 are concerned but there is probably the odd angel stashed away on the benches of this House or the other House.</P>

I am trying to direct the attention of the Minister of State to the possibility that a future Government may be advised to take the view that the purpose of this provision is to keep politicians of whatever colour, and in whatever assembly they sit, from the position of ombudsman.  If it is our intention that this should not be the case, and that politicians in either House, in a local authority or in the European Assembly, should be eligible provided their seat is vacated, this ought to be made clear.  The Minister might examine this point between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on the Fine Gael Ombudsman Bill I contrasted its provisions with the Government Bill which had just been hastily published, probably as a result of the bringing in of a Private Members' Bill at that time by Deputy Fergus O'Brien and others.  I pointed out the extreme debility and feebleness of the Fianna Fáil ombudsman compared with the one we were proposing.  I pointed out all the exclusions from the range of his scrutiny which the Fianna Fáil Bill envisages and in a moment of levity I described him as an &ldquo;ombudsmouse&rdquo; because the extent of his power will be so limited.  To borrow a phrase from an English judge, he will be a mouse squeaking under the Minister's chair, and very little more, because of the range of exclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw attention to the ludicrous nature of some of the bodies which are included.  I am not saying that some of these bodies could not be the authors of actions which would be causes of complaint from members of the public.  I look down at what is supposed to be an impressive list of organs of the State, the misbehaviour of which is to be subjected to the scrutiny of the ombudsman, and I find that they include such potential ogres as the State Paper Office, the Public Records Office, the National Library and the National Museum.  I am all in favour of the ombudsman having a chance to look into these dusty corners if he has to; but I contrast that solemn recital of all these bodies who in 50 years have never given cause for complaint by an individual&mdash;as distinct from complaints about the general quality of their service, which is affected by the way they have been largely starved of Government funds&mdash;with the immense list of very significant exclusions in the Second Schedule.  The organs which are included in the range of scrutiny are mentioned in section 4 (2) and include such potential <Col N="855" /> engines of tyranny as the State Paper Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>When we reach the Schedule we will discuss them fully.  The section deals with the functions of the ombudsman rather than the exclusions and inclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria on which the ombudsman is supposed to act are out-lined in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) and many of the grounds here recited would equally be grounds on which an aggrieved citizen would be entitled to have an administrative action quashed by the High Court or invalidated by one of the inferior courts.  My reason for saying this is not idle, but that the impression may be created in the public mind through these criteria that the citizen has at present no redress in regard to actions taken without proper authority or taken on irrelevant grounds.</P>
      <P>The law is that power can be exercised only for the purpose and by the means and modes which are laid down by the statute which confers the power, and any authority which steps outside those four corners or purports to do something which the Act does not authorise, or who does something on grounds which the Act does not contemplate or without taking account of grounds which the Act requires him to contemplate, or who in any way behaves unfairly or in a biased way with some ulterior motive in performing a function which the law has given him, is breaking the law.  I do not mean that he is breaking the criminal law but he is breaking the law in not respecting its intention and his act may be a nullity; certainly it is capable of being annulled by the action of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case anyone has the idea that something revolutionary is being done here today in conferring on the citizen rights which he has not previously had, I want to assert that an act done without proper authority is capable of being invalidated by the courts, as is an act done or taken on irrelevant grounds.  Supposing the Minister of State in his Department has some function and the Act sets <Col N="856" /> out the criteria on which that function is to be exercised but he exercises the function on some different criteria of his own&mdash;if he thinks Country Mayo has had enough and he believes something should be given to County Sligo, or the other way round&mdash;which is not cited in the law then he is outside the law.  His act can and will be quashed by a court, even if this Bill never sees the light of day.  The same goes for an administrative act which is defective and in which the administrative authority were careless or negligent in making up their minds, although the law about that is not quite so clear and there is not that much authority on it.  The same goes for actions based on erroneous or incomplete information.  That is not altogether clear but certainly an administrative decision made under a complete misconception of the facts will be set aside.  Most certainly an act which is improperly discriminatory or which is contrary to fair administration in the sense of not giving the person affected a fair chance to make his case and to show how the law does not apply or should not be applied to him capable of being invalidated by the courts.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the fact that the ombudsman is not a court and that one will not have to pay fees to go to him.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee that he will be any speedier than present court procedure but it is worth saying that while an ombudsman would be no good unless he is able to pin and nail maladministration on these grounds it is not the first time that these grounds have been heard of in our legal system.  As far as I can see there is only one ground out of the seven cited here which would not clearly be a ground for having administrative activity invalidated by the courts, that is the one about the &ldquo;undesirable administrative practice&rdquo;.  I say that is not clear because I do not know what it means.  What is an &ldquo;undesirable administrative practice?&rdquo;  It could be undesirable for reasons which are purely internal and personal to the Department itself, or to civil service conventions which benefit nobody but the people who take part in them.  I do not <Col N="857" /> know what criteria are meant and I should be glad if the Minister would give a few examples of what he understands by &ldquo;undesirable administrative practice&rdquo; over and above the criteria specified elsewhere in the subsection.</P>
    <P>All this suggests to me that we ought to think forward.  I do not mean to delay the Bill, little though its effective value is going to be as we will show later, but we ought to have an eye to integrating the operation of the ombudsman with the operation of the courts with a view to trying to save the citizen expense and to try to expedite his remedies.  To have two systems operating on very similar criteria side by side without any clear link between the two, and without showing the relationship of one to the other, is not necessarily a good practice.  Subsection (4) declares that the ombudsman shall not investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a person specified in the Second Schedule.  Provided I am allowed to make hay of the Second Schedule when we arrive at it I will pass from that subsection without saying anything more about it.</P>

      <P>Line 27 refers to an action taken in performance of administrative functions and I should like to know if that will tend to narrow down what the ombudsman may do.  How does one define &ldquo;administrative functions&rdquo;? Given our narrow Constitution will that provision not tend to narrow the ambit of the ombudsman?  We are hoping to have an ombudsman with the broadest brief possible.  We should not be tying him down to a narrow area.  In my view that line could restrict an ombudsman.  It is possible that it can be said that a certain matter cannot be dealt with on the basis that it was purely an administrative function.  What is the reason for the insertion of that provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That provision is not a <Col N="858" /> device to narrow the scope of the ombudsman. It is intended to mean the performance of a civil servant's official work.  It is possible, as Deputy Kelly stated, that there are grounds for a court action to be taken in a number of the instances he referred to but I am sure it has been his experience that those who will avail of the services of the ombudsman would not dream of going to court.  I do not think the ombudsman will require as much time as the courts.  If that happens it will be defeating the object of the legislation.  It will not be as expensive for people to go to the ombudsman as it would be for them to start a court action about something they were entitled to.  Court actions require time and money.  The idea of the ombudsman is to give a citizen quick and inexpensive redress for any wrongs done to him by the State.</P>
      <P>In relation to court actions, the standards of proof required for success can at times be so strict that quite justifiable complaints might not get redress.  Undesirable administrative practices were referred to by Deputy Kelly.  I am sure he was referring to the practice of too short a period of time for application. From my experience there are other things which could be dealt with such as the carelessness of an inspecting officer in the Department of the Environment.  I have often come across cases where the facts submitted to a Minister are not in accordance with the situation on the ground.  While that may not be a cause for a court action it causes inconvenience and is a cause of grievance to citizens.  They are examples of what is meant by undesirable administrative practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is not a panacea for all ills but it is a start.  We all want to see these provisions in operation and we will learn from that.  Deputy Kelly feels that the ombudsman will have very little power but for the vast majority of citizens he represents a quick and inexpensive way of having grievances dealt with.  I make that statement taking into consideration the bodies that have been omitted from the legislation.  Many of <Col N="859" /> those with grievances can have them redressed if they bring them before an ombudsman.  I do not agree with Deputy Kelly that this is an ombudsmouse. He should give it a chance.</P>

The Minister's reply was very fair and modest when he said we would have to see how it works and learn from it.  I accept that.  I do not think the exam-ple he gave of undesirable administrative practice is very enlightening.  I will put down an amendment on Report Stage to try and make it more concrete.  The instance he gave of an engineer or someone on the ground making a mistake and being careless in measurement or something of that kind presumably is already comprised in (iii) as a result of negligence or carelessness or (iv) based on erroneous or incomplete information. I am trying to see what is meant by &ldquo;undesirable administrative practice&rdquo; which is not comprised in the other headings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 is the exclusions section, and they are so drastic that one can see the ombudsman shrinking away under one's eyes like the figure of Alice in Wonderland shrinking to the size where it could be got into a bottle.  The ombudsman is shrinking under our eyes as we read through section 5.  What is left for him to do is very trivial compared with the kind of things most people feel aggrieved about.  I will come to that when we are dealing with the Schedule.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is a Deputy like myself and I presume he looks after his constituency and knows well the kind of things people get aggrieved about.  He will know, when he compares the grievances with which people come to him with what this section and the Schedule purport to exclude, that in the vast majority of cases he will not be able to tell the aggrieved person to go to the ombudsman because the matter will be totally outside his purview.  Before coming to the institutional exclusions of various Departments and functions I should like to ask the Minister a few questions arising from paragraph (a), subsection (1).  I may not be reading the subsection properly but it seems to be leaving a curious possibility open.  It states:</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman shall not investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) if the action is one in relation to which&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) the person affected by the action has initiated in any court civil legal proceedings and the proceedings have not been dismissed for failure to disclose a <Col N="861" /> cause of action or a complaint justiciable by that court whether the proceedings have been otherwise concluded or have not been concluded,</P>
    <P>Unless I am completely misreading it, that appears to exclude only a situation where a person has initiated civil legal proceedings and left them hanging.  It does not exclude the situation&mdash;perhaps rightly so&mdash;that somebody has begun civil legal proceedings and concluded them unsuccessfully.  I am not complaining about it, but I should like to be clear as to what we are doing.  It seems it is possible for someone to bring civil legal proceedings and to lose and still be able to go to the ombudsman and say: &ldquo;The court threw me out but will you take a look at the case?&rdquo; I emphasise I am not complaining about it.  It would be a good provision if that is what is meant, but we ought to be clear about what exactly we mean.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the expression &ldquo;civil legal proceedings&rdquo;&mdash;this is a technical point which the Minister's legal advisers might look at&mdash;is apt to cover what are called State side orders or applications for them such as <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> which are the forms in which ad-ministrative decisions are most commonly attacked.  I notice two lines down there is a reference to a &ldquo;complaint justiciable by the court&rdquo; which appears to be something distinct from a cause of action.  It may be that <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> are envisaged under the heading &ldquo;complaint justiciable by the court&rdquo;.  I am not sure if those two remedies are, properly speaking, part of the category called &ldquo;civil legal proceedings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In connection with subparagraph (ii) of the same paragraph in which:</P>
    <P>the person affected by the action has a right, conferred by or under statute, of appeal, reference or review to or before a court in the State (not being an appeal, reference or review in relation to a decision of a court),</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;under statute&rdquo; is vague. <Col N="862" /> Does it include for example the right to <i>habeas corpus</i>?  That expression is only a colloquial one and does not occur in the Constitution or in subsequent legislation. It can be called that for convenience. That right is conferred by a very special kind of statute, namely section 4 of article 40 of the Constitution.  Is it intended that the right conferred by statute in that context, namely the right to <i>habeas corpus</i> or make an application for it, is to be a right of a kind which will exclude the act complained of from the ombudsman's scrutiny?  I hope I am making that clear.</P>
    <P>Take a case&mdash;I do not mean a political or criminal one although these would be included in theory&mdash;which is not confused by political or criminal dimensions, such as a person arrested by the Garda under the Act dealing with mental treatment which empowers the police to arrest someone for his own protection and that of others if they find him raving around the place, to put it in a nutshell, although the Act does not use that word.  A policeman is entitled in law to take in charge someone who is raving and there is a procedure laid down by the Act where various certificates are issued and the person is committed to an institution.  That is an administrative disposition. No court has been behind it, and it is an action which I imagine will fall under the heading of the definition section.  The immediate remedy for a person who feels aggrieved, namely the person who appears mentally deranged or someone on his behalf, would be entitled to apply for <i>habeas corpus</i>, but the right to that is one conferred by statute&mdash;as I say, admittedly a special kind of statute but nonetheless statute law.  The Constitution is a statute.  Is it intended&mdash;or perhaps it has not occurred to anybody&mdash;that a person who has a right conferred by statute, such as the right to apply for <i>habeas corpus</i> here, is not entitled to go to the ombudsman and ask him to have a look at the process by which the person was taken in charge and committed to an institution? Perhaps the Minister of State would prefer me to go through my remaining <Col N="863" /> points on this section, or perhaps I should stop there and come back.  I will do whatever he wishes.</P>

      <P>I do not quarrel with the exclusion in subsection (1) (b).  The exclusion in regard to actions affecting national security or military activity, or arrangements regarding participation in organisations of states or governments is a reasonable one and I make no complaint about it.</P>
      <P>The exclusions in subsection (1) (c) and (d) are not reasonable and, when the public realise them, will shrink the ombudsman, to begin with, to about half of the stature he should have, and he has got a long way to go before he gets into that little bottle I will put him in before I am finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exclusion at subsection (1) (c) is the exclusion of an action relating to recruitment or appointment to any office or employment in a Department of State or by any other person specified in the First Schedule to the Act.  If I may remind the House, that First Schedule, apart from the Public Record Office, the State Paper Office, the National Museum and the National Library, contains also bodies of appeals officers under the Social Welfare Acts, the Land Commission, the National Savings Committee, the Commissioners of Public Works, the State Laboratory, the Ordnance, Survey, the Commissioner of Valuation and Chief Boundary Surveyor and so on.  I believe that recruitment to the public service here is fair and above board and I shall not qualify that.  Of course, one hears complaints.  People say: &ldquo;Of course, you know he is a cousin of So-and-So and he is a nephew of So-and-So.&rdquo; One cannot persuade people. So deep is the slave mentality anchored in us that we cannot believe that this State is capable of conducting anything on any basis other than that of the old pals act.  I believe that the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission, established in this <Col N="864" /> State by William Cosgrave's Government in order to put an end to jobbery at these levels and to the suspicions of jobbery, do an impartial and fair job.  But, at the same time, there are constantly people who are aggrieved by the failure of the Civil Service Commission, or of the Local Appointments Commission, to recommend them for appointment.  This process is a source of grievance to a lot of people.  It is a source of grievance to the man who has not been made county engineer, county surveyor or whatever it may be, or who has failed a junior executive or administrative officer examination or something of that kind.  It is a source of grievance to him, or it may be.  I cannot see what there is so sacred about the appointment or recruitment process which should justify its removal from the purview of the ombudsman.  If we are going to appoint an ombudsman who, as the Minister has agreed, will be a person so highly respected that all parties in this House will be able to agree about him, I cannot see that he should not be trusted with the details in the Civil Service Commissioners' files, or the Local Appointments Commissioners' files in regard to the appointment process.  Why cannot he be allowed to conduct an investigation there?  I do agree that he might perhaps not be expected to disclose to the disappointed party the details of the process and it would be intolerable if the appointing commissioners were to disclose to anybody and everybody the opinion which they had formed confidentially of the person; it might not be fair even to himself.  I do not suggest that.  But at least the ombudsman should be empowered to look at the appointments process and at least satisfy himself that it has been fairly conducted and to transmit that opinion then to the aggrieved party.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that there are dimensions to this which are very sensitive.  But let us pull them out from under the table and look at them.  Last year I had to write a study which was intended for publication in a collection which the German Federal Constitutional Court were organising in regard to appointment <Col N="865" /> to the public service and recruitment to and promotion in the public service. I shall detain the House for a moment to explain this.  The reason that the German Constitutional Court has had to take an interest in this is because in Germany people of all kinds in the public service including&mdash;and this is the most sensitive part&mdash;school teachers are considered to be <i>Beamte</i>; they are considered to be State officials and have very well defined rights.  One of these very well defined rights is that to absolute transparency in the process of their recruitment and promotion.  Many of these <i>Beamte</i>, particularly at the school teacher level&mdash;depending on one's political viewpoint or as somebody as far Right as most people in this House are on the European spectrum would say&mdash;became infected with the extreme Left Wing ideas of the Bader Meinhof Group.  People like that were in the public service at school teacher level and were sometimes propagating these ideas, or sometimes were in very sensitive jobs and so on.  That accounted for the interest of the Germans in this because obviously a constitutional question is involved.</P>
    <P>Whether it is fair to dismiss a public servant, to refuse him promotion or appointment merely because he holds very far-out political views is a serious question in any democracy.  The very same question exists in an Irish guise even though it has never surfaced in such a painful way.  Of course it is the case here that applicants&mdash;and this is why I say let us pull the thing out from under the table and look at it&mdash;for appointment in the public service, or in the Garda, are made the subject of a quiet couple of inquiries to see if they are all right.  I do not mean to see if they are Fine Gael or Labour Party supporters.  I do not even mean to ascertain if they are extreme Socialist in their views; I mean have they got connections which are subversive, which might be dangerous from that point of view.  I am well aware that a process like this can verge into the objectionable&mdash;I am well aware of that&mdash;and all any government can do is behave with good <Col N="866" /> faith, and try to steer a course which is not objectionable and not spill over into the other.</P>
    <P>I quite understand that something like this may have inspired that exclusion. But what I want to know is why should the ombudsman not be permitted to know that which the Civil Service Commissioners are allowed to know?  Why should he not be entrusted with a file which presumably in Grand Canal Street is available to a certain limited number of people.  I am speaking now about staff, people of naturally absolutely un-suspect probity and so on, but who do not have to be recruited by resolution of this House and of the Seanad.  Therefore, I cannot see what is the point in excluding this very important matter on which grievances so easily arise from the ombudsman's purview.  Again I do not say, and I would not be so absurd as to suggest that he should be able to say to somebody: &ldquo;Look, the Garda made a few inquiries about you.  We understand that you had a suspicious connection with this or that organisation and we simply cannot take a chance on you.  We are frightfully sorry.&rdquo;  I do not say that he should go that far.  All I say is that the ombudsman should be let see the file and satisfy himself, in his own conscience, that no injustice&mdash;all he can do is exercise his own discretion, as indeed the Bill says&mdash;has been done to the aggrieved party.  Subject to that I do not think he should be asked to disclose all the file to anybody.  But he should be allowed satisfy himself at least that no injustice has been done.  To exclude recruitment or appointment to the public service and the conditions on which people hold office and so on is cutting a colossal chunk out of the potential area of citizens' grievances&mdash;a huge segment is removed from the circle.</P>
    <P>That instantly makes the ombudsman irrelevant to an awful lot of citizens, because they may never have a grievance in their lives except in regard to the failure of the State to appoint them to a particular job, or to promote them at a time when they thought they were entitled to promotion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> There are other exclusions here I need not go into.  There is a blanket exclusion which goes over and above and beyond all the exclusions mentioned in the schedule and the others mentioned individually in the section.</P>
    <P>I will read section 5 (3):</P>
    <P>Where a Minister of the Government so requests&mdash;</P>
    <P>I doubt if that expression has a precedent; I may be wrong&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in writing (and attaches to the request a statement in writing of the reasons for the request), the Ombudsman shall not investigate, or shall cease to investigate an action specified in the request, being an action of&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;a Department of State whose functions are assigned to that Minister, or a person mentioned in the First Schedule whose business and functions are comprised in such a Department.  I am abbreviating the subsection a bit.  In other words, when all the smoke has cleared away, and all the flummery has faded into the distance, and the beating of the drums has died to a whisper, we find that Ministers, far from subjecting themselves to the fearless scrutiny of this administrative Lancelot who rides through all the red tape, and lifts up the oppressed, and sees that justice is done to them, are entitled to require the ombudsman to discontinue an investigation.</P>
    <P>I am not such a baby as not to understand that there may be investigations which will trench into an area of national security, or genuinely on an area of Government policy, or national policy, so sensitive that perhaps even an ombudsman, who, do not forget, is being given the same status as a High Court judge and is being made just as irremovable, in fact more irremovable, ought to be shut out from.  If so, the criteria on which Ministers are entitled to require the discontinuance of an investigation, or to require that it should not take place in the first instance, should be set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As the Bill now stands, for any reasons provided that he states them, a <Col N="868" /> Minister can shut out or preclude the ombudsman from acting.  There is no requirement that the reasons should be adequate, or that they should not be incompatible with the spirit of the Bill, or that they pertain to national security. There is nothing like that at all.  There is not even a requirement that he should state his reasons with much particularity. Provided he states his reasons, that is the end of the ombudsman's activities. That is the point at which the ombudsman fits down into the bottle.  He is a mouse in a bottle under the Minister's chair at that point.  The Minister can take up the bottle, cork it, and put the ombudsman out on the window sill and leave him there for the winter. So far as this Bill is concerned, he is not in the picture at all.</P>
    <P>I do not need to be told that a Minister who has any self-respect will not lightly use the powers conferred by this subsection. I know that.  I am willing to make that assumption in favour, needless to say, of all my own colleagues, and a fair few of the Minister's colleagues.  It is inadequate in a Bill like this which will be presented to the public as a measure, on the principle of which at least, Members of the House have been agreed.  It is regrettable that there should be this gaping hole torn in the Bill because of this exclusion.  I would not object to it so much if the exclusion were qualified by the criteria on which the request was to be made.  I would not object so much if the reasons were to be stated with full particularity.  I would not object so much if it were made clear that the reasons had to relate to national security, if that is what is in the Government's mind.</P>
    <P>Merely to be able to stop the ombudsman in his tracks with a half piece of paper on which the Minister can say, for anything the Bill says to the contrary, that he wishes the matter not to be investigated for the reason that it would be against the policy of his Department, is not good enough.  That would seem to me to be a bad reason and I am sure it seems to the Minister of State to be a bad reason.  In so far as the Bill says nothing to the contrary, that is a good <Col N="869" /> enough reason to stop the investigation. The fact that the exclusion is so drastic and blanket-like makes the section hopelessly unacceptable to our side of the House and I would hope&mdash;assuming that the section will be passed&mdash;to introduce amendments on Report Stage to improve it.</P>

      <P>I will take Deputy Kelly's last point first.  An all-party committee sat for a considerable length of time and made recommendations on this Bill.  One of the things they recommended was that certain decisions by Ministers, where they are required or allowed to make value judgements, should be excluded from the ombudsman's area.  They did not specify in detail what these decisions were, but the general intention was to provide means whereby the discretionary decisions of a Minister, for which he is answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, should be exempted.</P>
      <P>I am advised that it proved technically difficult to draft a provision which gave precise effect to the committee's recommendations. In law, the official actions of a civil servant are the actions of a Minister.  Therefore, if discretionary decisions of a Minister were excluded, then the discretionary decisions of civil servants would also be excluded.  Furthermore, much of the power of each Minister is, in legal terms, discretionary. There was simply no way, for drafting purposes, of distinguishing between the personal discretionary decisions of a Minister and the decisions of a civil servant.</P>
      <P>The only feasible technical way of giving effect to the recommendations of the all-party committee proved to be the provision that, where a Minister or a Minister of State signs a request to the ombudsman not to investigate a specific action for a stated reason, the ombudsman shall cease to investigate. Could I make reference to Deputy Kelly's ombudsman in the bottle?  We are reminded of the old story of the genie who came out of the bottle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no cork in this bottle because the ombudsman will be the one who will remove the cork.  While I have full confidence in all Deputies on this side and I have doubts about some on Deputy Kelly's side, any Minister who would make a habit of this would leave himself open to being reported to the Dáil by the ombudsman when he made his annual report, or he might make a special report to the Dáil.  This would give far more publicity to such an action than the original action itself.</P>
      <P>The ombudsman will be independent. He will be, in no sense, a puppet of the Minister.  It is not envisaged that this provision will be widely used.  I repeat, should the Ombudsman feel that this provision was being abused, he would be free to make reference to it in his report or, as I said before, to make a special report.  It would not be in any Minister's interest to abuse the power of veto, given the degree of adverse publicity that would result.  As I have said, the adverse publicity would probably be as great as if not greater than if the Minister was found guilty after a full investigation of the case by the ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly gave an example&mdash;I hope I have not misunderstood him&mdash;and talked about Garda arrests. Arrest would be a Garda action and, as such, would be excluded.  He was probably not talking about the actual arrest, but the action of the person committed to an institution.</P>

      <P>A person such as that would have the right to contact the ombudsman to make representations and I should like to think that the ombudsman would go ahead and investigate such complaints.  I say that from experience of cases I have come across.  Under section 5(1), people who have had recourse to <Col N="871" /> the courts can go to the ombudsman. However, I do not think people who have had judgements handed down by courts should be able to go to the ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get this sorted out.  I suggest that the Minister should take advice about this between now and Report Stage.  I can see some advantages of going to the ombudsman even if a person has been thrown out by the courts. We should distinguish between two things.  Most of the cases on which the ombudsman could make reports concern grounds which would support an application in the courts to invalidate a Minister's decision.  I do not know what is an undesirable administrative practice or what a court would regard as information so incomplete as to vitiate an administrative decision, but there may be grounds among the ones listed here which would determine the ombudsman's jurisdiction, grounds to which a court would not have regard, which would not weigh with the courts&mdash;for example, this thing &ldquo;undesirable administrative practice&rdquo;&mdash;over and above a feature which a court would regard as relevant for the purpose of quashing the end result of the process.  If so, clearly the fact that somebody has taken action and been thrown out by a court when the case he made to the court was that the considerations taken into account by the authority were wrong ones should not stop him from going to the ombudsman to make a somewhat different case there: that the court did not take the wrong considerations into account but that the court had worked in a way which would ensure that the person would get the wrong end of the stick. I am speaking generally.  I could see an advantage in not allowing the decision of a court to close the door to the ombudsman. On balance I suggest it would be best to leave this provision open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a point about delays.  I am sure that in the case of the ombudsman this would depend entirely on the volume of business.  I would remind the Minister that the European Human Rights Commission and the <Col N="872" /> European Court hear only a small number of cases and there are usually colossal delays before the cases come out at the far end.  They could be numbered in dozens in the past 30 years but the number of applications made which have to be screened&mdash;that is what takes up the time&mdash;would be tens of thousands. When the ombudsman gets round to cases he will be able to deal with them quickly enough, but there will be a fair number of cases which he cannot investigate because the Act will exclude them.  I am sure there will be many citizens throughout the country who will be amazed to find that we will have an ombudsman who cannot tell them why they have been refused jobs or health cards or why they have not been allocated houses.  They are the things people will be aggrieved about, and in order to sort that out, in order to conduct a screening process, staff will be required and time will be required.  There may be borderline cases and it all adds up to loss of time.  Therefore, I would not be all that confident that the time lost before the ombudsman would be less than that lost before the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

      <P>The Deputy spoke about exemptions and spoke of the Civil Service Commission.  I agree with him.  It should be said here, of all places, that the Civil Service Commission are fair and above board without exception. However, the recommendation of the all-party committee, which sat for a considerable length of time, is that the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission should not fall within the ambit of the ombudsman.  The Bill has been drafted accordingly.  That committee pointed out specifically that the ombudsman would have an interminable task if every disappointed candidate were to ask to see reassessment of results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some confusion because both commissions are listed or included among the bodies subject to investigation. The reason for this quite simply is that administrative decisions&mdash;for example, the placing of advertisements&mdash;should be subject to <Col N="873" /> scrutiny.  For example, if an advertisement was published in a newspaper and there was not sufficient time left for people to apply, or if they could apply only in Dublin because the post would not allow others to be in time, the applicant could go to the ombudsman and say: &ldquo;I have a cause of complaint against the Civil Service Commission on the basis that the date of the advertisement did not give me enough time in which to put in my application, but not in relation to the application itself or to the fact that I was not appointed&rdquo;.  Deputy Kelly also said that the ombudsman should have access to certain files.  I feel strongly that the Minister should have access to files which he does not seem to have access to.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to belittle the distance the Minister has come in this respect.  I am surprised at his concession a second ago that even in regard to such a humble preliminary matter as the date on which an advertisement is inserted could be a matter for scrutiny by the ombudsman in regard to applying for a civil service job.  Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Ombudsman shall not investigate any action by or on behalf of a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) relating to recruitment or appointment to any office or employment in a Department of State or by any other person specified in the <i>First Schedule</i> to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite arguably that would exclude even such a humble preliminary act as examining the adequacy of notice which the advertisement in the newspaper represented.  If it was in <i>The Irish Times</i> in such a way that people had two days' <Col N="874" /> notice but was in the <i>Connacht Telegraph</i> on the Thursday after the closing date, I agree that would be an unfair way of doing business.</P>

      <P>This section has disappointed everyone in the number of exclusions that have been inserted.  People relate the Government, local authorities and health boards on the one level in that all of the bodies mentioned are administrators. People will not understand why they may not go to the ombudsman with a complaint.  We are starting off on the wrong foot.  The Minister said that he can rectify this by order at a later stage, but that is not good enough.  By having such exclusions in the Bill we are acting as if there was a fear to investigate certain areas.  I should like to quote a paragraph from a statement by C.J. Milvain regarding the Ombudsman Act in the <i>Western Weekly Reports</i>, 1972:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...can bring the lamp of scrutiny to otherwise dark places, even over the resistance of those who would draw the blinds.  If his scrutiny and observations are well founded, corrective measures can be taken in due democratic process; if not, no harm can be done in looking at that which is good&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not have any fears about the matter and we should not allow any exclusions. It is wrong to insert a provision stating that the Minister will write to the ombudsman saying that he cannot investigate certain areas.  The words &ldquo;shall not investigate&rdquo; are used in the Bill and that is wrong.  If the Bill stated that the ombudsman &ldquo;may not investigate&rdquo;, at least that would be some help.  The provisions in the Bill mean that we are giving less power to the ombudsman and this should not be allowed to happen.  It is all right for a Minister to say he has confidence in his colleagues but in certain circumstances Ministers may deem it prudent to tell the ombudsman that he shall not investigate a complaint.  That is dangerous and it defeats the whole purpose of the Bill.  The local authorities, semi-State bodies and health boards are being excluded and we are also proposing <Col N="875" /> to insert in the Bill the provision that the Minister will write to the ombudsman telling him he cannot investigate a complaint. That is making a joke of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee wanted to keep the whole area as broad as possible. If Ministers want to exercise their prerogative, one can fairly ask why are we appointing an ombudsman.  Is it to give respectability to this area, to tell people that they may refer their complaints to the ombudsman and, if they are lucky, that he will accept them?  That was not the spirit in which we approached this Bill.  All of us wanted a good Bill.  We wanted the ombudsman given as much power and independence as was possible to investigate all complaints.</P>
    <P>The paragraph I quoted from the statement by Mr. Milvain spells out clearly what people have in mind.  In my view section 5 has ruined this Bill.  It is totally against the spirit in which people approached this area.  This is not a political ploy and we are not trying to be obstructive.  We wanted a Bill that would give autonomy and independence to the ombudsman but we regard section 5 as totally restrictive and unacceptable to this side of the House.</P>
    <P>When we come to the Schedules we will go through them line by line.  If the Minister inserted the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in section 5 that would give some discretion to the ombudsman.  As matters stand, there is no leeway or outlet given to him and I oppose that very strongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a point raised by Deputy O'Brien and myself with regard to the power of the Minister to exclude the investigation of a particular matter, the Minister said that one control would be the fact that this exclusion would become public knowledge.  The Minister as I understand it, said that the ombudsman would publish a report on the Minister who used his powers in this way and that the Minister would then be subject to public criticism.  That is not written anywhere into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> Section 6 subsection (7) speaks about the duty of the ombudsman to lay a report on his performance before each House of the Oireachtas annually and may</P>
    <P>from time to time cause to be laid before each such House such other reports with respect to those functions as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>That is fine but in view of this very drastic exclusion it would be as well if the Government insisted on this.  At the very least the ombudsman should have a mandatory duty to include in his annual report a statement which would represent verbatim, the directions he had received from the Minister or Ministers under section 5 of this Bill in relation to any requirement to hold or not to hold an investigation.  However, it would be more satisfactory for the public if the ombudsman were required to make known immediately at least to the party affected the fact that he had been required either not to investigate something or to discontinue to investigate something by the Minister and to recite verbatim to the complaining party the reasons why the Minister had made such a request.  The ombudsman should be required to include in his annual statement a list of the occasions with a quotation of the grounds on which this exclusion was invoked, and for ordinary purposes and for political use the ombudsman should be required to tell the complainant at once why an investigation has been discontinued or why it cannot be implemented.  This Bill will not work with this exclusion in it. This at least would give the complaining party a chance to go to his public representative and publicise how he has been treated by any particular Minister. That would give public representatives here and elsewhere the press a chance to ask the Minister why he has refused to allow something to be investigated.  That is the least that should be done.  I hope to put an amendment to that effect later on.</P>
    <P>An alternative that would be reasonably satisfactory would be to amend subsection (4) of the next section so as to require the ombudsman where <Col N="877" /> he is not able to investigate to tell the complaining party immediately the reason why he is being stopped.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly suggested that the ombudsman's report should quote verbatim the terms of a Minister's request not to investigate.  This is acceptable to me and I presumed that the ombudsman would do that anyway.  I will look at it between now and Report Stage to see if we can facilitate the Deputy.  One could say that it could be left to the discretion of the ombudsman but if the Deputy insists I will see how we can accommodate him.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that and while he is doing so will the Minister also look at the point I made in regard to the value of requiring the ombudsman to let the aggrieved or complaining party know at once because otherwise the immediacy is gone.  The Minister may not be here next year and he might find himself very anxious to discover why a Minister had refused to allow something to be investigated.  A Deputy will not have a chance of doing this at the right time if he has to wait for the annual report of the ombudsman to surface.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Brien referred to the number of exclusions but I would point out that this is in accordance with the recommendations of the all-party committee.  The all-party committee recommended the exclusion of health boards and local authorities initially but they can all be taken in by order. If I am here in a year's time I will have a look at the operation of the ombudsman to see what improvements <Col N="878" /> should be made and to see after consultation, what bodies in Part II can be taken in.  There is no reason why a lot of them cannot be included once we get the things working.  To take all of these in at the start would inundate the ombudsman with work and he would not be able to deal expeditiously with the complaints, which is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There were no Fianna Fáil members at the last meeting of the all-party committee when the recommendations were finally drawn up.  We tried to meet the views of the all-party committee in this Bill and both sides of the House agree with the principle of the Bill.  I will certainly look at all the points raised by Deputy Kelly and Deputy O'Brien.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take up the point which the Minister introduced. Subsection (1) of this section does not bear on this exclusion power of the Minister.  My reason is a lawyer's one and I hope the Minister of State will not despise it for that reason.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>In any case where a complaint is made to the Ombudsman in relation to an action and the Ombudsman decides not to carry out an investigation under this Act into the action or to discontinue such an investigation....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could not be cleared by the use of the word &ldquo;deciding&rdquo; that what is happening here is that the ombudsman is exercising his judgement and his discretion on whether to investigate and his decision is not to investigate.  It is envisaged by section 5 (3) that that power should be mandatory and that there power should be no element of decision or discretion whatever left to the ombudsman.  If there were it would be a different day's work.  If the ombudsman were allowed to decide for himself, having had the Minister's request, whether he would acquiesce, it would be a different story.  The words of subsection (3) of section 5 are mandatory. I cannot read them otherwise.  It says that the ombudsman shall not investigate or shall cease to investigate. That seems to me to be a scenario which <Col N="881" /> is excluded by the ordinary use of language from the scope of subsection (1) of section 6.  The reference to &ldquo;decides not to&rdquo; clearly envisages that it is a decision taken in any other circumstance than the one where the Minister has forbidden him to go ahead. Here his discretion has free play.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for a good try, but I do not think he will find that any of his legal advisers will agree with him that section 6 (1) plainly carries the effect of subsection (3) of the previous section. Naturally one lawyer's opinion is as likely to be as wrong as another's.  I may be wrong about this, but it certainly seems to me not to accord with the ordinary use of language.  Lawyers may be a very contemptible crew but oddly enough they start out from language and its ordinary use.  It is litigants who try to get them to twist something else out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Kelly's point and I assure him that this subsection was intended to cover the case he has cited.  We will look at it and we will ensure that it will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a technical point here which the Minister might look at.  It has one dimension which is not technical but is of some substance.  If I am right about this it may be an oversight.  Subsection (1) deals with the conduct of the ombudsman's investigation and states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman may, for the purposes of a preliminary examination, or an investigation, by him under this Act, require any person who, in the opinion of the Ombudsman, is in possession of information, or has a document or thing in his power or control, that is relevant to the examination or investigation to furnish <Col N="882" /> that information, document or thing to the Ombudsman and, where appropriate, may require the person to attend before him for that purpose and the person shall comply with the requirements.</P>
    <P>That is fine but there are elements in an administrative process which are not as palpable as a document or as the contents of a document or even as palpable as information which is non-documentary, information transmitted by word of mouth.  There are such things as motive and judgement that cannot be elicited from an official without interrogating him.  I do not mean putting him on the rack but asking him: &ldquo;Why did you do this, why did you do that, why did you not do the other?&rdquo;  It may be that some other part of the Bill implicitly empowers the ombudsman to interrogate an official in that sense of the word, not in a hostile way but to question him.  It does not seem to me to result from anything in section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 7 defines the powers of the ombudsman in respect of examinations and investigations.  All the first paragraph of subsection (1) does is to empower the ombudsman to get the files and to ask an official: &ldquo;Have you any information bearing on this matter over and above the files which you have brought along with you?&rdquo;.  If the answer is no, that is the end of the ombudsman's powers so far as conducting his investigation of this official is concerned. He is not apparently specifically allowed to ask about the official's motives, modes of operation or methods, but these matters are highly relevant to several of the criteria listed in section 4. That section, unless I have missed something in it, ought to be amended in order specifically to empower the ombudsman to question a Minister or any of his subordinates in regard to the motives or circumstances of a particular administrative action.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another matter, although this may arise more directly under section 8.  The ombudsman, who I am sure will be absolutely honest and <Col N="883" /> who will have to know at least something about how government works, might find in the course of conducting an investigation a case being made by an official or by a Department which was prejudicial to the complaining party.  I do not mean a case that would reflect morally, for instance, on him; but the ombudsman might find an official saying that a decision not to grant planning permission, for instance, had been made because the road concerned was very narrow and there would not be access for fire engines.  In saying that I am aware that An Bord Pleanála are excluded from the Bill.  But let us suppose that the reply from the applicant was that there was that there was access from some other place or that adequate fire protection was available without the fire engines having to travel along the roadway concerned.  It might not occur to the ombudsman to make that point. He would have many other cases to deal with but had the complainant known in advance that the point about access would be raised against him, he would have wanted to rush in and say before the case got to the ombudsman that there was another means of access.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while it would be unreasonable to ask the ombudsman to hold a kind of court with the complainant present and brow-beating officials, there should be some access for the complainant to meet face to face with the officials who had decided his case and there should be some possibility for him to cross-examine them.  I do not mean necessarily to examine them in a hostile sense.  In my reasonable experience of administrative activity in this country I do not ever recall being confronted with a case of deliberately malicious, dishonest or disreputable behaviour on the part of an official either at national or local government level.  I have come across cases of people not getting their rights as a result of their being insufficiently understood, but I have never heard any suggestion that anything other than that is much of a feature of our system.  Consequently, when I use the phrase &ldquo;cross-examine&rdquo;.  I do not mean <Col N="884" /> putting an official in a corner and subjecting him to rigorous questioning.  Instead, I am using the phrase in the lawyer's sense of testing the reasons for someone having reached certain conclusions. Having regard to what is now the conception of the courts in regard to constitutional justice, cross-examination is almost a necessary part of a fair procedure.  A person should be given the chance of testing what is being raised against him.</P>
    <P>The powers of the ombudsman should be stated more clearly.  It should be stated clearly that he is entitled to question or interrogate an official and that in any case in which he would consider that fairness to the applicant so requires the applicant, whether acting on his own behalf or through a solicitor or counsel, should have access to the inquiry so as to test, by cross-examination if necessary, the points being put forward against him by a Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the phrase, &ldquo;who in the opinion of the ombudsman is in possession of information&rdquo; in section 7 as meaning that, if a person is in possession of information as to the reasons why he did or did not do something and that if in the opinion of the ombudsman that information is relevant, the applicant can be summoned by the ombudsman to appear before him.  In other words, I understand the section as empowering the ombudsman to summon witnesses and to question them and also to request the production of documents and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agrees, then, with what I am trying to establish, but this does not come through in the Bill.  I will give the Minister an instance from the <i>Irish Jurist Reports</i> of 1945 in which is cited the case of O'Mahony against the then South Cork Board of Health. That case concerned an old lady who was the tenant of a labourer's cottage provided under the Labourer's Act, 1936, the cottage being owned by the local board of health.  The old lady had made a nuisance of herself to the board by forcing them to carry out repairs to the cottage.  They had dragged their heels <Col N="885" /> about doing the work but she took them to court, where it was decided that they had to pay for the repairs.  It transpired in the course of the court hearing thereafter that the board of health felt badly about being taken to law by this old lady.  Later she applied, as she was entitled to apply, under the 1936 Act to buy out the cottage but her application was turned down by the board.  It transpired that they were actuated, not by any of the considerations which the Statute recognised, namely, whether she was within the qualifications outlined by the Act for acquiring the labourer's cottage of which she was a tenant, but by a mere pique, their reaction being &ldquo;We will show this old one who is boss&rdquo;.  I mentioned that as a very rare case.  I doubt if one would find a similar case in the Irish Law Reports, but such a case would not respond to the exercise of the function which section 7, subsection (1), paragraph (a) contains.  An ombudsman might have requested documents and so on but it would have been very difficult for him to ascertain the motive which lead to the board's refusing to vest the cottage in the old lady.</P>

      <P>The council very kindly made a presentation to me of this report recently.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in commissioning this survey the council had regard to the importance of the artist in our society and of the difficulty of ensuring that the artist is given adequate reward and recognition. This is particularly true of individual creative artists who devote the greater part of their time to their art.

Both Deputies are right in drawing attention to the fact that something perhaps more specific requires to be done for the individual artist who is struggling to exist out of his or <Col N="888" /> her art.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the proposals by a private landlord (details supplied) to obtain vacant possession of blocks of flats, as a result of which most of the tenants concerned will be forced to seek local authority housing with a consequent expansion of demand on the already crowded waiting list for accommodation from Dublin Corporation; and if he will make <Col N="889" /> representations to the landlord in question to ensure that the present tenants can remain on in their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from tenants of the blocks of flats concerned.  The matter is, however, one between a landlord and his tenants, and not one in which I, as Minister for the Environment, have any functions or powers, nor is there any action that I can usefully take in connection with it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this new development of companies&mdash;the names of the directors of which are difficult, if not impossible, to find out&mdash;purchasing whole blocks of flats and then proceeding to use the existing law to virtually evict existing tenants is another development in speculation by unscrupulous people of the basic needs of our people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that some tenants have been served with notices to quit by the landlords, Associated Properties Limited.  The Minister for the Environment has no power or function with regard to such matters.  The general question of the security of tenure of the tenancy is one which comes within the area of the landlord and tenant code, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice. As Deputies know, the circumstances of this matter came about through a judgment in the High Court which the courts of the land have now decided upon.</P>

      <P>While the question submitted by Deputy Quinn is in relation to a particular block of flats, it is not an isolated case.  In Rialto, there are 108 tenants under threat of eviction, some of whom are extremely old people who have lived there all their lives, because of a similar operation by a group of people whose identity is almost impossible to establish. The social effects of this type of <Col N="890" /> operation are, to say the least, very distasteful indeed.  Deputy Quinn, to my knowledge,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of measures have been launched in the last 12 months on the recommendation of the Manpower Consultative Committee to alleviate shortages emerging for computer programmers and systems analysts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 13 experienced systems analysts have been recruited to date from a campaign in the United Kingdom organised by the National Manpower Service last June.  The manpower education <Col N="900" /> programme launched last autumn provided an additional 346 student opportunities in courses leading to computer science qualifications over and above those studying in this area at the time of the programme.  Of these 346 places, 127 are in short duration courses which will ensure an increased supply of qualified computer personnel this summer.</P>

The number of vacancies for systems analysts at the end of 1979 was 51 and 145 vacancies would arise over the following two years.  The corresponding figures for programmers are 53 and 181 and for junior trainee programmers the figures are 77 and 214.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will outline the discussions he has had on the Government's Discussion Document on Worker Participation; and when he proposes to introduce positive proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in publishing the discussion paper <i>Worker Participation</i>, which was released on 27 March 1980, is to focus public attention upon developments relating to worker participation at different levels of the enterprise, promote public discussion and stimulate all concerned to formulate their views on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The paper sets out to pose options rather than put forward any hard and fast blueprint.  It has been designed so that both sides of industry and other interests will have an opportunity to put <Col N="902" /> forward their views and point the way forward.  Until the social partners in particular have outlined their positions Government initiatives as regards the private sector would, in my view, be premature.  Any worthwhile progress in this area must be based on consensus between the interest groups concerned.</P>
    <P>To aid this process I propose to set up an advisory committee on worker participation composed of representatives of the main interest groups.  The terms of reference of the committee will be to undertake a study of the feasibility of possible initiatives, including research, in relation to worker participation and to make recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that he has not had discussions with anybody on the worker participation document?  Does he not agree that the House ought to be tired of his fobbing off of issues to working parties, standing committees and commissions which will not report until many years after the Minister has left office?  Does he not consider that this matter is more urgent and needs positive action by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should realise that a discussion paper was provided to stimulate discussion, particularly among the social partners and the community at large.  It was part of the commitment by the Government in last year's national understanding.  I believe it to have been a very positive and progressive step forward.  To give some indication to the Deputy of what has been happening since the document was issued I should like to tell him that many seminars were organised by various groups.  I addressed a number of those and at all times I supplied officials from the Department.  Further seminars have been arranged and will be held in the near future.  With regard to the advisory committee mentioned in the reply I should like to tell the Deputy that it will be representative of both sides of industry. The Deputy should realise that an issue like worker participation needs to be promoted and discussed.  I do not think that in our situation something imposed <Col N="903" /> by a Government is the answer. The answer is to get the views expressed and considered by both sides of industry when the commitment is a complete one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be a clearer sign of the Government's intent and dedication towards worker participation if, for instance, he sets up a worker participation agency to promote worker participation in the same fashion as the equality agency?  Will the Minister consider that suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree. Both sides of industry received the discussion document very well.  I believe that in an area like that, where obviously all views will not coincide, it is important that public discussion takes place.  Public views should be expressed by both sides of industry and the community.  The document, which was welcomed, served a very useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that both management and unions are a little afraid of worker participation and are dragging their feet in this regard?  Does the Minister agree that it is the interest of the community at large to follow this path, admittedly very carefully?  Does the Minister accept that the best way to pursue this would be by setting up an agency which would diligently approach the problem over the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree that there is a certain amount of caution being exercised by both sides of industry in regard to this but, however, both sides welcomed the issuing of the discussion document.  I believe the proposal in that is the right way forward and not through an agency.  I do not see what role an agency can fill in this area. The essential components of success in worker participation are both sides of industry and for that reason I am looking forward to their response to the discussion document.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Mitchell</b> asked the Minister for Labour the amount of aid Ireland will receive from the European Social Fund in 1980; the manner in which decisions were taken as to the type of aid to be sought from the fund; by whom these decisions were made; if there is any significant change in the type of aid being sought in 1980 as against 1978; and if he will outline the Government's policy in respect of applications for aid from this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputies' question refers to the amount of Social Fund aid requested for Ireland in 1980 and not to actual receipts from the fund in 1980, many of which relate <Col N="907" /> to operations carried out in previous years.  Applications totalling £56.57 million, in respect of operations commencing in 1980, have been submitted by Ireland to the European Commission. The Commission's formal decision on most of these applications will not be conveyed for another few weeks but I understand that a total of £48.24 million has so far been recommended for approval by the Social Fund Committee. Applications for £0.3 million were not recommended by the fund committee and the balance of the applications, amounting to £8.03 million, will be considered next month by the committee.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, Social Fund aid is provided mainly for training, the fund providing in relation to Ireland 55 per cent of the cost of approved operations, the balance being provided from public funds.  It is the responsibility of the applicant organisations to frame their applications so as to derive maximum benefit from the fund.  My Department give assistance and advice to applicants in seeking aid from the fund and try to ensure that the applications conform to the regulations and decisions of the Council of Ministers and to the criteria laid down by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The most significant change in the fund since 1978 has been the introduction in 1979 of new aids to promote the employment of unemployed young people. The National Manpower Service, the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment expanded their programmes on behalf of young people to take full advantage of these new aids.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to try to obtain maximum benefit for operations in Ireland which might qualify for aid from the fund though within the limitations of the amount of Irish public expenditure which can be made available for such operations.  We should also like to see an expansion of the resources of the fund and of the types of aid which it can give and in the proportion of the benefits of the fund which are directed to the less developed parts of the Community.</P>

    <Title>Ombudsman (No. 2) Bill, 1979: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before lunch I was talking about the problem which subsection (1) discloses, namely, that though it requires officials to provide information and documents to which they have access, at the ombudsman's request, it does not specifically commit the officials to answer the ombudsman's questions on something which may be just as material to the issue of whether there has been maladministration, in other words, the state of an official's mind at the time when the administrative action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of that subsection does not necessarily include the possibility that the ombudsman might wish to establish, as a litigant in court might wish to establish in similar circumstances, whether the decision of which the litigant <Col N="947" /> has complained had been taken for the wrong reasons, perhaps as the result of an element of bias.  These things will not surface merely through the delivery of documents or of information of an oral kind.  They will only surface if the ombudsman is permitted to interrogate the officials&mdash;I emphasise I do not mean that in a hostile sense&mdash;in regard to other matters, particularly the official's state of mind and his motives, and if the complaining party is permitted to cross-examine&mdash;again, not in a hostile sense&mdash;the official whose behaviour is under scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In reply the Minister said he thought the expression &ldquo;in possession of information&rdquo; in subsection (1) is a phrase apt to include the state of the official's mind. Though there is room for a difference of opinion in regard to the wording, I cannot see that the wording means that at all.  As far as I can see, the subsection relates to information of a factual kind. The Bill requires the official to deliver certain information, but why did the official consider that the applicant was not a fit and suitable person?  These are all areas on which an official might have a subjective and completely honest point of view&mdash;there is no question of suggesting dishonesty in that regard&mdash;but it is a subjective matter about which information cannot be elicited from the official if the ombudsman is not permitted to inquire about his motives.  The officials's motives cannot be ascertained unless he is subjected to testing by the plaintiff or by his representative.  The question of a representative arises more properly on section 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can do is restate what I said before the adjournment, that as far as we are concerned this is designed to give the ombudsman statutory power to summon witnesses and to ask them any questions he feels will be of use to him in his determination of complaints.  I will have a look at the subsection before Report Stage to see if we can strengthen it, <Col N="948" /> perhaps by changing the wording, in order to come some way towards Deputy Kelly's thinking.  Our aims are the same. It is only a question of getting the form of words that might satisfy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that subsection (3) puts the ombudsman for some purposes in the same position and on the same level as a court. An official might behave towards the ombudsman in a way which would render him guilty of contempt of court, if he was in court, or of an offence.  Although it is not usual for a judge to do it, a judge might ask a witness why he had done this or that, particularly if the judge finds that counsel have not been active enough.  If the witness refuses to answer, or pretends he does not wish to answer, it could constitute a contempt of court.</P>
      <P>The Minister may argue that my question is answered by subsection (3).  If so, why bother reciting all the things the ombudsman may do, require information and the production of documents and so forth?  Already these things are in the power of a court.  The first subsection declares the positive things the ombudsman can do and the third subsection states that a person shall be guilty of an offence if he obstructs or hinders the ombudsman. These two subsections should correspond; they should be like the obverse and reverse of a coin.  I accept that the Minister and I have the same aim and I think I will put down an amendment for the Report Stage on this.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My first point is very minor.  Subsection (1) appears to contain an echo of Article 34.1 of the Constitution. It says that an investigation by the ombudsman under the Act shall be conducted otherwise than in public.  The reason I say the subsection is an echo of that Article is than the Constitution lays down that justice shall be administered by judges in courts established by law, and save in such limited and special <Col N="949" /> cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.  This may be only a drafting point and whoever in the office of the Attorney General or the draftsman formulated this subsection might like to have another look at it.  It contains a strong suggestion that the Government's view of the ombudsman is that he will be a person administering justice.  Obviously he will not be a judge for constitutional purposes.  If he will not be a judge and if he will not administer justice I cannot see the purpose of specifying that he is to sit otherwise than in public.  I suppose the more explicit the whole business is the better but the Government might like to reflect that they may be burdening themselves with a forensic point that might tell against them at a future stage.</P>
      <P>I could see much advantage in allowing the ombudsman to decide for himself whether an investigation should be held in public or in private.  This ombudsman-in-a-bottle will be entitled to look at only a very small proportion of public grievances but even of that fraction I have no doubt that the majority will be cases which it will be more convenient and humane to conduct in private. However, there might be the odd one that would be the subject of intense public interest and where the public advantage would be better served by having the investigation in public.  On the whole it might be better to leave this matter to the discretion of the ombudsman or, if the Minister wishes, to insert a directive clause to the effect that he shall, unless satisfied that the public interest so requires, sit in private.</P>
      <P>Subsections (3) and (4) add up to something awkward.  Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, the procedure for conducting an investigation shall be such as the Ombudsman considers appropriate in all the circumstances of the case,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is fair enough.  I should have preferred also if the question of publicity <Col N="950" /> or non-publicity of his operations were left to his discretion.  The modern doctrine of the courts is to the effect that in a clause like this the courts read a presumption into it that whatever decision the ombudsman makes about conducting his investigation, whatever decision any official makes about doing anything he is statutorily empowered to do, he will do it with regard to the principles of justice.  In other words, he is not going to behave unfairly.  That presumption automatically is hung around the neck of an official or a Minister by the inclusion of a clause such as this in a Bill.  There a presumption not only that the Act will be constitutional but that anybody who is given any power under the Act will exercise it in a constitutional way.  That is very healthy and salutary.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman may determine whether any person may be represented, by counsel, solicitor or otherwise, in an investigation by him under this Act.</P>
    <P>Again, that is subject to what will be the judicial presumption that the ombudsman in deciding whether to allow somebody to be represented by solicitor and/or counsel will behave fairly, that he will decide whether it is appropriate in a particular case for the complainant to have legal assistance and so forth.  It is a pity that we should fall back on this, as yet not very well-defined judicial presumption that, in any case, will come into operation only when it is invoked before the High Court.  What may happen is that there could be 999 cases of unsatisfactory proceedings before the ombudsman before it occurs to the 1.000th litigant to go to the courts by way of an ordinary action and complain that he is not allowed to bring solicitor and counsel with him.</P>
    <P>I might be answered by being told&mdash;as I have said to the House&mdash;that the ombudsman will behave in a constitutional way in regard to the procedure of his inquiry and the question of representation.  However, it would be <Col N="951" /> more satisfactory if a party were specifically authorised here to be represented by solicitor and counsel. Most complainants will not want that. In any case, presumably they will have to pay if they bring solicitor and counsel with them.  If they get a fair sight of the official whom they think has done them down that will be enough for them.  But I think they should be specifically authorised here to do this and not leave open the possibility that we are going to have yet another case like in re Haughey, where in the Committee of Public Accounts in 1970 a person who was being examined by the committee was not allowed the benefit of counsel to test the accusations being made against him and which the Supreme Court subsequently&mdash;and I suppose predictably &mdash;said was impermissible.</P>
    <P>This is a regrettable arrangement.  I can see what is meant.  I know the presumption is there and I have no reason to think that the ombudsman will behave other than fairly.  However, it should be spelled out that a party appearing before him is entitled to have representation with him.</P>

      <P>I consider that if the right of a person to have counsel was written into the Bill it would defeat its whole purpose.  It would be running parallel to the courts system.  In specifying that a person was entitled to be represented there would be a danger that every person and organisation involved in even the most simple complaint might feel it incumbent on him or them to engage a representative.  If the ombudsman cannot be trusted to behave in accordance with the Constitution and with natural justice the whole Bill will fail.  To write into the Bill what the Deputy has suggested would make the whole system unnecessarily cumbersome and would encourage the association of investigation by the ombudsman with court proceedings.  It is my belief it would run contrary to the whole purpose of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would be more cumbersome but I believe the Minister of <Col N="952" /> State is building up trouble for himself.  I am sure the ombudsman will be decent, respectable, honest and willing to observe the spirit of the Constitution.  So was the late Deputy Paddy Hogan who was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee but that did not stop him from going wrong and making a mistake because he simply was not a lawyer and there was no legal advice available to him on the spot.  Perhaps he did not think of taking advice and the other members of the committee&mdash;of all par-ties&mdash;did not think of it either.  The ombudsman may just as easily go wrong.  If he decides, with a perfectly clear conscience, that a complainant has not established his complaint, what is to stop that complainant bringing an action?  If he asks for counsel and is refused permission, what is to stop him from bringing an action in the courts saying he is being treated in an unconstitutional way in disregard of his rights by the ombudsman?</P>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister of State that the more one builds into a Bill like this the more cumbersome it is likely to be but at least it will be written down in black and white that the ombudsman will have no discretion to forbid a complainant bringing counsel with him if he wishes.  If you give him that discretion you give him discretion to be wrong as well as to be right.  If he exercises that discretion wrongly the Minister may find himself encumbered by proceedings in the High Court.</P>

      <P>There is not any question of suspecting any sinister intent on the part of anyone either now or in the future but if the Minister refers back to the Irish Law Reports he will find hundreds of cases in which people have been forced to come to grips legally with the administration, and where the citizen has won it has almost inevitably been the case that the administration has not been malicious towards him in any way but had acted by reason of not understanding him properly.  That is the sort of situation that I am trying to avoid in the case of the ombudsman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In a way subsection (2) of this section is a little brother to section 1 which empowers the Minister to withdraw a matter entirely from the scrutiny of the ombudsman.  Here the Minister is being given what amounts to the same power because he is being empowered to withhold from the ombudsman any document, information or thing on the grounds that the disclosure of such would be for the reason stated in the notice which the Minister must give, prejudicial to the public interest.  This is a regressive provision.  Nowadays the tendency of the courts is to narrow and not to entrench the grounds on which in ordinary proceedings the Minister is entitled to claim privilege in regard to documents.  That ground has been whittled away to a large extent.  The idea that a Minister would keep a document out of sight of a court can be likened to our <Col N="954" /> habit of wearing collars and ties, a habit that we inherited from the English and which at least those of us who are older than 35 are afraid to throw off.  Despite the stuffy aura of the courts and of the conservatism which is attributed to them, they are a good deal more advanced in moving away from the English model than are the Legislature or the Executive. The courts have said that the old English rules in the type of case we are talking about are not in keeping with the kind of state we have here and they have tended, except in very restrictive types of cases, to allow a judge to make up his own mind as to whether a departmental document should be admitted in evidence.  In other words, the judge is trusted to decide on whether a Minister is entitled to withhold a document.</P>

I cannot think of any valid reason for giving to the Minister the power to decide on the staffing of the office and of appointing the officers.

      <P>The subsection concerned confers on the Minister for the Public Service the right to appoint and determine the number of staff of the ombudsman.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>But the point is that we are setting up the office of ombudsman as an independent body and divorced from the general administration but dealing with investigations within the administration. If this new office is to be seen to be independent and fair the ombudsman should have the power of deciding on the appointments to his office, though I agree that the question of number would be one for the Minister.  I do not think it fair to compare staff in the Ceann Comhairle's office with this new situation because to do so is to view the ombudsman in the light of his being part of the machine, whereas I see him as somebody outside the machine who will be looking in at the machine.  We are talking of a totally new concept and that is the light in which we should consider the situation rather than that the Minister should make the appointment.  I am not saying that the Minister would appoint the wrong staff.  That is not at issue.  What is at issue is that we are setting this office up and must give it all the independence that we can.  If we start niggling about the Minister's powers to <Col N="957" /> appoint, that is limiting the power of the ombudsman.  That is the point I want to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is limiting his independence.  Section 10 (4) empowers the Minister for the Public Service to delegate to the ombudsman his powers and appropriate authority under the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and the Civil Service Regulation Acts of 1956 and 1958.  He has power to delegate such matters as extension of probation, dismissal of unestablished civil servants, certain disciplinary procedures and so on.</P>
      <P>For legal reasons it is necessary that a Minister appoint staff, as in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Their independence is not thereby diminished.  The Deputy need have no worries at all about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to labour the point.  This impinges on the independence of the office and that is what worries me.  In section 10 (4) would the Minister accept that the word should be &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;delegate&rdquo;?  If he delegates the power, he can give it and take it back again.  If he transfers power to the ombudsman, it is not something which will be taken back.  This is just a question of words, but from the point of view of the independence of the office the transfer of powers to the ombudsman would be better.  There is more permanency and independence about a transfer.</P>

This is what I <Col N="958" /> have been wanting to get away from all the time.  This is a completely new office which should not be affected by what happened in the past or what happens in other Departments.  It should be looked at differently.  What is done in other areas does not necessarily follow for it and should not follow it.  It is not that I have any great fears about it.  We will not always be around and this will be the norm for the appointment of staff and the delegation of authority and power. On that basis, the Minister should look at both of these matters again, not on the basis of what is the procedure in other areas.  We are speaking about something which will be basically outside the competence of the administration.  The ombudsman will be on his own and if he is on his own we should give him authority and independence.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the First Schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much that I <Col N="960" /> want to say something specifically on the First Schedule, except by way of pointing out the contrast between the relatively harmless organs of state mentioned in it and the relative unlikelihood that they are ever going to do any damage to anybody or cause any grievances.  I instanced earlier the State Paper Office, the Central Statistics Office, the National Savings Committee, the State Laboratory, the Ordnance Survey Office, the Stationery Office, the Public Record Office, the National Museum, the National Library.  These are all relatively harmless bodies.  It is worth mentioning them to contrast them with the very far from harmless ones whose operations are of the greatest possible importance which are excluded from the definition of the Departments mentioned in Part I of the Schedule and also the very large number of bodies equally excluded in the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>I did call attention earlier to the fact that there was an expressed reference in Part I of the Schedule to the Department of Economic Planning and Development. If we are going to clean up that Schedule from that point of view, I must also point out to the Minister of State that it will not stop there.  The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy no longer exists under that name. Presumably, either the words &ldquo;and Energy&rdquo; will be scrapped and/or the Department of Energy will feature in that first part of the Schedule in its own right.  Equally, the Department of Tourism and Transport which had a short existence, rather like the Kerensky Government in revolutionary Russia, between Deputy Lynch's return to power and his exit.  That Department has been broken up and its operations reassigned.  Presumably that will also have to go from the Schedule and Tourism will be attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce and Transport will be attached to the new Department of Communications and Transport, or is it the other way round?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out a few grievous elements in Part II of the First Schedule. The first thing which is being excluded <Col N="961" /> from the purview of the ombudsman is the work of the police.  I do not mind the police not being under the ombudsman, provided there is some authority to whom people with complaints can go.  I say that not because I have reason to suspect the police; it is the other way round, I tend to suspect the people who make charges against them.  I believe it is in the public interest that the police should be, so far as it is possible for 8,000 human beings to be, above suspicion, but that does not mean beyond criticism.  Those two things are not the same.</P>
    <P>If a criticism is made of the police as a unit or of some unidentified officers or a particular officer, there should be some way of having it investigated by an independent official.  It is not enough&mdash;I freely make a present of this information to the Minister that colleagues of mine have taken a different view of this&mdash;merely to say to somebody who says he has been beaten up, framed or victimised by the police that they should be brought to court.  I will not go into the reasons why that is not enough but it has not been found a satisfactory way of doing things.</P>
    <P>Complaints made to the police about individual police officers are investigated. There is a regular procedure in the police for doing that.  I have no doubt that if I made a complaint to the police in my position&mdash;if that is not too pompous a phrase to use&mdash;or if Deputy O'Brien or the Minister made a complaint, it would be fairly thrashed out. We know enough to be satisfied that the matter was being properly investigated. The people who live in the shadow of subversive organisations and so on, do not have very much confidence in the police.  A certain section of the press, and therefore of the public, even though they have no connection themselves with subversion or crime, tend to have their confidence in the police constantly shaken.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said in the interests of the Garda, if for no other reason, in having an investigative organ other than <Col N="962" /> the courts which are uncertain, expensive and so on but which are clearly independent, to which people can go if they have complaints against gardaí.  This is not the first time I said that and I do not want to labour the point.  I want to recall an instance which I gave before when it was very visibly in the public interest that the police should be thoroughly investigated. That was in 1967 when a man died in a police cell in Cork.  There was no political complexion in this unfortunate man's situation and it was in the days before the IRA were heard of in their present spasm of activity which has lasted 12 years too long.  This man died in circumstances which gave rise to ugly suspicion or whisper in some quarters that he might have been attacked by gardaí while in the Cork Bridewell.  There was a three day inquest and they returned a verdict of accidental death.  But that was no good because the whispers continued.  The Minister for Justice in those days was Deputy Lenihan&mdash;there are not many offices he has not shed lustre on in the course of his enjoyable career&mdash;and he stonewalled on the issue of a public inquiry into that cell death until the whole country was shouting at him, until newspaper editors who had not originally given the matter any thought began to take up their pens and say there had to be an inquiry into this matter because the inquest was too short, not enough matters were ferreted out and so on.</P>
    <P>A judicial inquiry was set up with a judge of the High Court, a Circuit Court judge and a district justice.  They sat not for three days but for three weeks and took detailed evidence of all kinds.  They came to the conclusion that this unfortunate man had genuinely died as a result of an accident.  He was the victim of a very unusual accident, but not unheard of.  He had fallen while drunk very unluckily in such a way that his ribcage got compressed by the steel bar of a bar stool and he suffered a rupture of the spleen.  Unfortunately his injuries were not spotted in time and he died from internal bleeding.  Nobody could blame the unfortunate gardaí, who were trying to run a late night police post in a big town, <Col N="963" /> for that.  There was no sustainable evidence that he had been assaulted.</P>
    <P>Not another word was ever heard about that case.  That investigation, which the then Minister for Justice so bitterly resisted until it was dragged out of him by the people, completely cleared the pall of suspicion from the gardaí.  At the end of the day the people who came out best were the gardaí.  It is for that reason as much as anything else that I would be very much in favour of a proper independent investigative organ other than the courts.  The courts are independent but they have not proved satisfactory in some respects to the kind of complaints likely to be involved in such cases.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable, after all the talk and the complaints about the gardaí under governments from both sides of this House, that the police should still be exempted from scrutiny when we seem to be getting a complaints commissioner, this ombudsman, mouselike though his statutory character is being made.  How many decisions of the Department of Justice or of the organs which fall under their Estimates affect the ordinary citizen?  How many licences do they issue?  How many orders do they make? How many decisions do they take?  The Minister for Justice may decide on somebody's naturalisation or he may take certificates of alienage or something like that, or he may have some functions in regard to things which do not impinge on .1 of 1 per cent of the ordinary population. The matter for which the Minister has responsibility, about which he must answer questions and take political responsibility and which impinges on a large number of people, is the police force.  They are the people who are being taken from the scrutiny of the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The second matter I want to mention is the courts.  I have no complaints to make about the courts.  They are a separate arm of the State and cannot be controlled by this House.  I am not making any complaint about them not being subjected to the ombudsman.  It would be an absurdity and an impertinence if <Col N="964" /> the House were to attempt to put an ombudsman over the courts.</P>
    <P>The third point which gives ground for a lot of hard feeling is An Bord Uchtála, the Adoption Board.  I know adoption is a very delicate and painful matter and that innocent hearts are broken over it.  I am not trying to make little of these things or neglects them in any way.  But there have been cases which ended up in the courts, and God knows how many other cases which might have ended up in the courts if the parties had been better advised, because some part of the adoption procedure was faulty, because something was not taken into account which ought to have been taken into account, or somebody was not given a warning he ought to have been given. These things can happen.  As I said before, most defects in administration happen innocently.  I am not making any allegations that anything except innocent inadvertence is involved.</P>
    <P>Why take the proceedings of An Bord Uchtála out of the purview of the ombudsman? I make no special case for An Bord Uchtála; it is only the tip of the iceberg as far as the exclusions in the Bill are concerned.  Some of the others mentioned later in the Schedule are organs of a quasi-judicial type and I suppose it would be objectionable to have an ombudsman breathing down the neck of the judicial commissioner or the appeals tribual of the Land Commission or the Labour Court.  I accept that but there are several other heads, one being the Defence Forces, under which one could criticise the exclusions here contained.</P>
    <P>In regard to the exclusion of the Defence Forces, I agree that military promotions must be a matter of things that are impalpable in a way that civil service promotions are not.  There are certain posts in the military service to which mere seniority ought not, perhaps, entitle one to promotion and a certain instinct regarding the right man for the job must be allowed to operate in military matters, although one would be a bit more jealous about its operation in civilian matters.  However, as far as I can remember it was actually in connection <Col N="965" /> with military administration that the first ever ombudsman was appointed.  It was either Gustavus Adolphus or Charles XII of Sweden who established the first independent complaints commissioner. He was not called an ombudsman but a justice officer or something similar.  He was appointed specifically in the context of military administration in order to give soldiers or officers who were aggrieved by different forms of discipline or military disposition a chance to make their case to someone other than their superior officer.  While I agree that a wide range of military matters are not proper to be submitted to the scrutiny of a civilian ombudsman, I would not have excluded the Defence Forces holus-bolus. I could well imagine certain matters in which the Defence Forces are involved where the scrutiny of the civilian ombudsman would be of great public value.</P>

      <P>I must refer back to the report of the all-party committee because a considerable amount of this Bill is based on that report.  The intention was that all Departments should be included from the start and that local authorities, health boards and noncommercial State-sponsored bodies be added later.  They specifically recommended that the commercial semi-State bodies should not be included at all.  This is broadly what the Schedules will do. We will consider before Report Stage the points which have been made in relation to the tidying up of the First Schedule to cover new Departments.</P>
      <P>I am in some difficulty in that I did not have notice of some of the matters Deputy Kelly raised and I presume that he will put down amendments on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Garda are not included because their work is considered to be mainly subject to the scrutiny of the Judiciary or related to security or subject to existing appeals machinery. The report of the all-party committee states that the greater part of the work of the Garda relates to the investigation of breaches of the law and the detection, apprehension and prosecution of those responsible.  Their actions in this area are, therefore, subject almost as a matter of routine to the scrutiny of an independent Judiciary and are, therefore, not appropriate for investigation by another authority.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Board make orders which have legal force and the Minister for Justice has no function in relation to them except to provide them with staff. This does not reduce the board's independence just as it will not reduce the independence of the ombudsman in having civil service staff.</P>
      <P>A citizen who feels he has been wrongly dealt with by the Garda can take a case in court.  I appreciate Deputy Kelly's point that it can be costly but the facility is there for the citizen to take action against the Gardaí if he feels he has been treated in a wrongful manner.  Individuals can cross-examine gardaí in court and I feel the situation is well covered.  My own experience of the gardaí has been very good and complaints from people who would not have the same power as Deputy Kelly or any other Deputy are treated fairly, adequately and quickly.  It is not envisaged at present that any of the bodies listed in Part II will be included.  However, at some time in the future this Government or any other Government can by order amend the First Schedule by deleting bodies from Part II and including them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces in many European countries are made up of conscripts and consequently they are intimately bound up with the daily life of the people. In Ireland neither the same considerations nor the same cultural traditions as, say, in Sweden would apply. The members of our Defence Forces are <Col N="967" /> there by choice and volunteer.  They accept the conditions of military life and a soldier who has a grievance can go, as can a civil servant, to his immediate superior.</P>

      <P>I realise the Minister of State is giving the official view on this matter and I accept that it is based to some extent at least on the views of the all-party committee.  Regarding what he said about the police, I would emphasise that it is of no use to talk about the courts.  Friends and colleagues of mine have taken the same line as the Minister on former occasions but there is no use in saying that the courts are there in order to investigate the police.  In order to get the courts into action and to crank up the court machinery there has to be a litigant, there has to be a plaintiff and he has to have a cause of action.  There has to be a defendant also.  One cannot walk into a court and say: &ldquo;I feel badly about this&rdquo;.  The matter must be cast into a form of action which the legal system of the country recognises.  There has to be a defendant who can be made liable under one of the existing rules of law for the act of which the plaintiff is complaining.  As an example, let us take the family of the man who died in the cell in the police station in Cork.  I understand he came from a fairly humble walk of life and I would imagine&mdash;I hope I am not saying anything hurtful&mdash;that his family came from a walk of life which would not instinctively know a great deal about how to handle lawyers or legal material. What are they to do?  Who are they to sue?  Had they any evidence of any kind either against the sergeant in charge or the gardaí in the Bridewell?  Had they any means of discovering their names? Had they any means of discovering if there were any other prisoners in or around the Bridewell at the same time who could have given evidence?  What would have been the cause of action? Were they going to institute a prosecution for murder?  Would the Attorney General of the day not have instantly thrown out as being manifestly unfounded whatever shreds of whispers or <Col N="968" /> rumours they were able to produce towards that end?  That family wanted to find out what happened to that man.</P>
      <P>Unless one can fit one's point into the mould of a recognised form of action and aim the thing against a recognised defendant the courts are powerless. When one gets there the ordinary rules of procedure apply.  The plaintiff must make his case and bring it past the <i>prima facie</i> stage.  If he does not it is fired out before even the defence are required to go into evidence, before even the State is required to put up a single witness. Unless the plaintiff can make a plausible case with evidence called by himself, the Garda, the State or anybody else will not be required to produce evidence.  The case can be fired out on the conclusion of the plaintiff's submission and his evidence.  I am not trying to make a meal out of this or to go into legal niceties&mdash;they are not really niceties; they are very simple facts&mdash;but there are a lot of areas, particularly in regard to police behaviour, in which it is not easy either to collect evidence, to find out the names of potential defendants, or to make an allegation stick in a form which is recognised as being actionable at law.  That must be done apart altogether from the question of costs and the question of whether one has the nerve and the willingness to make oneself disagreeable, which goes with any litigation and is inherent in all litigation, even that about a hedge or a ditch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pre-eminently not an area in which it is enough to tell people that the courts will see them right.  It is pre-eminently an area in which it would be an advantage to have an independent official of a kind who can be informally approached and who does not require a case to be cast in a particular form of action which only a lawyer would be able to identify.  It is important that such a person is able to recognise in the common sense that Deputy Calleary or Deputy O'Brien or myself would bring to bear that there is a hardship or a potential hardship and find for himself what happened, if he can.  That is what is needed and it is regrettable and deplorable that the very first exclusion in <Col N="969" /> the list should be one of those about which there is most often public concern. I am not saying that it necessarily is a justified concern but, undoubtedly, there is some measure of concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the important area of the Bill.  The list of exclusions is very formidable.  While a lot of the provisions were in line with the thinking of the all-party committee it should be remembered that that committee deliberated four years ago.  We have all had time to think, reflect and formulate new ideas in this area.  It would be safe to say that if the same all-party committee considered this matter today they would have a different view because of the experience they have gained in this area.  I believe the committee would be a little bolder now than they were four years ago.  It is not valid to say that the Government are adhering to the report of the all-party committee.  The report of that committee was a guideline.  The Minister should include any of the bodies that have been excluded.  Local authorities and health <Col N="970" /> boards should be included and I will continue to make that point until the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister told the House that such bodies can be included by order.  He also mentioned that noncommercial State bodies could be included but they are of little consequence because their role is so small.  The general public come into close contact with the commercial State-sponsored bodies and they should be included if the powers of the ombudsman are to have any meaning.  We can only refer to the commercial State bodies when we consider the Estimate of the Department responsible for them and we are all aware of how restricted those debates are.  I do not see any reason why they should be excluded.  I am not worried about a lot of the bodies excluded but we are all aware that the public have grievances from time to time about some of them.  We are all aware of the areas of contention and frustration.  The idea of the Bill was to get away from such frustration and give people a platform where they can air their grievances before a person who has access to the various Departments and bodies.  If the bodies I have referred to are excluded then this appointment is not even a halfhearted effort.  It amounts to paying lip-service to the problem.  I hope the Minister will avail of this opportunity to remove from his mind the idea that he has to adhere rigidly to the contents of the report of the all-party committee. The Minister, knowing the problems that exist in the various areas, should say I will include this, this and this.</P>
      <P>This Bill will rest on the appointment of the individual, in his character and calibre.  He will fashion the type of office it will be.  The complaints and where they come from will also fashion the office of ombudsman and the future of it.  If we have a narrow field, the office will become a useless one in no time and people will not have faith in it because they will not be sure what complaints they can refer to it.  They will have a list of dos and don'ts.  That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to look at it <Col N="971" /> again and include local authorities, health boards and semi-State bodies. They are the ones that have direct contact with the public and can initiate the friction and day-to-day problems.  It is important to look at the schedule again and go through it with a fine comb.  The Minister should not wait for 12 months and see how it goes on.  It is quite obvious that there are areas that require to be taken out immediately and looked at. We can look through the list again and say we will have this, this and this at a later stage.  People think of local authorities and health boards as general administration and will wonder why they can bring a matter about health but not about a health board or local authority to the ombudsman.  They can bring a problem about a hospital to him but perhaps not something else in the health area.  There is a conflict and it may be used for exclusions rather than inclusions. We must include as broad a base as possible.</P>
    <P>It is five years since we put down this Private Members' motion and we have had time to think and look at it.  Let us open the blinds and look at it and if there are problems let us eradicate them.  If there are no problems that is fine.  The whole idea of having the ombudsman is to have openness as far as we can.  I appeal to the Minister to take this course of action and be bold.  He probably feels that it will be done anyway and, if that is so, now is the time to do it when the office is getting under way.  It should be equipped to deal with all areas.  The office will then be effective and do a worthwhile job.</P>
    <P>With so many restrictions put on it the position of ombudsman will not be a success, not because of the ombudsman but because the House will have imposed too many restrictions and closed too many doors.  I regret this.  I do not wish to make political capital out of this because it is not a political issue.  We are at one on it and the all-party committee wanted it to work well.  The Minister should include local authorities and particularly health boards.  In case people think I have a major problem with health <Col N="972" /> boards I have not.  They are remote and the way they submit their accounts, which would have nothing to do with the ombudsman, is a typical example of this, and because of the way they treat public representatives and the public in general they must come within the ambit of the ombudsman.  Once they do that they will put their house in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree very much with what Deputy O'Brien has just said.  I should like to make a few specialised points on this schedule.  There are two personages in the State I cannot find anywhere in the Bill either included or excluded.  I believe they should be excluded but I do not see them in either of the excluding schedules and I do not think they are implied anywhere else. One is the Attorney General and the other is the Director of Public Prosecutions. I do not think either of these persons should be subject to the ombudsman's scrutiny.  The Attorney General is an independent constitutional officer and although not a judicial personage he occupies a position which would not be appropriate for the ombudsman, who is scrutinising administration in a more general sense, to look at.</P>
      <P>I would not be in favour of the Director of Public Prosecutions being under scrutiny but it would be no harm if it is intended to exempt them to say so in so many words.  It may be that he is excluded by implication in some way I have missed or my eye has skimmed past and, if so, no doubt the Minister's advisers will tell me.  I cannot see how the DPP fits into the Bill.  He is not listed among the persons who are subject to investigation. His vote falls under the Attorney General's vote, which, for Dáil purposes, is looked after by the Department of the Taoiseach and I do not notice any exclusions from the Department of the Taoiseach in the second part of the First Schedule, nor does he appear to be mentioned in the Second Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is one to make of it?  I hope the Minister does not think that it is a frivolous matter because more than once it has happened in my time in public <Col N="973" /> life&mdash;I am certain the same thing has happened to Deputies Calleary and O'Brien&mdash;that people have complained not about being prosecuted but about other people not being prosecuted.  For example, if a road accident occurs and someone belonging to them is injured or killed and no prosecution takes place that can be a subject of very acute grievance, let nobody deceive themselves about it.  While it might seem vindictive to somebody who is not involved in a family tragedy to be trying to have somebody else prosecuted, one might feel very differently if a member of one's family were injured or worse, let us say, in a motor accident caused by a driver whom one thought was drunk and who had not been prosecuted for reasons which did not seem adequate to me or to you.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has to be a genuinely independent personage. He has to be trusted and he is appointed in a manner rather like that of the ombudsman's appointment.  We would not get people of standing very anxious to have the job if they were to have, perhaps, a non-lawyer looking over their shoulder, a man not equipped to make decisions of a strictly legal kind based on an assessment of probabilities in a court of law.  Therefore I am not in any way suggesting that he should be included in the ombudsman's scrutiny. But I do think that, in order to circumvent people from imagining that the ombudsman, powerless though he is in a lot of other respects, might be able to check up on the Director of Public Prosecutions' failure to prosecute somebody he should be specifically mentioned here.  At least I cannot for the moment see why he is not, any more than is the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>In regard to the individual exclusions, some are very hard to understand.  I see that An Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha is one of the bodies excluded from investigation.  That is the formal title of the College of Art here beside us.  I had a constituent not very long ago who was very much aggrieved by something <Col N="974" /> which the College of Art had done.  I will just explain it very briefly.  What they had done was to refuse to award him an honours certificate in drawing.  Now he had not passed an honours examination but he had passed an ordinary pass examination at a date when there was no distinction between pass and honours, in 1966, I think.  Subsequently this distinction was drawn but it was apparently&mdash;or so he said&mdash;agreed that the pre-1966 pass qualification was equivalent to a post-1966 honours qualification. However, he was unable to produce documentary proof of this because a certificate had not been issued and was now unissuable because there had been a fire, or student demonstration or destruction of some kind in the College of Art and the authorities were no longer in a position to document for him his achievement before 1966.  That was a severe nuisance and a professional handicap to him.  I cannot see what is the dimension of public interest or security which should render a thing like that immune from the ombudsman's scrutiny, but there it is&mdash;An Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha.</P>
    <P>I see that the Central Bank are excluded. Suppose I want to take money out of the country to pay for something&mdash;I do not mean to speculate against the Irish currency&mdash;but suppose I want to take money out of the country to pay a bill, to pay for some necessary import, or to buy myself something abroad&mdash;and mind you we are in the Common Market one of the purposes of which is the free movement of capital. That is what it was founded for and that is what we have signed up for.  Suppose I want to buy something abroad and suppose someone in the Central Bank thinks my purpose is frivolous&mdash;suppose he forms that idea in his mind&mdash;that would seem to me to be a highly om-budsworthy matter.  But I see the Central Bank is here excluded if they refuse me exchange control permission.  What is the reason for excluding that?</P>
    <P>Previously I acknowledged that Deputy Calleary, the Minister of State, had a degree of modesty and <Col N="975" /> reasonableness quite unusual in his party when he admitted that we were only feeling our way in this Bill; that we would have to learn as we went along and that the last word had not been said. Something like that coming from a Minister is very disarming.  But my experience also tells me that once a thing like this becomes an Act it is very hard to get much of a shift out of it afterwards. I do urge the Minister of State that there are what I can only call idle inclusions in this long list in the Second Schedule.  There are bodies included in it that there is no good public reason for excluding. Why not look at it in this way? Why not put them into the ones which are subject to scrutiny and take up the same line that we are only feeling our way, that we will see how we get on and, if the Central Bank or the College of Art find themselves the target of an insupportable burden of inquiry and scrutiny, that they cannot conduct their business without finding little ombudspeople under their feet, certainly then let us look at it again and perhaps remove them from scrutiny in some way.  This is a body of men who have done the State an enormous amount of service, but it is a typical, official attitude&mdash;let us cover up all we can, wait for the others to squeal and, if they squeal hard enough, we may let out an inch or two here or there, but let us cover up as much as we can in the first instance.  That is not a good footing on which to get an ombudsman off the ground.</P>
    <P>I see that the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is included.  Perhaps I have had a slip of memory here but, as far as I can remember, that is the body which carries out the blood tests on samples taken from motorists.  That is a function which, if something goes wrong with it, may be responsible for somebody unjustly being very heavily penalised.  It is true that that cannot happen except through a court proceeding, in the course of which the motorist concerned will have ample opportunity to test the correctness of the certificate of his blood.  I do not make <Col N="976" /> any special point about this, but what is the sense in excluding the operations of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety from the scrutiny of the ombudsman? Probably it would happen once in ten years only that anyone would start worrying about what was going on in that medical bureau but why exclude it? Why not let the ombudsman in?  If he makes a damn nuisance of himself, unreasonably so, and the bureau cannot get on with its work, then perhaps think about taking him out again.</P>
    <P>But the worst aspect of the exclusions in the Second Schedule are the ones to which Deputy O'Brien adverted a moment ago.  I have been in this House since 1969 when I first stood for the Dáil.  I am not exactly sure how long Deputy Calleary has been here; I suppose somewhat longer because I think he was a member of a local authority before he ever came to Leinster House.  He knows perfectly well that the bread and butter of the political clinic are people who want health cards, people who want houses, and now, of course, people who want telephones.  At least that is how it is in the Dublin suburbs.  I can quite understand that in the country there may be an additional range of things.  Now and again one gets an eccentric constituent&mdash;I do not say that in a censorious way&mdash;a constituent with an exotic or out-of-the-way problem.  I had one once who was in a terrible state because CIE would not sell him an old double decker he wanted for his private bus collection.  I have to say I notched it up amongst one of my successes&mdash;I managed to persuade CIE to sell him that old double decker bus. Their reasons for being unwilling to do so were very respectable.  They said that, in their experience, even though these double decker buses started off as collectors' items they ended up as unsightly chicken coops.  places for growing mushrooms in and generally as eye sores.  I persuaded them that the man in question was above board.  I showed them photographs of an astounding collection of buses he had made and, eventually, much to their credit, they changed their mind and sold him the old <Col N="977" /> bus.  But for every interesting case one gets like that&mdash;and out of which one might get some personal benefit from following to its end&mdash;one gets 50 which are run of the mill cases about health cards, housing allocations and telephones.</P>
    <P>What am I to say now to some constituents who come along to me wanting to know if they can get some benefit from the Eastern Health Board?  What am I to say in Dundrum and Rathfarnham to people who feel they need contributions to their medicines? What am I to say to the far more numerous ones who cannot get a house? These operations of dispensing health benefits and housing allocations are the functions of the health boards and local authorities respectively.  These matters are, however, excepted and exempted from the scrutiny of the ombudsman.  It is not a bit of use to tell Mrs. So-and-So who comes to my clinic in Dundrum that if she has a quarrel with the Public Records Office, with the State Paper Office or with the National Museum the ombudsman will look into her case.  That is no use to her.  She wants a house for her husband and three children.  And when she says: &ldquo;I thought we now had an ombudsman in this country who would look into my grievance&rdquo;, a grievance sharpened by the perception that a neighbour of hers who has less points as far as she can see&mdash;though she is usually wrong; there may be some medical dimension or other matter of which she is not aware&mdash;has got a house, or somebody who has been on the list for a shorter time, she feels a very acute sense of grievance.  She could live to be a very old woman and never once fall out with the Public Record Office, or with the State Paper Office or the National Museum.  But she feels a bitter sense of grievance if she has to live in a house with 14 other people.  I will not mention the roads concerned but the Minister of State can very well imagine this for himself.</P>
    <P>This is the sense of grievance which makes up 95 cases out of 100 of the <Col N="978" /> grievances which people feel against administration, none of which, or a diminishing fraction of which only are the result of official malice.  Most of them are not even the result of official negligence but of the grand old budgetary constraints which do not allow enough money for this, that or the other, and the people at the bottom of the barrel are squeezed as they always are.  That is a grievance, and an ombudsman who cannot do anything about it will not be of any use to me or to Deputy Calleary.</P>
    <P>The same goes for the VECs, perhaps to a lesser degree.  What about people who apply for appointments controlled by these committees?  They may feel a sense of grievance but they will be wasting their breath if they go to a local representative to ask him to take the matter up with the ombudsman.  They will say they are frightfully sorry but that they cannot do anything about it because the letter of the law will exclude it.  However, if it should happen that a person has a problem with the Ordnance Survey, the local representative can say: &ldquo;I will certainly take that up.  I will march to the Phoenix Park and bang the table, but as far as getting you a job with the VEC is concerned, or a house or a health card, you will have to go to your TD&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the size of it.  Though I do not want to belittle the task any Government have in trying to make everybody happy, I say the Fine Gael Bill was infinitely superior to this, and I hope that the Minister, whom I genuinely and sincerely praise for the humility and moderation with which he dealt with this Bill, will try to bring some more of it to bear to get the Bill substantially changed between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Brien asked us not to close the book, not to draw the blinds.  I say, let us print the book first; let us build the house first and put up the blinds before we start to draw them.  I should like to point out the part Deputy O'Brien had in this.  I think it was his <Col N="979" /> motion in 1973 or 1974 that started the process leading up to today.  He was a very active member of the all-party committee.</P>
      <P>That all-party committee made certain recommendations and we have kept almost rigidly to those suggestions. Points were made in regard to omissions but let me stress that omissions in this Schedule can and will be taken in as soon as we see how the office will operate.  There is much talk today about what the ombudsman should do, that he should get staff and that cases should be dealt with expeditiously.  All I am saying is that we should get the office started. Let us not give the ombudsman all of these all at once.</P>
      <P>I take the points made by Deputies O'Brien and Kelly.  Many of the complaints we get as TDs concern local authorities and health boards.  I can only speak for my association with Mayo County Council since 1967 when I became a member.  There are 31 ombudsmen on that county council and all of the 31 have access to all the information possible.  Deputies may say that one should not have to go to a councillor, but if one takes that to its logical conclusion one should not have to go to an ombudsman. In so far as local authorities are concerned there is no need for worry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Schedule gives a list of Departments to be included from the start.  Deputy Kelly referred to a number of small bodies.  Part II of the Schedule excludes certain bodies.  The Second Schedule has a list of bodies not now included but which can be included <Col N="980" /> later by order.  I will take a look at that.  I have some views of my own and I will see what I can do, but I do not think we should include all of these bodies now.  I am saying that without any malice, only with a view to getting the office started, in operation, off the ground.  I give a commitment now that if I am here in a year I will review the matter and that I will consult the members of the all-party committee, those of them who are left.</P>
      <P>I suppose amendments will be tabled for Report Stage.  I will undertake to look at the points made.  For instance, Deputy Kelly mentioned the offices of Attorney General and the DPP.  They are not Departments or institutions such as the semi-State bodies which could subsequently be included.  They are separate entities, like the Oireachtas itself.</P>
      <P>I undertake to look at the Second Schedule, but honestly I feel that we should not lumber the ombudsman with all of the bodies listed there.  We should give him a chance first of all to get the operation off the ground, to get his office working in regard to the bodies listed in the First Schedule.  At least we will have an ombudsman.  I do not agree he will fit into the bottle Deputy Kelly wanted to put him in.  As I have said, as far as possible we have tried to keep to the recommendations of the all-party committee.</P>
      <P>I must come back to that again. Deputy O'Brien said we have had time to reflect.  Perhaps, but that committee put a lot of good work, which they got little credit for, into their report and I think Deputy O'Brien was doing himself down when he said they have had time to think.  I suggest that their thoughts at the time were more accurate than their thoughts now.  As I said, I will look into the suggestions that have been made and will consider any amendments the two Deputies, or others, will put down.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> The functions and title of the Minister were changed since the Bill was introduced and the proposed amendment takes account of this by proposing to delete &ldquo;Energy&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Tourism&rdquo;.  The change in the Minister's title was affected by the Industry, Commerce and Energy (Alteration of Name of Department and Title of Minister) Order, 1980 that was made under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 30, to delete &ldquo;participants&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;a participant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since our previous debate here we discovered that there was a grammatical error in paragraph (d) of subsection (1). The word &ldquo;participants&rdquo; in the first line of the paragraph should be in the singular to agree with the word &ldquo;his&rdquo; in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii).</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 11 and 12 in the definition of &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that nothing in this definition shall be construed to include <i>bona fide</i> commercial operations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I propose this addition to section 1 is because of the definition of the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; which might be misconstrued and inadvertently forbid <i>bona fide</i> commercial operations.  I do not think we should leave any word in the Bill open to misinterpretation.  The so-called pyramid selling schemes are objectionable in that they provide that payments by participants are made by reason of prospects held out to them of receiving payments or other benefits in respect of people who become participants. As it stands, paragraph (c) of sub-section <Col N="983" /> (1) could be construed to include people operating on a bona fide basis. To put the definition beyond doubt, I submit that the inclusion of the amendment would clarify the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that the amendment is reasonable and fair.  I am sure the Minister and the Department are aware of the various methods of salesmanship. I described one such method where items are on display at tea or coffee parties. The promoters of these schemes are rewarded for their efforts by being given goods of the type sold during the evening. On some occasions they receive monetary reward also.  There is a kind of social function involved with the people who buy goods paying the promoter for them.  The goods I have in mind and which are sold in this way are not available in the shops or by way of any outlet other than at the type of function I have described.  Perhaps the Minister knows the products I am referring to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>These goods are of a very good quality and anyone to whom I have ever spoken and who had bought some of those products seemed very satisfied with the goods.  My concern is that the people involved in this type of activity might consider that what they were doing would be illegal after the coming into operation of this legislation. The amendment tabled by Deputy O'Toole is designed to ease the minds of any such persons.  In some instances there are items of a special nature that are not on sale at the parties and which can be obtained only through the promoter.  There is some concern that these items might come within the scope of this Bill and in this regard such fears should be put at rest.  The operation I have in mind is a very satisfactory commercial operation.  Perhaps it is an operation of an unusual nature but there is a demand for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are discussing <Col N="984" /> is a Bill dealing with pyramid selling and this Bill has taken a long time to reach the House.  Work on it has been going on for some years.  In the drafting of the Bill great care has been taken in defining &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; in order to ensure that no desirable or acceptable trading arrangement would come within the ambit of the Bill.  In these circumstances I do not see any reason for the Fine Gael amendment. There have been references to goods being sold at parties.  I am aware of such activity in my county but this activity would not in any way be regarded as pyramid selling.  It involves the same promoter for a whole area so that there is not any question of someone going from one area to another trying to recruit promoters.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been designed to protect people who in the main consider themselves to be involved genuinely in an honest selling organisation.  There was a problem in defining pyramid schemes without bringing in schemes that cannot be regarded as such, but Deputy Enright need have no anxiety on that point.</P>
      <P>Regarding the points made by Deputy O'Toole, if he refers to the definition of &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; in section 1 he will find that the four elements contained in paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive, in subsection (1) must be present.  In other words, a scheme which was not a pyramid scheme might include the elements in (a) and (b) and possibly those in (c) or (d) but not both (c) and (d).  Like Deputy O'Toole, I am anxious that the Bill would not catch anyone other than those involved in pyramid selling and to that extent I do not think that either the Deputy or Deputy Enright need have any fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's approach to this question.  He has now stated that all the four elements in paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1) of section 1 must be present to constitute the kind of scheme that comes under the Bill, but the fact remains that in the preamble to the definition the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; means:</P>
      <P>any trading scheme which includes the following elements...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Paragraphs (a) to (d) are then listed. Taking the English language at face value, there is nothing to show that the scheme must include the four elements, as the Minister has now stated, which is what he meant to have included in the Bill.  There is nothing there to exclude further elements, as the Minister must also admit.  The phrase is &ldquo;Scheme means any trading scheme which includes...&rdquo;. It does not say that it must include the four elements exclusively.  It is a question of putting this matter beyond any shadow of doubt.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) is the crunch.  In order to come under the prohibition section of the Bill, element (c) must be present.  For that to be so there must be a definite connection between payments by participants and the prospects held out to them, as mentioned in paragraph (c).  I fully appreciate what the Minister has said, but the fact is that that is not stated in the drafting of the Bill.  As the Minister well knows, a Bill becomes an Act and becomes a legal document.  In this country we do not have what people have elsewhere, the spirit of the Act.  As far as I know, what the Minister has said on Committee Stage cannot be taken as admissible evidence in the event of this Act being discussed in court, whereas this could be done elsewhere, I understand&mdash;for example in the UK.  What a court must make judgment on is what they see in cold print in front of them.</P>
    <P>In order to put this definition beyond any shadow of doubt, it should be stated that it excludes people engaged in bona fide operations.  As Deputy Enright mentioned, there are strange types of sales promotions, as the Minister is well aware, some of them closely related to pyramid selling&mdash;first cousins or second cousins, at least.  Unless we get down to the nitty gritty of the operations it is difficult to differentiate between pyramid selling and the kind of operation which is taking place, albeit a legitimate, lawful, legal operation.  If this Bill goes through in its present form there is a danger here, though not a very great one, and on Committee Stage it is our job on this side <Col N="986" /> of the House, and indeed on the Government side, to ensure that as good a job as possible has been done on the drafting and that no loopholes are left whereby any one word might be open to misinterpretation or misconstruction.  This is very important in the case of the definition section of a Bill, where one is defining words.  One is not talking about a word down through a section; one is talking here about a definitive section of the Bill.  That preamble worries me by stating &ldquo; `Scheme' means any trading scheme which includes the following...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let me finish by repeating that it does not say that it must include all four elements, nor does it say that any further elements are excluded.  This is my argument, which is logical.  I fully appreciate the Minister's problem in that accepting amendments from this side of the House is not the normal thing.  I hope however, that the Minister is not averse to this kind of suggestion if he saw that it would help at the end of the day to produce a Bill which was watertight and beyond any misinterpretation or misconstruction by anyone outside this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment put down by anybody, if it has merit, will be included.  I can see the Deputy's concern and his reason for putting down the amendment.  However, his amendment does not really affect the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Further elements may be present but to be included or involved in pyramid selling (a), (b), (c) and (d) must be included. &ldquo; `Scheme' means any trading scheme which includes the following...&rdquo;, seems to me to be a very definite statement. It does not say &ldquo;which may include one or more&rdquo;.  It says &ldquo;which includes the following&rdquo;, which means that the scheme must include the following.  There is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The phraseology of that is definite.  What the Deputy is trying to bring in as an amendment has been the concern of the drafting people and others involved.  It is phrased in this manner so that no bona fide person will be caught out.  As we said in the early part of the Bill on Second Reading, we want to eliminate the con person.  This definition of &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; is very definite.  The real crunch comes in (c) and (d).  Discussion on this is good and it could be referred to later on, but I feel that it is already taken care of.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it would have the same effect as my amendment if that particular line were amended to include the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;?  For the first time in the House, the Minister has stated that the four elements must be present to constitute the definition of &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; under this Bill. That confines it to a narrow area of activity which we are trying to curtail and abolish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to sow the seeds of co-operation in the <Col N="988" /> Minister's mind, that he might on Report Stage agree to a more clear and definite expression in writing of what he actually means and what he has expressed to be the case, that the four elements must be present to constitute a definition of the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; as defined.  I am not a legal man but I put it to him that if that is not done it may be misconstrued.  I am not sure that what the Minister states&mdash;that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; is sufficient to ensure that all four elements must be present&mdash;is there. Looking at this as a layman I felt the amendment proposed was necessary to put this beyond a shadow of doubt.  I ask the Minister to look at this between now and Report Stage to find out if the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; could be construed to mean something other than what he stated.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if the legal interpretation of &ldquo;includes&rdquo; is as definite as the Minister is saying.  That is my problem.  The Minister must agree that a strengthening of that would put it beyond yea or nay.  My amendment would definitely do that.  As I said, the inclusion of &ldquo;must&rdquo; would have the same effect and would strengthen this beyond any shadow of doubt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1c:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 36, after &ldquo;induce&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or attempt to induce&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This legislation is endeavouring to clamp down on the type of operation known as pyramid selling because of its objectionable approach, the soft sell and the way people can be unknowningly caught up in it.  If we accept that this whole area of pyramid selling is objectionable, we could have a situation where a promoter would try to induce people to participate in this kind of promotional work of pyramid selling which may or may not be successful.  The effort at commissioning this type of salesmanship would also be frowned upon under this legislation because it is wrong.</P>
      <P>This is a tidying up operation. Elsewhere in legislation dealing with pyramid selling this format has been adopted.  The phrase &ldquo;attempt to induce&rdquo; is a common expression in other areas of life and would ensure that this approach to sales of this type ought to be brought under the aegis of this Bill.  It is logical to seek that it be included in this legislation. If a person tries to do something wrong but, because of certain circumstances beyond his or her control does not succeed, that does not make that attempt any more legal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case we could have attempts made at pyramid selling by a promoter and without this amendment there is no way he or she can be found to be in breach of this legislation.  This is simply to tidy up the whole approach to this measure to ensure that it is all pervading and does the job it is meant to do, which <Col N="990" /> is to stamp out this objectionable type of promotion.</P>
    <P>There is another reason.  The Minister knows that with the introduction of this legislation there are probably a number of people at this very moment trying to find some way round his Bill.  It is accepted that there are very highly paid people in the area of taxation to look in depth at legislation and scrutinise it very closely to see what loopholes exist.  Invariably they find loopholes.  A person who attempts this kind of operation and fails may, while being outside the provisions of this legislation, find some more sophisticated approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill a person who induces another person becomes a participant.  It is strongly inferred that the person is successful in so inducing and has got his client.  A promoter may call a meeting of a few prospective agents in an hotel and go through his Madison Avenue type of promotional talk, but if the assembled people refuse to participate he will not have induced anybody although he will have attempted to do so.  That alone should be frowned on if we are serious about this legislation.  The inducing of a person infers success but an attempt to induce infers, initially at least, failure.  That is my definition.</P>

      <P>I am as concerned as the Deputy to ensure that there are no loopholes in this Bill.  We are discussing the words &ldquo;induce&rdquo; and &ldquo;attempt to induce&rdquo;. The dictionary definition of &ldquo;induce&rdquo; is to &ldquo;persuade or prevail on&rdquo;; it is not definite.  I would have no objection to putting in &ldquo;attempt to induce&rdquo; if I thought it was necessary but I am convinced, as are the Department, that an attempt to induce a person to participate in a pyramid sales scheme would constitute an offence.  I am satisfied that an attempt to induce would constitute an act of inducing.  We have gone to some <Col N="991" /> trouble to check up on this matter and there is a border line.  According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary the definition is &ldquo;to prevail on or persuade to do&rdquo;. It did not seem that &ldquo;to induce&rdquo; meant that an action was definite.  The word &ldquo;induce&rdquo; should be watertight and include &ldquo;attempt to induce&rdquo;.  An attempt to induce would constitute an act of inducing.</P>

      <P>Obviously I am failing very badly in my attempt to persuade the Minister of State to accept my amendment but I am making a very good attempt. I put down amendment No. 1 (b) and attempted to persuade the Minister to accept it; if he had done so I would have induced him.  I failed to do so and therfore my inducement did not go beyond the attempting stage.  That is the difference and it is very clear to me.  If my putting down the amendment was in breach of an Act of this Parliament, surely it must be accepted that my attempt was also a breach of that Act.</P>
      <P>We are outlawing pyramid selling.  If the promoter is successful in inducing people to participate in this scheme which we hope to outlaw, surely an attempt to induce by a person&mdash;albeit unsuccessful&mdash;must come within the ambit of the provisions of the Bill.  I am not talking about something new.  The Minister will find this format in umpteen Bills.  It is used regularly in legislative phraseology and in legal books.</P>

I can visualise a learned judge with his dictionaries giving definitions of the word &ldquo;induce&rdquo;.  I can see that the omission of the words &ldquo;attempting to induce&rdquo; will have the effect that the person who tries to promote a pyramid selling scheme but fails will not be liable for prosecution.

I am trying to ensure that this legislation will be applied across the board to include those who are involved in the operation of pyramid selling and those who try to involve others.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, shall, within three months of the commencement of each calendar year to which this Act has application, prepare and have presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, a report setting out the following in respect of each of the three previous calendar years&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) in respect of each rating authority the number of persons, the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land in respect of which they are rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, who were not liable to pay income tax because of insufficient income but who were liable to pay rates, as provided in this Act, in the relevant year, <Col N="995" /> (b) in respect of each rating authority the number of persons, the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land exceeds £1 per acre on average and whose total valuation exceeds the amount standing specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, and</P>
    <P>(c) in respect of each rating authority the extent to which the percentage increase in the county rate in the year exceeds the percentage increase in agricultural incomes in the State in the year in question or the latest year for which figures are available as determined by the Central Statistics Office.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment is to insert in page 3 of the Bill between lines 25 and 26 a new section 4.  The new section would read as follows:</P>
    <P>4&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, shall, within three months of the commencement of each calendar year to which this Act has application, prepare and have presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, a report setting out the following in respect of each of the three previous calendar years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>There are three basic headings of information we wish to have the Minister provide a report on.  They are:</P>
    <P>(a) in respect of each rating authority the number of persons, the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land in respect of which they are rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, who were not liable to pay income tax because of insufficient income but who were liable to pay rates, as provided in this Act, in the relevant year,</P>
    <P>The reason for requiring this information is that it has been very obvious to us from our examination of the Bill that there are many people who as a result of the Bill will have their rates doubled on <Col N="996" /> the grounds that this is a means of making them pay their fair share of taxation but who do not have incomes which, if they were being assessed only for income tax, would make them liable to pay any income tax whatever.  In other words, there are many farmers who will have to pay a substantial increase in the amount of their rates as a result of this Bill who do not have taxable income in the terms in which such would be understood by people in occupations other than agriculture.  This is fundamentally unjust and the State should not introduce legislation which would have that effect.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the State must publish information which would show quite clearly the number of cases in which this would happen.  It would make it quite obvious to the public and to the Oireachtas, in perusing the report we are seeking to have presented, the number of people who would have to pay substantial increases. This has an additional significance, apart from the injustice being done to those people if they do not have an income of that kind, in that bigger farmers will be able to use their rates as a set-off against the payment of income tax under the concession introduced in the second last budget. However, there will be many farmers who will not have an income that would make them liable for income tax and therefore will not have an opportunity of availing of this concession.</P>
    <P>We have shown that there are a number of farmers with a valuation of around £40 who on average would be earning £4,000 a year and who are married with two children, with the rates payable on that land, taking average rates, and the small amount of income tax payable, they would pay twice as much as a PAYE worker with the same income and responsibilities.  That is the effect of this Bill.  This is the only amendment we could introduce because of the way the Bill is framed to prevent amendments because of the rules of order in the House.  It is an amendment which will ensure that if injustice is being done it will be seen to be done and the evidence of <Col N="997" /> the injustice will have to be provided to the House in the form of a report.</P>
    <P>The second item on which we require information is as follows:</P>
    <P>(b) in respect of each rating authority the number of persons, the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land exceeds £1 per acre on average and whose total valuation exceeds the amount standing specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, and</P>
    <P>Basically what we are looking for is evidence of the number of cases where land is excessively highly valued.  This Bill purports to double the rates in a number of cases.  These rates are based on the poor law valuations placed on land.  We submit that they are fundamentally unjust and do not reflect the actual earning capacity or the relative value of the land held by different farmers.  The reason this is so is that these valuations for the purpose of rates were devised in the middle of the last century, well over 100 years ago.  The valuations which were devised on the basis of agricultural conditions at that time still stand.  These are known as Griffith valuations.  I shall give a number of examples of the injustices that occur.</P>
    <P>In County Monaghan the land is very highly valued by comparison with the income that can be earned from it, which is very low, and the reason is that at the time Mr. Griffith was doing his valuation flax growing was very common and particularly so in Monaghan.  There was a thriving linen industry in the province of Ulster at that time.  As we know, the flax industry has long since disappeared.  It collapsed in the early part of this century but the high valuations placed on Monaghan land still remains.  Farmers in Monaghan are still paying disproportionately high rates for the simple and sole reason that in the middle of the last century their land was capable of producing flax.  It had nothing to do with anything that is current or relevant at present but because it was worth a lot of money in the last century it is highly <Col N="998" /> valued today and farmers are paying very high rates on it.</P>
    <P>There is another example of land that is excessively valued at present.  When Mr. Griffith was doing his valuations, when cattle used to be driven on foot to Dublin, when there were no lorries or other means of carrying cattle to Dublin, that meant that land, for instance, in Dunboyne where I live, which was within droving distance of Dublin and therefore more suitable for the production of cattle for the Dublin market, was valued much more highly than land, say, ten or 15 miles further along the county and not within droving distance of Dublin.  This is now entirely irrelevant because there are lorries and it costs very little more to get a lorry to bring one's cattle from, say, Summerhill to Dublin than it does from Dunboyne.  But the valuations are higher on some of the land because it was deemed to be within droving distance of the city.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there are two farms beside one another in my parish, just over the ditch from one another, looking exactly similar in terms of their fertility or ability to produce.  One of them has a valuation of £1 per acre and the other, for reasons which I cannot fathom, has a valuation of £2 per acre.  Possibly the reason is that at the time Mr. Griffith did his calculation the land which was valued at £1 per acre was at that time divided into a large number of small holdings whereas the land which is valued at £2 per acre was at that time one big, single farm.  Perhaps Griffith felt it would be fairer to value the smaller farm at a smaller level of valuation and put a higher valuation on the larger one, which at the time was a reasonable proposition. But it happens that at present both farms are in one large unit.  The basis on which this discrimination was made in the middle of the last century between one farm and another no longer exists but the valuation continues and the farmer continues to pay rates at a very high level in one case and at a much lower level in another simply because of conditions which applied in the middle of the last century, indeed shortly after the Famine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> This has been verified very fully by a study undertaken by a gentleman named Lee in the Agricultural Institute who has shown quite clearly that the valuation system currently in force bears no relation in many cases to the productive capacity of the land in twentieth century agricultural conditions.  Much work has been done in the Agricultural Institute in the soil survey which is being carried out by them from Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, which would provide the material to carry out a comprehensive revaluation of land.  It has been estimated that this comprehensive revaluation of land would take approximately 13 years to complete and would cost about £10 million.  Therefore, it is not something that can be done overnight. Even if the Minister were to get up here today and say that he accepted a lot of what I have said about the discrepancies in valuations, that he had decided to have land revalued so that we would have a fair system, it would not have any effect for about 13 years because we could introduce no new rating system based on new valuations until the entire country had been revalued.</P>
    <P>What we are endeavouring to do here is to produce evidence of cases of glaring injustice, where the land is patently very much over-valued and requiring the Minister to give information on such cases in the House.  I belive that by at least bringing the facts to public knowledge in the form of the report we are seeking to have presented under the provisions of this section we will create a climate of opinion which will lead to a revaluation of the land being effected.  I would argue very strongly in favour of the requirements we are seeking to have made in subparagraph (b) of this amendment.</P>
    <P>The third item on which we are seeking to have information disclosed to the House by the Minister is as follows:</P>
    <P>in respect of each rating authority the extent to which the percentage increase in the county rate in the year exceeds the percentage increase in agricultural incomes in the State in the year in question or the latest year for <Col N="1000" /> which figures are available as determined by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>That item of information is of very great relevance in this year because this Bill will provide for the effective doubling of the rates of many farmers in 1980.  In a year in which the incomes of those same farmers have fallen by anything between 9 per cent and 20 per cent could anything be more unjust than to increase their burden of taxation dramatically. Yet that is precisely what this Bill proposes to do.  It is doing it most markedly in the case, not of big farmers&mdash;the big farmers, if they have a sufficient income to pay income tax, can set off their rates against such liability, thus mitigating the effects of this Bill to some considerable degree&mdash;but in the case of small farmers who do not have an income of sufficient size to pay income tax and who cannot set off the increased rates to be levied under this Bill against anything.  They must pay them in full without any hope of ever having them recouped.  Those very farmers with valuations of between £40 and £60 are those on whom the Minister is now seeking to have this very significantly increased rate levied.</P>
    <P>I believe that the information we are seeking here will be very useful and that it will show quite clearly the movements of farm incomes and of rates.  Obviously, if the rates are increasing by a lesser amount than agricultural incomes in a given year, that information also will be shown as a result of this report.  I have no objection to that information being brought forward either if in a particular year it happens to be the case, but the important thing is to establish, as this amendment seeks to do, that there be some relationship between the amount of tax people have to pay and the amount of income they are actually able to earn. The signal characteristic of this Bill is that it proposes to increase very dramatically the rates that people are having to pay in a year in which their incomes are actually falling.  The Minister may claim that there might be difficulty in obtaining some of this information.  I would point out that we are asking that <Col N="1001" /> this information be provided no later than three months after the end of the year to which it applies.  Therefore, the Minister will have at least three months in which to gather the information. Secondly, we are making it clear he will not have to get the information on his own, that a responsibility will rest with the Revenue Commissioners to co-operate with the Minister to provide statistics that he has not got but that they will have.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) relates to the valuations of tenements of agricultural land where valuations exceed £1 per acre.  Information on this should be readily available in every local authority on the basis of survery map material and records in rate books.  I am certain that once that information is provided for any year there would not be any additional cost in providing it for subsequent years unless the valuation system is changed altogether or a position is arrived at where more farmers will be brought into the tax net.</P>
    <P>As far as paragraph (a) is concerned, the Revenue Commissioners will have information on all farmers whose valuations are in excess of £40.  They will be sending out income tax demands and they will know at the end of each year of farmers who have incomes which would put them into the tax net.  If they have such incomes, farmers will be sending in cheques and if they have not they will not be sending in cheques, and the Revenue Commissioners can arrive at the figure required by paragraph (a) simply by subtracting the total number of farmers who have sent in cheques for income tax or who are liable to do so from the number who have valuations in excess of £40, and the result will be the figure required to be provided. Therefore, there is no great difficulty in providing that information.</P>
    <P>In regard to paragraph (c), equally the information can be provided quite easily. Apart from any changes which may occur in the allowances, something the Minister can calculate easily, increases in the county rate will be uniform <Col N="1002" /> throughout the country, or so it seems and so it has been for the past three years because the Minister has been insisting on a 10 per cent or 11 per cent increase. Therefore, it will be easy to get the increase in the county rate each year. Equally it will be easy to estimate the increase in agricultural incomes throughout the State in the year in question. Substantial farm income statistics are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and by the Farm Management Survey of the Agricultural Institute. Therefore there should not be any difficulty in obtaining comparable information on agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not come in and claim that it would be administratively impossible, that it would impose an intolerable burden, to provide this information.  As I have demonstrated, it would be no such thing. The information could be presented with great ease if the Minister set his mind to do so.  If the Minister does not accept that, the only conclusion I can draw is not that he cannot present the information but the he will not present it because he has something to hide, because he does not want to let the Oireachtas or the public know of the incontrovertible fact that there are many farmers who will be paying substantially increased rates because of this Bill who would not have been liable for income tax, and that therefore there are substantial numbers of farmers who will be paying massive increases in rates if agricultural incomes increase.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to present the information we are looking for the only conclusion we can draw is that he simply wants to hide it from the public, that he does not want farmers to see the full magnitude of the injustice being perpetrated by this Bill.  From my experience of talking to farmers, they are only now beginning to realise the magnitude of the injustice imposed by this Bill.  Small farmers are realising that as a result their rates will be doubled, that they will be paying twice as much in rates as people with equivalent incomes will be paying income tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have thought he <Col N="1003" /> would be able to get this Bill through the House relatively quietly without too much publicity, but I can tell him that farmers are beginning to realise what is the position facing them.  The result of this Bill will be to excite all the feelings of injustice generated against the 2 per cent levy last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has one thing in common with the two per cent levy.  It seeks to impose dramatically increased taxation without any regard to the income of the taxpayer, a characteristic which the 2 per cent levy had in common with the Bill.  It increases taxation without any increase in income which would help to pay that taxation.  Indeed I would argue that this Bill is far more unjust than the 2 per cent levy because it is selective.  The information we are seeking would demonstrate the truth of what I am saying about how unjust this Bill is. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, my conclusion will be that his reason for not doing so is that he does not want the injustice of the Bill to be exposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment is the same as the one he put down on Committee Stage but withdrew of his own accord.  At that time he said he would give me an opportunity to reconsider my position.  I had already made it clear on Committee Stage that some of the information then being sought did not arise at all on the administration of this Bill.  Some of the information sought involves the functions of other Ministers but even to the extent that part of the information sought might be obtainable from local authority records, the trouble and expense of taking it out and putting it together as a report for submission to the Houses of the Oireachtas would not be justified.  I have not heard anything at this stage that would encourage me to change my views in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the amendment we <Col N="1004" /> are discussing is mainly to highlight certain aspects of farmers' incomes and their rates.  The amendment seeks a report on three matters.  Paragraph (a) of the amendment would require me to report on the number of persons in each local authority area with valuations above the income tax threshold for fulltime farmers who are not liable for income tax.  The wording of the Deputy's amendment relates to the 1978 Act which tied the valuation ceiling for rates relief to the income tax threshold.  The present Bill does not do this; it sets £40 valuation as the rates relief ceiling for 1980, 1981 and 1982.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean to reduce the number of years?  I think it would be more acceptable to farmers to know what would be the situation for three years instead of the two years specified in the previous measure.  There are practical difficulties involved also.  I have no information on the liability to income tax of individual farmers and neither do local authorities.  There is nothing in the administration of relief given under this Bill that would cause the local authorities or my Department to become involved in the personal income tax affairs of ratepayers.  Liability to pay rates applies to a current year whereas the income tax of a farmer in one year is based on his earnings in the previous year.</P>
      <P>With regard to paragraph (b) of the Deputy's amendment, the information being sought is not available in my Department and does not arise in the administration of the agricultural grant. Local authorities have the information, but collecting and assembling it would be a fairly big operation.  There is no need for the information in this case and I am not satisfied that the expense and trouble involved in obtaining it would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of the amendment seeks in some way to relate farm incomes to rate poundage increases.  Information on this matter is available to any Deputy <Col N="1005" /> who wishes to look up the volume entitled <i>Local Authority Estimates</i> which is produced each year by my Department and which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The same applies with regard to the data sought on agricultural incomes.  It is open to any Deputy to consult the bulletin giving the quarterly Irish statistics published by the Central Statistics Office.  Because the information is available already, I do not see why I should produce a report setting it out once again.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier in the debate, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  On more than one occasion in debates in this House we have agreed that the system obtaining with regard to valuations is not the most equitable.  It is a long-standing system dating from the time of Griffith and I agree there are injustices resulting from the system.  Apart from the distance from the Dublin cattle marts which would have affected Deputy Bruton's constituency, as I said previously there were cases where certain lands were supposed to be ideal for wheat-growing and high valuations were placed on such lands.  This happened in my own county but modern agricultural technology and experts in this area long ago decided the land was not suitable for wheat growing.  Some of the land in question has a valuation of £3 per acre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as I understand it, the farming organisations are not in favour of changing the system for the adjusted acreage system.  Unjust as the present system may appear to some, many farmers prefer it.  I suppose there are other reasons why they would not <Col N="1006" /> like a change.  For instance, many farmers have carried out intensive reclamation work during the years and have improved their lands and a revaluation would mean that their valuations would increase considerably.  There is also the reason the Deputy gave, namely, that it would take 13 years to complete the work, and the cost involved does not warrant embarking on such a course at the present time.  While farmers are not completely satisfied with the present system they prefer it to the adjusted acreage system because many might suffer if their farms were revalued.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am making the case that the Bill, in relation to the category of farmers between £60 and £40 valuation, will increase their rates by over £282 on valuations of £40 and £364 on valuations of £59.  That is an increase of 142 per cent on the £40 valuation.  106 per cent on the £60 valuation, an average of 124 per cent.  When we make this case the opposite side say that farmers can deduct it from their income tax payments. That is correct if those farmers are liable to pay income tax.  I am satisfied that many farmers all over the country with valuations of between £40 and £60 will not be liable to pay income tax this year and those people are being discriminated against by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment wants to make it obligatory on the Minister, his colleague, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1008" /> or somebody to publish a list of the farmers whose valuation exceeds £40 and who are not liable for income tax.  That is a reasonable request.  The amendment asks for a list of farmers whose valuation exceeds the threshold for income tax but who are not liable for income tax because their income is insufficient.  I respectfully suggest that according to any reasonable standards those farmers are being discriminated against by this Bill.  If their income is sufficient to make them liable for income tax they can deduct the rates they pay from the income tax and they are then liable for income tax only.  If it is held that if they are too poor or their income is insufficient to oblige them to pay income tax the Minister will tell them that they must contribute, whether they like it or not, a sum in an average county, of £500 on a poor law valuation of £40.  That is unfair. I believe if the Minister was obliged, as this amendment seeks to oblige him, to publish a list of the farmers whose valuation exceeds £40 and who are not liable for income tax public opinion would force him to drop this discriminatory Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to Deputy Bruton, has not made any case for not accepting the amendment and for not publishing the list of ratepayers which Deputy Bruton seeks to make him publish.</P>
    <P>The argument is that if you are well off enough to pay rates you will not have to pay them because it will be merged into your income tax payments.  If you are so poor that you are not liable to pay income tax then you will have to pay rates.  How can anybody justify such a system of taxation?  How can any Minister, who is pledged to introduce equity into the income tax system and the rating system and who is pledged to have particular reference to the lower income group, justify such a system which says: &ldquo;If you are making far above the income tax level we will not look for rates from you but if, through no fault of your own, your income is so low that the income tax authorities do not bother about you and recognise that you are <Col N="1009" /> not able to pay income tax you must pay the rates.&rdquo;  There could be a case of a man being liable for £500 rates and £500 income tax at the same time.  One will cancel out the other and he will make one payment.  This system should be exposed and Deputy Bruton's amendment has done a lot towards exposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit to accept my amendment.  He introduced a number of arguments against it.  He said that he and the local authorities did not have information about the individual tax liability of farmers and therefore, could not provide from their resources information about the number of farmers who would have a taxable income, who would have valuations which would put them within the net established by this Bill.  This is an invalid argument because it is stated quite clearly in the amendment that the Minister for the Environment in conjuction with the Revenue Commissioners shall provide the information required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the Revenue Commissioners have this information and there is no dispute about that.  The section quite clearly provides that they should co-operate with the Minister in making this information available.  I believe the information sought in the Bill should be presented in an annual report to the House.  The Minister said that some of the information is already available in other places.  He mentioned the information sought in paragraph (c) about agricultural incomes and the rate of increase in the county rate.  The amendment seeks to bring that information which, in some cases, may be available elsewhere, together into one composite report so that under this Bill we can see the relevant information about the implementation of the Bill.  It is not meeting the case of the amendment having the information spread all over the place in many documents which some people might not even know existed. The amendment seeks that on the <Col N="1010" /> implementation of this Bill the information be made available on an annual basis.  I believe this is a very good principle in relation to any legislation because it is important that there should be a system of reviewing the effectiveness and the justice of any given legislation. Therefore what we are proposing here is in some degree novel in that it requires the Minister to present an annual report in respect of the implementation of a particular item of legislation.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;take note of the commitment of the Government to spend £650 million on telephone development over the next 5 years and of the decision to increase postal and telecommunication charges from 1st July, 1980, so that consistent with the principle accepted by successive Governments the services will be self-supporting and the burden of making good a deficit on the operation of the services will not have to be borne by the taxpayer.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister let me know in relation to the £650 million which is to be spent in the next five years, I presume some in this year, what proportion of the increased charges will be used against funding this share of the £650 million or are we completely ignoring that?  The Minister said on a number of occasions that it was always recognised that the postal services should pay for themselves.  Over the years I have been trying to point out that no other service run by the State is asked to pay for itself.  When there is an increase in wages for the postal staff and then an increase in the cost of services it is always pointed out that the increased cost arises from increased wages.  This argument would not be so ridiculous if every other service were paying for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we left office the postal service was paying its way but that was a few years back.  Last night the Minister commented that, not having taken wage and salary increases into account, the extra money which was now going to be charged would not balance the budget and would not make up for the increased costs this year.  We must assume that no provision has been made for an increase in wages.  These matters must have been discussed before the budget, so I just do not know how this could happen so soon after the budget.  Is it not a fact that the Post Office Engineering Union had given in detail what they considered to be the minimum amount which should be provided next year for the postal service, and that that amounts to a total of £250 million?  I assume that this union will be laughed off and completely ignored when the matter is being dealt with and that the Government will make up their own minds.  The Post Office workers know what is wrong and when they make suggestions as to how it should be <Col N="1012" /> remedied they should be listened to.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the engineering end appears to have levelled off and that we have reached a stage, after a lot of trouble, where there seems to be some kind of industrial peace there.  The same is not true for the other branch of the service.  I blame this on the people who were responsible for last year's strike and they were not the Post Office employees who were on strike.  Somebody thought that there was a possibility of going back to the 1880's and starving them out, but it did not work out that way because trade unionists are a lot more loyal to each other than that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the telephone services, airy fairy figures of hundreds of thousands of additional telephones are not worth a damn if we cannot make the telephone service that we have work, and at present the service is not working.  I have been told that people are waiting seven or ten years for telephones.  I do not know whether or not that is true but people are waiting two and three years.  I have written to the Department on a number of occasions in relation to an industrial estate in Ashbourne, County Meath.  Almost 12 months ago they were told that they would get 100 lines.  They have not been able to get one line.  When people inquire about going into the estate the first thing they want to know is about the telephone service.  The telephone service there is nil and that being so it is a bit of a cod that the Minister should talk about thousands of telephones being installed this year.  This is the end of the fifth month and where the Minister is going to get figures from I do not know.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to get an ordinary telephone call without interruptions. Recently after about ten minutes of a telephone call somebody cut in and said that he was very interested in my telephone call.  That person had been listening all along.  Even in this House for some extraordinary reason almost all the lines I have been using have cut in on people who were already using the line and people cut in on the line when I am using it.  This proves that the service is bad and that we should do something <Col N="1013" /> about it before we talk about additional telephones.  It is very hard to ask people to pay an additional £40 rental a year when the service is so bad.  Deputy Deasy last night said that to suggest that old people should pay for calls was ludicrous.  To ask these people to pay for calls means that they might as well get rid of the telephone because they cannot afford to pay for it.  Maybe that is the idea behind it, if people find it too expensive they might send the telephone back. It is also too expensive to ask for 10p for a local call.  Not so long ago it cost an old 2p for a telephone call and it now costs a new 10p.  The whole thing has got to be a bit of a joke.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An extraordinary thing was that when postal charges were increased when we were in Government the howls of derision from the Fianna Fáil side of the House had to be heard to be believed.  If Fianna Fáil had reduced charges to what they were before those terrible increases they referred to were put on I could understand the logic of the argument, but that was not the case.  Now there are to be these further increases.  The Minister has tried to justify the almost 50 per cent increase by saying such an increase is necessary and that there is not any reason for anyone to complain about it. Having regard to the cost of the postage stamp on Christmas cards, for instance, it is doubtful if anyone other than members of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be able to afford to send these greetings any more to their relatives or friends.  A charge of 15p for a stamp for a Christmas card is much too high.  If the <Col N="1014" /> Minister is in office by next Christmas and I doubt if he will be, he should do something about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have expected the movers of this motion to have put <Col N="1016" /> forward clear alternatives to the action that they are condemning.  Instead we have had the principal Opposition speaker telling us blandly that the charges should not be increased because of the increases that were imposed last year, and that increases would not be necessary if the services were operated properly.  If we were to accept that approach the losses would have to be borne by the taxpayers generally.  Is that what the Fine Gael and Labour Parties want? If it is, they should say so clearly so the public may be aware of the situation.</P>
      <P>Would the Opposition be prepared to tell those thousands of taxpayers who took to the streets last year that they should be burdened with additional taxation in order to pay for the telephone and postal services?  The approach of successive Governments to the Post Office services has been that these services should pay their way but what is being suggested in the motion before the House is that the users of the service, including business and commercial concerns of all kinds, should be subsidised from general taxation.  In other words, regardless of the extent to which one avails of the Post Office services he should foot the bill in the same proportion as any other.  It is important that this concept on the part of the Opposition be understood clearly by the public.</P>
      <P>I do not see any justification for such an approach.  Those who use the services are the ones who should pay for them. There is an onus on the people opposite to demonstrate how according to them the increased charges could be avoided.  I have waited with keen interest to hear the formula that the movers of this motion have for avoiding these increases and for turning the services into a break-even situation.  The losses that are being incurred on an increasing scale will be much worse if remedial action is not taken now.</P>

      <P>The Opposition may do this with the Minister, but they are certainly not going to put it over on me.  I lost two minutes there and I shall get them.  All we have got are general lectures from the Opposition.  Since the Minister and I were put into this Department, all we have got are lectures, day in, day out.  False accusations are what we have in this House from the Opposition. There has been absolutely no effort whatsoever&mdash;not even the sign of effort&mdash;from them to help us with a solution. We shall give the solution in our own way.  We shall give it in a clear and positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When compared with other EEC countries, our postal charges compare favourably.  I am emphasising the statement made last night by the Minister.  It <Col N="1018" /> is very important in this context.  Our prices put us in the middle range.  When account is taken of the standard of service here, our users are getting a fair deal.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again the point made by the Minister last night regarding the effects of the increases in the CPI, which in the case of telephone charges will add 0.06 per cent to the CPI and telecommunications 0.1 per cent&mdash;a total of only 0.16 per cent, or one sixth of 1 per cent.  What on earth are the Opposition talking about?</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully brought up the point of profitability changing in a few years. One would think that the Post Office have been profitable, but Deputy Tully who was a member of the former Government should have remembered the position clearly.  I put the facts before this House tonight and if Deputy Tully accuses me of not giving the facts, let him bring the facts to me.</P>
    <P>One of the grounds on which Deputy Deasy condemned the increases was that he failed to see why, if the services were profitable a few years ago, they could not continue to be so now.  Let me give the facts now for the benefit of the members of the Opposition.  In 1973-74 there was a total deficit of £6.5 million.  In 9 months of 1974-75 there was a deficit of £5.6 million.  In 1975 there was a total deficit of £16.6 million.  In 1976 there was a deficit of £8 million.  These are the facts, and it must be remembered that in every year in which the National Coalition Government were in power we have astronomical increases up to 35 per cent. Here they are with a false face this evening, trying to glibly trick the nation into thinking that we were not doing our job to the high standard we have set for ourselves. I certainly will not take it from them and have no intention of taking it from them inside this House or outside if they so wish.  In this connection, the same Deputy asked if any guarantee could be given that losses will not continue, even if the charges are increased. Of course, no such guarantee can be given.  I do not claim to be in a position to fortell the future, but I would be very <Col N="1019" /> surprised if other revisions of charges did not become necessary from time to time in the Post Office, just as they have taken place and are likely to continue in almost every business in this country and, indeed, throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The main argument put forward against the proposed increases in charges has been that the quality of the service is not of a high standard and, therefore, that the charges should not be increased.  I do not claim that the telephone service is of a high quality.  Its shortcomings, which are not a new phenomenon, are well known but Opposition Deputies have spoken about them as if they could be remedied overnight. The Minister last night gave a quotation from Deputy John Kelly in this House which exactly illustrates the point.  Nobody could seriously propose this.  If Deputy Deasy had read the report of the Post Office Review Group to which he referred and if he had absorbed its contents, he would know that the group examined the causes of the present difficulties and found that they were due primarily to two factors&mdash;underinvestment in the service over a long period and unsuitable organisation.  The group, as the Minister stated here yesterday, gave it as their view that it would take at least five years to bring about a high quality service.  That is a realistic assessment and, as the group pointed out, could not be readily achieved.</P>
    <P>As Deputies generally know, long lead times are an inescapable feature of the development of telephone communications. Sites have to be acquired, buildings erected, exchanges designed, ordered and installed and trunk and local calling networks have to be built up.  To have a high quality telephone service to-day, the necessary plans would have had to be made and action initiated some years ago.  In practice, this was not done and we are now paying the penalty for that and will continue to do for quite some time yet.  The Opposition cannot divest themselves of this responsibility and it is futile for them to criticise the shortcomings of the telephone service as if they had no responsibility for its present <Col N="1020" /> state.</P>
    <P>The simple facts are that enough capital was not made available and investment was not given at the time for those vital factors in the telecommunications service.  They are the people who were in power then.  Where was that investment and where can we see it today? As Deputy John Kelly quoted in this House, if they want us to have all the telephones that are outstanding installed in one week, how can we do it?  The Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government did not make the money available in his Department for the groundwork to give the service that we so eagerly desire to give to this nation to-day.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I will set out briefly what the Government are doing to redress this position.  It will be clear that the first requirement for the development of the telephone service is the availability of the necessary capital.  The telephone service is a capital intensive one and without capital, no real progress can be made.  The Government addressed themselves to this problem and decided to make £650 million available at 1979 prices.  Deputy Deasy said that he saw no evidence that increased sums were, in fact, being made available.  Let me quote a few figures which will, I hope, clear this point once and for all.  The amount of capital made available in 1975 was £45.1 million, in 1976 £50 million, in 1977 £57 million, in 1978 £61 million, in 1979 £75.3 million and this year it is £100 million.  These figures speak for themselves.  The results of the recent increases in the amounts made available are not yet evident because of the time it takes to build up the infrastructure of the service.  Results in the form of improvements in the quality of the STD service should begin to become evident from the end of this year and should gather momentum from the second half of next year onwards, as improvement schemes at present in the pipeline are completed.  I shall not go much further on this point because on Friday next the Estimates will be dealt with in this House and they can be gone into in detail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> Deputy Tully made the point that the additional telephones that the Minister had said were planned to be installed in the period up to 1983 would, in fact, only worsen the service because these extra telephones would be added to an already overloaded system.  That shows clearly how Deputy Tully understands or comprehends this investment.  Surely Deputy Tully, a former Minister in a Government in this House, should understand what we mean when we say that we are now laying the foundation for a high quality service in every district. Surely Deputy Tully can see that this statement that they will only congest the system by 1983 is a false statement and one which should not be made in this House.  Surely he does not think that the millions spent will be wasted on buildings with no instruments in them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy made numerous references to the poor standard of postal service.  He said that frequently there were letters in the newspapers complaining about the service provided by the Department.  In the last four weeks monitoring of the postal service has shown that over 80 per cent of first-class letters are being delivered by the first working day after posting, and 98 per cent by the second working day.  Taking into account the fact that over one million letters a day are handled by the Department this adds up to a very high standard of service.  The standard aimed at is 90 per cent delivered by the first working day after posting and the balance on the second working day. The standard aimed at for the parcel service is 95 per cent delivered by the second working day.  Recent returns show that a 93 per cent rate is being achieved.  I appreciate the efforts of the people in the postal service to bring those figures to the point they are at now and we look forward to their co-operation to make it an even more fascinating figure and bring it to the highest record ever witnessed in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not the only administrators <Col N="1023" /> having difficulties with the postal service as is often quoted in this House.  A recent authoritative report on the Inner London postal service found that complaints about the deterioration of the London letter service were fully justified, and added that there was no doubt that the deterioration had significantly impaired the efficiency of the business community in Inner London.</P>
    <P>They also said that the service in certain districts has been particularly poor. We are far better than that.  Yet the Opposition come here and ridicule those working diligently to give the people the service they expect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy and Deputy Tully referred to staff relations in the Department and to the postal strike last year.  Deputy Deasy referred to recent newspaper headlines about poor morale in the Department which was attributed, he said, to low pay.  For obvious reasons I do not want to comment on these remarks at present but I want to point out that everything possible is being done to improve the staff relations climate within the Department. The Minister and I have devoted a lot of our time to personal matters because the job in the Post Office is one of managing people and we shall continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiation structures have been overhauled in recent years in consultation with staff organisations.  Those at present available provide means by which problems over pay and other matters can be resolved in a reasonable way without industrial strife.  Unfortunately, to judge from recent reports in the <Col N="1024" /> media, there seems to be a disposition in certain quarters towards disruption of the public service as an alternative to the observance of freely negotiated agreements. Our great Taoiseach has called for a year of industrial peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Post Office are concerned, industrial peace and staff co-operation would enable us to make significant progress at last in a modernisation of the Department's service, and particularly in developing the telephone system.  No matter what resources the Government make available, progress will not be achieved without the commitment and co-operation of all the Department's staff.</P>
      <P>The public sector generally, including the Post Office, had bad press in the industrial relations area in recent years. There seems to be a body of opinion abroad that public enterprises are peopled with mindless militants and antediluvian management and that the public sector cannot deliver an efficient service to the public.  I have made my point on this matter in an unequivocal way before the people of the nation here tonight.</P>
      <P>I do not believe for a moment that this is the case.  The Post Office are capable of doing a good job and since I became Minister I have not met anybody who contended otherwise.  Impressions and intentions are fine in themselves but they are no substitute for actual performance. This year we had an opportunity to give a lie to the doubters who say we cannot do the job.  Let me repeat, the Government have provided the resources and it is up to management and staff working in harmony to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening Deputy Deasy referred to the impersonal nature of the response, it was claimed, often received when complaints were made about the telephone service.  It is important for the House and the users of the telephone service to understand clearly that difficulties are encountered which are not the fault of the operator.  Every effort is being made to <Col N="1025" /> improve not only the technical facilities available to the operators, but also the working conditions of the operators.</P>
    <P>I visited a number of exchanges around the country.  I saw the remnants of the embargo imposed by the Coalition when they were in office.  Operators were frustrated because they could not give a better telephone service.  I wish I could tell every operator tomorrow to move into new quarters, with new technological equipment and a better environment in which to work.  That will not be done tomorrow, but I can assure them it will be done before we leave office, before the next general election, because this Government have committed themselves to an investment of £650 million in a better telephone service.  We will give the operators proper working conditions so that they will be able to provide a better service, and we make no apology to any man, woman or child for so doing.  I say that to Deputy Deasy, Fine Gael spokesman, and Deputy Tully, who seems to have taken over the role on the Labour side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>A question was raised last night about the National Prices Commission and Deputy Deasy complained that the proposed increases had not been submitted to them in what he claimed was the normal way.  It is not correct to say or to imply that it is customary to consult the National Prices Commission in regard to increases in Post Office charges.  The Prices Acts do not apply to Post Office charges and the only occasion on which the commission were consulted was in October 1975 when they were given an opportunity of expressing their views on proposed increases from 1 January 1976.  Deputy Tully should be aware of that.  The commission explained that it was not possible in the limited time <Col N="1027" /> available to examine the proposals.  They suggested, with an eye to future increases, that a consultancy study should be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs invited the commission to have a consultancy study made, the report of which was published by the NPC as Occasional Paper No. 21 in December 1976.  The main conclusions of the consultants were that larger and more frequent increases in charges were necessary if deficits were to be avoided on Post Office services and that future increases should aim at a gradual return to a position where losses would be eliminated.  The present increases will not bring about a surplus in the Post Office services.  There is no good reason why the commission should have been consulted about them.  Moreover, it is a matter for the Government to decide how much, if any, of the cost of the service should be borne by taxation and it would appear to me to be wrong in principle to ask the NPC for advice on such a question.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an allegation made at the beginning of this debate.  I am not sure how much time I have left to speak.</P>

I would ask Deputy Enright to say clearly how he would propose to deal with the excessive deficits we have had in the Department.  I do not want any presumptuous statements by him or Deputy Deasy.  I see a Deputy from Kerry and I can anticipate what will be said because I can see the shade of the paper in front of him.

Many companies who may have contemplated taking on additional staff cannot do so now because they must tighten their belts. After the budget was introduced I warned the Minister how unwise it would be to implement the increases outlined.  I did not say there would be closures but I warned the Minister that the increasing of costs in the postal and telecommunications services could lead to job losses.</P>

      <P>The Minister at the Fianna Fáil youth conference in Limerick pointed to the difficulties being experienced by many firms.  Every item of increased cost at present is dangerous and damaging for many firms.  Never before were so many native Irish industries going through such a period of enormous difficulties and unprecedented pressures from all sides.  Many of those firms are not making a profit, they are <Col N="1030" /> barely breaking even, and a good number of them are suffering losses.  Why did the Minister decide on an increase of 25 per cent in postal charges and an increase of 20 per cent in telecommunications charges?  The cost of posting a letter will be going up by 3p and one must take into consideration the additional weekly cost that will mean in industries. The same applies to the increase in the cost of telephone calls.  One can appreciate the difficulties small concerns will experience after July.</P>

      <P>Industries, farmers and private individuals who need these services will be affected by the increases. The Government Information Services in a statement issued for publication on 17 May announcing the 25 per cent increase in postal charges and the 20 per cent increase in telecommunications charges put forward a number of interesting points.  The Minister of State dealt with some figures earlier but the GIS statement was to the effect that in 1973-74 there was a deficit of £6.5 million which increased to £16.6 million in 1975.  That figure was reduced to £8 million in 1976 and, according to the GIS statement, the main reason for the deterioration in the postal services financial position from a small surplus in 1977 to an estimated deficit of £14 million in 1980 was pay increases.</P>

      <P>In August 1979 there were increases in the charges of 20 per cent.  The cost of a stamp was increased by 2p and in July it will be increased from 12p to 15p, an increase of approximately 50 per cent in that short space of time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Wage increases are not to blame for these increases because they were less than the amount the Minister will collect from these charges.  The National Prices Commission should be considered in relation to these charges, particularly in view of the fact that in August 1979 those charges were increased across the board by 20 per cent and that from July it is intended to raise them by 25 per cent.  This is a matter of serious concern for everyone: in less than a year to have two increases one of 20 per cent in August and 25 per cent in July.  If the Government are allowing increases of that magnitude it is time someone with a better sense of understanding was consulted in regard to them.  The country is going through economic difficulty at present and a lot of firms are experiencing this difficulty.</P>
      <P>For you to allow increases of that magnitude without having to refer to anyone must be called into question, Minister.  There is no way you are in touch with reality.</P>

To proceed in the manner in which the Minister and Government are the sole judges of the magnitude of their increases is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prices Commission are a widely constituted body and have looked into the workings of the Department before. Even though the Act does not apply to the Post Office in this instance, to try and bring about a semblance of reality to the situation the matter should go before the Commission for consideration and recommendation.  This matter will have serious and widespread repercussions and I am concerned about it.  You stated in regard to the postal service that there has been no growth in traffic.  If you continue <Col N="1034" /> with price increases that situation will continue and if prices continue to rise you will face a situation where there will be a danger of a drop in traffic in the postal service.  It is important to have a postal service that is on a par with the very best in Europe and one that is expanding. Continued price increases could prove very dangerous in the long run.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to consider this matter seriously and investigate it thoroughly because I am very worried about it at present.  I hope we will see a growth in traffic and, Minister, are you not worried that there is no growth?  I put it to you&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be an expansion in postal traffic and that the postal service will grow.  There is no reason why it should not.  We have an expanding population and it is logical to assume that there will be an expanding postal service.  I hope the Government are considering why there has been no growth.  They should be endeavouring to ensure that there is growth.  However, if they continue with increases and charges of this magnitude there will not be growth.  They are placing the postal service in an inviduous situation and one that is bound to cause concern.  The Government should be considering these things at present.  They are of enormous importance and will have effects on our economic development and growth in the future.</P>
      <P>The reason for putting down the motion is that it is important that somebody calls attention to increases of this nature and that, if they are allowed to continue unabated and someone does not shout stop, the Minister and his Department may feel they can continue on as they have been doing since last August.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the matter of increases granted in regard to subscribers using coin boxes would be looked into.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on this on Friday.  On 3 July 1979 the former Minister, Deputy Faulkner, then in charge of Posts and Telegraphs said, when dealing with the capital sums required, that the Government recognised that this called for an accelerated level of expenditure.  Part of the functions of the new telecommunications body, he said, would be to develop appropriate financing arrangements for the accelerated programme but in the meantime the Exchequer would make available the sums required, estimated at up to £100 million for 1980.</P>
      <P>What is the position in regard to the expenditure of £650 million to which the present Minister refers?  What proportion of that will be met from capital costs?  I appreciate that the Minister will not be in a position to reply to this debate this evening, but I would hope that on Friday he would elaborate on how he will break down this figure as between capital costs, interest costs and so on.</P>

      <P>The increases sought at this time are excessive, are far beyond the capacity of many small businesses, firms and industries to pay.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this motion has served a very useful purpose.  I thank the Chair for his indulgence in allowing us to stray from the exact content at times.  A motion like this of outright condemnation of price increases often can turn out to be a dull affair with a purely negative <Col N="1037" /> approach, one side contending the whole matter is black and the other side white. This has not been the case.  Despite the Minister of State's assertion that we have not offered any alternatives or any reasoned argument as to how these increases could be avoided, the contrary is the truth.  This has been a constructive debate.  Indeed, as a result, the Minister may well take the type of action which will bring about an improvement in the postal and telephone services.  For too long people have been burying their heads in the sand in this matter.  Let us face the fact that our telephone system is diabolical, that, despite all the promises of the past three years, it has worsened. Anybody can so ascertain by going out into the street and questioning the public, when they will discover that matters are worse now than they have been ever.</P>
      <P>I want to correct a few mis-statements made in the course of replying to my introductory remarks last evening.  I have been accused of making a false statement to the effect that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs made a profit in 1977.  I did not make that statement.  I said that the postal services showed a slight profit in 1977, and I was merely quoting from the Minister's statement of 16 May last.  Secondly, there appears to be a contradiction between the figures presented by the Minister here last evening and those presented by the Taoiseach earlier in the day, in that the effect on the consumer price index would be an increase of .16 per cent according to the Minister while the Taoiseach told us here yesterday afternoon that the increase was actually .20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that did annoy me, justifiably, was the manner in which statements I made about the quality of the telephone and postal services were misconstrued as indicating that I was attacking the staff.  Indeed phrases such as &ldquo;ridiculing the staff&rdquo; have been used by Deputy Killilea and the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, contended that I accused the staff of being discourteous.  I never used such phrases.  I said there is a highly impersonal relationship between the people <Col N="1038" /> who operate the telephone service and the public.  I fail to see how anybody could dispute that fact.  In my remarks last evening I outlined to the Minister how these matters could be rectified.  I went to great pains to explain that the telephone service will have to deal directly with the public, and not in a secondhand manner by way of correspondence and telephone calls.  What we need is a man-to-man or woman-to-woman confrontation, dealing directly with the public.  I hope the Minister will take heed of my advice on that issue.  A lot of the dissatisfaction felt by the public, indeed a lot of the frustration felt by the staff, particularly within the telephone section of the Department, is due to the impersonal nature of their contact with one another. The sooner that situation is rectified the better.</P>
    <P>I will come back to the real issue of how to improve the service without increasing the charges.  Tonight, Deputy Killilea said that it was when the National Coalition Government were in office that the problems were created.  He said there was under-investment in the service during that period and that that had caused the problems we are facing today.  He said that the other cause of the problems we are facing today was poor internal organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some figures in front of me which will contradict the statements made by the Minister of State.  In 1971/72, the capital investment by the then Fianna Fáil Government in the telephone system was £11 million.  In 1970/71, it was £9 million; in 1969/70 it was £7 million.  During the term of the National Coalition that investment varied from £44 million to £48 million. These figures speak for themselves.  The years of under-investment were the 16 years of continuous Fianna Fáil Government, from 1957 to 1973.</P>

      <P>That kind of investment of £7 million per annum ten years ago meant that all that could be done was to keep the service ticking over, and ticking over very badly at that.  There were not any new programmes for replacement of antiquated equipment.  The first real attempt to replace obsolete equipment was made during the term of the National Coalition, with annual investments in the order of £44 million, £46 million, £48 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The result is that we have the lowest number of telephones per thousand of the population in Europe.  I will give the statistics.  Per thousand of the population, the Federal German Republic has 374; France 293; Italy 285; the Netherlands 422; Belgium 313; Luxembourg 522; the UK 415; Denmark 493; and we are down at the bottom of the league with 163.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister of State would lay the blame for that on the four years of National Coalition Government when the investment was a multiple of the investment by previous Fianna Fáil Governments, and a major multiple in many cases.</P>
      <P>These new increases have given rise to a situation in which many people will regard a telephone as a luxury.  I particularly refer to people who might have qualified for the telephone rental subsidy scheme if they could afford the installation fee which has been increased from £60 to £100.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment this grave matter of cutbacks in the Employment Incentive Scheme.  It has been repeated by many people on the Government side as well as the Opposition side of the House in this Dáil and the last Dáil that the central economic challenge facing the country is the creation of full employment, the reduction of unemployment and the creation of meaningful jobs.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister for Labour, Deputy Michael O'Leary, introduced the employment incentive scheme which has proved to be the single biggest creator of meaningful employment of any Government scheme ever introduced.  Jobs created under the Employment Incentive Scheme are meaningful jobs in the private sector.  The Minister has indicated that there is an 80 per cent placement after the six months payment of the Employment Incentive Premium has elapsed.  There are other schemes which have been introduced by the Minister, some of which have stayed and others have gone.  The aggregate of all these schemes does not come near the total number of jobs created in any one year by the Employment Incentive Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Question Time today the Minister for Labour indicated that there would be a further cutback in the Employment Incentive Scheme.  I use the word further advisedly because the 20 per cent subsidy was fixed by Deputy Michael O'Leary in 1977 and it has not been increased since despite roaring inflation. By keeping it at £20 a week this year on last year's figures alone this means an effective cutback in the region of 16 per cent whatever the rate of inflation is.  The Minister said today that he is discontinuing the Employment Incentive Scheme to the bank and insurance sector.  It may well be that the motivation for this decision, other than the financial problems which the Government are coping with, is the point made by Deputy Horgan when he queried whether or not the inclusion <Col N="1046" /> of the bank and insurance sector by the Minister was merely contributing to increasing their excessive profits.  Of course that would be the concern of this House if in part that was the effect of the extension of the employment incentive scheme to the banking sector.  If the Government wished to control the profits of the banks and the insurance companies this House would not be averse to it.</P>
    <P>This House must be dedicated to meeting the challenge of job creation. Nobody here has to be told that the unemployment register has again taken an upward swing and that the portents for the rest of the year are extremely grave. The spectre of 100,000 people again unemployed haunts the country, yet the scheme that created so many jobs was not expanded to meet inflation and is now afflicted with another cutback by the Government.  This, under a Government that promised to give full employment within four years.  I wish the Government were living up to their commitment. If the Government followed sounder and saner economic policies we would not be in this situation of having 100,000 people unemployed and we would be approaching an unemployment level of 4 per cent, which economists say is equivalent to full employment.</P>
    <P>The decision wheedled out of the Minister is a shameful decision by a government who have bankrupted themselves with anti-social largesse mainly to the very wealthy.  Millions of pounds have been spent compensating the investors in the Irish Trust Bank.  Millions have been squandered in abolishing wealth tax and in abolishing rates not just on domestic dwellings, which is fair, but on mansions and castles throughout the country while at the same time local authority rents were increased.</P>
    <P>There are no extra funds in the kitty for job creation.  If the Minister were motivated by a desire to control the profits of the banks and the insurance companies he might be congratulated here, but that is not what he said in his reply today when he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> Up to the week ended 28 March, 1980 a total of £490,986 has been paid under the employment incentive scheme in respect of the additional employment of 1,320 workers in the banking and insurance sector.</P>
    <P>One thousand three hundred and twenty jobs were created for £490,000.  That is less than what the IDA say it costs to create a job.  In his reply today the Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the present economic and financial situation, and the need to achieve savings in public expenditure, I have notified participating firms that it is not possible to continue payment of premia to banks and insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister singles out banks and insurance companies in the hope that he will get away with it by allowing it to be understood that they are trying to control the profits of banks and insurance companies.  All the Minister and the Government are trying to do is penny pinch here and there to try to save themselves from bankruptcy which they have brought upon themselves and the country. It is a shame that this Government have totally abdicated on their promise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very hard to reply to a budget speech in four minutes.  Deputy Mitchell as usual is trying to ride about three horses in the House and trying to distort the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was applied and extended to the services sector without any exclusions in September, 1977.  That was to the hotel, catering and building industry. Each and every service and scheme funded from public funds is under continuous <Col N="1048" /> review in the course of day-to-day administration.  The case for the inclusion or exclusion of the banks and insurance industries has been raised on a number of occasions in my Department, and again only last month.  This last review arose particularly out of the administration of the supplementary premiums scheme for which the moneys were made available from the Employment Guarantee Fund set up under the national understanding.  It seemed to me that there was greater need for the application of these moneys and the moneys provided by the State for the basic scheme to manufacturing and service industries such as the hotel and catering industry rather than to banking and insurance.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier to-day, I considered that the banking and insurance businesses were well equipped to finance their own recruitment and were clearly in a separate category in the risk area. Nobody would suggest that their need of State aid in the sense of the employment incentive scheme is as great as that of other sectors and I am sure that the amounts they receive under that scheme would be of much less significance to them in the context of their total profits. The premium payments would have much greater significance for many of our manufacturing and services sector industries.</P>
    <P>I was asked to-day how much was paid to banking and insurance companies under the scheme in 1979.  I have now got the figure.  It was £292,705 which bears out the point I was making that it is relatively insignificant against the total profits of the whole banking and insurance systems.  It is relevant to say that I have had no representations in the matter from any bank or insurance company.  I was further asked what were the estimated savings in the present year by the exclusion of the banking and insurance businesses.  It would be very difficult to give any estimate, because there is no assurance that recruitment by the banks and insurance companies will continue at the same rate as last year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy obviously mixed his <Col N="1049" /> schemes.  The Employment Incentive Scheme applied for full time permanent jobs, so there can be no question of placement after any length of time.  The scheme the Deputy was referring to must have been the work experience programme which I introduced which has an 80 per cent placement.  It is a question of applying money where it is most needed for job creation.  I do not understand how any Deputy can make the statements made by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>Originally this scheme applied only to manufacturing industry.  Particularly from the young person's point of view, as the records will show its extension to the services sector, the hotel, catering <Col N="1050" /> and building sector, was of marked significance where youth employment was concerned.  As we all know, in recent years there have been many opportunities for young people in the services sector.  The present rate of premium for the Employment Incentive Scheme is £20 and £14 which are the base levels, but in certain cases with the assistance of the Employment Guarantee Fund these figures go to £40 and £34 up to 30 June. That is the position.  The Deputy was riding a number of horses in the wide ranging speech he made.  Obviously I have no time at my disposal to comment on many of the extraneous points made by him.</P>

The directive has no implementation deadlines the reason being that the EEC Council must first lay down limit values and quality objectives for listed substances.  Commission proposals involving the first four of the many substances covered by the directive are at present being discussed at working party level and neither limit values nor quality objectives have yet been set.</P>

      <P>The following is the position <Col N="923" /> with regard to implementation of the directives referred to by the Deputy: (i) The Council directive concerning the methods of measurement and frequencies of sampling and analysis of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water in the member state was adopted on 9 October 1979 and it must be implemented by 11 October 1981. The measures necessary for its implementation are at present under consideration; (ii) Regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972 have been drafted to implement the directive relating to the lead content of petrol which will come into operation on 1 January 1981.  Consultations on the draft regulations are in progress with the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism; (iii) The implementation of the directive in relation to the driver-perceived noise level of wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors is a matter for the Department of Agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture has made regulations to implement the directive; (iv) As titanium dioxide is not manufactured in this country at the present time it was not considered necessary to make specific regulations to implement this directive.  The EEC Commission have been informed accordingly and have accepted the position; (v) Regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972 have been drafted to implement the Directive on Toxic and Dangerous Waste.  Difficulties have arisen in Ireland and in other member states in formulating an exact definition of such wastes.  The problem is at present being considered by the Commission in association with the member states.</P>

      <P>The requirement that claimants to unemployment benefit and assistance must attend at a local office or other signing centre to sign the register as evidence of unemployment is governed by regulations which require attendance on every working day but permit arrangements for less frequent signing for persons living more than two miles away or in other exceptional circumstances. Departmental policy in implementing the regulations is based on the minimum attendance necessary consistent with maintaining proper control of claims while at the same time taking account of any hardship which might be caused to claimants.</P>
      <P>The frequency of signing depends on the distance a claimant lives from an exchange or local office.  Generally speaking, daily attendance is required of persons living within a two-mile radius.  All other claimants within a range of six miles attend either once or twice a week. However, whenever special factors occur, such as a sudden local increase in the live register which would be likely to cause hardship in queueing or to impair the service, authorisation is given for a relaxation in the general signing arrangements as local circumstances require.  I might mention here that in the case of persons over 65 who were required to attend only once a week I recently arranged that they should be given the option of attending once every four weeks.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements generally operate in a satisfactory and equitable manner.</P>
