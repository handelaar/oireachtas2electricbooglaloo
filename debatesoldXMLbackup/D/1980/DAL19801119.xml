      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 41 and 42, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  one of those members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of An Chomhairle Oiliúna;</P>
      <P>(g)  two of those members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Irish Vocational Education Association;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>When we discussed this Bill on Committee Stage, an amendment put down in my name to this effect was discussed by the House and withdrawn by me to give the Minister an opportunity to consider it again between then and Report Stage. I am very sorry to see he has not accepted the logic of my arguments on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is indicating acceptance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>If my assumptions were fully justified, I do not see the point of <Col N="677" /> the Minister's interruption.  In relation to what the Minister said at that time &mdash; that he would give an assurance that he would be appointing somebody from the Irish Vocational Education Association and therefore that the query I was raising and the structural problem I was identifying did not exist as far as he was concerned &mdash; after some consideration, I put down the amendment again for Report Stage. I have done so because there is a critical difference between what the Minister is proposing and what I am proposing.  I suspect there are two critical differences.</P>
      <P>First, I am proposing two members from the Irish Vocational Education Association; up to now the Minister has not given any indication that he intends to appoint more than one.  The second difference, and it is much more critical, is that anybody from the IVEA who reaches the governing body of this institution <i>via</i> the ministerial nod will not necessarily be the nominee of the IVEA itself.  The appointment will be a ministerial one, carried out by the Minister within whatever constraints and sense of opportunities habitually operate.  This is in marked contrast to the method of nomination in relation to the other bodies specified under this section, not least AnCO whose own nominees are effectively ratified and appointed by the Minister. I take it that even in these cases the Minister might have the opportunity to refuse to ratify or to nominate somebody who was totally inappropriate, but I do not see that possibility arising in the ordinary course of events.</P>
      <P>My amendment is designed to give the IVEA a strong voice on the governing body of the institution and to do it by writing into the statutes governing the creation of the governing body a specific right of nomination for the IVEA.  The Minister's assurances are welcome in so far as they go but they do not go far enough.  The Minister would not lose anything but the governing body would gain substantially if the amendment were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we went into the suggested amendment in reasonable detail and I indicated my <Col N="678" /> thinking to the House on that occasion. I stated then and I reiterate now that I realise that the Deputy tabled this amendment because of his appreciation of the work done by the Irish Vocational Education Association in the whole field to which these trainee teachers are related specifically.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out at the time there are two parts of the Bill whereby members of the IVEA may be selected to be on the governing body and, consequently, to represent their association.  These are section 5, sub-section (4), (a) and section 5, sub-section (4), (i).  I hope that the Deputy was not implying that while he has admiration for the IVEA in general, that admiration is selective in any way.  I say this because he indicated that he feared that if the matter were left to the Minister's choice and if he were to select someone from the association, it might be someone who was undesirable in some way.  I would not restrict my admiration to any specific member of the association. Anybody who is working and giving service in that field would be a worthy representative of the association in this instance.</P>
      <P>If I were to accept that the composition of the sections of the Bill was such as to leave it open to exclude the IVEA, I would accept the amendment but there is no doubt in my mind as to there being plenty of scope in the Bill as it stands for selecting people from the association for the governing body.  I have given the House an assurance of my intention to select people from the association for representation.  Deputy Horgan made the point that there might be only one or two persons left.  The wording of the Bill does not preclude me from nominating three members of the IVEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed in the Minister's response.  The points he made were essentially debating points which did not touch the core of the argument in respect of this amendment.  In order that there not be any misunderstanding, I would stress that the purpose of my amendment was not merely to express appreciation of the work done by the IVEA and by the organisations and <Col N="679" /> schools associated with that organisation. Though that appreciation is worthwhile, my amendment is an expression of a structural reality in the field of education in general and especially of the nature of the subjects which are to be taught by the people who will graduate from Thomond College.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to put words in my mouth by suggesting that I considered as undesirable his right of appointing anybody to the IVEA.  From my point of view it would be more accurate to say that I appreciate that right in the case of the IVEA as in the case of any of the other organisations, institutions or bodies who are named in connection with the governing body but that it is less desirable that the Minister should nominate than that the body or organisation concerned should nominate.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the Minister will not choose anybody unsuitable from the ranks of the association.  That is not what is at issue.  Neither is the issue the number who may be selected.  The question is whether the associations themselves should have the right to nominate.  I fail entirely to understand why the IVEA in relation to Thomond College and to this sector of the educational system should be denied the right to nominate members. I find it all the more extraordinary because AnCO &mdash; and this was admitted by the Minister on Committee Stage &mdash; who are to some degree a subsidiary body, have written into this Bill a right of nomination to the governing body of the new college whereas the IVEA which by any standards would be the most suitable umbrella organisation for nomination purposes is excluded and may only come in on the Minister's say-so or at his whim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to go into much detail about the IVEA.  The Minister is well aware of their past, of their present and of their potential.  In addition, many members of the Minister's party throughout the country are members of the IVEA and are playing a full part in the running and organisation of that association, <Col N="680" /> an association whose educational policy is closer to that of the Labour Party and to the recently-expressed Fine Gael policy in many respects than to the policy of the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>However, what we are talking about is not basically a party matter.  The association are a non-party organisation.  They are an educational association and their record in terms of creative thinking and constructive criticism of our educational system is very good.  They have a particular role to play in the government of Thomond College and for that reason I urge the Minister to reconsider the amendment and to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 12, to delete &ldquo;staff&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;management, staff and students&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan on Committee Stage asked for this.  As it was not formally down by him as an amendment he asked me to consider it on Report Stage.  I am now moving this amendment.  When we were debating the National Council for Education Awards Act it was mentioned in a different context, namely &ldquo;the management, staff and students of any institution to which the Act applies&rdquo;.  In this Bill it is &ldquo;any college or body referred to in the said subsection (4)&rdquo; of this section, that is the list of nominating or recommending bodies.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is that the Minister before selecting his seven nominees to the governing body would be bound to have regard to the extent to which the staff or management of any college or body referred to in subsection (4) should be represented on the governing body.  As the House knows the following colleges or bodies are mentioned:</P>
      <P>Thomond, The staff and students are already substantially represented by definition in subparagraphs (b), (c), and (d).</P>
      <P>National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  The governing body, that is the management of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, have the right to nominate three members.</P>
      <P>An Comhairle Oiliúna, as we have been discussing on Deputy Horgan's amendment, two members.</P>
      <P>A university in the State or a constituent college or recognised college of a university in the State.  One governing body member is to be a member of the staff of the university.</P>
      <P>Representation by the management of the university on the governing body is hardly necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> The College of Education for primary teachers.  The staff only have been named as essential representatives.</P>
    <P>Bodies representative of the interest of second level education.</P>
    <P>That came up for discussion under Deputy Horgan's amendment already, I indicated, when we were discussing that amendment, that I have certain powers which would possibly meet Deputy Horgan's amendment.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment. I am sorry the Minister did not go as far in the earlier amendment as he has in this one.  It improves the Bill.  Even though its practical effect may be limited it is an expression of goodwill which will be welcomed by all the interests involved.</P>

    <Title>Thomond College of Education, Limerick, Bill, 1980: Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a great debate on this Bill.  The reason for that is that we had such an in-depth discussion on the NIHE Bill that to go over the same ground again on this Bill would be unnecessary.  That does not mean to say that this Bill is unimportant or that the establishment of the college on a statutory basis is unimportant.  That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very important move by the State <Col N="685" /> and has the full support of Fine Gael and, to my knowledge, all Members of the House.  Thomond College has a very important role to play in our educational system.  It will be involved not only in the education to degree level of physical education teachers but also in other specialist disciplines.  It represents a great leap forward in areas where we have not to date put enough emphasis.  We hope that the present Government will provide the necessary resources and funds to allow the college to expand and meet targets of investment and expansion, especially in relation to student population.</P>
    <P>In our opinion there are some defects in the Bill.  For instance, I am sorry that the college will not be allowed to grant certificates and diplomas.  This is a weakness in the Bill which could have been rectified but unfortunately the Minister was not moved to introduce an amendment which, far from damaging the Bill, would have improved it substantially.</P>
    <P>We differed, as we did on the two previous Bills, regarding the composition of the governing body and we could have discussed this matter <i>ad nauseam</i>.  By and large the Minister has improved the composition of this governing body <i>vis-à-vis</i> the governing body of the NIHE and has adopted a more liberal attitude.</P>
    <P>Because of a technical procedure in the House I was not able to speak on Deputy Horgan's amendment in relation to the IVEA, but we supported it in the Division Lobby and it would have had my full support on the floor of the House.  While the graduates of Thomond College would not be exclusively involved in the vocational sector, I imagine that a large proportion of graduates would go into that sector.  However, I would hope that they would also go into other sectors such as community and secondary schools where there is a great need for a widening of the curricula.  Because of the historical division there is a very good argument for allowing the IVEA to be automatically represented by their own nomination on the governing body.</P>
    <P>The structure of the Bill is similar to that dealing with the NIHE.  I am fairly satisfied that the Bill achieves its objective. <Col N="686" /> It only remains for me to wish the director, staff and governing body every success in their future involvement in this area of education.  I am pleased to note that the dispute between the students and the college has been resolved, and I had some part to play in the resolution of that dispute.  Right was not on any one side in this unfortunate dispute.  I believe that the final part I examination should have been held at second year and not postponed or deferred.  That was a weakness on the part of the college authorities.</P>

      <P>The students should not have pursued such an acrimonious dispute because of its implications for the authorities and the NCEA.  I am very glad the dispute has been resolved.  I wish the Bill well and to a certain extent I congratulate the Minister for its introduction and the manner in which he steered it through the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The society in which we live is dominated by many things, not least by status, and it is a sad fact of life in our educational system that for many years some of the subjects in which teachers are now to be trained in Thomond College have suffered a lessening of status in schools and in third level institutions. It seems to be the fact that since our Republican Constitution forbids the conferring or acceptance of titles of honour educational distinctions and qualifications are effectively one of the most sought-after forms of status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By conferring the status of a fully-fledged third level institution on Thomond College and by giving the teachers trained by that college the status of degree holders under the National Council for Educational Awards, this Bill will at least take the first step towards restoring those subjects.  It will give the men who teach those subjects and the young men and women who will learn thém something of the status they will need in Irish society if we are to produce well-rounded, well-educated individuals in the <Col N="687" /> years ahead.  The remainder of the job of supplying that status will be done on the ground by the college itself and by the men and women it produces to teach these various disciplines.  On all sides of the House we wish the college well and say that its institution did not come a moment too soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasant duty to thank Deputies opposite for their help in getting through all Stages of this Bill.  Deputy E. Collins said that the debate was somewhat thinner than it might have been because we had combed fairly tightly the clauses in the Bills setting up the colleges in Limerick and Dublin, and this is true.  Nevertheless, the discussions on this Bill were helpful and clarified many of the issues involved in the setting up on a statutory basis of Thomond College.</P>
      <P>I deliberately chose to deal step by step with higher education legislation and I will follow the same course in the matter of the universities Bills.  I hope in the very near future to have before the House the Bill for the new National University of Dublin, followed by Cork, Galway and Maynooth.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and assure Deputy E. Collins, who raised the matter, that the Government are committed to provide the resources in this and in every other field of education, particularly at third level.  It would be totally illogical to provide for the establishment in Ireland of some of the most sophisticated industries without providing expertise in education to back the establishment of those industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that Deputy E. Collins made about the non-provision of certificates and diplomas in Thomond was adequately dealt with earlier in the debate on the Bill and Deputy Horgan, in his contribution, pointed out the long history of the ambition of the various teachers' organisations to have an all-graduate profession.  It is in that context that as of now only degrees are and will be awarded in Thomond.  It was highly desirable that we have an all-graduate profession.  Some recent statistic I saw was that the Inner London <Col N="688" /> Education Authority has a teacher force of which 50 per cent are graduates and that is the highest percentage on Great Britain.  So we are considerably in advance of that and this Bill will aid in that field.  I am not saying that the provision of, say, certificates whether of one year or two years' duration, or diplomas later on, will not be made.  What we are dealing with here is the qualification necessary to be registered as a teacher and therefore it is very important to nail our colours to the graduate mast.  Indeed Deputy Horgan in his final contribution indicated that it was important from the point of view of the provision of status for the particular areas of physical education and the specialist education subjects.</P>
    <P>I indicated also in the course of the discussion that it was my ambition to get under way an expanded programme of training so that the specialist teachers will be available in all the schools as was mentioned by Deputy Collins.  Deputy Horgan made reference to the structural reality of the vocational education system where the specialist teachers were mainly employed and are still mainly employed but not exclusively.  I would like to refer to one of the problems about the Irish Vocational Education Association and that is the problem of being able to provide personnel.  They are so busy and the committees are so small.  I had a discussion with Deputy Boland on this a couple of years ago.  The good people are so busy in and about vocational education that it is difficult for them to make time for added committees and added duties. There may be a way we can solve that but we cannot do that immediately.</P>

      <P>The London Convention included dumping and deliberate disposal not only of wastes and other matter from the vessels and aircraft or platforms but it also includes the dumping of the vessel itself or the platform or the aircraft.

      <P>In page 3, after line 16, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`territorial seas of the State' means the territorial seas of the State for the purposes of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, and the internal waters of the State for the purposes of that Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This simply means that under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, there is a three-mile limit from the base line and it did not include the internal waters, say, from the Aran Islands towards the coastline <Col N="690" /> and the estuarial waters.  This makes it possible for us to have jurisdiction over the three-mile limit from the base line outwards plus the internal waters between the base line and the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would include the tidal waters right up the estuaries.  On the west coast, north-west coast and south coast the base line is a line drawn and agreed and it does not include the sea between the islands and the land and this extends jurisdiction to cover all waters from the tidal limits out as far as three miles beyond the base line.</P>

      <P>By way of explanation, Deputy Corish and Deputy Keating are not in the House but they raised this matter on Second Stage.  This means in effect that somebody prosecuted under this Bill cannot use it as a defence to say that they were instructed to do so by their employer. The removal of this section means that this can no longer be done.  In practice if the amendment were not made at this time a person who proved that he had acted on the instructions of an employer could not be prosecuted.  In deference to what was said by Deputy Corish and particularly by Deputy Keating I have agreed to remove this section in its entirety.  It makes it a stronger Bill and I would like to thank Deputy Keating for raising the matter.</P>

I am glad to learn that they are now included.  In regard to those countries could the Minister tell me what is their standard territorial waters limit? We talk here about the territorial seas of our State.  Can the Minister tell me what are the territorial limits of the 12 or 44 signatories in question?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Law of the Sea Conferences of 1958 and 1960 failed to agree on the limits.  But I understand that the present Law of the Sea Conference, not yet concluded, has been considering the extension of the territorial seas to a 12-mile limit.  Approximately <Col N="692" /> 76 states have to date claimed this limit of 12 nautical miles as against three.  A draft Council resolution in 1979 of the member states of the European Economic Community suggested that they might extend their territorial limit to 12 miles as well.  But, as far as we are concerned, that has not yet taken place. The majority of the EEC states, including Ireland and the United Kingdom, have a three-mile territorial sea limit.  Italy and France have already claimed a 12-mile limit.  It is expected that, after the present Law of the Sea Conference is concluded it might be necessary to claim a 12-mile limit.  But, as things stand.  Italy and France are the only two countries of the nine EEC countries that have claimed the 12 miles territorial limit.  Ours is still three.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(8)  In relation to the application of this Act to substances, devices, apparatus and products to which the Nuclear Energy (An Board Fuinnimh Núicléigh) Act, 1971, or any order under section 6 thereof applies&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  references in this section (other than in this subsection) and in sections 2 (3) (b) and 5 (1) of this Act to the Minister shall be construed as references to the Minister for Energy and to An Board Fuinnimh Núcléigh as his agent, and.</P>

      <P>I was surprised that there was not more specific reference in the original Bill to the danger of nuclear discharge or dumping.  I am glad to see that the amendments make provision for such control.  How effective are An Bord Fuinnimh Núicléigh?  What status have they and what authority do they have?  What work have they carried out in the past and what work does the Minister envisage them carrying out in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Deputy should raise these matters on these amendments.  This Bill covers all dumping, including low level radioactive waste but because the Minister for Energy and the Nuclear Energy Board would have the expertise and manpower to deal with matters connected with radioactive waste it has been decided that we should extend the licensing powers of this Bill to the Minister for Energy.  He may appoint officers to deal with radioactive substances and the dumping of such substances at sea.  This Bill will not alone strengthen the hand of the Minister for Energy but will close any loopholes that might have existed as far as his jurisdiction over dumping at sea was concerned. One amendment is for that specific purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that even though, to date, the Minister for Energy might not have been able to prosecute successfully for dumping at sea, this Bill gives him that power.  To avoid duplication of power in so far as the Minister for Energy would be responsible for radioactive waste disposal and other matters concerned with radioactive waste this Bill is <Col N="694" /> being extended to give him the power to deal with all matters concerning waste disposal at sea of low level radioactive waste.  It is important, in the public interest, to state once again that high level radioactive waste may not, in any circumstances at all, be dumped at sea.  We are talking about low level radioactive waste in selected sites under very close surveillance. I can assure the House and Deputy Deasy that the Minister for Energy and the Nuclear Energy Board have the expertise and personnel to monitor all of these matters, to follow through and, if necessary, to prosecute should it ever happen that such would become necessary under this Bill.  I am satisfied that this Bill gives the necessary powers to deal with dumping of low level radioactive waste at sea and that such power should be vested in the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that what we have before us here is largely irrelevant? First of all, we do not have any nuclear waste in this country, so the question of its loading does not arise.  Secondly, the Bill refers only to territorial waters extending to a limit of three miles.  The public concern about which we spoke on Second Stage really concerns the area beyond the three mile territorial limit. What function, if any, does this Bill fulfil in governing that type of dumping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill in so far as at this time we may ourselves not have any processes providing radioactive low level or other kind of waste.  If I might take a simple example, if another country that might be producing this kind of radioactive waste granted a permit for the dumping of such radioactive waste to an operator who suddenly decided to dump it in our territorial waters we would have no way of stopping them without this legislation.  Let us not forget that all the other countries which are signatories to the London Convention specify that prior notice must be given of proposed dumping of this kind of waste at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sites are picked after extensive and exhaustive investigation with all concerned&mdash;indeed our officers have participated <Col N="695" /> fully in the monitoring and inspection of the disposal of radioactive waste. So it is essential even though we do not have that loading factor at the moment. In another case radioactive waste might be on one ship and transferred to another and subsequently dumped just outside our territorial limits.  We would want to be in a position to protect our interests in that regard.  Also any loading or waste disposal carried out by an Irish ship irrespective of where it is dumped in any part of the world will be controlled by this legislation and can be successfully prosecuted if there is infringement of the legislation. I think that is essential, apart altogether from the fact that we do not at this time concern ourselves with the production of this waste and also so that we would participate fully in the convention and the control of it so far as the European scene is concerned.  It is essential to proceed with the legislation at this time.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to a point raised on Second Stage, the amount of the fine mentioned in this section.  £500 seems to be a trivial amount.  If the dumping were of a dangerous nature, as most likely it would be, I do not think £500 would be an adequate penalty.  I was under the impression that the Minister agreed with this idea and I thought he would have changed the £500 to at least £50,000 or some such figure.  The sum of £500, or 12 months imprisonment, or both, especially as we know that courts normally opt for the fine, seem to be very small for such a potentially dangerous action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not as the Deputy states.  The Bill as framed, bearing in mind the damage that can be caused to human life or to maritime environment, provides no limit to the fine that can be imposed in the case of prosecution for an indictable offence.  Perhaps <Col N="697" /> the Deputy is referring to a matter that is tried summararily in the District Court and there is a £500 limit there for a very minor offence.  It is strictly confined to a minor offence and a district justice may impose that fine of £500 or up to 12 months imprisonment.  But for a serious offence under this Bill there is no limit on the amount of fine and/or up to five years imprisonment can be imposed for an indicatable offence.  Both cases are covered and no limit is imposed in the case of an indictable offence because of the seriousness of the nature of the offence and the damage that might be done either to the environment or otherwise.</P>

    <P>Question proposed &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not oppose the passing of the Bill because I agree with its contents but I want to reiterate a point I made on Second Stage about the Ineffectiveness of our control over the type of dumping referred to in the Bill due to the limits involved.  The territorial limits are obviously far too small and this means that 99 per cent of the world's seas are available for dumping of dangerous substances. If one draws a three-mile limit around each of the world's maritime countries one finds that the percentage covered by the Bill is pathetically small. Could the Minister give us any hope of bringing about a situation where the 99 per cent not covered under this Bill will get some protection?  Can he give us some hope that the signatories to the Oslo Convention and the London Convention will not just include the 45 referred to here <Col N="698" /> today but will include every nation in the world whether maritime or landlocked so that the possibility of dangerous dumping of toxic or nuclear waste or anything injurious to fish life or human life will be prevented?</P>
      <P>In its present state the Bill goes a certain distance to alleviate our fear of disasters occurring around our coasts but there is this great yawning gap outside the three-mile limit which is not dealt with at all.  As I pointed out previously, there are many industrialised countries not listed in this Bill in these conventions that are quite capable of dumping a quantity of dangerous materials not just in the open seas but close to our coast.  There is no provision in this Bill to prosecute people who might dump even within our three-mile territorial waters.</P>
      <P>In reality, the Bill is doing a certain amount of good but, overall, the dumping at sea problem remains with us and the two conventions referred to in this legislation have not solved the problem. They are only nibbling away at it at present. Could the Minister in his reply give us some hope that a convention will be drawn up which will govern dumping in the greater areas to which I have referred, outside the territorial waters of the maritime nations of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to register my appreciation of the participation of Deputy Deasy and the other Deputies in the debate on all sections of the Bill.  It is my opinion that this is the first serious step taken by a Government Department to deal with a matter which may not at this time cause disturbance to us as we do not have a great amount of this type of dumping, but it is a step in the right direction in that we are living in a time when dumping of toxic wastes,&mdash; including low-level radioactive waste&mdash;will become part and parcel of everyday life.  It is essential that we be prepared for it and be able to protect the environment, maritime life and fish stocks by having this legislation on the books.  It gives, in effect, considerable control to the licensing agency as far as this dumping is concerned.  It must be remembered that it applies not just to <Col N="699" /> territorial waters but also to any ship, aircraft or structure registered in Ireland, irrespective of what sea or ocean of the world it operates in.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of the Bill was that it would ratify the two conventions, the Oslo Convention which has no jurisdiction over all the seas of the world and the London Convention which has, and this Bill does ratify both these conventions, in effect.  It is aimed at controlling pollution of the seas caused by dumping of harmful substances from any kind of ship, aircraft or maritime structure, When one considers that annex I of the conventions provides that certain substances may not be dumped anyway and annex II provides for the material which may be dumped with special permit and others which need a permit also, in effect all dumping at sea will be controlled by this Bill irrespective of whether the substances are of a harmful nature or not.</P>
      <P>It will be remembered that part of this Bill gives power to the licensing authorities to stipulate where and when the dumping may take place and this will be monitored very closely by the licensing authorities.  In effect, the authorised officers will be in a position to enforce the safe dumping of these substances in so far as our territorial seas and the seas outside them are concerned.  As Deputy Deasy rightly stated, we have not a large amount of this type of dumping at present but in the future it will be important.  This Bill is the first comprehensive legislation to deal with this very important matter. I am hoping that we will never have the need to implement the provisions of the Bill, but if we have I am convinced that the authority given and the limits applied in so far as the fines which might or might not be imposed by the courts are concerned will act in a deterrent way and ensure that this type of infringement of our seas will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that this Bill will deal effectively with any possible future dumping and, for that reason, I am glad to see that the Opposition Deputies are not opposing the Bill.  I sincerely hope it will act in a way which will continue to protect our environment and fish life, <Col N="700" /> irrespective of whether inside or outside our territorial waters.</P>

      <P>I will willingly give way if any Member from the Government side is anxious to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to make a contribution to this debate mainly because there is a mental hospital in Waterford city, an <Col N="702" /> institution that has done very good work in the field of mental health care down the years.  I should like to deal with a number of provisions in the Bill.  My first comment relates to the situation of voluntary patients, a very delicate area.  On occasion when some citizens feel they are in a certain state of nerves, depression or alcoholism they have the facility to enter a mental hospital voluntarily.  The removal of formalities in section 13 in relation to voluntary patients is very desirable.  In relation to those voluntary patients who wish to discharge themselves from hospital, the present situation is that it is possible to insist on such a patient giving 72 hours' notice of his or her intention to discharge himself or herself. I understand that that condition is rarely demanded but the provision exists. I would not like to see it removed because the occasion may arise when a doctor or a consultant may be worried about the person anxious to discharge himself or herself.  A doctor or a consultant may consider that person to be a danger to himself or herself, family, friends or society.  The provision should be retained.  The Minister should address himself to that matter when replying.</P>
    <P>Many of us have been approached by patients anxious to discharge themselves and we all take great care when dealing with such people.  I am aware of this problem because I live adjacent to the local mental hospital.  For that reason I meet more such patients than most Members. Great care must be exercised when dealing with voluntary patients in relation to their admission, their personal problem and their discharge.  They must be treated with the utmost delicacy.  The provision in relation to the 72 hours' notice is desirable and important on health grounds and necessary for the protection of the patient.  Doctors who are playing an important role in the effort to bring such people back to health must be given some control over them especially in relation to personal privacy and integrity. Great care must be taken to allow doctors, particularly the RMS, have some say in relation to voluntary patients so that they have time to consider the <Col N="703" /> condition of such patients.  They must be allowed time to make arrangements for the supervision of voluntary patients as soon as they leave hospital.  I am sure the Minister is anxious to ensure that personal rights are given to a voluntary patient and that he is also anxious to ensure that there is no invasion of privacy or of the patient's person in so far as he could be forcibly detained.  In relation to the voluntary patient, the doctors must have some facility to give them time to assess their own and the patient's position when he wishes to sign himself out of the hospital.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with applications for recommendation for reception.  This is an extremely delicate area for the family or the brothers or sisters making a recommendation for the detention of a person in a mental hospital.  They envisage grave anguish to the people involved.  I have come across a number of cases mostly, unfortunately, involving alcoholism, where it had become necessary for the reception and detention of a person in a mental hospital.  They caused grave anguish to the people involved.  I have come across four or five extremely delicate cases.  This is a private area of legal medicine, I suppose.  Subsection (2) sets out the procedure whereby an application can be made, and the people who are entitled to make such an application.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in this section.  It would appear that brothers or sisters cannot apply for a recommendation for reception unless they are actually residing with the patient.  That comes under paragraph (d).  This may cause difficulty where the person to be received is living alone.  It might debar a brother or sister from taking action on a family basis.  It is always desirable that the family should be involved in these circumstances. Admittedly, a member of the Garda Síochána may do that in certain cases, or an authorised officer.  Where the family realises that there is a need for hospitalisation, and where it is desirable that a person should receive expert medical attention, irrespective of whether the brother or sister is living with the person involved, he or she should be able to <Col N="704" /> make a recommendation for the reception of that person.</P>
    <P>I am sure if he considers the matter further, the Minister will agree with me that we should have flexibility in this area.  It is an extremely personal area and, to a very high extent, it involves the invasion of a person's privacy and, indeed, even the invasion of a person's home, in order to ensure that the person who may be at risk to himself can be taken into a mental hospital and receive expert attention.  Irrespective of whether a brother or sister is living with the person concerned there should be an entitlement to make a recommendation for the reception of that person.</P>
    <P>Section 19 (1), which is a major section, also deals with recommendations for reception and provides:</P>
    <P>A recommendation for the reception of a person in a psychiatric centre shall require the written recommendation in the prescribed form of two registered medical practitioners in accordance with the following provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>I agree it is extremely important to maintain a balance in respect of the right of a person to be free to go about his business and the need for protective devices being available to ensure that a person who is at risk to himself, or society, or his own family receives proper medical treatment.  This is a very delicate area and it should be treated with great care.  Heretofore, the recommendation for reception needed to be given in writing by one medical doctor only.  It is now proposed to change that to two medical doctors.</P>
    <P>Where there is a need to bring a person into a mental hospital on a non-voluntary basis there is always a degree of urgency about the admission.  It may not be possible to get two doctors to sign the recommendation. For instance, if a person living in an isolated rural area is in need of immediate urgent and expert medical attention in a psychiatric hospital, two doctors may not be available to make the written recommendation for reception. This is a grave situation and there could be a time lapse during which the person could do damage to himself or others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> It is highly desirable in relation to non-voluntary patients that there should be a certain degree of flexibility available to the medical profession.  One would like to assume that doctors will act with the highest motives in writing recommendations for reception.  We must approach this problem on the assumption that doctors will adopt a very responsible and neutral attitude.  Where we accept that a doctor will act for the benefit of a patient it is desirable that one doctor should suffice to write a recommendation for a reception especially in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the need for two written recommendations is unnecessary and may in certain circumstances be the cause of a person doing harm to himself or others in an emergency situation.  A way around this would be to allow one doctor to write the recommendation for reception and to then have two doctors independent of the psychiatric hospital assess a patient to validate the original doctor's written recommendation for reception.  I appreciate that what the Minister is trying to do is to protect the person concerned but in doing so the Minister may allow a situation to develop where because two doctors will not be available, in the time lag between getting them, the person, who we will accept needs immediate and urgent treatment, might damage himself or others.  This provision if implemented will make certification almost impossible in many rural areas and will probably eliminate any kind of rapid action in an emergency.  It is essential that provision should be made for the reception of a patient on the recommendation of one doctor only.  That is very important in the interests of the patient.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with the decision of a review board as to a person in detention. The review board can direct the discharge on a majority decision of two to one even if the dissenting member is the medical member.  When making a decision to release an involuntary patient it is highly important that the view of the medical member of the board would have higher priority than that of a lay member.  A situation is being created in which the opinion of the medical member can be <Col N="706" /> neutralised because it will only need the decision of two members of the review board.  That is undesirable.  We are dealing with mental illness which is complicated and requires specialised medical attention.  It is logical and rational that the medical member of the board would have an important part to play in making a decision to discharge a patient.  The Minister should have another look at section 39 with a view to ensuring that if the medical member of the board disagrees with discharging a patient, then a second review board will be consulted.  If a medical doctor gives his opinion that the patient should not be discharged greater notice should be taken of it than of the lay person's opinion.  There must be a mechanism to allow the opinion of the medical doctor to have a delaying effect in relation to the discharge of the patient. Where a person should be released from a mental hospital I would not for one minute delay his release.  I am merely taking the case where a medical doctor's opinion is allowed to be laid aside without further referral.  In such a case there should be direct consultations between the medical officer of the Department of Health and the medical officer of the psychiatric centre.  That would allow any doubts about the person's health or sanity to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>It would be most unfortunate for such a person to be talked about in the community after his discharge if word got around that the doctor on the review board was not in favour of his discharge and it might possibly do him personal harm.  I am sure the Minister will agree that that is the last thing he would like to happen.  It is important from the point of view of the Minister, of the medical profession and of the personal integrity of the person to be discharged that his name upon discharge will be cleared on all medical grounds and he goes back into society with an absolutely clear medical certificate.  Where a medical doctor raises doubts it is highly undesirable that a person should be discharged.  Where a doctor states an opinion contrary to that of the two other members of the board and in favour of the retention of a patient in hospital, there must be some other referral <Col N="707" /> means to ensure that there is no doubt about a person's right to be a private citizen free from a mental hospital.</P>
    <P>For that reason some referral method must be established to remove any iota or strand of doubt about a person.  I suggest that where the medical member of the review board states an opinion that the patient should be retained in hospital whereas the other two members of the board state that he or she should be released, there must be a referral procedure. Direct consultations between the review board and the Department of Health medical officer together with the medical officer of the psychiatric centre should first take place and an opinion be received from those two experts as to the right of a patient to be discharged with a clean bill of health, and that must be emphasised in this case; otherwise you are not really allowing the person to be freed from a mental hospital with a clean bill of health.  I am sure that the Minister will give serious consideration to my suggestions.</P>
    <P>Another section to which I would like to refer in general terms is section 44 which relates to consent for certain therapeutic procedures and states that the medical council may, with the consent of the Minister, make rules.  This seems to be casting doubts on the medical profession and on the professional status of consultant psychiatrists.  It is highly important that our consultant psychiatrists be trained to the highest possible standards, but, having been trained, it seems rather an unusual procedure to adopt not to allow them to make or carry out specific treatment.  The Minister now is insisting that the medical council may make rules &ldquo;in regard to the application to any person of any specified therapeutic procedure for the treatment of mental illness, and specifying the conditions to be complied with and the precautions to be taken to safeguard the rights and well-being of patients to whom the procedure is applied&rdquo;.  I doubt very much if a consultant psychiatrist would act in any manner other than to the benefit of his or her patient.  I do not think that this provision is desirable and I understand that it is the <Col N="708" /> first instance of legal restraint on the medical profession regarding details of treatment and certainly in relation to the psychiatric profession I understand that grave doubts have been expressed about this section.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the admission of alcoholic patients involuntarily into a mental institution.  There may be a very good case for provision to be made for the involuntary admission of alcholics in special circumstances.  Again, this is an extremely difficult area which would require delicate consideration by the Minister.  These are my direct comments in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some general observations about the development of our mental hospitals.  In my lifetime tremendous strides have been made in the provision of mental health services and I have seen a great change in attitude on the part of the medical profession towards the treatment of patients.  I live in a city in which there is a mental institution and because I live in close proximity to it I come across the patients of that institution far more than many others do.  Indeed I have the privilege of going to Mass in the mental hospital and from my observations, which can be only a layman's observations, I feel that a number, maybe as high as 10 per cent, of patients at present in mental hospitals should not be in mental hospitals at all. I would say with a certain amount of certainty as a layman&mdash;I am not a doctor&mdash;that the only reason they are in mental hospitals is that nobody, no member of the family, no friend is prepared to care for them.  They may be suffering from old age, which in many cases is the only reason why people have to go into mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of geriatric space for old people and the long waiting list of applicants for entry to our geriatric hospitals can only be described as unsatisfactory. We have an excellent geriatric hospital in Waterford. St. Patrick's Hospital, where there must be ten or more acres of waste ground upon which could be built a big extension to that geriatric hospital which would allow for the entry of a number of genuine geriatric cases.  Sometimes <Col N="709" /> geriatric patients are incarcerated in mental hospitals and that is an indictment of and a most unfortunate reflection on our present-day society.  I have stated that 10 per cent, maybe more&mdash;I would bow to expert opinion in that&mdash;of people who are in mental hospitals are there only because no one will care for them. Whether they be geriatrics in the true sense of the word or whether there is perhaps a slight want, surely that alone is not reason for their incarceration in a mental hospital.</P>
    <P>There is a need for some new approach by the Minister in relation to many people who at present are in mental hospitals. Some attractive financial incentive should be given to relatives or friends who are prepared to care for people.  I do not know how much it costs per patient in mental hospitals but I am sure the sum is quite high and that the State would save money by giving a substantial, favourable allowance to relatives of people who otherwise would be patients in order to care for them.  Part of that allowance should be in respect of the medical needs of the patient.  By establishing this new type of allowance you could cut down substantially on the population in our mental hospitals.  The way then would be open for more intensive care for patients in mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>When I was a young man St. Otteran's Hospital had high walls and the attitude towards it was Victorian.  That is only 20 years ago.  The position now is that the walls are only six feet high and it has become an open hospital for many patients.  I often see them going to the shop to buy cigarettes, sweets or whatever and it is great to see them walking on the streets.  There was a farm attached to the hospital a little out of the city where some of the patients could go and do a day's work.  We can be proud of the innovations that have been made in our mental hospitals and the professional staff in the hospitals should be praised.</P>
    <P>The consultant psychiatrists, male and female nurses and so on who sometimes work in difficult circumstances have effected a profound change of attitude towards the treatment of mental illness and a more Christian way of looking at <Col N="710" /> it.  I have heard criticisms of our mental hospitals and I am sure they are valid. The attitude towards mental health and the treatment of patients has changed radically.  I am sure the medical profession would like to see further changes and a different emphasis on treatment.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way but I am satisfied that we could help further to reduce the numbers in our mental hospitals by ensuring that adequate finance is made available for those who could care for patients at home instead of putting them into mental hospitals which would mean a substantial saving to the State.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to the Deputy for having facilitated me in this way.  I welcome the Bill.  It represents a step forward towards safeguarding the rights of patients.  The purpose of the Bill should be to strike a balance between protecting the rights of the patients and the rights of the public. It is an honest attempt to protect the <Col N="711" /> rights of the patients.  Anything which helps the 14,000 mental patients in our hospitals must be welcome.  These are the most vulnerable people in our community. They are not in a position to defend or protect themselves.</P>
      <P>We have had a very bad attitude towards mental illness through the years. Patients' rights have been flouted. Patients have been committed to hospital by people, under the direction of doctors, and they have never got out again.  People have ended their days in such hospitals simply because the person who originally signed them in was not available and but for that fact they would have been discharged. Anything to improve that situation would be an enlightened approach to the whole problem of mental illness. Mental hospitals have held people for years as we know from the lady in Roscommon who wrote a book about living a lifetime in one of them.</P>
      <P>The Stigma attached to mental illness has persisted for too long.  Our whole attitude to mental hospitals was such that we built high walls around them.  Nobody wanted to know anything about these people and the attitude was that they must be alienated at all costs.  It is because of this attitude that we have the appalling conditions that still exist in our mental hospitals.  I do not blame the Government because the conditions have persisted despite the fact that we have had different Governments.  The public have adopted an apathetic attitude towards these hospitals and the people who live in them.  There was an expose on television some weeks ago and everyone was alarmed.  These conditions were highlighted at different intervals by different people.  I mentioned them on numerous occasions but I got no support because the public did not want to know.  It was not something that concerned them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the public were serious about it they would not make the demands on the health service that they do make.  This would mean there would be more money for our mental patients and hospitals. However, they are not concerned if they are not directly involved.  An indication <Col N="712" /> of their lack of concern is the fact that a high percentage of mental patients never receive even one visit a year.  That is an indictment of the public.  They are treated almost like social pariahs to be locked away and to have no one visit them or send them a card.  Governments only react to public opinion and public opinion has not been on the side of mental patients.</P>
    <P>There were appalling conditions in St. Brendan's.  It was even falling down. They were the most inhuman conditions a patient could possibly live in.  The same is true of parts of St. Ita's Hospital and I was constantly trying to highlight them. So much so, indeed, that people said I was on my hobby-horse again whenever I mentioned them.  Doctors and officials who know of these conditions and condone them stand indicted in the public eye.  They have no right to condone them. They should make a public protest against them and say that they will not work in such appalling conditions.  They should say they will go on strike until the conditions improve.  Those who are involved daily with the treatment of patients and see the deplorable conditions in which they live and under which the doctors work are the people who should have been out fighting against them, protesting and helping to mobilise public opinion against the appalling conditions. They did not do this and their silence indicts them.  When people protested against the officials' defence of the <i>status quo</i> they felt they were being attacked personally.  I am now asking doctors and officials concerned in the mental health services to make their voices heard so that improvements will be initiated.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have set out minimum standards of care for these patients, uniformally throughout the country, because such patients are the least able to speak up for themselves.  Therefore our obligation to them is strongest.  I suggest that the Minister introduce immediately a five-year plan to improve the conditions in which mental patients live. He would earn the gratitude not only of the patients but of the entire nation.  We know money is short, but when introducing <Col N="713" /> ing a five-year plan to organise minimum standards of care for mental patients the Minister could say to the other health sectors: &ldquo;Hold back, This is the top priority area and we must do something about it immediately&rdquo;.  Let there be a curb on expenditure on other improvements until we first provide proper standards for mental patients.</P>
    <P>On the question of keeping mental patients in hospitals, I ask the progressives please not to dump those people out in the streets.  Unfortunately we have begun to display such a tendency under the mistaken idea that it is in the interests of the community at large.  People who have been in hospitals for years have become sheltered, institutionalised, and when put out they tend to suffer from the revolving door syndrome &mdash; they return within a short time.  Some of them go to hostels and some become involved in vandalism and may wind up in prison.</P>
    <P>Those responsible for mental health care tell even schizophrenics that they can go home, and they are dumped in the streets.  This must be stopped immediately. Those people have been protected and sheltered for years and it is criminally wrong to treat them in this way.  When considering all those grandiose schemes to open up our mental hospitals we must be extremely careful.</P>
    <P>Let us by all means open our mental hospitals, but to the public, to volunteer groups.  Why not invite them in to help? There may be opposition from the trade unionists who might fear such people would be assuming some of their duties, but this could be sorted out.  Above all, we should encourage young people to visit such institutions.  I suggest it would be a good influence on young people to see at first hand how those patients live. It would give young people a sense of responsibility and we would have a lot less vandalism and juvenile irresponsibility. In America they brought high school children in to visit such institutions with excellent results.  In consultation with the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health could do a lot of useful work in this respect, It would be of benefit to the young people concerned and would help to overcome the depression from which <Col N="714" /> many mental patients suffer because of the conditions in which they live.  It would eliminate the need for the anti-depressant drugs being used, which are a woeful waste of money.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should make provision for an ombudsman in each health board region.  Patients with justifiable grounds for complaint could have their cases dealt with compassionately and quickly.  I also urge on him the need to provide half-way houses for mental patients so that while being prepared to return home they will still live in sheltered communities after leaving hospitals. We have made progress in this respect, but there has been a £2 million cutback in psychiatric services and this is not doing anything to improve the lot of our mentally ill people.</P>
    <P>All this Bill will do is to give certain rights to the mentally ill.  Despite what has been said I do not think the provision requiring two doctors to certify a patient for admission will cause much inconvenience. Already this is a requirement for private patients and all we are doing is extending it to public patients.  This will give more rights to patients.  The number of patients admitted by one doctor only is an indictment not only of the State but the medical profession.  The attendance of two doctors is a vital safeguard which must not be allowed to be sidetracked.</P>
    <P>The provision of a review body is another safeguard for mental patients. However, it is to be limited to a membership of three &mdash; a lawyer, doctor and lay person.  I hope the Minister will be persuaded to extend the membership to five, because it is possible that the two professionals could sway the lay person. The existence of such a body will ensure that people will not be detained for life in mental hospitals, and the composition of the review body should therefore be considered with great care.</P>
    <P>The review body will review once a year but where there is a chronic patient they will not review for two years.  This is wrong because enormous advances are taking place in the treatment of mental illness. What we may consider to be incurable today may be curable tomorrow.  We <Col N="715" /> are seeing great advances in the treatment of schizophrenia.  At present they are at the experimental stages but even in one year there may be a cure for this illness.  This Bill does not make provision for advances in therapy for mental illness. A patient may be detained for two years even though a new treatment may be discovered.  All the evidence from research taking place at the moment suggests that there may be a complete cure for schizophrenia within the next few years.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will create enormous problems if the review body have to review chronic cases once a year rather than once in two years.  Because of the burgeoning interest in mental treatment research, to have the review body look at chronic cases every two years would be a retrograde step.  As I said, we are seeing great advances in this area.  It is not so long since we had these people in cages and could only shove their food through the bars.  The earliest largactil tablets enabled those in charge to open those cages.  Schizophrenics, with special phenothiazine treatment, can now take their place in their community.</P>
    <P>I heard somebody criticise the medical council and the role they will play.  We should not condemn anything that protects the rights of patients.  The medical council are there to monitor the possibility that patients may be experimented on. They must ensure that ethical standards prevail.  There is no harm in that.  Any doctor who has the interest of his patients at heart must not be afraid of this council overseeing the treatment used.  In my opinion that is not wrong.  Doctors must welcome this council because it is an attempt to prevent unethical treatment, experimentation and so on.</P>
    <P>We have seen evidence in Britain &mdash; we do not know about Ireland yet &mdash; where patients were experimented on, treated very badly and, without giving their consent, subjected to certain treatment. We badly need this legislation and I would oppose any attempts to dilute it.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider injuries to patients.  This happens but some of it is self inflicted.  In such a situation I would <Col N="716" /> like to see the patient's rights protected, but who will report the injuries to the medical officer?  Section 45 does not answer that question.  It merely says that the medical officer shall give a report to the Minister on the injury or the alleged assault.  We must look more closely at this.  I am opposed to allowing an appeal to the Minister, because that gives him too much power.  We have seen in Russia that people were certified as psychiatric patients because they objected to the system. I very much oppose that.  There should be an appeal to the courts against such decisions because this would be more attentive to the rights of the patient.</P>
    <P>I fail to see why we should incorporate in this Bill immunity for the staff against civil proceedings.  Why should we deprive a mental patient who may be assaulted from suing a member of the staff?  To give the staff immunity is very dangerous. Again we are talking about the most vulnerable section of the community, those people who cannot defend themselves. To give immunity to the staff is negation of everything we are aiming for in this Bill and I oppose it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of very good points in this Bill which makes an honest and determined attempt to protect the rights of patients, but there is still a lot to be done.  This Bill gave me the opportunity to tell the House what I saw in a mental hospital.  There are small points in different sections which need to be clarified and amended.  In section 33 we talk about telling patients the reason for the refusal. Subsection (4) says</P>
    <P>Where the application is refused the health board or medical officer shall so inform the applicant.</P>
    <P>The applicant should be told the reason for the refusal, verbally and in writing. An independent inspectorate should examine our hospitals and the conditions which entitle a hospital to be given a licence.  That would be more helpful for the patient.  This is covered in section 36.</P>
    <P>Section 24 (4) reads:</P>
    <P>Where a reception order or extension order is made in respect of a person in any centre the medical officer in charge <Col N="717" /> of the centre shall forthwith inform the person and the applicant...</P>
    <P>That should be done verbally and in writing. That would clarify the point.</P>
    <P>I am very worried about the Garda taking a person into custody.  For how long will that person be detained?  In my view the Gardaí have no part to play in this.  There must be some alternative, but if the Minister insists on this provision, I would like to know for how long the person will be detained in the Garda station. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that point.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue.  There was a great deal of necessary consultation with the profession, the authorities, the Garda and various interests throughout the country in the preparation of the Bill, which is an honest attempt to protect the rights of the patients.  What is wrong is that there are not laid down any standards relating to quality of care or anything that would give the patient the right to proper detention.  These are provisions that I should like to see being incorporated in the Bill.  Consequently, I trust that the Minister will pay attention to this point and to the other points I have raised.  I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a special interest in the field of mental illness.  This arises from my association with a psychiatric hospital in this city.  At the outset I would refer to the words &ldquo;mental hospitals&rdquo; in the title of the Bill.  Many years ago these hospitals were referred to as lunatic asylums but in more enlightened times they are referred to as mental hospitals.  However, I suggest that we should refer to them as psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister that the Bill is a most important piece of legislation. It is the only new legislation in this area to come before the House since 1945 and the legislation that was enacted then superseded the Lunacy Acts of 1867 which gave power to justices of the peace to commit to any district asylum any person or persons considered to be of unsound mind or anybody apprehended <Col N="718" /> in circumstances suggesting that there might be an indictable offence involved.</P>
    <P>The 1945 Act was enlightened and progressive and was very well received by the medical profession at the time.  The Act abolished judicial certification and transferred complete responsibility for the care and treatment of the mentally ill to the Minister and his officers.  For the first time ever a person was entitled to enter a mental hospital as a voluntary patient.  In 1947, the year in which the Act came into operation, more than 4,000 patients were admitted to public mental hospitals here.  There were two types of committal procedure in respect of those who had to be certified.  In one case there was the category of temporary patients while on the other hand there was the category of persons of unsound mind.  Of those some 4,000 admissions, 900 were voluntary, 1,123 were temporary and more than 2,000 were classified as persons of unsound mind.  Under the previous legislation, and also for the first time, out-patient clinic facilities were provided for the mentally ill.  However, the development of these facilities was very slow and two years later only few such clinics were in operation.  But since then and during a period of perhaps 25 years, admissions to mental hospitals continued to increase until in 1972 they reached a peak of 23,000 admissions while the out-patient clinics catered for 30,000 patients.  Since then admissions have decreased considerably and the number of persons in public mental hospitals today represents a decrease of 30 per cent during a 15-year period.  I consider this to be an advance in medical science and treatment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there was a stigma attaching to the mentally ill in the past. Those suffering from mental illness were put out of sight.  Relatives were ashamed to acknowledge the existence of these people.  That was a dreadful situation but attitudes have changed in many respects and there is now an acceptance of mental illness for what it is.  This means that steps can be taken at an early stage in the treatment of patients.</P>
    <P>Treatment facilities both in psychiatric hospitals and in clinics have improved <Col N="719" /> greatly and the successful intervention of the GPs working in the general medical scheme has played a significant role in this area.  Since the scheme was introduced increasing numbers of GPs have become involved, but despite these advances there are problems in relation to dealing with seriously disturbed patients in several of our hospitals.  Most of our psychiatric hospitals do not have adequate facilities for dealing with such patients.  In some instances there have been legal difficulties in transferring patients to the central hospital at Dundrum, the only psychiatric hospital where appropriate treatment facilities are available for these patients.  The changes in section 207 of the Mental Treatment Act which provided for judicial transfer order are long overdue.  The Minister should give very careful consideration to this section as it would not necessarily be good or in the interest of the patient that transfer to another hospital could be executed all too easily.  Perhaps in those circumstances a declaration signed by two psychiatrists would be more suitable and more in the interest of all parties concerned, especially the patient who is the most important party in such cases.</P>
    <P>The present legislation which requires judicial order can involve up to a two weeks delay in being put into effect.  Such delays are far too long particularly in cases of patients reacting violently and perhaps endangering not only themselves but other people.  The new Bill proposes the establishment of review boards which would take over completely in due course the responsibilities that now rest with the inspector of mental hospitals.  As the Minister mentioned, it can be argued that a system based on one person is neither satisfactory nor acceptable in terms of contemporary opinion.  However, I would suggest that many arguments could be made in favour of having only one person involved provided that that person is the right man or woman for the job.  I agree that the title inspector of Mental Hospitals is totally outdated.  If the position is to be retained the title should be changed so that there is less of <Col N="720" /> the big stick about it.  Perhaps the term, adviser to the Minister, could be used.</P>
    <P>A more relaxed environment is absolutely necessary today to give to psychiatric hospitals the appearance of hospitals dealing generally in mental affairs.  I am aware also that the medical profession are very anxious that there should be one person only who would be responsible to the Minister on behalf of mental hospitals in specific areas.  This would be irrespective of the title used.  This is a matter that should be considered fully.  Such an appointment should be for a limited period of, for instance, not more than three years.  This would ensure that the person appointed would have full experience of mental hospitals and mental health in general and would have to be a specialist in that sphere.  I understand that such a system is now operating very successfully in the USA and Canada.  It might be beneficial to the Bill if the Minister had another look at this particular aspect.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that perfection and specialisation are absolutely necessary in any matters relating to health but that they are even more important when dealing with mental illness and psychiatric illness.  Mental illness has far-reaching effects on the lives of the people concerned and on their families.  It is vital that not only properly qualified people are appointed but also that the officers controlling psychiatric hospitals are completely up to date on the changes which take place daily in relation to the treatment of psychiatric illness.  It is important for the Minister to give very careful consideration in regard to replacing the existing post of inspector of psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been criticised in some areas.  Some speakers have said that it makes no reference to the day-to-day running or administration of mental hospitals. I agree with the Minister that if any standards of treatment to be provided in hospitals were incorporated this would be meaningless in practice.  We all share the same views on the type of hospitals we would like to have and in relation to the care which we feel should be provided in those hospitals for patients. <Col N="721" /> We share the same views in relation to the facilities which we feel should be provided which would benefit patients and staff.  It does not mean, because this is not embodied in the Bill, that individual hospitals will not strive to attain the standards we would all like to see.  I know, from my involvement with psychiatric hospitals, the care, attention and medical treatment given to patients by the staff in most mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>Great progress has been made in recent years in relation to the care of patients in mental hospitals.  I would like to put on record the gratitude felt by the general public to all the people involved in the care of mental patients.  Anybody who has experienced the problems caused by mental illness understands what I say and knows the great work done by the people involved.  This applies equally to the public sector and the private sector.</P>
    <P>We have moved into a modern era of psychiatry.  The focus for treatment will no longer be located on a full-time basis in mental hospitals.  The general focus will be located in the community, which now understands and accepts mental illness for what it is.  The emphasis should be on prevention at all levels and should be directed wherever the treatment is needed, whether it be the hospital, the home, or the day centre.  This will also involve the family doctor and community nurses working alongside psychiatrists.  I believe that then a very real effort will be made in providing the effective preventive services which are so badly needed.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate fact of life that we will always have mental illness in our society.  The pressures of modern day living are contributing in a major way to this.  Mental stresses have never been greater than they are today.  Unfortunately, a greater number of people are resorting to tranquilisers in an effort to alleviate their problems.  Many medical people have expressed strong opposition to the increased prescribing of tranquilisers which very often create more serious disorders and illnesses which in quite a number of cases eventually necessitate <Col N="722" /> psychiartic treatment.  The medical profession have a great responsibility to do the right thing and not prolong the illness and even perhaps make the illness worse by continuing to prescribe tranquilisers and other drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell made a number of excellent points.  I agree with his reference to the attitude of the public towards mental illness.  Attitudes have changed in comparison to many years ago.  We can do a lot more by teaching our young people in the schools to understand mental illness and to have concern for those who are affected by this sickness.  There is also a great responsibility on the relatives of such patients who can help in many ways.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The proposals contained in it are an advance on previous legislation.  The Minister indicated he will be putting down a number of amendments for Committee Stage.  I am very pleased about his flexibility in that respect.  The people involved in the psychiatric profession are very conscientious and dedicated people.  I am sure the Minister will bear this in mind when he is considering the many suggestions which have been put forward by the people in the profession.</P>

Is the Minister aware that the pilot research, for example, which is being carried out under the Medico-Social Research Board does not include any rural parents or families and that there is a major gap which should be plugged by further research?</P>

      <P>When a research group of any kind is set up, it is normal to select a particular area to carry out the initial pilot scheme.  In this instance, the area selected was Dublin, the area of greatest density of population.  That does not mean that when we have examined the results of that pilot scheme, we will not continue to research into this problem until we discover the cause of sudden cot deaths, because of the concern, not only of this House, but of parents and the public in general.  So far we have no medical evidence to tell us the reason for what the Deputy referred to as sudden cot deaths.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>Sudden deaths of unspecified cause in infants were not identified in the International Classification of Diseases, which is the basis of our mortality statistics, until 1 January 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of certified sudden infant deaths or cot deaths in 1979 was 90. Because no specific provision existed prior to 1979 for coding of these deaths, comparable statistics for earlier years are not available.  The Medico-Social Research Board is carrying out research into sudden infant deaths.  This research commenced as a pilot study designed to test the methodology of further research. This pilot study has now developed into a two-year study of the deaths of infants who died between one week after birth and one year of age.  It relates to Dublin city and country and to the period April 1979 to March 1981.  This study will help to identify some of the circumstances <Col N="726" /> associated with sudden infant death.  It will also help in deciding on what form future research in this area should take.</P>
    <P>The cost of this research is absorbed in the general expenditure of the Medico-Social Research Board.  The extent of future expenditure will depend on what research is decided upon following evaluation of the results of the current study.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate, and, indeed, share the concern of all parents who have lost infants through `cot deaths' and I am eagerly awaiting the outcome of the present study.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says that the money made available is included in the general allocation, surely the information must be available as to precisely how much money is being spent on research into infant sudden deaths?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In reply to the Deputy, it is very difficult to know how much money will be spent on research of this kind.  When a research body is set up and perhaps after two or three months of research the cause of the problem is discovered, then one does not require any more money.  In this particular instance, as I said earlier in reply to Deputy Kenny's question, we have no evidence from international studies, studies from EEC countries or anywhere else, as to the cause of this problem.  I am telling the House that as money is required for this research, it will become available under general expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not have understood me, or I may have misunderstood him.  Am I to take it from his reply that it is open-ended how much money the board spend, that they can splend any amount they see fit?  Is that the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">

      <P>The number of applications for admission to nurses training schools in this country has always been far in excess of the number of places available. As with other similar professions the number of training places provided is geared to the country's national manpower requirements.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 7 April 1980 the first three days of a claim to disability benefit or unemployment benefit were regarded as waiting days in respect of which benefit was not paid unless the claimant had been sick or unemployed within the preceding 13 weeks, in which circumstances payment was made from the first day of illness or unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As from 7 April the first three days of all claims to disability benefit are <Col N="732" /> regarded as waiting days unless, while in receipt of unemployment benefit, the claimant became ill or, having been ill, suffers a relapse within three days of resuming work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>That change took place in April 1980.  Heretofore a person who applied within 13 weeks would not lose the first three days.  There was a major administrative problem, as the Deputy will appreciate, and we have a supplementary welfare allowance to cover any hardship that may arise from the fact that the three days are not covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that supplementary welfare allowances will not be paid within the three-day period to which the Minister refers and that, because of the change which has been brought about by the Minister, people who have a relapse of their illness are being deprived unfairly of benefit in respect of the second three-day period? Surely the Minister must accept that the amount of money being saved by the State in comparison with the hardship being caused to the individual does not warrant this unfair change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the question of the amount of money saved by the State as compared with the total amount of money paid out by the State in social welfare benefits arises.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the administrative cost of excluding the second claim will be greater than heretofore.  It has to be <Col N="733" /> greater.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="734" /> for Social Welfare the basis on which the privilege of board and lodgings is assessed in computing the means of an applicant for unemployment assistance; and whether single persons can now qualify for unemployment assistance where they are being given board and lodgings by a relative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis on which the value of board and lodgings is assessed for an applicant for unemployment assistance living with a relative is determined in accordance with section 13 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and regulations made under that Act.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not specify the method by which the value of board and lodging is to be calculated.  Each case is decided on its own particular merit.  The assessments have regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.  For example, where the head of household is not in steady employment, generally no amounts are assessed on foot of board and lodgings afforded to a single person in that household.  Where the head of household is in steady employment, the assessment is the proportion of the net family income which is estimated to be devoted to the upkeep of the single person.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the operation of the scheme, certain improvements were made from 2 April 1980.  As a result of these improvements the position now is that the assessment of board and lodgings of a single person does not normally exceed 12½ per cent of the net family income of the household in which he or she resides.  It may, in fact, be considerably less particularly in the case of households with large numbers of dependants.</P>
      <P>Accordingly a single person being provided with board and lodgings by a relative can qualify for unemployment assistance provided that the assessment of weekly means does not exceed the appropriate maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance which now stands at £17 in urban or £16.45 in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the new proposals, if any, he intends to introduce for the improvement of the present fuel voucher scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 6 August last I announced new measures for the improvement of the fuel schemes and the <Col N="737" /> new arrangements have been in operation since the beginning of October.</P>
      <P>The most notable improvement has been the introduction of a new national free fuel scheme for the benefit of persons in all parts of the country who are unable to provide for their heating needs from their own resources.  Under the scheme a weekly allowance is payable to eligible persons, normally by way of vouchers which may be used to purchase any type of fuel or to pay gas or electricity bills.  In general, those eligible are persons receiving long-term social welfare or health board payments, such as old age and widow pensioners, disabled persons and deserted wives, living either alone or with a dependant or with another person receiving a similar payment.  The scheme operates for the 30-week period from October to April.</P>
      <P>The urban fuel schemes in 17 cities and towns are continuing and the value of the weekly voucher has been increased by 33? per cent from £1.50 to £2.00, which is also the value of the weekly voucher under the national scheme.  Persons who do not qualify under the urban schemes, such as contributory old age pensioners, may benefit under the national scheme if they satisfy the conditions.</P>
      <P>Approximately 115,000 pensioners and others will benefit under the fuel schemes this winter at an estimated cost of £7 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the Minister for Health has already announced that, because the national scheme which he announced and gave details of is not as beneficial as the scheme already in operation in the Western Health Board area, he has instructed the Western Health Board and any similar boards paying a voucher in excess of his scheme to continue to do so?  Is the Minister unaware that the beneficiary in County Carlow will not receive as much benefit under the national fuel scheme as will the beneficiary in Counties Galway, Mayo or Roscommon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a means test for this scheme.  As in every other scheme there may be different interpretations by different individuals, but generally all eligible people will qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that previously in certain parts of the country beneficiaries were being supplied with a ton of coal, the price of a ton of coal or the price of two tons of turf, approximately £90 and that the national scheme now provides for a payment over a 30-week period of £2 per week which is £60 per annum and consequently certain beneficiaries in areas outside the Western Health Board area will receive only £60 a year whereas people in the Western Health Board area will continue to receive benefit equivalent to approximately £90 per annum.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the new national fuel scheme represents a considerable improvement on the arrangements previously in operation.</P>
      <P>An additional 29,000 people will benefit under the new scheme and the assistance of £2 weekly represents an increase of 33? per cent over the rate provided generally last year.

      <P>Irish pensioners residing abroad, including those in Britain, receive their pensions in Irish currency. They are paid by means of payable orders issued to them by my Department at weekly or monthly intervals, as required. Prior to this country's entry into the EMS and the break in the link with sterling Irish pensioners in Britain were paid by pension order books cashable at face value at post offices in that country.  As British post offices do not operate a currency conversion service this arrangement has ceased and the pensioners now make their own arrangements for the encashment of the payable orders.  As the value of the púnt is lower than that of Sterling the pensioners receive less in British currency than the face value of their pensions.  They are however being paid the full value in Irish currency of the pensions to which they are entitled under the Social Welfare Acts.  There is no provision for the payment to Irish pensioners residing abroad of rates higher than those payable to pensioners residing in this country, nor does such provision exist in other member countries of the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded a retirement pension with effect from 7 June 1979 and a pension order book was issued payable from 12 June 1980.  The arrears for the period 7 June 1979 to 11 June 1980 amounted to £1,006.85.</P>
      <P>He was also awarded a British retirement pension from 7 June 1979 and the arrears of this pension for the period 7 June 1979 to 9 April 1980 amounted to IR £798.18.</P>
      <P>The total British and Irish arrears due to him, therefore, amounted to £1,805.03.  However, as he had received a total of £915.40 by way of old age (blind) pension for the period 7 June 1979 to 12 June 1980 he was only entitled to the balance of £889.63.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of an anomaly resulting fron the change over in social welfare regulations in April 1979 whereby persons, who prior to that date were deemed to be in insurable employment and had paid contributions accordingly, were subsequently denied unemployment benefit; and whether he will take steps to remedy this injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations to which the Deputy refers concern the insurability under the Social Welfare Acts of part-time employment and employment remunerated at a rate of less than £6 a week or £26 a month.</P>
      <P>Prior to 6 April 1979, all part-time employees who were employed for the purposes of an employer's trade or business were insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, irrespective of the duration of the employment or of the amount of the remuneration.  In addition, persons such as private domestic workers who were employed otherwise than for the purpose of the employer's trade or business were insurable for all benefits including unemployment benefit it they worked for a total of 18 hours or more in the week for one or more employers or, if working for a total of less than 18 hours in the week, were mainly dependent for livelihood on the earnings from such employment or employments.  All other part-time employees were insured for occupational injury benefits and services under the Health Acts.  Otherwise, persons in insurable employment were, generally speaking, likewise covered for all social insurance benefits, regardless of their rate of earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As from 6 April 1979, the date of the introduction of the PRSI contributions scheme, revised regulations provide that irrespective of the nature of the employment any person who works for 18 or more hours in the week in one or more employments, continues to be insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare <Col N="745" /> Acts.  Where the total number of hours worked is less than 18 hours in the week, the employee continues to be insured for all benefits including unemployment benefit if he/she is mainly dependent for livelihood on the earnings from such employment or employments.  Any person who works for a total of less than 18 hours in the week and who is not so dependent continues to be insured for occupational injury benefit and Health Act services.</P>
    <P>The revised regulations also provide that a person who has only one employment remunerated at a rate less than £6 a week or £26 a month is from 6 April 1979 similarly insured only for occupational  <Col N="746" /> injury benefit and Health Act services.</P>

I am now satisfied as a result of inquiries made by my Department that the person in question is residing at her County Kilkenny address and the allowance book with orders cashable from September 1980 was re-issued on 31 October 1980.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in all cases people are complaining that the least time it takes to get a reply after sending in a certificate is six weeks and that nine to 12 weeks is normal? Surely the Minister came across this when he was a Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I did.  When I was appointed Minister of State the Minister asked me to look into this problem of the undue delay in the payment of benefits. As the new Minister of State I went in to the Department to where the post comes in as I wanted first hand knowledge of what happened from when the post came in until the cheque was sent out.  Approximately five per cent of the certificates sent in contained a wrong address, an insurance number or income tax number which was the wrong number.  These have to be referred back to the people who sent them in and sometimes they cannot be referred back because the certificate does not contain the address of the person who sent it in.  The Minister was very concerned about this.  I am satisfied there has been an improvement in the issuing of payments and benefits to people. There will always be some delays not necessarily the fault of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said 5 per cent are incorrect and I accept that. However 95 per cent of them are correct and the normal time to get a reply is nine weeks.  It is never less than six weeks in my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have checked on the Deputy's statement and it is incorrect.  I assure the Deputy that 95 per cent of correct certificates submitted to the Department will be paid within three or four days.  Another point is that sometimes we receive a certificate dated perhaps two weeks later.  Whether it was delayed in the post or whether the person put the certificate in his pocket and forgot <Col N="749" /> about it I do not know, but we have checked the date on the envelope with the date on the certificate.  If a certificate is posted into my Department properly completed with the name and address and the proper insurance number, in three days the cheque will go out to that person.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The free electricity allowance scheme was designed as a measure of assistance for old age type pensioners living alone or with certain excepted categories of persons to enable them to remain in their homes as active members of the community.  Where, however, persons residing in homes are in receipt of a qualifying pension or allowance and have their own separate apartments each with <Col N="752" /> its own meter on the domestic two-part tariff, they may qualify for the allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that in many cases where old age pensioners have their own meters and are living in their own compartment within a larger house they are deemed ineligible because of some legal contract they have entered into in the case of a will or assignment with their son, daughter, nephew or niece where that son or daughter is responsible for their welfare until their death?  The Minister is not coming altogether clean in stating that where they have separate meters they are automatically eligible.  That is not so.  In many cases that is not sufficient on its own, and the Minister knows that well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>

      <P>I ask him if he is aware that in many cases old people did provide separate apartments for themselves and separate meters and they hoped to be able to qualify.  Then because of a will or assignment they had entered into prior to this they found themselves to be deemed ineligible because of the responsibility resting on their relatives to look after them and the Minister and the Department got out of the payment on this score alone.

      <P>I am aware that in many places where the mother leaves the house she builds on an attachment to the house, <Col N="753" /> a room, perhaps something like a kitchenette, and she gets her own meter.  In that case, provided she is the registered consumer of the electricity, and provided that the meter in the family home is in the name of the son, then, in my opinion, that person qualifies.  I have said, and I repeat, that I do not want to go into individual cases.  If the Deputy has a particular case he should bring it to the my notice and I will investigate it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that where the old age pensioner has by deed or assignment handed over the property to a son or daughter and where a separate meter has been installed for that old age pensioner, that in itself does not qualify that old age pensioner for free electricity allowance because of a will or assignment which makes the son or daughter responsible for the welfare of that person?</P>

When these inquiries are completed his claim will be dealt with immediately.  In the interim an application form has been issued to him to enable him to claim unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister withdrew the earlier Bill and sought leave to introduce this Bill some weeks ago I said that his predecessor's Bill had been on the Order Paper for three years without an attempt being made to advance it in any way, obviously because consolidation Bills are not measures likely to receive the same measure of publicity as the distribution of toothbrushes among the children of the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite repeated requests, an attempt was not made to advance the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill.  The Minister has sought privately through the Whips to get an assurance that this Bill will have gone through all Stages and be passed by both Houses before Christmas.  That is an extremely unreasonable attitude, particularly because of the vast complexities and technicalities of a consolidation Bill of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanation advanced was that if <Col N="770" /> the Bill has not been agreed before Christmas further social welfare measures that will become necessary after the next budget will mean that a consolidation Bill would not be consolidating all social welfare legislation.  My point is that that will be the position in regard to a consolidation Bill at any time because in any year there will be two or possibly three social welfare measures.  Therefore it will be impossible always to have a single Bill embracing all of the social welfare code at any one time.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to the House to suggest that it can deal with the entire complicated social welfare code between now and Christmas.  There will be agreement from this side of the House for the Bill to be referred to the Joint Committee on the basis that the Committee will be given the time necessary to deal properly with the Bill.  The Minister said he would circulate a detailed explanatory memorandum to help the Members to handle this consolidation measure.  The only documeant  I have seen emanate from the Department is so complicated that it would need an explanatory memorandum to help Members to interpret it.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is not fair to expect the Joint Committee to have conducted an entire examination of the social welfare code before Christmas.  On the basis that the Committee should be allowed the time necessary to deal adequately with the Bill, and on the assumption that the explanatory memorandum promised by the Minister will be forthcoming soon, I reluctantly agree with the motion.  I ask the Minister to tell us who will sit on the Joint Committee.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Brady said, this Bill is meant to update the 1945 Act which was a very forward looking Act for its time.  I think it was Deputy MacEntee who introduced it on behalf of Fianna Fáil, who did so many things of a radical nature up to that time.  I do not think one can honestly say the same thing about the Bill before us.  It is so inadequate as to be practically irrelevant to the needs of our times.  Though the advice of those of us who are members of the medical profession may be considered to be suspect because of our special interest in measures of this kind, the Minister can take it that the submission by the Irish Division of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, of which I am a member, gives a reasonable assessment of the fundamental effects of the Bill.  They go on to say:</P>
      <P>The Bill is entitled &ldquo;An Act to make further and better provision for the regulation of care and treatment of persons suffering from mental disorders and to provide for related matters&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill has little to say about care and treatment, being confined mainly to provisions designed to protect the civil liberties of persons compulsorily  <Col N="772" /> detained in psychiatric centres, it is felt that this title is misleading.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a more appropriate title would be &ldquo;An Act to make provision for the registration and supervision of psychiatric centres and for the detention in psychiatric centres of persons suffering from mental disorders and to provide for related matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not in any way underestimate the true enormity of the task facing the Minister for Health in dealing with the question of the treatment of mentally or emotionally disturbed people because, as I will show, one would have to have the powers of a dictator, and certainly the authority of a united Cabinet with very forward-looking and radical ideas, to deal with the sources of distress frequently called mental illness in any society. There are very few Departments which would not be involved in a comprehensive approach to so reorganising our society.</P>
    <P>I am one of those people who believe that in their various complex ways these people are opting out of situations which are personal dilemmas, or dilemmas associated with their lives, work, upbringing or relationships, they find intolerable.  The remedy most of them take is to go to what Deputy Brady called the &ldquo;lunatic asylums&rdquo;.  I favour the use of the word &ldquo;asylum&rdquo;.  I know what he was talking about, the perjorative nature of the words applied as they have been in society and the stigma attached to them, but an &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; is what many of these hospitals tend to be &mdash; they provide peace and an absence of stress.</P>
    <P>Many of us have begun to question the use of these instituions over a number of years.  In dealing with this matter we have the usual problem of the conflict of generations. I am sure this is a problem the Minister has faced.  It is difficult for him as a lay person facing the conflict of ideas within any profession where he has to attempt to arbitrate on behalf of the public. There are two extremes within psychiatry not only in Ireland but all over the world.  There are people who consider mental illness as a curable illness and <Col N="773" /> those who consider that what we call &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; is simply a reaction to situations of great stress and one should try to deal with the position the person finds himself in, which is so intolerable. There are many British and American psychiatrists, and some Irish psychiatrists, who take this latter view.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not feel I am being capricious or politically motivated in my criticism of his Bill, but I feel his proposals are very remote from what is needed just now.  What was made available in 1945 was a great advance &mdash; the turning away from the courts, from the scope of criminality, the introduction of the voluntary admission and the upgrading of many of the standards of care in many of these mental hospitals.  I have watched these hospitals over 30 years and that can be said to be true.  They are not all bad, although some are very bad.</P>
    <P>The trouble here is the Minister's&mdash;and this applies also to his predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, because he was involved in the preparation of this legislation&mdash;apparent attitude of mind about closed institutions.  It is a nineteenth century preoccupation with the general advantages of closed institutions&mdash;orphanages, workhouses, the origins of the modern hospitals in general medical care and prisons.  They were based on a common ethos of regimentation, denial of individual freedom, paternalist arrogance and an obsession with mystification and secrecy.  That can be said about the institutions I mentioned. If anybody is particularly interested, there is a magnificent work by a man called Hoffman on the whole of the hierarchical system within the mental hospitals and the behaviour patterns of all the inmates, not only the people sent there as mentally disturbed but of all who live and work in these institutions &mdash; doctors, nurses, social workers and so on.</P>
    <P>These closed institutions were justified by a set of unquestioned assumptions about the nature of psychiatric illness and the rehabilitation functions of institutions. They were meant to cope with human disease and psychopathology. This is being widely questioned but apparently not in the Department of <Col N="774" /> Health, if one is to judge by the contents of this Bill</P>
    <P>The Bill is not wholly bad.  There are obvious advances as mentioned by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Brady about the preservation of civil rights.  This is a very important question, but before I deal with that I would like to share the views of everyone who has spoken so far about the virtual total detachment by the public from the fact that these are the unwanted and rejected people in our society.</P>
    <P>As most people will know, the other subject to which I apply myself rather consistently is the question of prisons but, interestingly enough and to put it crudely, there are no votes either in concern for mental hospitals or in concern for prisons.  That is a strange feature of a society which makes so many protestations about its humanitarian approach to so many aspects of life, sometimes to the point of hysteria.  Down through the years successive investigative journalists have gone into these places of detention of which there are some very bad ones but also some very good ones who are operating on extremely good humanitarian lines of compassion and kindness but who are operating in very difficult circumstances. In some successive magnificent pieces of journalism there have been protests about the institutions that are bad.  Some politicians as well as some members of the medical profession have protested also from time to time in this regard.  I do not think that Deputy O'Connell is being totally fair to some of the psychiatrists I know who have protested from time to time but who found that there was nobody to listen to their protestations.  Now we have the very depressing response of the Government in terms of cutting by a considerable amount the expenditure on mental hospitals. This step represents the most eloquent comment that could be made on the mental hospitals either by the present Minister for Health or by his predecessor who is now Taoiseach.  It indicates what their attitude is to the future of these hospitals.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest defect of the whole system is the one to which I <Col N="775" /> referred earlier, that is, the faith that we as a society have in the closed institution and the effect of the closed institution on everybody concerned from the patient to the chief psychiatrist.  The whole process of instituionalisation is most pernicious, dangerous and damaging in its effect on the people involved.  Frequently I have seen people who have been in such places for a long time who could not be encouraged by any means to leave.  They are there for life because at some stage they found a situation that was intolerable so far as they were concerned.  They came to us and we gave them a brick wall to spend the rest of their lives looking at and left them there.  Essentially, that is a betrayal of people who are in the type of dilemma that leads them to seek help from us in the first place.</P>
    <P>From the psychiatric point of view, institutionalisation is very unhealthy in relation to all concerned, to the nurses and doctors, the social workers, the psychiatrists and the patients.  It is a continuing process.  The Minister may have found that change is not possible because of the resistance in this regard by the established institutions.  The old-time head of these institutions lived an extraordinary life.  A colleague of mine rejected a senior post because he did not want to become an old time provincial prison governor in imperial India where he would have an enormous house and free labour and where he would be totally paternalist and have control over everybody within the institution.  These people, after some time, grew to love the actual post more than they loved their work.  Consequently, there has been great resistance to change.</P>
    <P>I am not underestimating the Minister's job in attempting to bring about change where there would be such resistance but on the question of civil rights there is an important figure that I like to give, though to some extent this may be an over-simplification.  Let us take an institution which consists of 300 people under the care of one psychiatric team in a catchment area of 250,000 people and another institution under a different team <Col N="776" /> in a catchment area of the same number where the bed occupancy is 50.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that one can conclude that there are a number of people &mdash; extrapolating that to all institutions &mdash; who are unnecessarily detained, unnecessarily in prison.  Let us be clear that a mental hospital is simply a benevolent jail, that the head of the hospital is a benevolent jailer and that while the attitudes are somewhat different, the deprivation of liberty is identical with that of the jail with the extraordinary difference that if one who is referred to as a &ldquo;criminal&rdquo;&mdash; and I want to put that word in quotes because I do not believe in criminality &mdash; is put away in prison by society, there are a remarkable number of safeguards to protect his rights, regardless of whether he is a petty criminal, a murderer, a rapist, a terrorist or any other such deviant.  We have evolved a most elaborate system of defences so far as the liberty of that person is concerned.  There are the District Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court with provision for appeals from one of these courts to the other.  In the courts there are talented and skilled legal people whose job it is to try to have an accused person exculpated or at least to ensure that he is not wrongly confined to prison and that if he is confined, his confinement is in accordance with the strict rules laid down by this House in respect of the offence concerned. That is our attitude to the criminal in our society.  However, in regard to the person who is mentally ill, he needs the signature of the general practitioner as well as the signature of the psychiatrist and, as Deputy O'Connell said, he can be in for life.  Such people are deprived of their freedom for the rest of their lives under supervision by doctors.</P>
    <P>I am very shocked by the outrageous powers I have as a psychiatrist and as a doctor.  I am given the right to deprive an individual of his or her liberty if I wish, with only the minimum security for that individual. I am very glad that the Minister is attempting to introduce some kind of safeguard with the review board and the second doctor.  I do not think the second doctor is much of a protection.  In <Col N="777" /> our profession we do not usually fight with one another and it is very difficult to question a colleague's conclusions unless they are outrageously wrong.  One tends to accept that one's colleague knows the patient better, that he knows the family and the circumstances.  The review board and the High Court appeal is a welcome advance.</P>
    <P>The consistently dismissive attitude of the public towards those unwanted people is quite distressing.  Psychiatry is an unsatisfying profession for many reasons. The general feeling one gets is that the people in mental hospitals are women whose husbands want to get rid of them, men whose wives want to get rid of them, children whose parents want to get rid of them, or parents whose children want to get rid of them.  Psychiatrists are being used to intervene in what are frequently disagreements between individuals.  They are being given this extraordinary power of depriving a person who is always the loser and who can be indicted of having been in a mental hospital before or who has given a lot of trouble and is deprived of his or her freedom.  That person is put behind bars for the rest of his or her life. Very few psychistrists escape being presented with such problems.  They are often presented with parents who cannot control their child, a young adolescent who is giving a lot of trouble.  The psychiatrist is told that if that young person is not kept in he will harm his parents or somebody else and the psychiatrist will then be indicated as the person who let him out to cause all the trouble.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anybody who knows anything about psychiatric hospitals will doubt that a large number of old people are in those hospitals.  Most doctors have had the experience of trying to get persons of 65 years and over into hospital, and have gone to the Bed Bureau and so on to get such people admitted but have failed.  The young people possibly are not able to keep the old person with them any longer, possibly because of modern flat development with the absence of any place for the old person, a growing family and other problems. There is a very strong compulsion on the psychiatrist to admit to a psychiatric  <Col N="778" /> hospital somebody who has nothing else wrong except that he or she is too old and is a nuisance.</P>
    <P>Many old people are in psychiatric hospitals not only because of the selfishness of young married people with growing families who have no longer room for them; if it was possible for old people to live on their own, if there were sufficient domicilary, meals-on-wheels, laundry services and all the other facilities which would make it possible for such people to remain in their homes they would not have to be admitted to psychiatric hospitals. The Bill will not stop that type of thing happening.  The Minister's answer to me may possibly be that it is a much broader question.</P>
    <P>The problem also arises in relation to the alcoholic.  He is possibly every second or third person who is admitted to mental hospitals.  What on earth is the person with a drink problem doing in a mental hospital?  Why are there not special institutions for him?  Of course, the same is true for the mentally handicapped.  What is the function of the mental hospital? There are, unfortunately, very great misconceptions about mental illness.  In fact, there are those of us who deny that this is an illness at all.  Certainly, it is worth putting on the record that there is no cure.  There are many misconceptions about the role of the new great phenothiazine drugs mentioned by Deputy Dr. O'Connell, the new mode changing drugs of the late 1950s and 1960s.  They are not a cure.  All they have done is to make it possible to apply a straitjacket or to avoid the locked door.  They have very much changed the character of the closed institution but nobody is cured by these effectively stupifying drugs.  What they do is reduce a little the capacity to feel the pain, stress, agony of mind.</P>
    <P>The origin of distress still lies within the person's life and, there again, the Minister has made no suggestions whatever, neither on the curative nor on the preventative side.  On the curative side one would apply changes over the whole spectrum of the passion of lives over our society.  On the preventative side, there would be the introduction of educational changes, particularly revolutionary, radical,  <Col N="779" /> educational changes in attitude to parental control and, then, education in our schools.  There is no reference to these whatsoever.  These are the things which the radical sector of the psychiatric profession have looked for from the former Minister for Health and now the present Minister.</P>
    <P>Possibly, in his reply the Minister will comment on the inadequacy of the Bill. Possibly that was deliberate, in so far as he felt that it should not be dealt with in this legislation.  At the same time, however, it is a long time since the last Bill in 1945 &mdash; almost 40 years &mdash; and I presume this Bill is intended to deal with these problems in society over the next 20, 30, 40 years.  Does it even mark time?  I do not think that it does.  This is an improvement on some of the undesirable features of the old custodial institutional approach to mental illness but it does not touch the needs of many young psychiatrists whose attitude is completely different.  There are some people who obviously, must be kept in isolation for their own sakes and for the sake of the community &mdash; I do not deny that &mdash; but they are in the minority. Ideally, the Minister should have provided for an Act to make provision for the registration and supervision of the psychiatric centres and, in those centres, wide facilities, unorthodox facilities and accepted ideas, but a fairly free hand for different concepts of approach to the care of people who are psychiatrically ill and disturbed.</P>
    <P>The truth is that there is nobody who can say that this is the correct and only way in which to deal with people looking for help from stresses of society.  Indeed, in order to understand the impotence of the psychiatrist, the grandiloquence and grandiose terminology of schizophrenia, melancholia, endogenous depression, exogenous depression and all this, really means very little indeed.  We are simply giving very elegant names to the man who is unhappy with his wife, or a wife unhappy with her husband, a lady who is having two many children or living in high-rise flats under crowded conditions, a man with a job he cannot stand, an old person who is rejected and left alone, or <Col N="780" /> a young person who has been subjected to the frequently depressing experience of childhood in our society, both at home and in school.  You can call them whatever name you like, but they are the simple realities.  What changes can you make in a hospital which will improve the conditions in the home from which the young or old person, rejected husband or wife in the first place ran away to the institution?  I may be presumptuous in saying this, but I think the reality of the thinking of psychiatrists is a sense of total futility of one's role in psychiatry and the slightly degrading role of psychiatrists.  I found it very difficult indeed to continue to accept the fact that I know that this is the problem &mdash; the person arrives at the gate of the hospital, is taken in and the stress relieved for a while because the patient is separated from, at least, the stress and, to that extent, comes to some kind of peace with himself or herself and then the patient is sent back to the instigating cause, the source of that distress. The lady may have been beaten by her husband because he, poor man, is working in the wrong job or has a drink problem, has too many children or is married to the wrong lady.  They are unhappy and unfortunate people.  To hand that person a handful of valium does not solve anything.</P>
    <P>It is this preoccupation with the mythology of the power of psychiatry and the power of psychiatric hospitals which is perpetuated in the Bill.  The Minister has completely ignored the substance of his enormous problem and has continued to accept the validity of the mumbo jumbo which passes for therapy in the average psychiatric institution.  It is very like the period in my time with regard to tuberculosis when we did so many terrible things, in good faith, to our people in the hope that we would make them better but sometimes we made them much worse.  It is like the infectious fevers until the specific medication and the improved social conditions came to hand and that was the end of our problem.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming psychiatrists for doing what they do.  They do the best they can in the circumstances, taking their background, their education, the <Col N="781" /> facilities given to them by the State and the general outlook.  However, they are still to a considerable extent in the witch-doctor, medicine-man state of medicine and they do their best to conceal this truth from society.  There is a need for care on the question of individual liberty and the danger of trusting the psychiatrist not because he is a dishonest or an immoral person or such like.  I do not wish to appear critical but because of the difficulty of this task and the need which has grown up to which he has unfortunately subscribed, of creating the impression that he is supplying the answer to our needs, he has to do this for his own sanity; otherwise, he would feel a complete fraud.  His life is made particularly difficult.</P>
    <P>Questions I should like to put for consideration relate to the difficulties that a psychiatrist faces on the issue of releasing someone likely to commit violent crime or who is likely to commit this violent crime on himself or herself, suicide.  It is a very serious dilemma and psychiatrists would like to share the responsibility for making that decision with someone else, with some lay people, people who can look at this matter from the outside, legal people or enlightened lay people.  It is one of the sources of the high bed occupancy in our institutions.  It is a perfectly reasonable fear of a psychiatrist that the individual he is dealing with will take his or her life if he or she leaves the hospital. If that happens the psychiatrist has to face the coroner's inquest and all the unpleasantness that involves.  He will be faced with the question of a person who will react violently and take someone else's life or assault a person and cause serious bodily harm.</P>
    <P>This is the dilemma which psychiatrists face.  It is one reason why they should welcome, instead of being apprehensive of review bodies.  Those review bodies should be welcomed as an attempt to share the responsibility of deciding whether a person is suited or prepared for life outside.  It may sound like moral cowardice to speak like that but it makes a lot of demands on the psychiatrist and it means that it can lead to a reluctance to take such a decision.  The result is that <Col N="782" /> the person who is under suspicion for suicide or homicide is kept indefinitely in an institution adding to the Minister's problem relating to our mental institutions. A number of people are kept in because of the difficulty of taking a decision whether to discharge a person who is a risk to himself or other people.</P>
    <P>Too much is asked of our psychiatrists. Too much is demanded of them and they are given too much power.  Too much is demanded in the way of expectations of what can be done by individuals in closed institutions to solve the social problems of society which are really the problems of the Departments of Social Welfare, Justice, the Taoiseach, Health and Education, if one is to consider the origins of distress in society.  Everybody seems to be quite happy to use the dreadful description &mdash; I hope I will not be misunderstood when I use it &mdash; of the human trashcan of psychiatry of the mental hospitals, the rejects, the unwanted.  My fear always was that I was giving a certain measure of respectability by my professional pretentions to this effectively callous and cynical rejection of the problem people and the incarceration of them in our benevolent jails, frequently on flimsy charges.  Obviously, in the case of old people there is no justification whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputies might begin to understand how the whole rationalisation of my approach to political attitudes stems from my concept of society.  Where one is faced with a lady running away from her fertility, having an unnecessarily high number of unwanted children, locking her up in an institution is a temporary solution.  It is an appalling solution in my view.  It breaks up the home and the family.  She is supplied with valium or one of the other drugs, when obviously society should be providing for effective family planning.  When a husband and wife are living in a continuing hate relationship to the detriment of their own relationship and their children's relationship, the answer is not a psychiatric hospital, but some kind of divorce legislation. People are living these terrible beehive existences in multi-rise and high-rise flats because of the bad planning of <Col N="783" /> society.  They are overcrowded or living with their in-laws.  More housing is the answer.</P>
    <P>These are the proposals the Minister should be putting to us.  We should not continue to accept the old 19th century concept of the closed institution and its merits.  It is a most damaging concept for the treatment of people who are unhappy in society.  It is a damaging to everybody involved.  There should be an attempt &mdash; there is nothing certain about it &mdash; to retain people in community centres in which they are encouraged to live normal lives, or as nearly normal as possible.  If an old person is being troublesome in the home, he or she could be taken into a community centre for the day and in that way ease the burden on the parents or the children.  Difficult people in society should be taken off the hands of parents and children and treated normally within a community centre.</P>
    <P>By sending them off to a closed institution, a process which the Minister is facilitating in this Bill, we are making little or no contribution to the real problem in society.  Some of our approaches to these things are interesting.  We should attempt to help people to maintain a sense of normality instead of imposing the idea of sickness and invalidism and institutionalisation.  We should look after these individuals within society and send them to swimming pools, to the seaside, on bus tours, to the theatre, the cinema, singing pubs or race meetings.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to get money to take people on a bus tour to the swimming pool in Blackrock but money is available for the most costly and exclusive drugs to stupify individuals, which is what these drugs do.  They changes the personality of the person.  I consider it a great impertinence for any individual to change the personality of another individual in order to suit society, and to make him adapt to society rather than changing society and making it possible for him to live a normal life.  Money is available for the most costly drugs or appliances, or procedures, out other possibly more effective forms of care for these people are ruled as unacceptable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> The Minister will get two views on this. He will probably be applauded by some of the patriarchs living out their viceregal lives in these great institutions with the best will and the best intentions in the world, but completely destroying the individuals within the institutions.  On the other hand, I can assure him that attempts are being made to change the approach to the stress problems in society. There are new social attitudes to legislation on divorce and contraception, housing, social supports, domiciliary care for old people.  Dozens of different kinds of amenities should be available to keep these people out of mental hospitals.  This would be of advantage to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of education mentioned by Deputy Brady, Deputy O'Connell and others.  We have desperately seriously inadequate educational facilities for parents, and not just mothers, on the whole question of the complexity of the process of psycho-sexual development of youngsters in personality formulation.  There is virtually total illiteracy on this subject which does so much damage and which is the source of so many pictures of emotional distress in later life because of the damage done in the first nine years of life by ill-advised parental attitudes.  There is no reference to this.  There is no suggestion that the Minister believes this is seriously necessary, or that he has made any provision for it.  In fact, as we know, we are cutting the estimate for this sector of the Department.</P>
    <P>There are the other great social diseases like tuberculosis and fevers which affect the mass of the people predominantly. There is very little one can do with the end product of the defective social conditions in society.  The psychiatrist is there to conceal society's inadequacies. But the solution lies in the schools, in the homes, in recreation, in what is called quality of life, the size of classes, job choice, suitability, vocational advice and in an important feature in our society which is very damaging indeed, the physical punishment of children in childhood.  Where it is clear that there is no cure beyond the cure I have suggested of prevention, there is a need for research <Col N="785" /> for a so far undiscovered cure.  There is no question of serious moneys intended for research, so it must be clear to the Minister why I cannot agree with a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we will be able to deal with some matters in greater detail. In relation to the voluntary patient the Minister has not made it completely clear.  The voluntary admission was a great advance in 1945, but the only point is that the Royal College of Psychiatry is worried about the possibility of a voluntary patient who would turn out to be a suicide risk or a homicide risk.  What can we do about these people?  It is quite a problem because, obviously, if the hospital breaks faith with a voluntary patient such as this who then decides that he does not wish to come in and the hospital says that he will have to, it would be very damaging to the hospital and the hospital can be quite sure that they will never see him again.  That can be discussed later on on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Along with Deputy O'Connell I do not understand section 16&mdash;removal to Garda Síochána station of person believed to be suffering from severe mental disorder.  Everybody would have his own meaning for the phrase &ldquo;severe mental disorder&rdquo;.  To that extent it is meaningless and it is slipshod to include it in the Bill.  This occurs again in section 19.</P>
    <P>I have already commented on whether the business of a second practitioner is an advance.  Deputy O'Connell and Deputy E. Collins referred to the difficulty of getting two doctors in rural areas. I am greatly in favour of increasing the safeguards of the person being admitted but I am not sure if the second doctor is a serious safeguard as well as being a difficulty in an emergency in a rural area. If I thought that added greatly to the protection of the person's individual liberty and rights I would not mind the inconvenience, but this question can be considered further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The right of the inspection of dwellings is a very dangerous right to give and it can be dealt with later.  I am interested in the question of transfer.  Section 29 says:</P>
    <P>A person detained in a psychiatric <Col N="786" /> centre may, in his own interest, be transferred to another psychiatric centre in accordance with this section after consultation with the person and, if available, with the applicant for the reception of the person in the centre.</P>
    <P>Section 30 says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may designate a district psychiatric centre or part of any such centre as a special psychiatric centre for the transfer under section 31.</P>
    <P>That means to Dundrum, does it not?  I would be very slow to accept that principle. A person coming into a mental hospital as a voluntary patient could be certified and he could then find himself under this section transferred to Dundrum. That is outrageous.  This could happen in the circumstances of the sudden uncontrollable violence of somebody. I referred to a mental hospital as a benevolent jail but there is no doubt that Dundrum is anything but a benevolent jail.  A big headline in one issue of last week's <i>Irish Independent</i> referred to new security measures for the hospital and said</P>
    <P>Security at the Central Mental Hospital in Dublin &mdash; where a gang attempted to spring a convicted killer last Monday &mdash; is to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to deal with plans for the electrification of the wall and the building of a control room to monitor it. Whatever about the poor people who are sent there from courts, it is certainly a terrible place for the poor devil who goes into a mental hospital as a voluntary patient and then finds himself in this dreadful place.  This will certainly not be what he had intended when he walked into the hospital.  Is the Minister happy about this?  Would it not be better to create an institution if necessary for all the people who suffer from emotional disturbances of one kind or another including psychopaths?  I disagree with the proliferation of institutions but I would prefer to see an alternative to going to this dreaded place in our culture, the Dundrum Mental Hospital.  I will oppose that on Committee Stage.  My <Col N="787" /> suggestion would simplify conditions on occasions where there are particularly difficult cases.  The section as it stands would give rise to an undesirable development and I intend to oppose it.</P>
    <P>I wish I could be more helpful to the Minister as regards the form the review body should take.  The number of doctors should be greatly outweighed and non-medical people should be in a majority. The Minister may come back and ask, are they the only people capable of making a definitive, worthwhile decision? The Minister has moved away from acceptance of the fact that the doctor is the final, correct and only person to make a decision and, having done so, he should stick to that and increase the size of the review body so that instead of having three people there should be five.  However, that is something we can discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I presume the question of legal aid has been looked at from the point of view of people who make appeals to the High Court following committal.  I am not sure about the question of the Medical Council with the consent of the Minister making rules about treatment, although I am not a person to be worried about the curtailment of rights of members of the medical profession.  Indeed I have spoken against it throughout my contribution on the Bill.  I can imagine the Medical Council agreeing to proposals which could be disagreeable and because of that they could become acceptable when they should not be.  If we look back we can see what we did in regard to other diseases, blood letting, leeches, the extraordinary things we did in tuberculosis &mdash; as O'Shaughnessy said in <i>The Doctor's Oilemma</i>&ldquo;stimulate the phagocytes&rdquo;, the attempt by us to deal with something which is way above our capacity &mdash; the use of leucotomy, the cutting out of parts of people's brain, insulin shock treatment and ECT, which is still used in convulsive therapy and which is real which doctor medicine, irrational and undesirable.  It is still widely used.  It would be better to leave it to the individual doctor's discretion. He is answerable to society and to <Col N="788" /> his patient for what he does.  However, this is something that can be discussed.</P>
    <P>This is an advance on what was there before but it is a sad feature of the record of the Fianna Fáil Party and this Government with the great advances made by them in the 1945 and 1947 Acts that all one sees now in legislation is a depressing conservatism which has completely dominated the thinking of the party.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to show how remote this Bill is from the needs of the time. This Bill will be out of date in a relatively short time and this is sad particularly when it may have to last us for another 40 years.  It is a pity that a young Minister, new to his Department, could not have adopted a more enlightened attitude.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a great effort by the Minister to rationalise the situation regarding mental hospitals.  Most speakers have criticisms of different aspects of the Bill but it has been welcomed in principle by everyone concerned. I found it most interesting listening to Deputy Browne go through the different problems that he as a practising psychiatrist has.  I also found Deputy O'Connell's contribution interesting because of his medical involvement. It is worth while having people from different walks of life in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from a rural constituency and not having any medical background I have an interest as a public representative in this field.  I endeavoured to view psychiatric hospitals in my constituency and adjoining it over the last few months.  I was endeavouring to see the facilities that were there for the patients and staff.  I felt if I had an opportunity to see the institutions, meet the patients and staff I would be in a better position to make a worthwhile contribution in relation to the Bill.  My best efforts failed.  I was refused entry, point blank, into St. Brigids' Hospital in Ballinasloe and St. Patrick's in Castlerea, County Roscommon.  I made the application in what I felt was a proper and appropriate way.  I wrote to the chief executive officer of the western health board, Mr. Hannon, and sought permission to go and see both these institutions. <Col N="789" /> In due course I was told the matter was being considered by an appropriate standing committee of the health board. In May this year I wrote to Mr. Hannon and said:</P>
    <P>I wish to inform you that I am amazed at this matter having to be referred by your board to an appropriate standing committee.  As a public representative representing my constituency I feel I have a duty to visit both hospitals and I intend to carry out my duty with or without your permission.</P>

I was met with courtesy by the nurses involved, both male and female.  I was told that &ldquo;If I wished to see a patient or member of the staff facilities would be made available to me, with no escort to be provided, and those people would be brought to me or I would be brought to them depending on their condition.  To avoid embarrassment I withdrew from both those hospitals on that day in the hope that this Bill which was being discussed at that stage would be before the Oireachtas and I would be in a position to make an input into that Bill through the Minister, Deputy Woods, to ensure that public representatives as a right could visit mental institutions within or adjoining their constituencies. In due course I received a letter from the CEO of the Western Health Board, Mr. Hannon.  I do not wish to go into detail.  I am quoting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Dealing with the Health (Mental Services) Bill which is before the House for its Second Reading, we should encourage the open-type institutions to allow the members of the public to visit them.  Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Browne and Deputy Brady referred to the fact that quite often people are particularly  <Col N="791" /> interested in visiting mental institutions.  The person in charge of St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe would support that.  The superintendent of that hospital in his annual report said that many patients were dead in all but name. That is a sad situation indeed, but I am hoping that with the assistance of this Bill we, as public representatives, and the public generally would have rights of visitation. It is very important that Members of Dáil Éireann or the Oireachtas generally would have the right by application to visit institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Magill</i> magazine in their October 1980 edition, volume 4, no. 1, had an article by Helen Connolly who was carrying out research work for the magazine.  It was a very detailed article on mental institutions throughout the State.  After making 80 telephone calls to the Western Health Board, Helen Connolly gained access to St. Brigid's and St. Patrick's Hospitals and yet a public representative elected by the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim was refused entry.  Something will have to be done to ensure that public representatives have the right to visit these institutions.  In the statement that I obtained from the people in charge of the Western Health Board I was informed that &ldquo;Being a public representative does not <i>ipso facto</i> confer any rights on you to visit any of my board's installations above any other public representative or member of the public.  As a member of the public you are entitled to visit patients during normal visiting hours, having regard to any restrictions in relation to the medical and nursing condition of the patients concerned.&rdquo;  That is not right. The public would be satisfied if public representatives had special facilities so that they could visit the health boards' institutions and psychiatric hospitals to see at first hand the situation prevailing there.  It would be in the interest of patients and the staff and everyone concerned if the Oireachtas Members and public representatives in general were invited to see and examine the situation in psychiatric hospitals.  I have no experience whatever of seeing the institutions in this country.  I was debarred from fulfilling  <Col N="792" /> my constitutional duties as a representative to represent the people of my constituency.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of patients who are at present in these institutions have rights of representation just as have the general public outside.  The patients have voting rights and can vote if the medical superintendent feels that they are capable of doing so.  If they have those rights to elect their representatives they have the right also to see the public representatives in the institutions, and no CEO of any health board should be in a position to deprive public representatives of that right.  I appeal to the Minister to consider, in the context of this Bill, extending or amending section 36 which states:</P>
    <P>(1)  A designated medical officer of the Minister shall visit and inspect once in each year every special, district and registered psychiatric centre and shall report to the Minister on the visit.</P>
    <P>It goes on to deal with the two other aspects.  In that area the Minister should be entitled to grant permission to a Member of the Oireachtas to visit a psychiatric centre anywhere in this country.  A simple amendment should be included there providing that the Minister would have the right through application from the Member of the Oireachtas to authorise that Member visit the institution.  Allowing this facility would safeguard the health of the patients and it would ensure that the situation would not develop where CEOs would have the dictatorial powers to prevent a public representative from carrying out his responsibilities and duties.</P>
    <P>I know from contact with nurses and other people involved in the psychiatric services that they are a very dedicated group of people and they were most anxious in both institutions that I would have an opportunity of visiting them.  It was implied at some stage that the trade unions objected to the visit of an Oireachtas Member.  I say that the CEO of the Western Health Board was responsible for depriving me of an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to section 37, under which review boards will be set up in each region, the Minister might consider during Committee Stage some provision whereby review boards would have power to authorise public representatives to visit institutions in their constituencies. At the moment public representatives throughout the country have not got authority to enter psychiatric hospitals to visit or to meet patients.  This is a sad situation and in this debate we have an opportunity to do something about it.  I speak not only for myself but for all Deputies.  The Minister for Health, as inspector of institutions, has a right to go to these institutions, but only as Minister for Health.  As the law stands any other Minister could be refused permission to visit such institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell has told me he has been allowed into institutions, but the legal position is that public representatives have not got a right <i>per se</i> to go into institutions to visit or to examine conditions.  It will be many years possibly before we have a similar Bill in the House and we should avail of this opportunity to convey to the Minister the concern of many people in this respect. I receive many letters and telephone calls from people concerned about this lack of rights for public representatives <i>per se</i> to visit relatives or constituents or to inspect the conditions in which they live.</P>
      <P>The <i>Magill</i> article to which I referred was enlightening to me.  Because I had not permission directly to have contact with the institutions in my constituency I had to rely on second hand information provided in <i>Magill</i> in regard to conditions in these institutions.  Many improvements have been carried out in psychiatric hospitals but it is not right or proper that a public representative must rely on a popular magazine to find out what is happening in institutions in his constituency.</P>
      <P>With the secretive approach of the Western Health Board in regard to the two institutions in my constituency I was amazed that they allowed a photographer and a reporter into these institutions. They produced photographs which identified individuals in these institutions. These photographs could create difficulties for relatives of those involved.  However, the magazine exposes the situation and it is only right that the public should be made aware of the conditions in psychiatric hospitals.  It is right that relatives of those in such institutions should be requested to visit patients as often as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A frightening statistic is that which shows that, in 1971, 3,500 patients had been in psychiatric hospitals for 25 years or longer.  They have lived their lives in these institutions and have never received a call or a letter from relatives or friends.  A book had been written about a person in my constituency who was left in an institution practically all her life.  She had been put in there by her parents who then forgot all about her, <Col N="795" /> who died, and she was left there never having had an opportunity to come out to the light.  She is now outside and in great health.</P>
    <P>This Bill will assist people in such a situation because the review bodies will be there to draw attention to their plight. People will now be able to go to the review bodies with requests to have cases examined.  That is a very good feature of the Bill, thanks to the great work done by the Department of Health, by the Taoiseach when he was in charge of that Department and by the present Minister. The Bill may also help to solve the social ills which cause many people to end up in psychiatric hospitals.  On the other hand it was unrealistic of Deputy Noel Browne to suggest that we should have a Bill which would solve all modern day social ills and the problems of modern living.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very good step forward because it will give certain rights to people. It will ensure that people will not be put into institutions without certification by two doctors that they are in need of psychiatric treatment.  There is a sad comment in the magazine article to which I referred earlier in regard to an old man of 104 years who was put into an institution in 1916.  Since then he has not received a single visitor.  That is a sad reflection on our Christian Society.  That person has endured a living death in that institution.</P>
    <P>I do not have the experience of the medical people but my contribution is made from the humanitarian point of view because I feel I have been elected by the people not just to promote popular issues.  As Deputy Browne said, our job is to make an effort to help all the people, whether they have voting rights or not.  It is our duty and responsibility to act for the underprivileged in our society.  People in psychiatric hospitals, particularly long-term patients, are among the most under-privileged and deprived sections of our community.  Any funds needed to ease the situation for these people should be made available.</P>
    <P>Members of this House should get firsthand experience in these institutions.  We <Col N="796" /> should be able to meet patients and staff. The staff members in these institutions are very dedicated people who work under extremely difficult circumstances with very difficult patients and, often, with very little reward.  I know many of these nurses who work above and beyond their duty.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I met a nurse who brought one or two patients to a race meeting in Roscommon at his own expense, so that they could enjoy themselves. I know the Minister will provide any funds necessary to encourage these outings because the nurses are prepared to work beyond their normal duties to help these patients.  After so many years in these institutions there is a very close involvement between the nursing staff and the patients.  Many of these patients are long-term and nurses could have close contact with the same patients for the whole of their careers.  Some very good relationships have been built between nurses and patients.  I never hear any complaints against any of the nursing staff of any institutions in my county.  I hear only the highest praise for their work.  This praise extends not only to the nursing staff but to superintendents and all the medical staff involved.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years the staffing situation has improved.  In 1950 there were 62 psychiatrists, 13 junior medical officers and 3,311 psychiatric nurses and attendants employed in district mental hospitals.  The corresponding figure for last year was 120 psychiatrists, including about 90 of consultant status, approximately 100 junior medical staff and 5,750 nurses and attendants.  In addition, the service now includes about 20 psychologists, 20 psychiatric social workers, 30 occupational therapists as well as a small number of psychiatric therapists.  This is a good development.  The Minister and the Department are always willing to provide extra staff to ensure that the best nursing care is provided.</P>
    <P>I have had contact with the outpatient department of St. Brigid's Hospital, which provides occupational therapy. Many patients are employed re-covering furniture.  This has given them a great interest in life.  Work on farms attached <Col N="797" /> to the hospitals should be encouraged and I object strongly to any of these farms being sold, because they are providing very useful work for patients.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister notes my concern about the visitation rights of public representatives. I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of contributions from all sides of this House.  The views of experienced people should be of great assistance to the Minister.  When this Bill is passed it will be a major step forward in the health care and mental services area. This very useful legislation was badly needed.  Each section must be looked at in detail so that this Bill will be as perfect as possible when it becomes law and will provide full protection for people in our institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of saying a few words on this area of social and medical concern.  I join with our spokesman, Deputy Boland, who has already comprehensively outlined our views on this matter and I want to supplement the case put forward.  I do not join in the euphoria of Deputy Leyden's remarks about this being a beautiful Bill. Its primary advantage in terms of this Parliament is to allow us an opportunity to discuss an often almost forgotten area of public concern, that is, people who are obliged to be contained in places of treatment for the mentally ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context the Bill seems to be extremely restrictive rather than enabling. It is, in essence, a Bill about regulation pertaining to involuntary detention and places far too little emphasis on the growing importance of voluntary submission for treatment and of other categories of mental impairment or degrees of psychological or psychiatric derangement, whether that be for temporary, short-term or long-term problems.  The remit of the Bill is excessively narrow and focuses mainly on institutions and doctors and fails very largely to take account of this burgeoning growth of non-institutional care and often non-medical therapy facilities, including counselling centres, community centres, alcohol treatment centres and family therapy practitioners whose activities are free <Col N="798" /> from any accountability.  There seems to be very little recognition in the Bill of a citizen's right to treatment, let alone any indication that such people would be treated equally, and I include in that the psychiatrically ill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is redolent of a curious pointing to the past, as it were, in that it addresses itself to hypothetical problems, preventing improper detention, which is very important.  But it seems to be deficient in the sense that it does not leave open the way to development and evolution in this area.  The 1945 Act which the Bill is updating had many safeguards and precautions which, in terms of volume at least, are omitted from this much more limited proposal before us.  Many of the problems faced by psychiatric patients seem to be ignored and in some respects the legislation would appear to be excessively penal.  I am not happy that there should be such deficiencies in the Bill and I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister may find it possible to incorporate some of the suggestions put forward by Deputy Boland and by others. The Irish Medical Associations Psychiatric Group, the Irish Division of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties as well as other bodies have put forward good and comprehensive submissions, many of which outline areas in which improvement is needed.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I am saddened that on those rare occasions on which specific types of legislation come before the House, they seem to lack so much.  One would imagine that this Bill, having been in preparation for so long and having been in pursuit, allegedly, of the very fundamental promises in the election manifesto, would be comprehensive and all-embracing, and those promises were fundamental but if we are to assume that this is how they are to be met, all I can say is that we are all very disappointed because this is an area in respect of which there has been much suspicion, anxiety and concern.  All of us have heard of instances relating to the manner in which people were admitted to mental hospitals and detained, sometimes, allegedly, in situations in which there was very little <Col N="799" /> wrong with them.  This situation was difficult to specify but it caused much anxiety. The Bill, either as it is or as it may be amended, should be capable of being utilised so as to ensure that the case of every person in one of these institutions at present would be reconsidered and that the detention of any individual should be open to regular review.  No-one should ever be detained in an institution in circumstances that are not absolutely bona fide.</P>
    <P>The Bill is Sub-titled:</P>
    <P>AN ACT TO MAKE FURTHER AND BETTER PROVISION FOR THE REGULATION OF THE CARE AND TREATMENT OF PERSONS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL DISORDERS AND TO PROVIDE FOR RELATED MATTERS.</P>
    <P>In reality, the words &ldquo;and treatment&rdquo; are superflous and do not apply in the Bill in which there is scant regard to the whole question of treatment.  I join with the Royal College of Psychiatrists in suggesting that the Bill might be re-subtitled more accurately as an Act to make provision for the registration and supervision of psychiatric centres and for the detention in psychiatric centres of persons suffering from mental disorders and to provide for related matters.  In other words, let us be honest about what is involved. The Bill is fundamentally a regulatory piece of legislation relating to the method of induction and of containment of such patients, a matter which in itself is very important.  I should not like the impression to go abroad that the Bill is comprehensive and deals with the many needs of those people who, unfortunately and tragically, suffer from mental distress of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Let us ask how serious is the problem. Deputy Boland has given us some figures in this regard but I should like to add to those.  In the NESC Report entitled <i>Major Issues in Planning Services for Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons</i>, on the question of the numbers <Col N="800" /> of mentally handicapped, paragraph 2.1.2 reads, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The principal source of information on the numbers of mentally handicapped persons in Ireland is the census conducted in 1974.  Apart from persons in residential care who were functioning at a mild level of mental handicap, the Census was confined to moderate, severe and profound handicap.  Considering these groups only, 11,256 persons were returned as mentally handicapped in the Census, almost 56% of whom were in a variety of residential centres and 44% of whom were living at home.  Fifty-three percent of the total group were moderately mentally handicapped, 33% were severely mentally handicapped and 14% were profoundly handicapped.  The overall ascertained prevalence was 3.8 per 1,000 population.  Focusing on the 15-19 age group, which is usually used for comparative purposes since it is generally accepted that all cases of moderate, severe and profound handicap will have been ascertained by this age, the prevalence rate was found to be 5.17 per 1,000 of the population.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the figures available to us show that this country, for a combination of historic, demographic and social reasons, has the highest rate of psychiatric beds <i>per capita</i> of any country in the world &mdash; presumably that is any country in which statistics are kept &mdash; with the exception, arguably, of Finland.  In 1971 there were 16,700 patients in our psychiatric hospitals, about 60 per cent of which were not voluntary.  This figure compares with about 10 per cent in the UK at the same time and it underlines the importance of trying to transmute those areas of involuntary detention into the encouragement of voluntary detention and voluntary attendance at centres for treatment.</P>
    <P>In the past the position in this country was that any suggestion of mental affliction of any kind was a matter of shame but that attitude in itself was a shame. We should encourage and foster a willingness on the part of patients to attend <Col N="801" /> voluntarily where there is a suggestion of mental handicap or affliction.  It appears from the figures supplied to us that there is a greater proportion of mental illness in the west, the north-west and the southwest regions of the country and that the larger numbers of hospital beds are in certain counties.  Perhaps the origins of much of this mental illness are to be found in economic deprivation, in the small farm situation and in a certain amount of involuntary celibacy which is a serious issue having regard to the consequent loneliness that arises from it and the trauma which this implies for people. In 1971, some 30 per cent of patients were more than 65 years old.  It has been the practice to put some old people into mental institutions because there was nowhere else for them to go.  This means that there are people languishing in some of these institutions who should not be there at all.  These are people who have been befriended by the institutions concerned but who would be more properly at home in some other caring context.</P>
    <P>Not everybody who suffers from mental illness is treated as an in-patient.  In 1975, about 30,000 people attended outpatients clinics.  These may have included alcoholics and drug addicts.  The problem is very serious.  The Association for the Rights of The Mentally Handicapped, together with other voluntary groups involved in this area and to whom I should like to pay a tribute, assert that on the basis of the findings of a report conducted by the Minister's Department, 2,000 persons now in residential care could live in the community if there were available the necessary back-up and social care network.  It is asserted also that 2,000 persons who should be in residential care are living at home.  This is because the development of the appropriate facilities has not kept pace even with inflation and that most of the capital investment, in so far as there has been any &mdash; and it has been reducing in recent years &mdash; has been orientated towards trying to improve the facilities in many cases.  We must all agree that the facilities need improving.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is Saint Brendan's Hospital which, as we all know, is <Col N="802" /> a centre about which there has been a great deal of controversy, particularly in regard to the deficiencies in terms of facilities there.  When I visited that hospital some time ago I did not experience the difficulty which the Minister's colleague, Deputy Leyden, had in visiting other institutions.  I join with him in underscoring the importance of public access, not only for public representatives but for anybody with a genuine concern in those areas.  On the occasion of my visit to St. Brendan's Hospital and since then, in correspondence with interested parties associated with that institution, I have been made aware that the doctors, psychiatrists, nursing staff, catering staff and all the people involved are struggling to do a difficult job in unacceptable circumstances.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to pay particular attention to that institution because his predecessor, now the Taoiseach, indicated such a priority would be accorded to St. Brendan's.  The conditions at present there are unacceptable. Many of us were jolted recently by an article in <i>Magill</i> which showed up the visual aspect of the physical conditions in part of that institution.  I hope it will urge us all to ensure that increased capital expenditure for mentally handicapped institutions is made available, bearing in mind that such capital expenditure involves significant job creation which I am sure the Minister and his colleagues would welcome.</P>
    <P>There are 2,500 mentally handicapped people in psychiatric and geriatric institutions. It is appalling, on visiting some of those institutions, to see people who, with the exception of some interested members of the Department of Health and some of the voluntary organisations supporting the work of those institutions, are forgotten.  I have seen men and women standing or sitting all day, often engaged in nothing else but wasting away.  I doubt if that has to be the way. Under this Bill, the board which the Minister refers to should be enlarged and given extra powers to ensure that we review every case at present in such institutions, and not allow such a review to be dependent on a request from the individual.   <Col N="803" /> There is a lot of that type of approach in the Bill.  People who are psychiatrically ill, people who are mentally unwell, people who suffer from mental affliction of one kind or another, may not be the best arbiters on whether or not their interests are served by a request for a review, a request for release or a request for any other type of care.  I would like to see an opportunity being given for such reassessment at regular intervals, more than is given in the Bill. Some of the measures in the Bill omit some of the protective elements in the 1945 Act, for example in relation to visiting committees, all of which should be replaced so that greater access is given and better opportunities for closer monitoring of people in such institutions.  The extent of the problem is serious and should not be underestimated.</P>
    <P>There are specific issues in the Bill which can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  We may be taking an opportunity of putting down an amendment to change the sub-title.  I understand I have to do this on Second Stage if I wish to introduce an amendment on the actual change in the title.  Section 3 of the Bill in relation to the interpretation of mental disorder and severe mental disorder is far too vague.  It is an improvement on the 1945 Act in this respect but a clear definition should be provided since the concept in itself is not self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>Section 19(5) refers to a person suffering from severe mental disorder and a certification if that is the case.  Would the Minister consider some way whereby that certificate need not be a permanent arrangement?  If, for some reason, there is a temporary psychiatric disorder or mental ill health of some kind, which is a transient problem, which may be caused by an emotional upheaval in the person's life, will there be against the name of that person permanently a certificate that he or she at some stage has suffered from severe mental disorder?  I do not believe it is necessary to make it that permanent in some cases.  The first thing is the interpretation and definition of mental disorder and severe mental disorder. I would like a clear definition of <Col N="804" /> those and we should not shirk from trying to define them.</P>
    <P>Section 8 refers to the question of offences. The section omits the sanctions against ill-treatment, neglect, sexual offences and mis-statements which the existing law provides in sections 253 to 255. The Bill should be re-analysed in general with a view to re-writing into it those protective and helpful areas of the 1945 Act, which have been omitted or else the omissions should be justified.  They have not been and I believe, on balance, they weigh in favour of the patient.  I would like to see them re-entered.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the voluntary admission of patients.  This area is likely to grow and develop and we should encourage it.  Voluntary admission at an early stage can often prevent irreparable mental illness at a later stage.  We should not shy away from emphasising the importance of voluntary admission.  Section 13 states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Part shall be read as preventing or discouraging a person from being admitted voluntarily for care and treatment in a psychiatric centre.</P>
    <P>It is the only mention in the Bill of voluntary treatment of mental illness. The section could be expanded to include a statement of policy and intentions regarding the various existing and projected mental services that are not otherwise dealt with in the Bill.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to expand in relation to this increasingly important area of voluntary admissions bearing in mind that they are the greater number of people treated in this situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is confined to a minority of people which should not be the case.  We should expand this section and underscore the attention which the community, and I hope the psychiatric and medical professions, will increasingly give to areas of mental ill health analagous to any other area of health at the moment where people voluntarily go along to prevent a deterioration in their health.  We are reluctant to do that in the context of mental health.  I join with the report of the NESC in beseeching the Minister to consider the special problem in this area <Col N="805" /> and to launch an educational programme in it.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is very open to that kind of suggestion and has, with his predecessor, undertaken very valuable preventative health education in a number of areas.  This is a very good and sensible approach and I would ask that it be exteneded to the somewhat thorny, but nevertheless very important area of mental health education.  That would facilitate the development of an increasing degree of voluntarism in this whole area, which is the ideal if one can arrive at it. Section 13, therefore, should be rewritten, or extended to take that into account.</P>
    <P>Section 16 relates to the removal to a Garda Séochána station of a person believed to be suffering from severe mental disorder.  The section gives powers to the Garda to take a person believed to be severely mentally disorientated or disordered into custody.  Unfortunately, that is the only form of crisis intervention in the whole Bill and it is not adequate, to that extent.  In the context of this section, I mention specifically that the section itself could usefully be extended to include a statement of policy and intention, again, regarding the whole area of dealing with people who are in severe mental distress.  The whole section itself otherwise, unless it has that kind of development, could very well be omitted, provided that the section on crisis intervention were to be inserted and enlarged. There are other ways whereby people can intervene where mental disorder is evident rather than have Garda Sáochéna involvement.  I would expect and assume that the Garda Sochána &mdash; and statistics bear this out &mdash; would be reluctant, on balance, to become involved in this area. It is not the ideal, in the sense that the Garda Síochána, as guardians of the peace, are involved primarily with a different type of problem in our community. The section is somewhat misguided in that respect.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with the recommendation for reception and sets out the statutory requirements for compulsory detention.  This section has one or two problems as well as the one already <Col N="806" /> referred to, the degree to which a person suffering temporary disorder of some kind might find himself unnecessarily &mdash; dare I use the word stigmatised? &mdash; for a lifetime.  I am not suggesting that because a person is mentally unwell there is a stigma on him at all.  However, certain people in our society, unfortunately, will react in a certain way.</P>
    <P>I can imagine a case where a fiancáe could, if the engagement broke down, be extremely emotionally upset and liable for some kind of treatment.  That would pass in due course, but there would be a statement on the record that that person had suffered severe mental disorder.  It is the gravity of those words, applying to that particular circumstance, in the long term, which might be unnecessary and might cause as much harm as it does good.  Again, the questions of mental illness raised in this section are very vague and unspecified and should be very clearly defined.</P>
    <P>Section 21 talks about the question of an escort.  This is where a registered medical practitioner, making a recommendation for reception of a person, certifies that an escort is required.  In my view, this could be enlarged.  The provision therein is basically in relation to Garda escorts.  I see no reason why others could not be incorporated, such as psychiatric staff, a nurse in the appropriate circumstances, or anybody with a caring interest in the patient, again, to try to get this into the proper medical context, out of the areas of what Deputy Browne earlier referred to as benevolent prison.  I would ask the Minister to be good enough to comment on that.</P>
    <P>Section 23 deals with reception and detention and lays down procedures to be followed at the actual centre.  It does not detail the grounds on which a reception order should be made by the psychiatrist. The assumption appears to be that they are the same as applicable to the general practitioner in section 19.  However, once again they should be clearly and specifically indicated.  The less room for nebulous interpretation and confusion in any section, particularly when dealing with a Bill like this, the better. The reason, particularly in a Bill like this, <Col N="807" /> is because the consequences of error are extremely serious.  They lead, or can lead to a lifetime of imprisonment in an institution.  Let us have the minimum room for misguided manoeuvre, accidentally or otherwise.  Let us be as specific as we can about the terms which we use.  It should be clearly stated that the patients may be admitted on a voluntary basis also, if willing, rather than just detained or discharged.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the actual form of reception order.  This provides for initial detention of 28 days from the date of admission, with a first extension to three months and a subsequent extension to 12 months.  I suggest that the initial period is exceptionally long.  Twenty-eight days is a long time.  One's behaviour pattern during that 28 days could very well conform to the expected norms.  It is not necessary or desirable to have a detention period longer than the minimum, although I do not know what the minimum is.  I would have thought something like a week would be enough, if you include at the end of that week the possibility of making a second detention order.  There could be people whom you wanted to release or who wanted to be released after a lot less than 28 days and might find that the onus might be on them to organise the mechanism whereby that release would take place.  The question of the initial period is important, because it could begin the slide to a much more permanent arrangement which would not be in the interest of the patient.</P>
    <P>Section 27 deals with the return of a person absent without leave.  Under this section a member of the Garda Síochána may enter without warrant any premises where he believes the person in question may be.  It seems to me that there is no compelling reason why this provision from the earlier Act should be retained: the belief that a person who is absent without leave, as it were, is on the premises and should be pursued by obtaining a warrant.  This is a small point, but could be important in certain circumstances.  I could see a situation where, for example, to put it frankly, that power could be abused.  A search without warrant could <Col N="808" /> be organised without any reason and could be justified on this basis.  I do not see a compelling reason why we could dispense with what is, after all, hardly more than an administrative formality but which, neverthless, gives that modicum of protection to a person's own home, which is sacrosanct in this country. I would like the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>Section 32 deals with the discharge of a patient and says that when a medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre is satisfied that detention and treatment in the centre are no longer necessary in the interests of a person's health or safety or for the protection of other persons or property, he should discharge the person. I ask the Minister to consider why the property criterion should enter in here. In this context I am speaking of the basic human rights of a person in this situation. The property criterion should not be included here, because if damage arises there is adequate law already to ensure that appropriate steps can be taken.  Secondly, if we manage our social welfare service properly, there will be a suitable transit period to ensure that that person will not incur the risk which is implicit in the rationale of the section.  Presumably the rationale of the section is that a person could cause damage.  A person's human rights should not be circumscribed by some imagined or professed danger to property of an unspecified nature.</P>
    <P>Section 34 talks about the furnishing of documents to detained persons.  That section states that the medical doctor shall on request give the patient a copy of the reception order.  It is an important principle in this or any other legislation when dealing with anybody in care, whether in prison or any other type of institution, that they should have access to the maximum degree.  In the area of mental ill health that access to information and furnishing of documents should not depend on the person making a request.  To some extent the thing is contradictory. The person is in the institution because his or her mental health is impaired to some degree.  Obviously, that <Col N="809" /> means their judgment is obscured or inhibited.  Therefore, they are not necessarily the best persons to decide whether to seek the furnishing of such documentation.</P>
    <P>Why not do the obvious thing and ensure that every person gets a copy of the documentation?  We cannot guarantee that people will need it or that they will utilise it in the proper manner.  But it is important, when talking about ill health, to ensure that one does not depend on the understanding or mental maturity of the patient to ask for the document.  If one did one could argue that that would be a criterion by which they would be released.</P>
    <P>It appears to me in the context of section 34 that the patient should be entitled to be given further copies on request after discharge up to a number of years afterwards. The reason is that sometimes it is after discharge, after the process of healing has taken place, that a patient is most likely to be in a position to seek redress if he or she considers that any injustice or irregularity has occured.  The 1945 Act gives the right to documents after discharge, although the six months' limit in it is too short, but that safeguard is not in the Bill before the House.  I am asking that it be re-inserted.  All such patients should be supplied with all documentation which any other patient can obtain on request.  The Minister should include that amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 35 deals with the forwarding of certain letters.  I consider it an important right that a person who is voluntarily or involuntarily committed to an institution should have privacy of mail.  There may be certain exceptions in a high security prison but we are not talking about a prison &mdash; if it is, it should not be.  Therefore, this section, implying as it does that psychiatric staff have a right to open patients' mail, needs reconsideration. The section should be reworded to specify that any letters shall be posted unopened, that staff at the centre shall be required to provide stationery and stamps for letters to authorities and friends and that the post box shall be available in the vicinity.  Apart from being a right it seems to me to be very <Col N="810" /> good therapy that a person should know that he or she is not isolated or cut-off. The impression one gets &mdash; I have some experience of this in my constituency from people who to some extent have been in and out of such institutions &mdash; is that such institutions are lonely, isolated, cutoff islands in the community.  The more community contact there is the better for everybody.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I have put forward is a simple way of maintaining contact with the community without any risk being associated with it.  It should not be forgotten that we are not talking about people who were convicted of being criminals; we are talking about people who were unwell in some respects.  The benefits to be gained by ensuring privacy of mail and the dignity that that accords to the individual far outweigh the theoretic disadvantages of some imagined danger to the security of the person.  That should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>Section 36 deals with the inspection of centres and homes.  The inspectors/duties should be more clearly defined and reports should be laid before the Oireachtas each year.  I understand that this requirement was the subject of Dáil questions last year and that the requirement that reports on conditions in our institutions being laid before the Oireachtas has not been properly fulfilled for the last two decades.  I understand that some effort has been made to update these reports.  The Minister is nodding I am glad to see that but I suspect that those reports are probably about five years out of date.</P>

      <P>I accept that is the best way to clear up the backlog, but the disuse into which such a practice has fallen is to be regretted.  I hope the Bill will specify that from now on we will have the reports of the inspectors annually. The duties of inspectors should be clearly spelt out so that the House and our people are given the maximum insight into our institutions.  I am glad the Minister is making some progress in that regard.</P>
      <P>Section 37 deals with psychiatric review boards.  That section establishes such boards, a new concept, and follows broadly the British model contained in their 1959 Act.  The membership of that board will be appointed <i>in toto</i> by the Minister, but I believe he should broaden the base.  I do not think it is necessary or desirable for a Minister to appoint all members involved in such boards.  There are obvious interests which might appropriately be put on such boards, such as consultant psychiatrists, legally qualified people nominated by the legal profession in pursuit of the rights of individuals, nominees of professional bodies, representatives of staff associations and nominees of the Minister.  If such boards are to be established they should reflect the widest possible spectrum of public interest. I have argued for the setting up of such boards in our prisons.  The boards proposed should be broadened and the terms of reference strengthened.  This major step forward in terms of public understanding and public accountability would be advanced if the Minister accepted my suggestion.  The idea of nominating three people is a half measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 38 deals with a review of detention, a fundamental element of the Bill. The section states that an application may be made to a review board to examine the propriety of the detention of any person detained in a special, district or registered psychiatric centre or the conditions applying to a person discharged conditionally.  It deals with the people who may make such applications.  It <Col N="812" /> seems that once again the provisions of the Bill are a little restrictive, although I accept that they represent a step forward. Hopefully, the spectre of the forgotten person in whom nobody has any interest, languishing unlisted to in some institutions will be a thing of the past.  I would hope that would be the case.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary under subsection (3) to go to the High Court to seek such a review.  Why not make it relatively easy for an interested party with a legitimate and <i>bona fide</i> interest in obtaining a review.  A friend or another person should be able to require a hearing, perhaps on the production of an affidavit stating his good faith.  Would that not be adequate?  If we are to err in this Bill, we should err on the side of the patient.  We should place as few restrictions as possible on anyone associated with the patient pursuing his well-being and welfare.</P>
    <P>One could argue that this section places too much onus on the patient to ensure the protection of his or her rights at a time when he or she is least able to pursue those rights.  This arises on more than one occasion in the Bill.  It is extraordinary, because we are talking about people whose mental state has been declared to have been somewhat impaired.  We should not expect the responsibility to rest primarily on such people in pursuit of their best interests.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with the decision of the review board.  Section 39 (1) should be re-worded to enable the board to decide that, while the propriety of a patient's detention may be established, detention is either not suitable or not necessary in the patient's case, and make such provision as would be appropriate in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 41 deals with long-term detention and Section 40 deals with the review of conditional discharge.  Section 41 (1) should be re-worded to incorporate necessity and suitability as factors for consideration by the board.  It reads: Where a person has been in detention under this Act for a period of two years the medical officer in charge of the centre shall, if the person's detention has not been reviewed by a review board during <Col N="813" /> the preceeding six months furnish a report on him to the appropriate review board within one month and the board shall review the propriety of his further detention and shall, as it thinks proper, decide that the person is properly detained, and so on.  I am suggesting that necessity and suitability could be included there as factors in deciding whether it is necessary to keep the person there any longer or whether it is in his best interests to be detained.  That does not seem to be stated explicitly and I should like it to be.  The least chance for confusion there is in this Bill, the better.</P>
    <P>Section 43 deals with oral hearings. The oral hearing unfortunately is not a mandatory requirement, if I am interpreting the section correctly.  The section provides that a review board may determine an application without an oral hearing where such a hearing is not requested by the applicant or where it appears to the board that such a hearing might be harmful to the health of the person concerned. There are many people whose case should be heard and reviewed but who will not request an oral hearing because they are not physically or mentally well enough, or because the necessary documents might not be supplied to them.  Those documents are given only on request as well.  There is a kind of domino theory about all this.  If they know about the availability of such processes, there is probably little justification for retaining them in the centre.  Some other type of care may be appropriate. The section should provide that all applications must be determined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not rely on the patient to be the best arbiter of his own interest.  I should like it to be written into this section, or some other section, that there should be an oral hearing in all cases at which the applicant should be represented or be present.  Section 44 deals with consent for certain treatments. This section could be amended because <Col N="814" /> many of the restrictions in the section concern drugs, which are the major form of treatment.  The Bill should specify that certain types of treatment, and specifically what is called electro-convulsive therapy, ECT, and neurosurgery or lobotomies must be included among restrictive treatments.  This is a delicate and difficult area.  I should not like to see a situation in which major surgery, or treatment fundamentally affecting the long-term personality of a patient, could be carried out against his or her will.  That appears to me to be allowed and facilitated in this section.</P>
      <P>In the 1945 Act the office of inspector of mental hospitals has extensive provisions. There is a strong argument to be made for spelling out in this Bill the duties implied in visiting and inspecting. I want regular reports and I want them based on certain criteria.  We have seen visiting committees' reports from other institutions which added very little to the sum of our knowledge or insight into those institutions.  Let us be as specific as necessary and give a clear mandate to such visitors and inspectors that certain things shall be investigated and reported on.  It is vital that an annual report should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am glad to see that a legacy of neglect and misuse which has built up is being dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 277 and 278 of the 1945 Act allow for the possibility of sworn inquiries. There is no comparable provision in this new Bill.  I know the possibility of having a sworn inquiry has not been taken up for a long time but, on balance, rather than leaving it out, it is better to have it in, for the protection of the patient.  The regulations under the 1945 Act provide for visiting committees to be set up by health boards and lay down detailed instructions about the regularity and scope of such visits.  Since the 1971 Health Act was enacted visiting committees in general medical institutions have had no legal or statutory basis, which was a weakening of their position.  This Bill, by repealing the 1945 Act, produces the same situation for mental institutions. Access, openess, links with the community, breaking down public anxieties and <Col N="815" /> suspicions to the maximum degree possible in all cases, are fundamental to a progressive and evolving approach to treating people who are mentally unwell. Accordingly I suggest that we should underline the importance of visiting committees and not just give them powers but let them know clearly and unambiguously that they are important in the context of ensuring the proper governing of these institutions.</P>
    <P>The 1945 Act provides that notice must be displayed informing patients of their right to send an open letter to certain authorities.  Although the Bill before us contains the right to ask questions, unaccountably it omits the provision about a notice.  Section 268 of the 1945 Act provides that all deaths in mental institutions should be reported within 12 hours to a coroner.  Because of the arguably very lax death certificate procedures in existence, this is a protection which should be retained.  If a death occurs in an institution of this nature, why not allay possible public disquiet by insisting on a measure which was seen as enlightened 35 years ago?  That is only sensible.</P>
    <P>The old Act gives the Minister power to order that a particular person be admitted to visit a patient.  Though little used it is a power that could be relevant and should be retained.  I would like to see that power retained in the hands of visiting committees as it is in context of prison visiting committees.  This is again a way of ensuring that there is access because the possibility of according such a visit can only be undertaken by the person who would give such a visit if he or she bears in mind the proper governing of the institution, so there should be no conflict.</P>
    <P>The old Act provides penalties for ill treatment or neglect including cases outside of institutions, of persons of unsound mind.  There is no reason why that should be dropped and with suitable modification it should be retained as a useful protection for mentally ill people both inside and outside the institution.  The 1945 Act had certain penalties for mis-demeanours committed against female mental patients and that should also be <Col N="816" /> retained as should section 255 of the 1945 Act which related to penalties for misstatement on certificates and records. Although these provisions were rarely utilised they were at least a fabric of possible protection in an area where abuses could accur and they should be included.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should try to separate psychiatrically ill patients from others.  There should be a clear division of different types of patients.  At the moment, mentally handicapped and geriatric patients occupy the same kinds of institutions.  It should be stated as well in the Bill that detained patients should have the right to refuse any treatment except where failure to treat is considered to render the patient a danger to himself and to others.  Under present and proposed legislation there are limited provisions for information to be given to patients and relatives.  That should be broadened.  There should be an obligation on the health boards to produce educational material and a positive mental health programme devised by the Minister to encourage the ending of what too often in the past was a kind of quiet shame.  That relic of another age should be dead and gone and we should see mentally ill people as being temporarily ill with their best interests being looked after.</P>
    <P>The Bill is highly hospital- and institution-centred and makes no mention of community care even though this is clearly the major direction that will be taken because of financial constraints and the natural progression of future developments. It will be useful to introduce enabling legislation giving a statutory basis and impetus to community care.  It is also desirable to make provision for medical staff to visit and treat patients outside the hospital.  The Bill should prescribe crisis intervention facilities to be made available by each health board. This might take the form of some kind of standby team which could be assigned to deal in a crisis situation with somebody who had urgent need of attention.  The only crisis intervention provision in the Bill lies with the Garda and they would be the first to admit that it is a task which <Col N="817" /> they are unenthusiastic about and for which in some cases they are unsuited.</P>
    <P>Although in practice few hospitals exercise close scrutiny of ingoing and outgoing mail we should underscore the importance of this question of privacy, facilitating the maximum amount of dignity to every patient.  There should be a statutory right of access to all institutions by public representatives and I am ashamed at the treatment that we understand, was meted out to Deputy Leyden. It should not have happened and should not be repeated.  In the context of affording patients the maximum dignity they should have at their disposal individual storage facilities such as lockers in which to keep their personal belongings.  They should also have a right to wear their own clothing and footwear maintained to a decent standard and they should have some pocket money where appropriate. These normal elements of civilised living would help them to feel as normal as possible.  If possible they should also be facilitated with a choice of doctor.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no provision for any complaints procedure other than the unopened letter to the Minister.  The 1945 Act provided channels of complaint to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and visiting committees.  I would like to see the Bill detailing readily acceptable procedures in order to protect the patient and to encourage him to respond wherever there is a perceived cause for concern.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which is deficient in many respects.  The Minister will probably say that this legislation is not designed to do a lot of what I have been talking about. It may not be, I would like to think the Minister could introduce a Bill of this nature every number of weeks but it is unlikely that we will talk about such an issue again for a long time.  Therefore a comprehensive Bill would have been helpful.</P>
    <P>The United Nations General Assembly Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons, Article 7, states that:</P>
    <P>Whenever mentally retarded persons are unable, because of the severity of their handicap, to exercise all their rights in a meaningful way or it should <Col N="818" /> become necessary to restrict or deny some or all of these rights, the procedure used for that restriction or denial of rights must contain proper legal safeguards against every form of abuse.  This procedure must be based on an evaluation of the social capability of the mentally retarded person by qualified experts and must be subject to periodic review and to the right of appeal to higher authorities.</P>
    <P>A number of the elements of that important declaration of the United Nations do not seem to find an echo in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I will address myself to a red herring which was brought in by Deputy Boland and has featured in the debate ever since.  To do what we want in this Bill we only need a small Bill because we are dealing only with the 10 per cent of patients who must be compulsorily detained in our psychiatric centres.</P>

      <P>The Health Acts give the enabling legislation that Deputies have repeatedly requested here during this debate.  I do not expect Deputies to be familiar with the powers available under the Health Acts but I cannot accept the criticism that this Bill should provide powers which are generally available in the Health Acts.  I compliment Deputies for their contributions.  Deputy Keating has given a very thoughtful and concerned contribution to this debate from his knowledge of the legal side in general rather than his knowledge of health law. Deputy Keating's points along with other points made by other Deputies will be taken into consideration in the course of considering what amendments are necessary on Committee Stage.  One Deputy <Col N="819" /> after another talked about the lack of political benefits in being involved in this area and the lack of public interest, yet the Deputies who came in showed themselves to be deeply and genuinely concerned and I will recognise that fact in responding to the debate.  It was encouraging.</P>
      <P>Naturally enough there was a great deal of comment on the general standards and conditions in mental hospitals.  There are other ways of dealing with that problem but not through this Bill.  Recently there has been a great deal of publicity on the standards of accommodation and treatment.  Some of that criticism has been highly selective.  I am fully aware from my visits to psychiatric units around the country of the fine facilities which have been provided by the administrations in many of our health board areas. I admit that some of our public psychiatric hospitals are very old and unsuitable for modern psychiatric in-patient services. These buildings are very costly to refurbish and renovate and the capital cost and time scale for replacement of such buildings is quite large.  I appreciate that a number of Deputies recognise this factor and the inherited antiquity of some of the facilities involved.</P>
      <P>The second point is that there has been a vast increase in admissions and we have had to deal with this side by side with the task of trying to deal with the problem of very large and unsuitable old accommodation. We have also had an increase in the need for community-related facilities. This places considerable strain on facilities generally.  In that context there has been an enormous development in the area of mental handicap.  If one looks at the expenditure in capital and current terms in that area one will see the tremendous benefit which is being achieved and the improvement in services which is being effected.  This is a natural development since mentally handicapped people are not being admitted to psychiatric centres unless they are severely disturbed as well.  This is only a relatively new development in actual terms but it has been a growing one in the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> In relation to admissions the 1977 figures suggest a levelling off with all categories being reduced except alcoholism. There has been an increased emphasis on alternatives to hospitalisation and on short stay acute facilities.  A great deal of work has been going on in that area and several of my predecessors have put considerable effort into it.  If we look at the number of patients hospitalised the total in 1969 was 15,775 or 5.4 per thousand of population.  By 1977 it was down to 13,288 or 4.1 per thousand of population.</P>
    <P>Recent criticisms of the psychiatric services, which were highly selective, were confined to the position of long-term detained patients highlighting the worst aspects of the service.  In the last ten years to December 1979 £11 million has been spent on capital development in this area and £339 million on current expenditure.  Since 1977 there have been 14 major schemes completed; 14 further ones are in progress and 22 others are at various stages of planning.  It is important to recognise the wonderful work going on in these services.  At the same time refurbishing and reorganisation of the old facilities is in progress.</P>
    <P>I referred to the importance of informal treatment in community care setting. This is an aspect which we regard as of paramount importance.  Day centres and the application of treatment in the home are areas which can prevent unnecessary hospitalisation while the increasing use of residential hostels to provide after care services for discharged patients can serve to provide rehabilitative care and minimise readmission.  In 1977 there were 30 supervised hostels within a community setting providing care for 300 patients. There are now 600 patients catered for in over 60 such hostels.  Community psychiatric services are provided by 200 psychiatric out-patient clinics and 150 community psychiatric nurses.  To listen to some Deputies speaking one would think very little was happening in this area but there is a big transformation and development going on.  These services are supported by 24 day hostels and care centres.  I have had the privilege of opening a number of these in recent times and the standard of <Col N="821" /> care which will be provided will be of the highest level.</P>
    <P>Although the Government have achieved a great deal in community care I must draw the attention of the community towards adopting a responsible attitude to those recovering from or suffering from psychiatric illness.  Many Deputies raised this point.  Efforts to provide community care facilities in certain areas have met concerted opposition from local groups such as residents' associations. The community simply cannot opt out of its responsibilities towards patients.  This is one factor which health boards have found a delaying one in the plans they have.  Hopefully it is one which is diminishing but it is only fair to say that it exists as a problem in the implementation of the services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland made reference to the United Kingdom Mental Health Act, 1959, and Deputy Keating repeated some references to it.  There was a review of the Mental Health Act, 1959, presented as a white paper by the Secretary of State for Social Services in September 1978. Chapter I, paragraph 1.1 states:</P>
    <P>The scope of the Mental Health Act, as amended by subsequent legislation, is now largely limited to compulsory powers of admission to and detention in hospital, and to safeguards for patients subject to such powers.</P>
    <P>In that respect one will find that the scope of that Act is coming to the kind of provisions we are making specifically for the 10 per cent who are affected here.  The paragraph goes on:</P>
    <P>It is on these issues that this White Paper concentrates.  Statutory powers for the provision of services for mentally ill and mentally handicapped people are contained in other legislation, and the underlying philosophy for the provision of such services has been outlined in other White Papers.  This Chapter considers whether changes are needed in the definition of mental disorder for the purpose of compulsory powers; but it also takes the opportunity to consider the position of informal (voluntary) patients, and whether <Col N="822" /> any legislative change is required in respect of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is not so different from here as the Deputy would have us believe.  The essential difference is that the UK law is too elaborate and it tends to militate against the making of the provision of services for the psychiatrically ill similar to those provided for any other illness.  The basic principle which we had in this Bill was to deal with the 10 per cent where detention was essential and, as far as possible, to make the rest of the provisions and treatment as similar as we could to treatment within a general hospital environment.  This is the underlying philosophy of our Bill and I am convinced it is the right thing to do at this time.</P>
      <P>The underlying philosophy of our specialist services for the mentally handicapped has been to ensure that they should enjoy a childhood and adult life which is as normal as possible and to arrange that the mentally handicapped will share conditions of life and everyday patterns which characterise the community in which they grow up.  Living conditions will be similar to those in the rest of the community.  Guided by this principle the services in this country are making tremendous progress.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to give due credit to the excellent work done by the voluntary organisations, both lay and religious, with considerable State support.  Nevertheless, the work has been pioneered by these voluntary organisations and we have some very fine services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it clear also that there has been no broad demand on me as Minister for Health from either parents of families of the mentally handicapped to introduce special legislation in relation to the mentally handicapped.  I said in my opening remarks that I feel it is more appropriate to deal with any requirements there within the context of the <Col N="823" /> Green Paper to which I have referred already.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the two doctors' recommendation for detention. Deputy Boland joined with a number of other critics of the provision of the Bill requiring that a recommendation for reception be signed by two medical practitioners. He and others have argued that the extension of the current requirement in this regard, which is applicable to private patients, to cover all patients will give rise to difficulties in crisis situations.</P>
    <P>We found differences of opinion as various Deputies spoke and I come to Deputy O'Connell's remarks in that regard.  He was very forthright in his support for the two doctors' recommendation for detention.  I am prepared to consider the points made by the Deputy, but this question is a fundamental one.  The problem has arisen where one doctor may, for one reason or another, have some relationship, direct or indirect with the patient.  Deputy O'Connell reinforced this point very much in his very valuable contribution.  At least in this instance the requirement of a second signatory is a safeguard for the patient. Another point made by Deputy O'Connell was that the right of the patient in this respect should be paramount, and I would agree with this.  I have been involved myself in the removal of a number of people, particularly people who were elderly and had become psychiatrically severely disturbed.  I appreciate the difficulty in practice in arranging that when this had gone so far these people could be detained.  I have had practical experience of this in the early hours of the morning, apart from any other time.  Nevertheless, I would still put the right of the patient before those practical difficulties and I think that this is the right thing to do.  As I have said, I appreciate and will give consideration to the points raised by the Deputies in this respect.  The requirement for two doctors could be argued to be one of the more important safeguards for the individual enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland made a very serious attempt to persuade me to re-impose in <Col N="824" /> the Bill the requirement that voluntary patients be required to give 72 hours' notice before they would be permitted to leave hospital.  I am not anxious to do this, primarily and essentially because to do so would be, in my view, to take a step backwards.  I do not want anyone to be inhibited from seeking treatment for psychiatric illnesses voluntarily by the fear that when they go into a hospital they may be kept there.  Nevertheless, if some shorter period could meet the requirements I will consider that, but I would not consider it desirable to restore the present 72 hours, essentially because I want to see the normal situation restored as far as possible and I want to see patients who go in voluntarily treated as normal hospitalisation cases.  Some of the points made by other Deputies subsequently also supported that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must see the difficulty if a voluntary patient is on heavy medication and opts to leave.  There must be some period to take him off that medication in the interests of his own safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point the Deputy makes.  Nevertheless, similar situations occur also in general hospitalisation where a person can do harm to himself and may not be in the best of mental form otherwise.  I accept the point made by the Deputy and I will consider whether a shorter period might suffice or might meet the requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have gone too far.  I will make the point this way.  There should be at least enough time for the staff of the hospital to notify the patient's relations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>It should be pointed out that the Bill is intended primarily to deal with those people suffering from severe mental disorders who need to be detained in their own interest or in the interest of the safety of others.  As I have said, it is not desirable to legislate for the admission and discharge procedures for voluntary patients and these same principles would underline the treatment of children in the Bill.  The question of children was raised by Deputy Boland.  I accept that difficulties arise where parents neglect their children or refuse to avail themselves of the services made available for their treatment.  This problem can arise across the entire spectrum of illness, physical or mental, and I suggest &mdash; and I am sure Deputies will agree &mdash; that to single out children who may suffer from psychiatric illness for special treatment would be a retrograde step.  A general area of parental neglect and the specific procedures for ensuring that children receive proper care should, in the health sector particularly, no longer be fragmented in various pieces of legislation but should be considered in the context of the children's legislation which will follow on consideration of the report of the task force, which at present is with the printers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins and a number of other Deputies were concerned about the aspect of the Bill which empowers the Medical Council to make rules about certain procedures.  If I remember rightly, Deputy O'Connell was in favour of this as a review by the profession themselves. The only provision is that they may review these methods and provide guidance for me on whether these treatments are desirable.  There has been a fair deal of controversy in relation to some treatments over the years.  Deputy Keating came out quite clearly and in a very concerned way about the need to ensure that there was some consideration of those treatments.  Deputy Collins felt also that <Col N="826" /> the 72 hours' notice should not be removed.  I think I have dealt with that sufficiently at this time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins was concerned too regarding the application for reception, that a brother or sister cannot apply for an application for reception unless living with the person.  This arose particularly because brothers and sisters who had gone away from the area had at times sought to have someone admitted.  This point is covered by the authorised officer. A public health nurse, a social worker and a whole range of people would come under the heading of &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; and could deal with that problem in the local area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was also concerned about the provision for two doctors.  I have already covered this fairly extensively.  It already applies to private institutions so why not to public institutions as well?</P>
    <P>He was concerned about the review boards and their composition and suggested that medical members should have a higher priority.  This, of course, would, in effect, give a medical veto.  In relation to this entire question it must be borne in mind that it is medical people who will be putting cases to the review board in the first instance and I suggest that having one medical person, a legal person who will deal with a patient's rights and a lay person provides a good balance.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested we might consider the expansion of such boards to provide additional members and this was supported by other Deputies.  I will consider this matter carefully and look into the points made by Deputies.  Deputy O'Connell welcomed the Bill generally as a step forward, as an instrument to protect the rights of patients.  He seemed to understand how the Bill relates particularly to detained patients and said there has not been a good history in this country of attitudes towards mentally ill people. He gave some examples, including the fact that a high percentage of patients do not have even one visit per year.  Most institutions now are setting up associations of parents and friends and this will provide for visits, for much more openness in institutions, including St. Brendan's and St. Ita's, who have such associations.   <Col N="827" /> It is surprising that it is happening only now in St. Brendan's, but this is a good trend which I particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell stressed the need for minimum standards in regard to conditions and care and suggested this should have been written into the Bill.  In my opening remarks I spent some time on this subject and said it was more an administrative matter and one with which I am particularly concerned.  This is a matter not basically for legislation but for the health boards to put in order.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision to have patients examined by two doctors, the Deputy asked which is the greater consideration, the patient or the inconvenience of finding two doctors.  He pointed to the position in regard to private institutions and said that difficulties had not been encountered there of which we are aware.  He particularly welcomed the suggestion in regard to the Medical Council and suggested that people should give consent not only verbally but in writing. I will consider that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked about the situation when the Garda takes someone who is mentally disordered into custody &mdash; how long may they detain such a person? Under the Bill the Garda must apply <Col N="828" /> forthwith for a recommendation for reception from a qualified medical practitioner. That is under section 16.  He need not have any worry in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady referred to the Title and said he would prefer to have the hospitals referred to as psychiatric institutions. The Bill is entitled the Health (Mental Services) Bill.  Deputy Brady suggested that in each area one person should be responsible for inspection.  We can consider this.  He said such a system is in operation in the US and Canada.  I am concerned about this.</P>
    <P>Because of the time limit I will not deal in detail with the other points made but if we are considering amendments for Committee Stage I will consider all the points raised by Deputies.  Deputy Noel Browne emphasised the whole aspect of stress.  Perhaps the Deputy did not read my introductory speech before his contribution today.  In it I made it clear that the Bill deals specifically only with one category.  I said we will be taking other steps later to deal with other matters.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their thoughtful and in many cases very well researched contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I spoke at some length on the need for prolonged industrial peace if we are to create the best atmosphere possible for the creation of meaningful and productive jobs on the scale that will be required to meet the great and exciting challenge that is posed by our young population.  We have set out proposals for establishing this industrial peace and we invite the Government and the Labour Party to join with us in an all-party approach to this very serious national problem, a problem that has been with us for many years.  We are convinced that industrial peace can be achieved if there is present the necessary industrial relations infrastructure.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the question of the impact of the recent national understanding in so far as industrial peace is concerned and also in relation to the creation of jobs and to the maintenance of those jobs that exist.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday, we continue to award ourselves pay increases that are more than double those which our main competitors on the Continent are awarding themselves.  That sort of situation was all right in the past when we were linked with sterling and when sterling was devaluing against these other currencies.  But since our entry to the EMS, since we are no longer protected by a devaluing sterling and since our púnt, whatever its relationship with sterling, is not devaluing against the European currencies, we are facing headlong into a huge crisis on the jobs front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these circumstances and disregarding apparently what we have learned in the past, we have agreed a new national understanding.  Indeed, this understanding has been foisted on us by <Col N="832" /> the Government.  It is a threat to thousands of jobs already in existence.  I find it very sad that many of the workers who have been awarded this pay increase will find themselves out of jobs because of it before its expiry date.  In addition, the national understanding has the added drawback of the level of pay increases, damaging as it is and too high as it is in terms of jobs, being far too low to meet the increase in the cost of living.  I have estimated an 8 per cent gap in this regard. In other words, workers will have to endure an 8 per cent gap in their standard of living.</P>
    <P>Again I predict, though I hope I shall be proved wrong, that before the expiry of this new agreement this cut in living standards will in itself provoke not the much-needed industrial peace but further industrial relations anarchy and chaos. That would be precisely the wrong atmosphere to give us any hope of confronting in a meaningful way the challenge that is before us on the jobs front.  The possiblity is that as a result of the national understanding we will have the worst of all possible worlds.  However, the Government, and the Taoiseach personally, involved themselves in such a way as to ensure that there was reached agreement in terms of pay increases at such high percentages.</P>
    <P>The Government made certain commitments under the national understanding. The first section deals with employment. Paragraph 7 talks about new measures required.  It commits the Government to an increase in jobs of 7,000 between the end of 1979 and the end of 1980, which means that 31,000 new jobs would be created in that period and 24,000 jobs lost.  This means a net increase of 7,000 jobs.  It then points out that our workforce is increasing at a rate of between 5,000 and 10,000 per annum. Let us take a figure of 7,500.  If the commitment of the Government in the national understanding is to be met it should mean that there are 7,000 more jobs today than there were this time last year.  But, allowing for the fact that the workforce has increased by 7,500, it should mean that the unemployment figures  <Col N="833" /> for this week would be the same as the unemployment figure for the same week last year.</P>
    <P>Is that the case?  A release from the Central Statistics Office says that the total unemployed on 31 October, the last week for which figures have been published, was 110,921.  For the same week in 1979 there were 82,892 people unemployed, a difference of over 28,000.  The Government have reneged on their commitment of the national understanding on which the ink is hardly dry.  The job commitment for 1979 is not only reneged on but it is out by 28,000</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have conned the trade unions, the employers and the workforce at large.  I believe they have damaged their credibility as far as the workforce are concerned in a way they will only realise when the next national understanding comes to be negotiated. The figure is 28,000 worse than the Government said it would be six weeks ago when they not only agreed to the national understanding but pushed the social partners into agreeing to it.  Surely the Government could not have thought six weeks ago that the figure today would be 8,000 better than it is.  They deliberately conned the social partners and the workforce. We must add to that the likely adverse effects on competitiveness of the increase.  The unfortunate result of the national understanding is that by this time next year the Government will have brought themselves and us into new records as far as unemployment is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government have also reneged a second time on the national understanding when they said there would be a White Paper on Education by 14 November. That date has come and gone and there is no White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now in a very <Col N="834" /> serious situation.  We have 110,921 registered unemployed.  The Government's <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i>, Summer 1980, tells us that the total workforce in Ireland is 1,152,000.  We have, therefore, as registered unemployed 1 per cent of the workforce, but the registered figure does not tell the whole story.  Our total labour force is 1,152,000 and the total unemployed is 110,921, which is almost exactly 10 per cent.  The same <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i> tells us that the gross national income is of the order of £4,080,000,000 and 10 per cent of that is £408,000,000.  If we had £408,000,000 we could solve the unemployment situation before long.  Why do we not have that money?  We do not have it because the Government squandered it on largesse to the rich by abolishing wealth tax and domestic rates, even on the biggest mansion and no matter how many houses a person owns, on car tax and all the nonsensical election promises.  Those irresponsible election promises are now being paid for not in millions of Fianna Fáil Irish pounds but in thousands of Irish jobs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell obviously has the same closing page to his script for every available opportunity in the House.  I have heard all that before.  It gives me pleasure to support the amendment moved last night by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and to reiterate that the commitment of the Government to the eventual achievement of full employment is in no way diminished by the worrying increase in unemployment in the past year.  Our policies and our whole economic and budgetary strategies have been prepared and put into force with this fundamental objective in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell's statistics are confused and his comments on the national understanding did not reveal any serious consideration.  If the Deputy reads the national understanding he will see that the commitment to employment is there in the short term.  I have already referred to the commitment in the short term. That commitment in respect of jobs will be met and honoured.  Under the national <Col N="835" /> understanding there is a clause which covers the necessity for monitoring.  The Government, along with both sides of industry, accept that necessity for monitoring.</P>
    <P>The funds made available to the IDA, which my colleagues mentioned last night, and the resultant substantial increase in job creation by that body in new grant-aided firms is a direct result of our policies to provide meaningful and productive jobs for our young workforce, Last year, the IDA achieved the record number of job approvals of almost 34,500 compared with just over 30,200 in 1978, which was the previous best.  IDA grant-aided firms provided 19,400 additional jobs last year or 82 per cent of gross job gains.  That is because of a Government commitment to investment in that whole area of job creation.  In spite of the unfavourable climate prevailing worldwide at present, the IDA set themselves the target of achieving 30,000 job approvals this year.  The results for the first half of the year indicate that this target will be reached.  The new industries being attracted to this country by the IDA, such as electronics, are not as vulnerable to the recession in world economic activity as our traditional industries.  The target will draw heavily on our highly qualified and skilled manpower resources.  We must remember that the employment of a worker in a key position can create a significant number of other jobs.  Consequently, I have adopted a number of measures to increase the vital supply of people in the areas where these demands will occur.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that these achievements are being offset by the high level of job losses in our older and traditional manufacturing industries.  Over the years, particular attention has been given by the Government to the problems of these firms.  Our objective has been, and indeed will continue to be, to avert closure if this is at all possible and to reduce, if not stop altogether, the job losses threatened.  The responsibility for the financial soundness and the general wellbeing of individual firms must, in the first instance, rest with proprietors and <Col N="836" /> managers.  In recent years there has been a tendency on the part of some employers to be slow to recognise the economic warning signs and to bring to the attention of State agencies the problems they face.  This is an area which could be improved and indeed is receiving attention. The trade unions have a role to play in averting job losses.  If the firm is threatened, and if it is known at an early enough stage, I believe that management and unions can and must work together to avoid closures and to save jobs.  I said that it was receiving attention, and a working group comprising representatives from IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Credit Company, the Irish Productivity Centre, the Irish Management Institute, Córas Tráchtála and the Departments of Labour, Industry, Commerce and Tourism, and Agriculture has been set up to consider the question of job losses and to decide on any possible means of averting them.  Some measures are being considered and, as I said, action is being taken.</P>
    <P>For its part, the National Manpower Service are playing their role in monitoring the situation in relation to job loss by developing an early warning system.  The earlier it is known that a firm is in apparent difficulty, the better is the chance and opportunity of saving some or all of those jobs.  The National Manpower Service are, as I said, playing a monitoring role, too.  They are basing their information on, firstly, redundancy notices, secondly, notices under the Protection of Employment Act, and thirdly &mdash; and probably the most effective of all &mdash; the placement staff's knowledge of developments in local industries in local areas.  All the information received through these three sources is being transmitted to the IDA and to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The terms of the new national understanding referred to by Deputy Mitchell are very important in giving us the right climate in which to hold our own in the present recession and when the opportunity comes to take advantage of it.  The benefits from this agreement or understanding, however, can only be forthcoming if all sides fulfil the various commitments that each has undertaken.  If the <Col N="837" /> understanding is to be a success we must have the full co-operation of the community in such vital areas as an increase in our productivity, both as a nation and as individuals, in our commitment to buy Irish-made products as an alternative to imports and by a greater commitment to work by striving for an improvement in our industrial relations and a reduction in the increasingly high incidence of absenteeism.  It is only by a combination of these and indeed other factors that we can remain competitive in the present very depressed international market, offset the rise in our labour costs, keep the level of job losses to a minimum, increase the employment prospectus for our young people and protect the less fortunate, the old and the disadvantaged in our society from the worst effects of this recession.</P>
    <P>My colleague last night referred to this motion being taken as if we were living in an economic island removed from the other western countries.  He also went into detail about the position being so much better here than it is even in the other member states, that the position is so much better now than when the parties now in Opposition during the previous recession were in power.  He also mentioned something of immense importance, and that is the decision at the European Council in about a week's time to have unemployment as a priority item on the agenda.</P>

      <P>I was talking about productivity and generally it can be said that our productivity is low by comparison with that of other EEC countries. This, combined with the cost because of distance of transporting goods from the larger European markets and our almost total dependence on imported raw materials and energy for our industries, makes it more difficult for our exports to compete on equal terms with the EEC partners. Our standard of living can only increase, therefore, if our productivity <Col N="839" /> rises on a par with or faster than that of other countries.  This has not been happening in recent years.  For example, between 1973 and 1978 the average hourly earnings in Irish manufacturing industries rose by 140 per cent, much faster than the German rate of increase, which was 43 per cent.  By contrast, in the same period our productivity grew by 25 per cent while German productivity grew by 23 per cent.</P>

      <P>It is worth nothing that our share of the imports into the UK has been declining in recent years.  Earlier I referred to the working party that is looking at job losses and why they are happening, particularly in traditional industries but we must look at the UK <Col N="840" /> situation, a major contributor.  The fact is that the British market is depressed at present.  Is our competitiveness a contributory factor?  Are we pushing with the greatest expertise our marketing in that market?  Those points deserve consideration. I should like to make one telling point: if our industrial exports to the UK had expanded at the same rate last year as those of other EEC countries&mdash;ours expanded by a welcome 13 per cent but the other countries averaged about 26 per cent&mdash;it would have meant additional sales of £200 million or an estimated 5,000 more jobs in Irish industry.  We should be thinking of such a thing.</P>

      <P>On the whole the performance of our exports has been encouraging and here we owe quite a bit to Córas Tráchtála.  The Government are committed to continue to support CTT by additional funds and finance.

Córas Tráchtála are confident that 1980 will be another good year for exports with the net result of about 20 per cent in value increases on the year's total exports.  That will be achieved in spite of a world recession.  I believe we can improve on those figures if we take the opportunities that are open to us.</P>

      <P>The Government are determined to explore every avenue so that we can improve productivity, increase employment and ensure the competitiveness of our enterprises.  As part of our commitment under the national understanding we will be holding discussions with both sides of industry with a view to raising the level of productivity as a national objective and to finding practical measures to secure this objective.  Another way in which we can protect ourselves in the present economic recession is by being more aware of the selling and buying of Irish products. Every Member when addressing a group of people should refer to the importance of buying Irish products.  Certainly, the commitment from all sectors of the community to the Irish Goods Council's programme for the promotion of Irish goods is unprecedented.  That is to be welcomed <Col N="842" /> but, nevertheless, there are still too many people who fail to translate this goodwill into practical action when they go shopping.</P>
      <P>Supporting Guaranteed Irish is a practical commonsense approach to making a positive contribution to the national task of maintaining existing employment and creating new jobs.  Alone, however, the Guaranteed Irish symbol will not sell goods.  Manufacturers must aggressively market their products and retailers must be prepared to stock and promote Irish goods on at least the same level &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;at least&rdquo;&mdash; as the competing import for the customer does deserve choice of variety.  The customer must at least be given the opportunity to compare the Irish product with competing imports.</P>
      <P>Deputies have referred to a lack of planning and I should like to put the record straight in this regard.  My colleague last night referred to a decision of the previous Government to drop a census at such a vital time.</P>

      <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee, which I established two years ago, has ensured an improved interaction of policies between industrial strategy, manpower development, the education of highly qualified manpower and the training of skilled manpower.  The manpower implications of our industrial development have never been better articulated and have never been better responded to by the educational system.  I should like to take the opportunity to thank the educational institutions for the way they responded to our manpower plans that are all-important and will be increasingly so in an industrially developing country.</P>
      <P>The manpower issues and problems of our regions vary.  The different characteristics, opportunities and problems of the Irish planning regions prompted me earlier this year to establish regional manpower committees so as to better advise on the implementation of integrated labour market policies for the region.  Both the national Manpower Committee, and the regional manpower committees, are representative of both sides of industry and Government agencies. They bring together, therefore, on the one hand, the bodies involved in job creation and maintenance, and, on the other hand, equip job seekers to take advantage of the job opportunities becoming available.  I should like to emphasise that the job opportunities are becoming available.</P>

      <P>I must emphasise the point that the achievement of a situation of full productive employment requires dedication, commitment and expertise on the part of all labour market bodies of which the Government are only one.  Employers have a major role to <Col N="844" /> play; workers have a major role to play; trade unions have a major role to play and the Government have a major role to play.  I can assure the House that the Government have played their role and will continue to do so.  I must emphasise again, however, that on their own they cannot achieve full employment and there must be a major contribution from both sides of industry.</P>
      <P>On the problem of youth employment, the Government have given it a high priority in their job creation programme and have made available substantial resources to encourage and provide employment for the under 25s.</P>

      <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee have been examining the youth employment situation. That committee have now completed their discussions and will be publishing a report next week.  That report makes a number of recommendations which I am sure, when implemented, will contribute to easing youth employment difficulties.  As a further example of our co-ordinated approach, the National Manpower Service is of particular help to new companies starting off and especially to foreign companies whose knowledge of Irish recruitment procedures may be limited.  In this area the National Manpower Service act in close co-operation with the IDA.  I have not got time to go in detail into the expansion of the National Manpower Service and the enormous role that increased expansion <Col N="845" /> has played.  At the beginning of June 1978 there were 92 placement officer positions. This figure now stands at 150.  Similarly I have also expanded the occupational guidance service which is extremely important for young people. By the end of the year I hope that all regions will have at least one guidance officer.</P>

      <P>There are now almost 40 officers throughout the country helping in the industrial development and provision of employment in cities and towns, even in Deputy L'Estrange's constituency.</P>
      <P>When we talk of unemployment we must look at both sides of the equation. We must take into consideration the fact that our population is growing at seven times the Community average and that our labour force is therefore also increasing rapidly.  Over 60,000 young people come out of all levels of education and training each year and our immigration figures are also showing a continued increase &mdash; that is people coming back, unlike what happened when the Coalition were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the rate of increase in unemployment is less than in other EEC countries shows that our level of job maintenance and provision of new jobs is at a very high level.  This is due to the fundamental expenditure and the financial policies of this Government which are directed at maintaining economic activity and employment when so many <Col N="846" /> of our Community partners are pursuing deflationary policies.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our performance as a community to which we must pay more attention is the need for industrial peace. One cannot emphasise too often how important it is to have a climate of good industrial relations.  If we are to overcome the problems of the present international recession, this is imperative.  I look forward to a commitment by both sides of industry to industrial peace, and the national understanding being adhered to fully.  This is extremely important.</P>
    <P>I read with interest what Deputy Desmond said last night.  I endorse the comments made by him on the necessity for using and agreeing on procedures.  He said that, as a trade union member, he was talking mainly to the workers' side. He said correctly that there are two sides to every dispute and that there can be faults on both sides.  Much more can be achieved by consultation and negotiation than by conflict which is often unnecessary. Nobody wins in a strike situation.</P>

      <P>Each and every one of us has a role to play.  I believe in the commitment to the work place.  The best patriotism we can have as a nation is to give a commitment to work at the work place and to stay at work at the work place whether at management level or worker level.  The second most important aspect of patriotism in our modern society is a commitment to buy Irish-made products.  This cannot be emphasised often enough.  We will encourage our people to do that.  The Government are giving the necessary leadership and if the community respond we will come out of this recession far ahead of our EEC partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion.  I am convinced, listening to the Minister, that this motion is justified.  He made many statements about economic planning and Government planning. When he was interrupted he implied that the statements he was making did not suit us.  He certainly confused me.  He must have been talking about family planning or something like that.  His statements were hard for me to swallow.</P>
      <P>This motion was tabled after considerable thought.  The workers are now involved in a tragic situation.  My party have examined the crisis and are satisfied that the Government are not aware of or concerned about this appalling situation. They are completely bereft of a coherent policy to tackle the worst unemployment situation this country has experienced in its history.  The trends indicate that unemployment is on an upward swing and the Government appear to be indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent survey showed a figure of 111,000 unemployed.  This is an indictment of the Government and with their lack of initiative the Government have failed the people.  If the Government have any integrity they should resign <Col N="848" /> and give the responsibility of managing this island to people who care and have policies to put the country back on its feet and, more important, get the people back to work, which is their basic right. The figure just circulated does not include all those who are genuinely unemployed.  Certain categories never appear on the live register.  The public would like to know the extent of our tragic situation.  If we examine the problem in depth and find the real figure we will be able to take measures to combat it.  There is no hope in the forseeable future for the unemployed as the Government have no policy.  The courting of their friends to provide work has failed and only when they rid themselves of these parasites and formulate a policy to ensure a future for the labour force will we be sure of reducing unemployment. Surely the Government have learnt something from their mistakes.  Their policies have brought one disaster after another.  Are the Government aware that because of unemployment and rising prices people are hungry, or are they that far removed from reality considering that the 5 per cent of the wealthy they support are jet-setting around the world?  Unemployment is the greatest social evil we can experience.  Social welfare recipients cannot keep pace with rising prices.  One in four of our people is hungry, a higher percentage never have meat and some never know the taste of butter.  Surely the Government must carry the tag &ldquo;The poor are always with us&rdquo;.  This is the only tag that is rightly theirs.  They are expert at keeping the working classes poor. They are always very concerned about making the rich richer.</P>
    <P>The situation in the building industry is a clear indication of trends.  The Minister told us that there are no unemployment problems in the building industry, but building workers signing on at the unemployment exchanges know full well that there is unemployment.  I have tradesmen and labour friends in that industry and they tell me of the unemployment there.  Builders providers, the sand and gravel yards, the timber mills and any of the industries producing building  <Col N="849" /> accessories know that the building industry is a generating force in employment because of all the subsidiaries involved.  All these people are affected by the lay-offs in the construction industry. It is vitally important that the building industry be developed once again and brought to its former viable position so as to generate more jobs.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures are frightening and I wonder what we are to suffer next.  It is a far cry from the days when we were told that we would have full employment in the near future.  I welcomed that statement when it was made in the House although I realised that as long as the current Government are under a compliment to the whiz-kids and are committed to their welfare we will not get full employment and we will not cherish all of our children equally.</P>
    <P>The workers enjoyed very high standards during the Coalition period.  I am not a coalitionist but I am a democrat and will always accept a decision of a majority of the Government.  One must agree that the previous Government made big improvements particularly in social welfare and in providing work during the worst world recession we have ever known.</P>

      <P>At that time no citizen was hungry and the cost of living was stabilised, although there were some price increases.  Now after all the promises we have daily increases in the cost of living and longer queues at the unemployment exchanges.  I warn the Government that the workers and the unemployed will not tolerate this deplorable situation for much longer.  The greatest breeding ground for revolution is high unemployment and a reduction in the standard of living.  I would refer the Minister to a statement made about the French Revolution &ldquo;Cake in the palace, crumbs in the street&rdquo;.  If this Government continue in government that is what we will have.  People are without food, without heating, without proper clothing and, more importantly, with very little prospect of a guaranteed future in employment.   <Col N="850" /> The Government are committed to looking after their buddies, the rich 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Labour Party spokesmen have always indicated where we disagree with the Government.  We have exposed the weakness in the policies of Fianna Fáil in relation to job creation.  The next Government will have to clean up a huge mess after this ultra-Tory Government. It is some consolation that it will not last very long.  I only hope that the country is not bankrupt before the election.  The sooner we have an election the better, even if Mr. Stevie Coughlan can get here instead of me.  Apart from unemployment, there are very small pay packets, rising prices&mdash;</P>

      <P>A lot of promises were made in the manifesto.  It promised not only to stabilise prices but to reduce them and that if Fianna Fáil were put back into office all the social ills would be cured. What have we got?  We have massive unemployment, no politics to generate employment and no prospect of giving the people a guarantee of continuity at work.  There is little concern from the Government about our Buy Irish campaign despite the fact that the leadership and example needed from the Government are conspicuously absent.  Unless there is a genuine effort by the Government it cannot be the success it should be.  Again we have complacency and all we see from the Government is window-dressing. It is a well known fact that Departments purchase material from outside of the country.  Does that show <Col N="851" /> concern?  We have semi-State bodies awarding contracts to foreign countries. We have Ministers and TDs wearing Italian shoes, foreign-made suits and driving mercedes cars.  These are the important things that do not go unnoticed.

      <P>The economy is slowly grinding to a halt.  Workers are on a three-day week.  The prospects for the footwear and leather industries are gloomy.  There is no sign of any great concern on the part of the Government to bail out these traditional industries.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably tell us we are losing our nerve and overstating the position.  I have heard it all before.  He will probably say we are damaging the confidence so badly needed to induce foreign industralists to come here.  Let him tell that to the people.  It is our duty to give the people the facts and enlighten them on the gross mismanagement of the country by this Government.  The furniture trade is in a similar position to the footwear and leather industries.  The export trade is at rock bottom and the home market is no better.  These workers are severely threatened and there is no offer of help from the Government.  I will be told I am exaggerating the case and that I am irresponsible but the truth is not palatable and that is what I am stating. The unemployment situation at present is disgraceful and there is no prospect for the future under the Minister's Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chipboard factory in Athy closed last year and a few hundred jobs were lost.  There were more job losses in the Waterford and Scariff factories.  The irony of it all is that we export our native timber to Sweden at £1 per ton and they <Col N="852" /> sell it back to us as chipboard or hardboard for £9 a sheet.  Taxpayers' hard-earned money went into developing these forests over the years and that is the result: give-away prices for our timber and no policy from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that full employment should be the first priority of any Government.  In Government we would use all the resources of the State to ensure that everybody had a secure job in their own country.  This would not mean a total reliance on private enterprise such as this Government and successive Fianna Fáil Governments have had.  The natural resources of the country are grossly underdeveloped.  Hundreds of thousands of acres of land are lying idle and are not used productively to maximum output.  Our fishing industry is grossly underdeveloped and under-capitalised to an extent far greater than any competitive country.  The riches of the sea have not been tapped to create job opportunities for the people.  We continue to export cattle on the hoof whereas a more enlightened policy would be to kill the animals here and create jobs in spin-off industries.</P>

    <P>Unemployment is the greatest single factor which leads to boredom and degredation. For over 100 years successive generations of our people emigrated in search of employment in other lands. Through the sixties and seventies this trend was reversed but unfortunately due <Col N="853" /> to Government lack of policy and mismanagement of the economy emigration has started again.  This is a net result of the ill-conceived promises of the Fianna Fáil manifesto which bought votes during the 1977 election.</P>

      <P>I call on the Government to show their concern for human beings by promoting policies which will create the necessary jobs for our people.  It is scandalous that unemployment has been allowed to rise to an official figure of 111,000 as a result of the Government's lack of concern.  We estimate that the true figure when school leavers and others are taken into account is in the region of 160,000.  A former Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Lynch, a man I like very much, said that the Irish people would be very justified in throwing out a Fianna Fáil Government if unemployment was over 100,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a member of the party asked to wind up the debate on this very important motion I listened to the Minister  <Col N="854" /> at length but throughout his very comprehensive and Alice in Wonderland type speech I could find no reference whatever to the realities of Irish life.  The unemployment situation is the worst in our history and we are back, as they used to say in the thirties, to love on the dole.</P>
      <P>I must and will continue to refer to the major promise made in the 1977 manifesto that Fianna Fáil would reduce the unemployment figure each year by 25,000 to 30,000.  Deputy O'Donoghue, the ex-Minister, two years ago promised that by 1982 the cost of living would be reduced to 5 per cent and there would be no unemployment.  The manifesto promise on job creation and the elimination of unemployment was a very firm commitment and very high in the priority of Fianna Fáil in the 1977 election.  Unfortunately, the electorate were convinced and voted them into power.  What is the situation on 19 November 1980, approximately three-and-a-half years after they entered office?  We have a figure of 115,000, but it is nearer to 150,000 if the proper figure were to be given.  Even taking the 115,000 means an increase of 33? per cent on last year.  We are not talking in an impersonal manner about computer indexation of insurance numbers. We are telling a human story about human tragedies in families, jobs lost, financial problems and a very bleak future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the manifesto promise on unemployment, what has been the performance in the intervening three-and-a-half years?  In 1978 there was a definite dip down to approximately 80,000 people and I remember hearing about champagne corks popping all over the country. There were great celebrations because they had achieved the miracle of getting it down to 80,000.  However, instead of a happy ending, that was the unhappy start to the unemployment situation.  In 1979 the numbers started to rise rapidly and by 1980 the unemployment figure when it should have been going down went up against the normal seasonal trend.  Last week I read in the papers comments from several Ministers, including the Minister for Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Taoiseach.  One was about the great concern  <Col N="855" /> they felt when the figures were announced.  The other comment was that it was bad but not as bad as in other countries.  That is poor consolation to the many thousands who have lost their jobs in the last 12 months.  If the Government are to be honest they must admit to a dismal failure to resolve this crisis and to meet their commitments in the manifesto. I emphasise that, despite the ministerial statements, it is all due to a lack of policy or to a hit and miss policy.</P>
    <P>What are the Government going to do as we face the year 1981?  My first commitment as an ordinary back-bencher would be to reintroduce immediately without delay the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  It is necessary, it is urgent, and what was done last December has created a bad situation because of the sacking of Deputy O'Donoghue.  He may consider that a compliment because I believe that since his departure unemployment has escalated beyond all bounds.</P>
    <P>On this evening's paper I read a headline &ldquo;Haughey Angry over Leakage on Job Situation&rdquo;.  Surely this arrogant statement cannot go without being challenged. Surely the people of the country are entitled to know the truth.  What about the anger of the men and women who have lost their jobs during the year? Are they not to be heard?  Predictions are being made about the future prospects. As I have said, I believe that the figure at the moment is 150,000.  I am not a pessimist, I am a realist, and with the trends and what we are hearing from the experts I believe that by April 1981 it may be in the region of 175,000.  This is a frightening prospect for this country of ours as we face the eighties.</P>
    <P>This unemployment cancer, as I call it, is causing very serious personal problems, financial and otherwise.  I am talking about young married couples who had obtained a good job and built their own house or perhaps were fortunate enough to get a council house and were paying a high rent.  These people are under severe pressure and many problems are being created in the home because of this situation.  I have the greatest  <Col N="856" /> sympathy in the world for the men and women who, through mismanagement, have lost their jobs perhaps after services rendered over 30 to 40 years. What an awful situation these people find themselves in in their middle years with no possibility whatever of readjusting at that age to a new way of life.  It is not figures that we are talking about, we are talking about people, problems, human beings and tragedies.</P>
    <P>If we are sincere in wanting to bring down the unemployment figure, the first priority and the most immediate concern should be an immediate substantial financial injection into the housing sector, which at the moment is almost at a standstill. Any member of a local authority in this House will know what I am talking about.  At the end of the year we have barely enough money and in some places not even enough to finish what we started this year.  This means that the building sector are suffering serious unemployment. Young married couples with young families are destined to live in caravans or in horrible housing conditions for many years to come.  Another job-intensive area would be the financing of health board major installations and buildings. In my area, the mid-western region, which comprises North Tipperary, Limerick and Clare, we need an immense amount of money to provide services for our people.  Health must be a priority and the buildings are not there.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the education of youth and I support him in what he said and compliment the people concerned in the educational field in our country.  We are doing wonderful work through all sectors of education, but that is poor consolation to the young man with his leaving certificate or his degree when he comes out of school or college to find that there is no job for him.  I know of many boys and girls with the leaving certificate and many honours who are still registered with the National Manpower Service and still looking for jobs.  Despite all their education, the outlet is not there for them and they must wait maybe three or four years to get a job.</P>
    <P>Last week I spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Justice and I laid special  <Col N="857" /> emphasis on the increase in street vandalism which of necessity has forced the Minister for Justice in the foreseeable future to recruit a further 2,000 gardaí. There is a definite connection between the increase in vandalism and the unemployment situation and unless this serious situation is checked soon the youth will turn away from our democratic ideas and projects.</P>
    <P>Another commitment in the manifesto was to promote and develop the food processing industry in our country, yet a major industry giving substantial employment in the town of Carlow is on the point of closure.  It is amazing to think of a Government who committed themselves three-and-a-half years ago to the advancement and development of our <Col N="858" /> national resources taking such an indifferent attitude to a closure in Carlow which will have a great effect on this town and also on Erin Foods.</P>
    <P>Finally, if we are to save more jobs, there should be a selective import ban by temporary derogation from EEC regulations because the supermarkets of our country have been taken over by foreigners and nine-tenths of the goods being sold over the counter are from outside the country.  We are too nice in our regulations and we are being good boys. Break the rules, ban the import of these goods and save the jobs of our country.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate - Social Welfare Payments.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I had to bring the Minister back this evening but it is very important that the Department of Social Welfare should work efficiently. That Department have a grave responsibility to ensure that they are working efficiently and that people are paid their benefits when they are due.  Inefficiency in that Department hits at the most vulnerable section of our community.  The under-privileged feel the pinch when their benefits are not paid on time.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment because I believe the service from that Department has deteriorated dramatically over the last three years, but particularly since the postal strike.  During that strike people did not get their payments on time and hardship was caused and I am afraid the slack has not been taken up.  During a debate in this House on 6 and 7 May last, when the subject of the payment of social welfare was debated, the Minister gave certain commitments which he has not lived up to.  I want to remind him of a few of these commitments tonight.</P>
      <P>Social welfare recipients, no matter what benefits they are paid &mdash; whether it is unemployment or social welfare benefits, old age pension and so on &mdash; are entitled to what they are getting.  They do not go cap in hand to anybody and they should not be treated as second-class citizens. They are meant to feel this when their benefits are not paid on time and they have to approach public representatives to get their entitlements for them. This should be avoided at all costs.</P>
      <P>I do not accept, nor do I want the Minister to tell me, that there is a very large volume of social welfare recipients and that he will deal with this on a percentage basis.  I do not want to hear about percentages because every person who does not receive his benefit is one too many.  It should be the aim of the Minister to bring about a situation where benefits will be paid on time.</P>
      <P>I want to refer particularly to a few glaring cases where attention is needed. This year we had an unfortunate delay in the issue of old age pension books.  Every public representative was inundated with requests to get on to the Department and get the pension books released.  These people depend on these payments and they were left stranded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to refer to the delay in getting decisions for unemployment benefit from the relevant section of the Department.  This area needs to be looked at very closely.  In my opinion people should get their benefits from the unemployment section in half the time it takes at present.  During the week I had a case of a man whose unemployment benefit was stopped.  He had worked eleven years and had not received unemployment benefit for many weeks <Col N="861" /> because the Department said he was not looking for work.  This is not the best time to be looking for work and I do not think a man should be thrown to the wolves and have his benefits withdrawn because he is not able to get work in the small community where he is looking for work.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the delay in the issue of children's allowances, particularly allowances to people who apply for additional children.  My question, No. 23 on to-day's Order Paper referred to one of these cases.  A girl applied for a book and went through the normal channels.  She went to the post office on numerous occasions but it was not there.  She wrote to the Department and went to the social welfare officer on a few occasions.  He phoned the Department but still her book was not sent out.  She then came to me and I put down a question about it.</P>
    <P>These are not isolated cases.  I get this type of case every week and if the Minister wants any information on the type or number of cases I get, I can furnish him with written details.</P>
    <P>The situation in respect of deserted wife's allowances is also very unsatisfactory. Women are put under great pressure to give details of the efforts made to locate their husbands.  This week I had the case of a woman whose husband deserted her in June last.  She has been informed by the Department that an allowance will not be paid to her until such time as she furnishes sufficient evidence regarding her husband's desertion. This is a very harsh attitude for the Department to adopt especially towards people who may not have very much education and who are not in a position to correspond with the Department regarding their rights.</P>
    <P>The worst complaint I have to make is in the area of disability benefit.  The Department are failing to send disability benefit when it is due.  This is an unfortunate situation especially when some of the people concerned have worked for up to 20 or 30 years.  It leaves them cynical about the whole social welfare system. There are often delays of up to eight weeks between the time of application for benefit and the time of payment.  This <Col N="862" /> is not good enough.  Hardly a day passes without my office having to contact the Department on behalf of people who have not received benefit despite having furnished their certificates of illness.  The Minister should ensure that this situation is rectified.  Perhaps if payment were made through the local employment office or from the health board offices, the problem would be resolved.  I understand that it would be feasible for both these agencies to be involved in these payments.  What is unfortunate about late payments is that some people go back to work before they are fit.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Department that is very unsatisfactory is the whole problem of delays at the switchboard in answering calls.  I raised this matter earlier this year and the Minister assured me then that improvements would be effected but I find usually on phoning the Department that the lines are engaged. If one is lucky enough to be answered after many efforts, one is often left waiting for up to 30 minutes in having a query dealt with.  The situation is so bad that people in the unemployment exchanges are not prepared to phone the Department. The same applies to social welfare officers.  The number of complaints about the Department, not only in regard to the switchboard situation but to the other areas that I have mentioned indicate the inefficiency of that Department.  If it were run efficiently in the first place, there would be no need for all these phone calls.  I appeal to the Minister to take the Department in hand, to ascertain the cause of the problems and to have them rectified.  We do not like to have to come here and complain in this way about the situation but the people are entitled to their rights.  If Members of this House or the officials did not receive their pay cheques at the end of the month there would be a good deal of noise.  We must ensure that everybody else is looked after also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to refute the allegations of inefficiency in the Department. I am sure the Deputy would not wish me to refer to the number of payments that have to be dealt with each <Col N="863" /> week but in the context of the complaints he has made, it is necessary to give this information in order to put the matter into perspective.  The Department are bound under legislation to ensure in the interests of all of us that payments are made rightly.  I appreciate the work done by the staff of the Department and to that extent I resent the allegations made against them, allegations that are without foundation.</P>
      <P>Of course there will always be problem cases.  The Deputy says that the greatest problem relates to the payment of sickness benefit but I would remind him that this is also the biggest headache for the Department's operations because each week a total of 1,300 people either furnish incorrect numbers or forget to furnish any number when making application. About 250 of those would be new claims.  I appreciate that there are difficulties but I realise that in any system in which large numbers of people are being dealt with some difficulties will be experienced. However, I know that the staff of the Department work hard.  I have put some special effort into that area since taking up office.  In addition to the figures I have given, a further 250 applicants in respect of dental and optical benefits furnish incorrect information each week. Therefore, between sickness benefit and dental and optical benefit applications, a total of 1,550 each week are furnished incorrectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should do something about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We make every effort to inform people of the correct procedure. We do this by way of advertising and through the social services council.  In relation to old age non-contributory pensions, the Deputy is aware that I did something specific in that area which had a fairly substantial effect.  The step I took was welcomed greatly in the Department. To give an example of the improvement that occurred, of the 422 cases on hand in June last &mdash; that was before the change in respect of deeds of transfer &mdash; 295 had been dealt with by October; 41 were still with appeals and 66 with social <Col N="864" /> welfare officers.  In addition there has been a 10 per cent drop in the average number of letters received per week since 1 July as a result of the measure taken. The Deputy will know that one of the problems in this area was of a technical nature.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned also the question of telephones.  There are between 70 and 80 lines into the Department and the pressure is very heavy.  We have made arrangements with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to improve the situation but the improvements will necessitate a new switchboard and new equipment as well as very much improved telephone facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy. In relation to the other measures I would point out that, for instance, in respect of Christmas payments there is a novel measure this year that will be highly efficient in ensuring payment of the Christmas bonus on the due day.  There are considerable improvements in organisational methods which I shall not go into in detail at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Department have been through a difficult period during the past 18 months particularly because of a changeover to a totally computerised system.  That has been effected to a large extent but much remains to be done and when completed will contribute greatly to the sort of situation that the Deputy would like to see, but there will still have to be the implementation of the law and of the decisions of appeals officers.  There will still be the problem of people furnishing wrong numbers.  The computer will not solve that.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I assure the Deputy that I will seek to improve the efficiency of the Department in every way possible but I do not accept the allegations he has made.</P>

      <P>While I am seriously concerned at the loss of employment in manufacturing industry in the Dublin inner city in recent years as a result of industries having closed down or been re-located outside the area, I do not accept the Deputy's claim that the inner city has been virtually left without manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority have taken very positive steps to replace jobs lost and to provide new jobs in inner-city locations.  During the past 18 months the IDA have approved almost 2,300 new jobs for the area.  Last year the IDA set up a special unit to intensify their efforts to promote industrial development in the inner city. Almost £12 million has been committed by the IDA to the development of sites and buildings in the area.  To date 12 acres has been acquired for industrial development at four inner-city locations. The IDA have provided or are in the course of providing approximately 400,000 sq. ft. of factory space in about 70 units of various sizes at three of these locations &mdash; Pearse Street, East Wall and the Liberties.  Detailed plans for the fourth site, at Prussia Street, are at present  <Col N="762" /> being drawn up.  Most of the factory units being provided in the area are suitable for small manufacturing enterprises.</P>
    <P>The job potential associated with the four sites that have been purchased is 1,400.</P>
