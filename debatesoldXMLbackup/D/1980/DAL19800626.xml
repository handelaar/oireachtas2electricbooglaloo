      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important adjournment debate.  We are more or less over the halfway mark in the life of this Dáil.  It is the first adjournment debate in which we have to scrutinise the activities and performance of a new Fianna Fáil administration.  Of course the degree to which it is a new administration and the degree to which it is merely a cosmeticised phoenix-like rebirth of the former administration has yet to be seen. For my part I do not see as many distinctions <Col N="2153" /> between the economic policy pursued by this administration and the one immediately preceding it as certainly supporters of the present Taoiseach within his own party had been led to believe would be the case.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is walking on a political and economic tightrope.  The problem about it is that it is sagging in the middle and fraying dangerously at either end.  The problem might not be so serious were there anything like a decent safety net, but we all know what kind of safety net stretches underneath the tightrope on which the Taoiseach is walking.  The only effective safety net that is there is probably the International Monetary Fund.  We all know what will happen if and when the tightrope finally collapses sending the Taoiseach and his economic policies plunging towards the ground.  The International Monetary Fund will step in to bail them out at the cost of severe chastisement for his sins against the gospel of Keynes and other economic crimes.  Of course the cost of those failures will be paid for not necessarily by the Taoiseach and his Government but by other people within the Community.  It would not be so serious if the Taoiseach on this tightrope were only carrying on his shoulders some other acrobat, but he is carrying not just one other acrobat, he is carrying not merely the 14 other acrobats that make up the present Fianna Fáil Cabinet; he is carrying in some respect the economy and the entire future of the country.  That is why it is so alarming that the political and economic policies he is pursuing carry the risk they do.  That is why it is so alarming that their failure would have the dire results it gives us on this side of the House no pleasure to predict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening speech the Taoiseach made considerable mileage of the question of inflation and gave us several different aspects of the problem.  For example, he noted that basically the acceleration in inflation rates was due to the high increase in oil prices in 1979 and 1980. Earlier on he had pointed to the fact that we were a very open economy and imported <Col N="2154" /> a great deal of price increase from other countries.  We did not hear much about our being a small, open economy from Fianna Fáil in 1975, 1976 or 1977.  We did not hear from Fianna Fáil in those years much about the volume of price rises that were imported, because it suited them to lay the blame at that time for what was happening solely on the shoulders of the administration of the day.  Now that they are in power they are grabbing for an excuse which they denied that administration at that time, not alone that but they are grabbing at the same excuse at a time when the external economic factors to which they refer are still substantially less serious than they were during the period about which I have been talking.</P>
    <P>At the same time there is something of a conflict in what the Taoiseach has said because he suggested in his speech, following a review of the Common Market summit, that our own actions and behaviour and the measures we take will determine our success in overcoming our difficulties.  The House is owed an explanation by the Taoiseach as to which of these two lines of argument he regards as definitive.  Are all our problems self-inflicted, to be cured solely by our actions, or are they all imported from outside and are we powerless to cope with them, especially in regard to inflation?  Any honest politician or economist would have to admit that there is some truth in the analysis which indicates that we import some of our problems, whether we want to or not, but we cannot put up tarrif barriers against certain kinds of inflation. However, the Taoiseach cannot blame inflation as he did in his speech solely on imported factors and particularly on the increase in the price of oil.</P>
    <P>If one considers the situation in West Germany in 1974-75 and to some extent today, we can see that there is not a necessary correlation between a very substantial increase in the price of oil, even in such a country which uses huge amounts of imported oil, and the rate of inflation there.  During the 1974-76 oil <Col N="2155" /> price crisis the rate of inflation in West Germany certainly did not leap as it did in other countries.  While we must accept that the price of oil is an element in inflation, we cannot lay all the blame at its door.  A very substantial amount of inflation has been generated by this Government by their applying a stimulus to the economy when it was moving very nicely and they have now run out of economic steam at a time when it is important to get the engine moving again. They cannot deny the fact of inflation however much they try to explain it away.</P>
    <P>I will single out one item in the whole inflation index because it indicates more than anything else where the difficulties are and where the price is being paid for the Government's economic policies.  In 1977 the average working man with an average family who bought an average house on a first mortgage of about 80 per cent from a building society had to work for 15½ hours every week to meet his weekly mortgage repayments.  In 1980 a man in exactly the same position will have to work for 22 hours to pay the weekly mortgage bill.  We have more or less achieved the 40-hour week but under Fianna Fáil we have also reached a situation where more than half of those 40 hours must be worked to pay for that most basic of human necessities, a roof over one's head.</P>
    <P>One of the key groups in the next election, one of the largest in terms of voting strength and certainly one of the groups most prone to exercising their franchise, will be those young married people between the ages of 25 and 35.  It is these young married people, many of them on their first mortgages, who will be particularly hit by the increase in the cost of housing in real terms, that is, in terms of the number of hours which must be worked to pay for the roof over their head.  They will also be hit in many other ways.  If the wife has been working it is almost certain that her job will be one of the first to go in the economic recession which is upon us, regardless of the fact that many couples simply must have two incomes in order to pay the mortgage on <Col N="2156" /> their modest house.  They will also suffer because their young children will be going to schools which are not as well maintained, cleaned or heated as in the past.  The present Government's economic policy has its costs, but they are not paid by the people who impose that policy or in whose interests it is imposed. The costs are paid by the rising tide of unemployed, by the poor who see their real standard of living whittled away, and by the children who have no votes.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the Taoiseach's suggestion that one of the main problems in relation to the economy and to job creation was the level of wage settlements.  In speaking about the job creation problem he suggested two major factors contributing to our lack of competitiveness, namely, our unrealistic pay settlements and intransigent attitudes to restrictive practices and productivity.  We should not be fooled by this glib use of the word &ldquo;unrealistic&rdquo;.  We must be on our guard when anybody, especially in Government, uses a word like &ldquo;reality&rdquo; because reality is not always as Government would like it to be.  When a Government use the word &ldquo;reality&rdquo; we must ask who is defining it and whose interests are being served by the definition.  We have to guard against the assumption that all Government interventions, whether in negotiations about income levels or anything else, are in some sense disinterested with only the welfare of the nation at heart.  Governments are composed of politicians and politicians represent interests.  The interests represented by the elected representatives on the Government side of the House are sectional interests in this community and that fact should be made perfectly clear.  When Government politicians define &ldquo;reality&rdquo; they do so in the interests of those sections of the community which they represent.  They do not represent, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy laughably claimed during a recent debate, all sections of the community. Like it or not, the interests of some sections of the community conflict with the interests of other sections, and to attempt <Col N="2157" /> to persuade people that in one great umbrella organisation called &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; all these conflicting interests can be reconciled is absurdity itself.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has to be asked, in relation to what he has said about the standard of living, income increases and reality, what is unrealistic in a situation where a man or woman who works for a wage expects to be able to purchase reasonably the same amount of goods and services next year as were obtained this year.  I would not be so naive as to suggest that inflation could be reduced to zero.  Of course oil price rises and other such things must be paid for, but it is certainly unrealistic to expect working people to embark on a process in which the amount of work they have to do and the amount of productivity they have to deliver has to expand indefinitely in order to maintain their living standards even at their present level.  Whatever Euclid may say, work time is not infinitely divisible, and neither are wages.</P>
    <P>There is a general imputation in what the Taoiseach told us that belts have to be tightened all around.  That is all very well if there are the same number of spare notches in everyone's belt.  Of course there are not.  Some people are in a much better position to tighten their belt than others.  Under this Government people with least flexibility in this regard are being asked to tighten their belts to the greatest possible extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are keen on a new national understanding.  I remember the first adjournment debate on which I spoke in this House.  I suggested to the trade union movement that when they were negotiating new national agreements they should, in addition to looking for pay elements, make an attempt to get structural changes in our society which would defend the interests of the people they represent.  The then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy <Col N="2158" /> O'Kennedy, who is now Minister for Finance, came hot foot into the Dáil at the end of my speech and made a speech of his own in which he accused me of fomenting class war.  It is ironic to look back on the last national understanding in the light of that contribution by him. It is also ironic to look at the Taoiseach's and Government's obvious desire for a new national understanding in the light of the way they have reneged on so many of the commitments in the old one.</P>
      <P>The two basic things we need to say in relation to the adjournment debate on the economy are, firstly, when the axe falls it must not fall on those who cannot afford to bear its edge but on those who can.  We have seen no sign from the Government that this is the objective of their policy and it is not the way their policy is turning out in practice.  Secondly, we must have a more radical look at our economic policy and job creation programme that this Government or any Government in the recent past have had. We must have a look at the way in which huge amounts of public money are pumped into private enterprise with a little or no accountability.  We must look at the way in which our public sector enterprises are starved of funds or are required to invest productive capital, as far as they have it, outside the country so as not to compete with domestic private vested interests.  We all know how many jobs have been created by private industry in the last couple of years, but we do not know how much profit is being exported by way of capital or how much is being used lining bank accounts in pockets and how little is being put back into business to create more jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we on these benches talk about the public sector we do not mean adding to the army of, in the popular mind, faceless civil servants who are reputed&mdash;very often wrongly&mdash;to work for very high wages.  We talk about the need for public sector investment in productive jobs, industrial jobs and in jobs that create real wealth in our community. It is already being done despite the heavy hand of Government.  Anyone <Col N="2159" /> who doubts that only has to read the recently published official report of the activities of the State sector and the effect of the heavy hand of Government on initiative in the public area.  It can be done and it should be done.</P>
    <P>What I missed most in the Taoiseach's speech was any sense of the future.  He seems to be unaware, except in a brief reference to the electronics industry and its role in the Ireland of today, of the fact that between one-third and one-half of our work force will be affected by the micro-chip revolution within the next decade or so.  There are signs already in society at large and in many of its institutions that the implications of the micro-chip revolution, which is the third industrial revolution to hit us in a couple of centuries, will mean that to have a job in the future may be a luxury.  There are signs that society is gearing itself to divide its members into drones and workers.  In the past the lucky ones were those who got the better jobs but in the future the lucky ones may well be those who get jobs of any description.  If this revolution is not to create a society of drones and workers, if its benefits are to be harnessed for the benefit of the entire community and not just multi-nationals, who are now apparently responsible for over half the new jobs created in this State since 1977, if we are to have a society in which the benefits of production are spread globally and not concentrated in a few hands and pockets, we will have to look at Government policy in relation to the pattern of industrial investment, incentives offered to private industry with little or no sense of accountability and at the importance of providing a service industry which can be supported by a healthy, public sector and by progressive taxation both on incomes and institutions to help pay for the costs of these services.</P>
    <P>I was in the North last weekend and I feel bound to inform the House that the Taoiseach's name was not exactly on everyone's lips.  The problems they have in the North are savage and severe. There are security and economic problems and one tends to compound <Col N="2160" /> the other, as it does on this side of the Border although, to a less visible extent. What will solve the Northern problem eventually are deeds rather than words. We can talk all we like but until we have a society here that people in the North not only feel they would like to join but can perceive themselves as having an economic interest in joining, then we are spitting in the wind.  In 1933 a predecessor of the present Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, said:</P>
    <P>The only policy for abolishing partition that I can see is for us, in this part of Ireland, to use such freedom as we can secure to get for the people in this part of Ireland such conditions as will make the people in the other part of Ireland wish to belong to this part.</P>
    <P>It might have been expressed in a more sophisticated fashion but&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of his lucid intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was most definitely one of his lucid intervals and one which can be set against the economic policies pursued by the Government and ask them: to what degree do those economic policies match up to the dictum of one of the fathers of Irish republicanism in the modern age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a special plea for education.  Deputies on all sides of the House will have got in the last couple of weeks a letter, suspiciously similar in character for persons with such high educational and social standing, relating to the problems of financing in education, particularly in the primary school sector.  It is here that the cuts are being most severely felt.  As Professor Tussing warned more than a year ago, the consequences of failure to plan for social development is that when the cuts come they will fall hardest on those least equipped to bear them.  They are falling at present on the children in the schools. That is partly because the cut-backs are taking place in education and it is partly because the Government have constantly relegated social expenditure to second <Col N="2161" /> place.  It is part of the fundamental belief of this party that social expenditure and industrial investment must go hand in hand and cannot be put in a tandem arrangement in which one is forced to rise behind the other.  There are more young people here than ever before. Many of them who might have emigrated in the fifties or sixties are now staying here because they believe, with justice, that the country owes them a living. I doubt very much that many of them voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election, despite the propaganda.  I believe many of their parents did in the misguided belief that Fianna Fáil would provide jobs for their sons and daughters.  I hope that that group of people in particular will become radicalised in the years ahead and will realise that under Fianna Fáil their future cannot be guaranteed.  I hope they will realise that under Fianna Fáil the future is not what it used to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said when opening this debate yesterday morning, the development of the agricultural sector is a top priority for the Government. It is only a few weeks ago that the House dealt with the Estimates for my Department and that gave me an opportunity to discuss the agricultural situation generally as well as the various measures and schemes operated for the benefit of the farming community.  On this occasion I want to look at the wider aspects of the Government's agricultural policy and to consider the major issues which now confront us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the basic aims of our agricultural policy is to ensure that the agricultural sector makes the largest possible contribution to the social and economic progress of the nation.  This would of itself not only ensure the prosperity of the farming community but at the same time integrate even more fully the rural and urban sectors.  To achieve this aim requires the maximum co-operation between all concerned&mdash;farmers, agricultural organisations, processors, marketing organisations <Col N="2162" /> and the Government.  We are determined to see that everything possible will be done to realise this co-operation in full.  In the next week or two the Taoiseach and I will be meeting the leaders of all the main agricultural organisations to review the overall situation and to see what further steps could be taken to accelerate progress in agriculture.  Meetings such as this, together with those which the Taoiseach and I have already had with the leaders of some of the organisations, help to ensure that every potentially worthwhile development is examined at the highest level.</P>
    <P>Our immediate objectives are to encourage the maximum efficiency in the production, processing and marketing of farm products, to see that we get the best return from the markets for farm products and to ensure that we realise the full benefits of the CAP.  These objectives are interdependent and together are designed to maintain the maximum number of people on the land in economic security and with the highest standards of living that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Progress in the agricultural sector depends, of course, not only on the measures taken by the Government but also upon the extent to which the farming community respond to the opportunities which exist or can be created. Progress also depends on the efficiency with which agriculture is serviced by the industries supplying farm requirements or processing farm produce.</P>
    <P>The Government have a wide range of measures to provide the means for improved efficiency at farm level.  For all the criticism against it, the Farm Modernisation Scheme has proved a tremendous success.  Since 1975, £300 million has been invested in modernising Irish farms, with the aid of grants from Exchequer and EEC funds of £100 million. Almost 100,000 farmers are now participating in the scheme.  Most of the investment has been in land improvement, building and machinery&mdash;investments that were badly needed in order that we can compete effectively on the European market.</P>
    <P>The lean years of the fifties and sixties <Col N="2163" /> had left many of our farms severely under-capitalised.  In order to expand output and improve productivity, marginal land had to be improved, farm buildings brought up to modern standards and modern labour saving machinery installed.  While many farmers still have their investment programme to complete, we now have a very substantial number of modern efficient production units.  The investments under the Farm Modernisation Scheme have given a return that compares favourably with the return from investment in other sectors.  Investment in land improvement is increasing still further. particularly with the improved rates of grant provided under the Western Drainage Scheme.</P>
    <P>In the light of some of the pessimistic and depressing comments that have appeared in the media, it may surprise some Deputies to learn that approvals for new investment projects this year show a significant rise as compared with the corresponding period of last year.  In the first quarter of 1980 over 3,700 approvals have been issued for land improvement works representing an investment of about £9 million and an area of around 18,000 hectares as against 2,500 approvals representing an investment of about £6.5 million and an area of 14,000 hectares in the same period last year.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the case of farm buildings nearly 8,500 approvals have issued in the first quarter of this year representing an investment of over £37 million as against around 6,000 approvals issued in the same period last year representing an investment of about £26 million.  This 50 per cent increase in planned investment shows that there has been no loss of confidence by the farming community in the future of the agriculture industry.  Indeed it represents a positive attitude and one which I have detected from farmers myself in recent times.</P>
    <P>At the present time Irish agriculture is being affected by high interest rates which, coupled with inflation, are operating to discourage some farmers from undertaking the kind of investment that development of our agricultural industry <Col N="2164" /> requires.  In other cases farmers are unable to get enough working capital to operate their enterprises at the most effective level.  The Government have been considering this situation and I am glad to be able to announce that it has been decided to assist the provision of funds to agriculture at attractive interest rates.</P>
    <P>The total sum that will be made available under the new scheme is £50 million.  This will be raised abroad and will be made available at an attractive rate.  Depending on the precise terms on which the money is borrowed abroad, this rate should be in the range of 13 per cent to 14 per cent as compared with rates in the neighbourhood of 20 per cent which apply to similar type loans at present.</P>
    <P>Full details of the new scheme are being worked out in consultation with the ACC and will be announced shortly. The general intention is that the loans should be for expansion purposes.  The main types envisaged are: (1) Loans for financing increases in breeding stocks; (2) Loans for such purposes as working capital to young farmers taking over holdings for the first time; (3) Loans to provide working capital in cases where a farmer's own funds have been seriously depleted because of investments already made, and; (4) Loans to provide working capital for small and medium sized agricultural business, probably on similar lines to those proposed for industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress again that the aim is to assist expansion.  It is not intended that the loans should be used simply to enable a farmer to switch from existing borrowing at the higher current rates.  They should represent genuine additional capital.  A maximum loan of £25,000 per farmer is being envisaged and the farmer must be operating to a plan drawn up in consultation with his agricultural adviser.  No loan will be provided to assist the purchase of land directly or indirectly or, as I have said, merely to replace or restructure existing borrowing.  Expansion of breeding stock, <Col N="2165" /> the provision of working capital and land improvement will be given priority.</P>
    <P>This new scheme is yet another demonstration of the Government's efforts to assist agriculture and stimulate production.  I am confident that it will be welcomed by farmers and that it will prove most useful in helping to alleviate the difficulties arising from the current high cost of credit.</P>
    <P>There is a large volume of investment currently being undertaken on farms&mdash;and we have a very large number of farmers now completing their investment programmes.  It is important that all new investments should be part of a carefully planned development programme.  This applies as much to the smaller farmer as to the large one.  Every farmer is entitled to avail in full of the farm advisory service to help in drawing up a farm plan.  The advisory service is now at sufficient strength that any farmer can get advice on a person to person basis, or as members of a small group.</P>
    <P>From 1 July, the agricultural advisory service, as well as agricultural education and training, will be the responsibility of the newly established An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaiochta (ACOT) which will be taking over the work on these matters which has hitherto been discharged by my Department and the County Committees of Agriculture. When the new body is fully operational, Irish farmers will have available to them a highly modern system of advice, training and education, designed to meet their needs and enable them to realise the full potential of their farms.</P>
    <P>It is clear that on a large proportion of Irish farms considerably higher incomes could be earned through better farm management programmes.  What is required is that standards already reached by the efficient farmer be attained by those who, for one reason or another, are not using their resources as effectively.  This does not mean that the farmers must work longer hours, but rather than the system of labour utilisation must be rationalised and planned, in <Col N="2166" /> the knowledge that the farm work force is the most valuable resource on the farm.  It is here that the advice and help of ACOT can have the greatest benefit.</P>
    <P>At the individual farm level, the best prospects for increasing farm incomes lie in a substantial improvement in the productivity of the basic resources of labour, land and capital which are employed in farm production.  It is essential that full recognition be given to the fact that incomes earned by the individual farmer are primarily a consequence of the business policy followed on his own farm.  In other words, farm incomes are basically the responsibility of the farmer and the result of his decisions in the use he makes of the resources available to him.  The Government provide grants to assist farmers improve their efficiency and the Common Agricultural Policy gives a guarantee on markets and prices, but it is the farmer who brings his own skills and effort into play in determining the use he makes of his resources and the income he generates for himself and his family.</P>
    <P>The need for higher efficiency in agriculture applies not only at the production stage, but also at the processing and marketing stages.  The development of processing and marketing efficiency has been directly helped by grants to processors and by the establishment of State-sponsored marketing agencies.  In connection with marketing, I should like to express once again the Government's support for the concept of centralised export marketing. We are a small country and by international standards the quantities which we have to export are small.  If these small quantities are exported by a large number of competing exporters, the result is that our products realise less than they otherwise might and at the end of the line the losses from the haphazard unco-ordinated approach fall on the farmer.  In the case of dairy products. Bord Bainne has been a great success as a marketing organisation.  The position in the case of pigmeat has been less satisfactory.  This week's High Court decision in the matter of levies by the <Col N="2167" /> Pigs and Bacon Commission has been awaited with anxiety by all interests in the bacon industry.  Now that the court has given its decision, we should all get our heads together to see how best to mend our fences and decide where we go from here.  I will be inviting all interests in the bacon industry to have talks with me about the future, and I would hope that we will succeed in finding sufficient common ground among the various interests to enable us to decide on the steps needed for further development.</P>
    <P>A special effort is called for to raise the level of processing intensity in the agriculture-based industries and should help to provide the additional employment that the country needs.  Such an effort requires not only the identification and development of products which are labour-intensive and have a high value-added content, but also the development of a corresponding marketing capacity. The increasing industrial processing of agricultural commodities has highlighted the importance of consistent quality of farm output on a year-round basis, so that output meets processing requirements.</P>
    <P>This problem is of particular significance in the dairying industry.  If that industry is to maximise its contribution to the realisation of the national objective of increased job creation, a growing proportion of milk output will have to be diverted to the manufacture of products with greater employment content. The IDA strategy for the industry aims at diversifying milk output into products with greater employment potential and for which market opportunities are likely to be available.  As a result of this strategy, the number of new jobs in the dairy processing industry could be increased significantly.</P>
    <P>In the cattle sector, the gap between the price levels for cattle in other EEC member states and those in Ireland shows that there is scope for further increases in our prices.  Export marketing and transport costs account for part of this gap but it can be narrowed appreciably by improvements in the quality of our cattle.  The beef carcase classification <Col N="2168" /> scheme which has recently come into operation is aimed at improving the quality of our cattle by creating an awareness of the financial benefits obtainable in the market for quality beef. IDA assistance to the beef industry has the objective of improving efficiency and increasing production in the growth areas of boning-out of carcases into vacuum-packed and portion-controlled cuts and processing into frozen and canned products.  Such diversification would give rise to higher employment and value-added for any given volume of meat input.  Improvement of efficiency is, of course, desirable in itself but it should also lead to improved returns for producers.</P>
    <P>To maximise the contribution of the agricultural based industries to prosperity in agriculture and to employment, it is necessary to ensure consistently high quality of output, more intensive processing, more vigorous marketing, and greater all round efficiency.  State investment through the IDA's development strategies for these industries, the expansion of the role of CBF, the introduction of the beef carcase classification scheme and an increase in the State guarantee for borrowings by An Bord Bainne are all geared to meeting these necessities.  The achievements of the maximum added value is not only important for exported agricultural produce; it is equally important for produce sold on our home market.</P>
    <P>I should like now to consider briefly the situation in each of the wider sectors of agriculture.  The future for beef is good.  We have natural advantages which make us a low cost producer and beef is not in structural surplus in the Community.</P>
    <P>Following this year's price package, we are nearer than we have been for many years to an unpartitioned common market in agricultural produce.  If we leave the exceptional situation of Germany to one side, MCAs have virtually gone.  Substantial opportunities for development exist and will continue to exist, but in order to exploit these enterprise and innovation will be called for. <Col N="2169" /> We will have to reach beyond the limits which traditional trading patterns place on us.  New markets will have to be sought, both inside and outside the Community, and a vigorous marketing policy pursued.  Over-reliance on intervention sales, which is coming under increasing criticism within the Community, is not the way to good marketing.</P>
    <P>From the end of last year the beef industry was under threat of suspension of intervention during the summer months. This would have seriously damaged the industry and have upset producers' confidence. Fortunately we were able to ensure that the suspension was not implemented this year.  However, it would be foolish to regard the danger as having disappeared completely for ever.  There is, as I have said, increasing criticism of intervention and the cost of operating that system is under continuing attack. Our industry here should use the time available to reduce their dependence on intervention.  I fully appreciate that this cannot be done overnight and that it is necessary to avoid upsetting producer prices.  However, it would only be prudent to take precautions against the possibility of further efforts to restrict intervention purchases, particularly during those weeks when supplies are seasonally low.  The Government are fully committed to defending the basic principles of the CAP.  Their work in doing this will be more effective if we can show that our exporters are sparing no efforts to dispose of as much of our production as possible on commercial markets and that intervention is used for the purpose for which it was designed, that is as a floor support for producers and not as a market outlet in its own right.</P>
    <P>In the milk sector we have to accept that the Community's pricing policy will be more stringent in future than it was in the past.  During the transitional period we could of course also look forward to price increases resulting from our alignment to the Community price system. Higher productivity must compensate for the slow down in the rate of price increases. There is no reason why our <Col N="2170" /> dairy farmers cannot achieve increased yields per cow to place us on a par with average Community yields.  We are still 200 gallons a cow behind some of our main EEC competitors.  To achieve better milk yields we will need to avail fully of the many natural advantages which make Ireland particularly well suited to milk production.</P>
    <P>The scope for development is clearly there.  The return per acre which most Irish farmers can get from dairying is far better than they can get from other types of farming.  The progress of dairying since we joined the EEC is a clear example of the ability of the milk sector to grasp the opportunities presented by the Common Agricultural Policy.  I have every confidence that the milk sector will continue to progress and cope fully with the demands of the future.  As far as I am concerned, milk is still the best possibility that the smaller farmer has of making an adequate income for his family. The fact that our milk output has continued to grow in a period which has not been an easy one for the industry is an indication of the confidence of the dairying sector in the security provided by the Community support system and in its own ability to meet any short-term difficulties that occur.  The Government are acutely aware of the need to develop our dairying industry to its fullest potential. This year we succeeded in securing an increase of 4 per cent in the support price for milk in the prices package negotiated for the current year.  This was against a background of Community budgetary constraints and proposals to reduce the cost of the milk policy arising from the substantial surplus supply situation for milk within the Community. Most important, in these negotiations, we successfully opposed the super-levy proposal, as indeed we will continue to oppose any similar proposal in the future.  If some of the cost of disposing of surplus production is to be met by producers, then all who produce milk must share in the cost and not just those who happen to have increased production at a particular time. The Government are adamant that the legitimate development expectations of <Col N="2171" /> the Irish dairying industry must not be unfairly impeded.</P>
    <P>There is still considerable scope for expansion in the sheep sector.  We have shown that we can produce the quality lambs demanded by the French market. The current temporary restrictions on access to the French market, due to a severe oversupply situation on that market, are a source of concern to me.  I have raised the matter with the French Minister for Agriculture and my officials have had talks with French officials.  I am still pursuing the matter and I am hopeful that we will be able to maintain our traditional level of exports of quality lamb to the French market.</P>
    <P>As an indication of my own confidence in the future of the industry, I reintroduced the mountain lamb extension scheme earlier this year in order to boost the morale of producers of mountain lamb who had experienced particular difficulties in 1979.  There is a great need for higher standards of feeding and management in mountain and hill areas so that more profitable lambs are produced.  Yesterday I announced that this scheme would be continued in the final four months of the year.  This will give added confidence to the mountain producers who account for such a high proportion of our total output.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial growth in pig supplies over the past year in spite of the tight margins during recent months. Pig production has become an increasingly specialised business, demanding a high level of management expertise.  There is still room for improved efficiency in production&mdash;particularly in the improvement of efficiency of feed utilisation.  A more orderly approach to marketing can help to improve profitability by raising prices realised on our export markets.  Returns for our export bacon have suffered because of the weak UK market and fragmented selling. Our quality bacon is on a par with the best but we must ensure that our marketing will assure us of prices which will more closely reflect this.  As I have already stated I shall be going into the <Col N="2172" /> marketing system with the various interests concerned, in the light of this week's High Court decision.</P>
    <P>The poultry sector has been experiencing problems arising from the growth of imports particularly of eggs from the North.  While we do not complain about fair and reasonable competition, I am concerned that there should be no selling below cost of production and that our market should not be used as a dumping ground for surplus production.  This is something which I have raised with the EEC Commission and the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>The weather this year has been much more favourable to tillage than 1979, and I expect to see an increase in total crop output.  I understand that the experts take the view that the total acreage is up, in spite of a reported slight fall in seed sales.  Both winter and spring sown cereal crops look exceptionally well, and are now more forward than at this time in 1978 and 1979.  The outlook for tillage is good, and there is certainly scope for putting more land under crop production.</P>
    <P>In regard to disease eradication I think that at last the message is getting across that it is in all our interests to wipe out the two major bovine diseases, in TB and brucellosis, which have bedevilled our national cattle herd down through the years.  These diseases can, and I am determined that they shall, be eradicated, but this can only be achieved by unrelenting vigilance and strict adherence to the rules and regulations laid down by my Department.  Some herdowners and other interests may find these regulations irksome, but they were devised solely for the farmers' and the national well-being.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years good progress has been made towards the goal of eradication.  The percentage of TB reactors disclosed during the round of testing just ended was the lowest on record.  A further round has just started and I look forward with confidence to an even better set of results.  However, there is no room for complacency.  The incidence of TB is still far too high, especially <Col N="2173" /> in the southern dairying counties, and we are around the bottom of the league among the EEC member states. All the interests involved must, therefore, keep up an all-out campaign to ensure that this disease is eliminated, thereby safeguarding our valuable export trade in cattle, beef and dairy products.</P>
    <P>Full scale eradication measures for brucellosis now operate in 16 counties. These include Cork where compulsory measures were introduced last August. The disease incidence encountered there was somewhat less than we expected, and the experience gained in taking on this large county with such a high cattle population will be a great help in tackling the remaining counties.</P>
    <P>Farmers and their organisations have adopted an enlightened attitude towards disease eradication over the past couple of years.  This is a praiseworthy development, and the momentum and zeal which is so evident must not be dissipated but rather built on and developed.  The minority who flagrantly abuse the regulations must be identified and subjected to the full rigours of the law.  This week I have made an order adding Galway and Roscommon to the brucellosis free area.  This step, which resulted from the improved disease incidence in these counties, will facilitate trade within the area and broaden the base for live cattle exports.</P>
    <P>Nearly 90 per cent of our farms do not have brucellosis.  We must push on towards the 100 per cent mark.  Farmers and their co-operatives have put a lot of effort into the pre-intensive campaign in the ten southern and south-eastern counties over the past few years, and this year's milk ring test results in those counties show a significant drop in the level of brucellosis among dairy herds. Encouraged by these results and the positive attitude of farmers we are now at a stage when we can contemplate taking the final major step in the eradication campaign by bringing these ten counties into the brucellosis clearance area.  I visualise this happening towards the end of Autumn.  Given the determination and <Col N="2174" /> enthusiasm which now exists, I am confident that we are very definitely on the way towards getting rid of brucellosis from our national herd within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The recent debates on the Land Bond Bill and on the Estimates for my Department afforded Deputies an opportunity to express their views on land policy and on the operations of the Land Commission. The Government have devoted a considerable amount of time to considering the major issue of a new land policy. They are very conscious of the importance of land restructuring both from the economic and the social aspect, and they have accordingly decided that their views as to the action which should be taken should be set out in a White Paper.  Work on the preparation of this White Paper is already under way with a view to early publication.  This will give an opportunity for interested parties to express their views on the Government's ideas and enable due regard to be given to those views in the drafting of the new legislation which will in any event be going ahead at the same time.  While I do not propose to give details now of the Government's thinking, the basic objective of future policy will be to promote the efficient use of land and to ensure that the deserving family farmer who needs more land, and will be prepared to work it, will be able to compete more effectively for the extra acreage he needs.  I am committed to having a Bill before the House by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I announced increased cattle and sheep headage rates for the disadvantaged areas for 1980 as well as the new higher limit for off-farm income for participants in the headage scheme. Other measures which I announced were the continuation of the hogget ewe scheme in the lowland areas, an increase of 5p per gallon for producers of liquid milk and a grant of £75,000 for agricultural export promotion measures recommended by the Agricultural Exports Co-ordinating Group.  I also indicated that we are examining how the benefit of the increased FEOGA recoupment under the Disadvantaged Areas <Col N="2175" /> Scheme can be passed on to producers. In the coming months we shall be taking steps to bring into operation the new comprehensive EEC package for the west, the new beef suckler scheme and the new market organisation for sheepmeat.  All these measures constitute very positive evidence of the Government's commitment to the further development of agriculture and in particular the Government's concern for the smaller farmers in the disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>It has been said from time to time that the west of Ireland has not really benefited from EEC and Government measures.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  One only has to look at farms in the west to see the vast improvements which have taken place in the west during the last decade. This is not to say that difficulties have been eliminated or overcome for all time. Disadvantaged areas will always be at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the more fertile regions and that is why we operate measures to supplement incomes in those areas.  The increases in the headage payments in disadvantaged areas and the Mountain Lamb Extension Scheme which I announced yesterday is yet another illustration of this Government's continuous commitment to farming in the west of Ireland.  The implementation of the special western package will continue to display this commitment over the next ten years as accelerated improvements to roads, water supplies, electricity, education, land improvement, on-farm investments, beef fattening, forestry and agricultural marketing and processing take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to refer to reports in the press recently of statements about the dire position of farmers, with forecasts of further gloom and doom to come.  I am fully aware that farmers had a difficult year in 1979 and this has been widely recognised by me on a number of occasions.  However, I entirely reject the notion that farmers are <Col N="2177" /> faced with impending disaster, or that the recent Brussels price package was of no value to the agricultural industry. What would be the position if there had been no Brussels price package? Producers would certainly be very much worse off.</P>
    <P>It has also been stated that the agreement reached in Brussels after long sessions of hard bargaining will not result in any increase in farm gate prices.  EEC prices are, of course, not fixed at the farm gate but relate to ex-creamery or ex-factory sales.  As a large part of our creameries meat and bacon factories and so on are owned by farmers, it is up to them to decide what prices will actually be paid to producers from the total receipts for sales of their products.  Our recent Brussels agreement will result in better prices to the primary producers, though of course it takes a while for the effects of any Council decisions to be fully apparent.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations in Brussels I was concerned to ensure that we got the best possible deal for the agricultural sector as a whole.  The final outcome gave the lie to the gloomy predictions that were being made earlier about the outcome of this year's discussions.  The compromise package finally agreed was important to all sections of agriculture.  The key intervention support for beef remains unchanged, there is no super levy on milk, there is a Community scheme to support beef suckler herds, there is to be a common regime for sheepmeat, and finally the average increase of about 5 per cent is double the original proposal.  To suggest that on top of this agreement farmers might expect national aids on prices is totally unrealistic.  Our whole agricultural sector is dependent on maintaining the common agricultural policy, and we will not only do nothing ourselves to undermine that policy but will fight to see that it retains its present role in the European Community in the future.</P>
    <P>In spite of the problems farmers have had to face over the past year, there has been a resurgence of confidence in the <Col N="2178" /> industry over the past few months.  No doubt the better weather this year has been an important factor, but the Government's determination to give every possible help to the industry has been equally significant.  In this connection the measures which I announced yesterday and the others that are in the pipeline should certainly stimulate farmers' faith in their own industry and in their ability to expand and develop. Farmers now know clearly where they stand on the taxation issue and can concentrate on planning the development of their farm enterprises.  For their part the Government will not be found wanting. Our determination to support and aid the agricultural sector has been amply demonstrated by us in recent months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start by doing two things which may seem rather dull because I have done them before, but I will relate them clearly to the situation which was described in the opening speech yesterday morning.  I wish to demolish the myth, by reference to official figures, that the country had been left in a sorry state by the National Coalition Government; and, secondly, the myth that in some way the difficulties that the Government are facing have been largely caused by the level of oil prices.</P>
      <P>The National Coalition Government fought the 1977 election with weapons which were perhaps unsophisticated, electorally speaking.  I would be sorry if we were ever forced to use other kinds of weapons.  We were essentially in a situation of a Government using short Lee-Enfield rifles against an enemy willing to use poison-gas.  We were prepared to offer a certain number of reforms, but we were not prepared to make promises that could not be fulfilled.  In that respect our techniques were old fashioned.  I do not apologise for them, but they were certainly old fashioned compared with the techniques with which we were then confronted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Four years of Coalition misrule have left the country in a sorry state&rdquo;&mdash;those were the opening words of the manifesto <Col N="2179" /> which elected Deputy Nolan and all his friends.  I want to contrast the figures of 1976 and 1977 with the figures which are available today.  I repeat: these are not my figures: I did not pull them out of the air, invent them or cook them or dress them.  Any member of the press or the public who wants me to supply those figures&mdash;not in my handwriting but in the print of the Central Statistics Office and the Central Bank&mdash;has only to give me a call and I will provide them for him.  There are some things in the country not yet corrupted or cowed.  The Central Statistics Office is one, and the Central Bank is another.  I propose to go on trusting their figures, as I did when they showed things that were unwelcome to me also.</P>
    <P>In 1976-77 the growth rate of this economy was 5.2 per cent, the highest growth rate in the EEC in the very year in which the Irish people were invited to regard their economy as in a state of disaster in consequence of the efforts of Deputy Tully.  Deputy Liam Cosgrave. Deputy Garret FitzGerald and the rest of us.  It was 5.2 per cent then.  What will it be this year?  The Central Bank's forecast is 0.5 per cent, the lowest growth figure in the Community by a long shot.</P>
    <P>In 1976 our adverse trade balance was £479 million&mdash;too much.  In 1977 it was £572 million&mdash;also too much, taking into account the change in the value of money.  Certainly, these figures were too high.  But the 1979-80 trade balance, counting the 12 months to the end of May 1980 is £1,398 million.  It is almost three times the worst figure the Coalition ever achieved in adverse trade balance.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments deficit in 1976 was £157 million.  That is the balance left after the trade balance has been improved by the addition of invisible items such as tourism and remittances. It was calculated by the Central Statistics Office and the Central Bank as £157 million in 1976.  It was marginally better in 1977 at £155 million.  The Central Bank's forecast for 1980 is £747 million; and it was almost as bad in 1979&mdash;five times the Coalition's worst.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2180" /> The average rate of inflation in the 12 months ended 15 May 1977 was 13.9 per cent&mdash;far too high&mdash;but the measures we took, as Deputies opposite will recognise, brought it down within a time in which the measures contributed by the succeeding Government scarcely could be said to have much contributed, to 6 per cent or 7 per cent in the following year.  But it was too high in May 1977 at 13.9 per cent.  Three years later to the day it is 20.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The average price of a new house in 1976&mdash;I have the sensation of looking at an old advertisement or shopping list from the time of the First World War when I look at these figures&mdash;was £12,258. These are not my figures, but figures provided by the Department of the Environment.  In Deputy Tully's day he was quite happy and proud to be Minister for Local Government.  That was not trendy or grand enough for Fianna Fáil; it had to be the Department of the Environment.  All it has succeeded in doing is putting pot-holes in roads that once were driveable on.  It is the &ldquo;Environment&rdquo;, not Local Government, now.  Its figures show that the average price of a new house only four years ago was £12,258.  In the following year, 1977 &mdash;and this is the average spread over the whole year for all areas&mdash;the price had risen to £14,770, an increase to which I have no doubt the £1,000 new house grant which won Fianna Fáil many votes somewhat contributed, because instantly, as we predicted, it resulted in builders raising their prices.  The average price of a new house in the first quarter of 1980, according to the figures of the same Department, is £25,605, over twice what it was in 1976.  That is not the Stone Age; it is only the day before yesterday; it is only the time of the National Coalition that had the country ruined, that had us beggared.  But we were able to get new houses for less than half what they cost now, not to speak of the situation in regard to interest rates to which new house purchasers are subject if they want to put a roof over their heads.</P>
    <P>The change in the volume of investment&mdash;always regarded as an important <Col N="2181" /> thing&mdash;is also a significant figure that is calculated by adding from one year to the next the total of buildings, total purchases of equipment and plant and subtracting whatever in the way of equipment and plant has been demolished or exported&mdash;was plus 12.2 per cent.  The change in 1977 was plus 10.5 per cent.  These were the dark ages in the Fianna Fáil mythology, the years the National Coalition should apologise for.  What is the change in the level of investment this year, in the Central Bank's forecast?  When they made the forecast, put the figures together and sent them to the printers in March they forecast a negative change, a change with a minus figure to denote it, minus 1¼ per cent. But that was three months ago, and things are moving very fast.  They have now revised their figures&mdash;downwards, by a further five points&mdash;and it is going to be minus 5 or 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>If those were black days four years ago, in Deputy Cosgrave's time, Deputy Jim Tully's time and Deputy Paddy Donegan's time, what are we to say about 1980?  What can we say about those geniuses opposite?  We have 30 of them.  You can throw in the Attorney General and make it 31.  We have 30 of them in Ministerial offices of one kind or another.  All that extra brain power throbbing away has produced that result compared with ours.  We have 15 ministers of State with 15 cars, 15 private secretaries and I suppose an establishment of 60 or 70 other civil service staff, all turning out the very same quantum of work as seven parliamentary secretaries did in Deputy Cosgrave's day.  They have far grander titles&mdash;yes, and a much bigger output of letters around the constituencies and departments and much more back-slapping in the constituencies.  But what is the result when the smoke blows away?  Those are the figures, and anybody who wants those figures will have them from me with not one line of my handwriting on them, but photocopied from official documentation.  That is an invitation that I offer to any member of the public or the press.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> It may be said that I have forgotten about unemployment and that this is an area in which Fianna Fáil have really scored&mdash;&ldquo;you must hand it to them there&rdquo;.  I will hand it to them.  I shall give the figures.  In 1977 at the end of May the seasonally adjusted unemployment was 106,800 persons.  In 1980, at the end of the same month it was 94,700, an improvement of 12,100 persons.  I do not want to be accused of over-simplifying this: I realise that individual persons and jobs do not correspond.  That figure is almost identical with the number by which public service employment has been recklessly pushed up by this Government.  Compare that figure with their target, which was a reduction in unemployment of 5,000 in 1977, plus 20,000 in 1978, plus 25,000 in 1979, plus 30,000 in 1980, giving a grand total of 80,000 reduction in unemployment at the end of this year.  We are now half way through the year and the reduction, which exactly corresponds to the additional desk employment which is costing the country, in my estimate, £120 million a year, is 12,000&mdash;some achievement.</P>
    <P>The State debt figures show that in 1976 the external indebtedness of the Government to foreign countries was just over one billion; it was £1,039.5 million.  In the following year it was reduced by a marginal sum to £1,038.5 million.  This year it is £1 billion 800 million.</P>
    <P>The total national debt in 1977, at the end of that year&mdash;it had been pushed up very fast in the second half of 1977 &mdash;was £4,228 million and it is now £6½ billion.</P>
    <P>If the situation of 1976 and 1977 was the apocalypse, an economic Armageddon, what is one to say about 1980?  Is there anything to be said about it, except that the people are ten times more ungovernable now than they were then, ten times less willing to take advice, let alone the empty bleating we got from the Taoiseach yesterday, ten times more ungrateful and ten times more unwilling to recognise the efforts which all Governments have to put into trying to run the <Col N="2183" /> country.  They have been defrauded and deceived by the Government now sitting opposite.  They do not believe me when they hear me saying so because they say: &ldquo;That is only Deputy Kelly, who wants to get back to the far side of the House if we let him.  We cannot believe it from him&rdquo;.  I accept that.  That is part of politics.  Any person interested in this can get the figures from me but they are not my figures.  They are the figures provided by the State agencies which have not yet been cowed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office have not yet gone the way of &ldquo;Hall's Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;.  We were able to endure the black statistics of 1974 and 1975 just as we endured week in and week out the lampooning by &ldquo;Hall's Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;.  We endured; and enjoyed it.  I often went home from this House in those days, tired and sweaty after a day as Government Whip, and was able to sit back and enjoy the depictions of Deputy Liam Cosgrave and the Cruiser. I was able to laugh at my colleagues and once or twice at myself.  But the skins of the Soldier of Destiny are for too thin for that.  Once there was any talk about Judas Mac Sleeveen, that was the end of &ldquo;Hall's Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;.  One might as easily get me to believe that the earth is flat as that the demise of that programme had no political content in its motivation.</P>
    <P>Those are the figures, and those are the black and stark facts after three years of this Government.  Before I pass to the second myth I want to say a few words about the confidence with which the first myth was propagated.  It was propagated by a team led by Senator Eoin Ryan, a quiet, respectable looking man who presided over the formulation of that fraudulent election campaign. Where is Senator Eoin Ryan now? When did anyone last hear from him?  It reminds me, as I think I said on another occasion about somebody else, of Hamlet's reflection when he found the guts of Polonius behind the arras:</P>
    <P>Now is that councillor most still, most silent and most grave <Col N="2184" /> That was in life a foolish, prating knave.</P>
    <P>Where are all the other experts with their fraudulent advertising, which told the people there were 160,000 people unemployed in the very months when the Labour Force Survey of the EEC subsequently showed that that figure was exaggerated by 60,000?  Where are they all now?  They are now busily trying to pretend to the people that the difficulties about which the Taoiseach spoke here yesterday are attributable to oil prices.</P>
    <P>I want to give the House a few more figures which, again, are not mine.  They are again the figures from the Central Statistics Office.  They will have to do a Frank Hall job on the CSO if they are to change those figures and if they want different ones.  Those figures show a classification of product and commodity sectors, and they show the total import picture over the year.  It is quite true that oil imports have played over the last years, during the last two-thirds of the seventies, a disturbingly heavy part and role in our imports scene.  It has to be said that the big jump took place in 1973 and 1974.  In 1973 our oil imports cost £67 million and the total import bill was £1,137 million.  One's brain, and mine most of all, tends to flicker with the constant repetition of figures.  If the House will believe me that I have not made false transcriptions of these figures and will trust my mathematics and computing of percentages, I will tell the House those percentages.  Any member of the public or press who wants to work it out for himself can go back over those figures and see if I am wrong.  If I am wrong I will apologise.</P>
    <P>To the best of my ability to compute, the percentage of total imports represented by oil in 1973 was 5.9.  In 1974 it had jumped to 12.8, which is much the biggest jump this entire decade shows.  In 1975, 1976 and 1977 it remained at that relatively high level.  The figures in those years are respectively 13.2 12.4 and 11.4.  The total sank a bit in 1978 but the real significant feature in the sinking of the percentage was the enormous boom in consumer imports from abroad, <Col N="2185" /> triggered off by the reckless handing out of money by the Government in response to their election promises.  It sank to 9.1 per cent and in 1979 was back to 10.8 per cent.  In the first five months of 1980 it is 13.6 per cent again, exactly the same figure as it was in 1975.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to offend the Minister for Energy, for whom I have a lot of sympathy and a great deal of respect for the courage and resilience he has shown in recent months.  I am prepared to recognise him as the nearest thing the Fianna Fáil party have to a saint.  He is inclined to say that the oil figures are a terrible burden on the economy, that they represent so much grabbed out of the national product and scattered abroad.  That is quite true.  The same story is in the mouth of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  It was said no less than four times yesterday by the Taoiseach in regard to its bearing on the adverse balance of payments; but its bearing in percentage terms is exactly the same as it was in 1975.  Nobody regarded it as an excuse for us.  It is exactly the same, to within a few tenths of a percentage point.  It is of the same order as it has been all through the latter two-thirds of the Seventies.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy, to stick to the slightly ecclesiastical image which I introduced a moment ago, seems to have the old fashioned view, if I may compare it with the theological view I was brought up in at school, that there are different kinds of sin.  He seems to think that a £ spent on oil compared with a £ spent on something else is like a sin against purity which, for some reason never well explained, one is supposed to be more ashamed of than a sin against any other virtue&mdash;that somehow money spent on crude oil dirties the spender in a way that money spent on consumer goods, which the people have been recklessly encouraged to import and buy, does not dirty them at all.  I am simple enough to think that a £ note spent abroad is a £ note spent abroad no matter what it is spent on.  If the proportion spent on oil has been too high the <Col N="2186" /> proportion spent on other things, on consumer goods particularly, is also too high.</P>
    <P>That myth must be completely put out of court.  It plays absolutely no part whatsoever in this picture.  There is no difference between money spent on oil and money spent on anything else.  The proportion represented by oil imports has been pretty well constant all through the latter end of the Seventies.  I cannot say that the picture will not change. Perhaps it will change but, most certainly, it cannot be pleaded as a reason why the economy is in any special difficulties now.</P>
    <P>Those are the myths.  I had hoped&mdash;I have left myself short of time even with a measure of indulgence&mdash;to try and make it clear that the reason why those myths are material, not merely to history, not merely to a justification of the National Coalition Government but to what is happening now, is because they are material to an indictment of the Government for having stood the Keynesian axiom on its head.  That is what they did in 1977, 1978 and 1979.  We are all paying the consequences now.  The economy is in a far weaker position to do it.  They stood the Keynesian axiom on its head. The recession was over in 1976 and 1977.  The figures I have shown to the House prove it; or if it was not over, what have we to say about 1980.</P>
    <P>Every single economic indicator was climbing upwards where upwards was the good direction, or downwards where downwards was the good direction, as from early 1976 and in some cases as from late 1975.  That was the time to put the reins on public expenditure.  It was the time not to fling revenue away, but to save for the rainy day by cutting down on foreign borrowing and not to lead people to a situation of inflated expectations which, because they could not be met, would cause the people to become rebellious&mdash;and we will be lucky if they do not turn out revolutionary as well as rebellious.  What was done was to fling revenue away recklessly.  Car tax and rates were abolished.  There were income <Col N="2187" /> tax allowances on all sides: handouts of every kind by way of making it clear to the people that Deputy Cosgrave and the other members of the National Coalition had been not only incompetent but malicious in making times hard for the people.  We see now where we are.  I admit that we are experiencing the effects of an international recession, that world trade is very bad.  Fianna Fáil cannot be blamed for that; but this is the time for which they should have left themselves some leeway for throwing into wage negotiations the kind of makeweights that the National Coalition were able to throw in.</P>
    <P>One is reminded almost of the nineteenth century or of some other vanished age in looking at figures such as those produced by the Coalition, and which we are supposed to apologise for, compared with the figures we are confronted with now.  Let us consider the figures at which the national wage agreements of 1976 and 1977 were achieved, the figures at which the working people were willing to settle and who, despite all their grumbling, had sufficient confidence in and respect for the then Government to have settled for these agreements.</P>
    <P>In September, 1976, a seven-month agreement was concluded for the period 31 April to 31 October.  The figure was 3 per cent of basic pay plus £2 per week subject to a maximum of £5 per week. But who would thank us for suggesting such a deal now?  In 1977 the settlement which was ratified on 23 February was for a 14-month period and consisted of a first phase of 10 months and a second phase of four months.  The terms of each phase were identical.  They were 2½ per cent of basic pay plus £1 per week subject to a minimum increase of £2 or a maximum of £4.13p.  Who would dare to talk in those terms now, when people are seeking increases of 30, 40 and 50 per cent?  They are doing so because they have been led to suppose that all they need do is vote themselves an increase, that all they need do is to put in that rotten crew over there and the increases will be given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> While in Government we made enemies.  The people grumbled.  We were over-worked and we lost our tempers. We made mistakes, but the people had a certain feeling that we were trying to do justice.  We may have been mistaken on the wealth tax.  We may have been mistaken, too, on the capital acquisitions tax.  We may have got the thresholds wrong; but instinctively we were trying to reach a situation of equity, and that is vital to trust; because unless a government have the people's understanding and acceptance of their determination to be fair, there will not be any chance of achieving reasonable wage settlements.</P>
    <P>We were all supposed to believe that the Taoiseach is the most experienced man in the Government, but for him to pretend now that the situation in which we find ourselves is one that has been wished on us from the outside world is the greatest fraud of all.  For as long as this party have strength left, we shall make that fraud apparent to the people.</P>

At the conclusion of his speech yesterday, the Taoiseach gave a guarantee that the poorer sections of the population will be protected in the situation that confronts us.  The people of Ireland, both rich and poor, need to be protected against the Government over which the Taoiseach presides.  What this party require is a general election now&mdash;not another budget or a wage settlement&mdash;so that the people may be given the opportunity of putting into <Col N="2189" /> power a government in which the people, no matter how much they may grumble, will have some confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett):</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to concentrate on the more important aspects of the activities of my Department.  This year the Department and the local authorities together will spend an estimated £754 million.  The local authorities will spend £714 million of this amount while about £480 million of that £714 million will come from central Government by way of grants and special issues from the Local Loans Fund.  The balance will be raised by local authorities from rates and the other sources of Revenue available to them.  The massive injection of funds by the Government into the local authority sector emphasises the sector's important contribution to national economic and social progress. The local authorities are the providers of many vital services, the absence of which would seriously affect the ordinary living of the whole community.  It should also be remembered that the local authorities make an important contribution to economic advancement in the area of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution of local authorities to the economic and social well-being of the community is not by any means limited to their participation in the major development programmes which go to make up the public capital programme. The every-day activities of our local authorities involve the operation and maintenance of a whole range of services which affect our daily lives.  We sometimes take these services for granted, at least until some breakdown or weakness in the services brings them forcibly to notice.  The value of these services to the community cannot be measured in money terms alone. Nevertheless, finance is an important aspect.  Local authorities this year were able to budget for expenditure of nearly £510 million.  This is for their ordinary non-capital services which are covered in their annual rates estimates.  The £510 <Col N="2190" /> million represents an increase of almost £73 million or 17 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1979.</P>
    <P>The amount of money which can be made available to local authorities must be balanced against the provision being made for other public sector activities. The Government have held that balance very fairly.  An increase of £73 million in 1980 over last year cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered less than fair in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about housing.  In this regard I think it noteworthy that, despite the gloomy forecasts made by speakers from the other side of the House, last year saw the completion of 26,500 houses and indications for this year are also very encouraging. New house completions for the first five months at about 13,300 are the highest on record.  The figure for the same period in 1979 was 11,900.  Last year, an all-time record of 20,300 new private houses were completed.</P>
    <P>One of the key items in determining the well-being of the private housing market is the availability of mortgage finance.  The principal source of finance for the purchase of houses is, of course, the building societies.  Last year, the societies advanced £200 million in the financing of houses.  In the first quarter of this year, £66 million was paid out by the societies in respect of new and other houses.</P>
    <P>During 1979 the societies held their investment and mortgage rates at 9 per cent and 14.15 per cent respectively&mdash;this, despite the fact that other financial institutions had significantly increased their rates.  The societies maintained those rates until May of this year but when the associated banks announced in April that they were increasing their minimum investment rates, the societies informed me that they felt they would have no option but to increase their investment and mortgage rates. Following a meeting attended by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself, it was decided to establish a <Col N="2191" /> working group to examine the problem faced by the societies.</P>
    <P>The working group found that the proposed increases were justified and the Government decided to subsidise the societies' investment rate.  In coming to this decision the Government were extremely conscious of the heavy additional burden which would otherwise have fallen on borrowers.  The subsidy, which will cost the Government about £1.4 million in 1980 and about £18 million in a full year, will have the effect of preventing an increase of about £30 per month on loan repayments of £16,000 which is a fairly typical loan for new borrowers.  The need for the subsidy will of course be kept under constant review. I would like to record my appreciation of the help and co-operation given by the Irish Building Societies Association in the consideration and the implementation of this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given a wrong figure?  Did he say £1.4 million this year and £18 million in a full year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said.  It is the correct figure.  The reason is that it is paid in arrears every six months, as the building society themselves pay their interest rates.  Therefore, the only month this year in which the Government will have to foot the bill is June.  The remainder of the year would fall to be met next year.  The subsidy has a purpose and a very worthy one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to local authority housing.  With 8,924 dwellings under construction and with 6,644 men employed at 31 March 1980 the local authority housing construction programme is, despite what our critics like to say, in a healthy state.  Completions in each of the last three years have ranged between 6,100 and 6,300 and I am hopeful that completions this year will again be of that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2192" /> It is important to remember that despite sharply increased costs the Government consistently have pursued a policy of maintaining high standards of layout, design and construction for local authority housing.  Specific improvement measures include the provision of greater floor space, better quality of finish and improved insulation.  These improvements have to be paid for.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities are also required to include adequate landscaped open spaces in all their housing schemes and to reserve suitable land on their major schemes for essential amenities and community facilities, such as churches, schools and shops.  My Department have encouraged local authorities to pay greater attention to the provision of these amenities when planning their new housing developments.</P>
    <P>In talking about the financial aspects of the local authority housing programme one must refer to the subsidies payable by the Exchequer in respect of the provision of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The total direct State subsidy for the provision of local authority housing for letting is expected to amount to £62 million this year.  Another £300,000 will be paid to local authorities as a contribution towards the cost of the graduated subsidy on house purchase loans in accordance with the low rise mortgage scheme and a further £130,000 will be paid as a contribution towards the costs incurred in providing developed building sites for sale to qualified applicants.  The total Exchequer subsidy bill of £62.5 million compares with £31 million in 1977.  These amounts are high but are inevitable having regard to the commitment of this Government to provide housing accommodation for those who cannot do so for themselves from their own resources.</P>
    <P>As I have already informed the House, road grants totalling more than £53 million have been allocated to local authorities this year which is double the amount allocated in 1977.  This Government, since taking office three years ago, have allocated road grants totalling <Col N="2193" /> £144 million whereas the Coalition Government, in the three years 1975 to 1977 made available grants totalling £68 million.  Even when account is taken of inflation it must be recognised that the Government's performance leaves no room for criticism by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that legal responsibility for public roads is vested in the road authorities and it is their statutory duty to maintain and improve the roads for which they are responsible.  While my Department reimburse a large proportion of the expenditure incurred on road works by way of annual road grants, nevertheless it is the road authorities who decide the extent of the overall investment in the annual road works programme.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of criticism recently about the standard of maintenance of some roads.  I fully recognise that there are many compelling reasons for assigning a high priority to road maintenance, and the Road Development Plan for the 1980s assigns particular importance to it.  When measured in terms of road accidents, wear and tear of vehicles and waste of time and energy, the cost of inadequate road surfaces is considerable.  Furthermore, the neglect of a road leads to a cumulative process of deterioration resulting in the loss of much of the capital invested in building and improving it.</P>
    <P>It must also be realised that the performance of local authorities in the maintenance of their roads is readily apparent to the public, and it is on their performance in this area that the overall quality of local authority operations is most likely to be judged.  For those reasons I arranged some time ago that the city and county managers be asked to pay special attention this year to the question of road maintenance, particularly in relation to the principal roads which are those most used by the public. The matter was taken up also by the chief engineering adviser of my Department with the city and county engineers.  I am glad to say that, on the whole, the <Col N="2194" /> response of the managers and their engineers has been positive and constructive. Indeed there is evidence already of the extent to which the problem is being tackled.</P>
    <P>This year I have allocated grants totalling £9.3 million for the specific maintenance of the national routes which compares very favourably with the corresponding grants amounting to £5.2 million made in the last year of the National Coalition's term of office.  This indicates also the Government's commitment to maintaining and improving our roads.  As regards other roads, the funds available this year to the authorities from their own resources, including the rates support grant and the general road grant, is sufficient to enable them to carry out a satisfactory programme of road upkeep.</P>
    <P>Essential to the development of any area and the protection and improvement of its amenities is the existence of adequate water and sewerage services. Local authorities have a major responsibility in ensuring that existing schemes are properly maintained, and new schemes formulated and planned in good time, so that development is not unduly inhibited by a lack of services.  From the Government's point of view I am glad to say that the level of investment in the public water and sewerage programme has increased considerably in the past few years, from a level of £25 million in 1977 to £40 million in the current year, representing an increase of 60 per cent. This has made it possible for me to approve some 132 schemes estimated to cost £85 million over the last few years. These schemes are required to meet many different needs but all have one broad purpose in common, that is, to cater for economic and social development at local level.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be familiar with the role played by group schemes in bringing piped water to rural houses and adjoining farms.  Last year, group scheme domestic water installations reached an all time record level of nearly 10,950, bringing the total number of houses served by group schemes to <Col N="2195" /> 78,500.  The future prospects for group schemes are bright.</P>
    <P>I want to express my appreciation of the excellent co-operation given by county councils to my Department and groups in relation to the planning and execution of these projects.  Without such co-operation the local people would find it difficult to maintain their enthusiasm so vital to the success of those group schemes.</P>
    <P>Fire services are provided and maintained by local authorities and they have the primary responsibility to see that a reasonable service is provided.  I am concerned to ensure that the standard of the service keeps pace with the growing demands on it.  I have initiated various measures to promote standardisation and efficiency of the services and generally to support the development of the service by local authorities.  I have strengthened the capacity in my Department to deal with fire service matters to enable these measures to be pursued and to provide an ongoing appraisal and advisory service.</P>
    <P>Among the more important measures being taken at present are the local reviews of the strength and adequacy of the service which are at present being carried out by local authorities with guidance and support from my Department.</P>
    <P>There must be an adequate level of investment in the fire service and I am happy to say that the capital provision for the fire service has been increased significantly in the last few years.  This year's provision will enable local authorities to press ahead with their programmes for the building of much needed fire stations and the acquisition of modern fire-fighting equipment.  As a measure of the progress being achieved I should mention that 12 new fire stations or extensions were completed during the last two years, nine are at present under construction and a further 12 are expected to commence this year.  In addition, proposals for financing the purchase of 34 new fire appliances were approved by my Department in the last two years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2196" /> In my speech on the Estimates earlier this year I referred to the Environment Council's preliminary report entitled &ldquo;Towards an Environment Policy&rdquo;.  This report was published last year and contains a useful review of the present position and the issues concerned in developing policy.  The need for an environment policy has been outlined in this report and becomes more pressing as social and economic development proceeds.</P>
    <P>In general Ireland has a good environment although there are areas where improvements can be made.  It is true to say also that for some aspects there are disturbing trends.  In addition, with a rising standard of living, people are rightfully demanding that there should be an improvement in the overall quality of life of which the physical environment is an important element.  We must ensure, therefore, that economic development and the provision of more jobs is not obtained at a cost in environmental terms. The Environment Council's initial report has drawn our attention to this issue.  It has suggested, and I would agree, that there is no inherent conflict between development aims and the needs of a healthy and good quality environment.</P>
    <P>The environment must receive greater recognition for what it is, a major national resource, which is to be used but not abused.  In addition to its importance for tourism, which is very frequently stressed, there is a growing recognition of the importance of a good environment for industrial development and job creation.  Resources such as clean water, clear air, adequate and well managed waste disposal facilities and a pleasant natural environment are important developments for attracting foreign investment.  If we should allow our national resources to become polluted and depleted we may quickly find it more difficult to attract foreign investment.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that it is cheaper to prevent environmental damage than to remedy such damage in the future.  In fact, a small country such as ours, might find it difficult, if not impossible to generate the considerable <Col N="2197" /> funds that would be necessary to undo serious environmental damage or pollution. With our growing population and continuing development in the industrial and agricultural sectors it is now more than ever important that a national policy be prepared in order to ensure adequate protection and improvement of environmental resources.</P>
    <P>The implementation of an environment policy will have a cost for both protection and improvement measures. This is a matter that will have to be considered in relation to the benefits and the potentially greater costs of pollution and environmental deterioration if a policy is not implemented.</P>

      <P>An environmental matter with which I am particularly concerned and to which I have frequently referred, is the problem of litter, graffiti, fly posting and the abuse of public amenities.  The Environment Council's report on this matter entitled &ldquo;Litter and the Environment&rdquo; has recently been published.  In this report the litter problem is described as having the proportions of a national scandal, and this is a description with which I must agree.  Indeed, the evidence to support <Col N="2198" /> this conclusion is everywhere to be seen, both in rural and in urban areas.  The council's recommendations are being examined in my Department in consultation with the other Departments concerned, in order to determine appropriate action.  For my own part, I will be renewing my request to local authorities to extend their afforts in this matter and to ensure high standards in the operation of their own services and in the maintenance of public facilities.  I am aware of the good work that has been done in the past by many local authorities, State agencies and private organisations in this matter.  I appreciate also the frustration that can arise when there appears to be no appreciable result.  But efforts in this area must be continued and renewed.</P>
      <P>The importance of a good environment to the tourist industry and in attracting foreign investment cannot be overstressed.  We will need, therefore, to channel our efforts into solving the various environmental problems I have mentioned if the country's rich environmental assets are to be exploited to their full potential.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his speech yesterday stressed the importance of infrastructural development in relation to the maintenance and creation of employment. I have shown during my contribution to this debate that the amount of capital which the Government have provided for housing, sanitary services and roads during the past few years leaves little room for criticism.  Not alone will this massive injection of capital provide employment during the construction of these projects but it will also be of significant assistance to industrial development in the years ahead and to job creation.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate yesterday and today one would get the impression that the members of the present Government do not come down to earth at all but travel around by helicopter or other methods.  They can hardly bring the executive jet home with them.  The Minister for the Environment talks about the good state of the roads, and it is quite plain that he does not know what he is talking about.  The roads within a radius of 30 or 40 miles of Dublin which were traditionally good are now in many cases a morass.  What must they be like in the constituency which the Minister represents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was last in the area about six months ago and I would certainly not describe the roads as being in a very good condition.  There is no use in talking about the building of new roads because there is no money even to repair existing roads.  The Minister has mentioned various figures showing what he describes as a tremendous increase in the amount of money allocated to local authorities for road works, but he seems to have forgotten that inflation must be taken into account.  If he compares what we spent with what Fianna Fáil were spending when we took over, he will realise that his arguments ring very hollow. Local authorities all over the country are for the first time in ten years facing the problem of having to lay off <Col N="2200" /> regular road workers, pensionable servants of local authorities.  The Minister should look at the facts and figures, because either someone is codding him or he is trying to cod the House.  One local authority have laid off as many as 60 regular men.  Not only do I know the managers and engineers in most local authorities but I also know the staff, because during 30 years I organised them and helped to make a decent living for them.  They tell me that if repairs to the roads are carried out they will not have money to keep the men in employment. The result is that they are spending their time cutting weeds, opening watercuts and filling potholes with sand.  The sooner the better the Minister realises that this is the situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister also talked about housing. Deputy Kelly gave figures showing that an ordinary house now costs exactly twice as much as it did when the Minister took office.  The Minister must also remember that the number of houses being built must suffer.  I took over from a Fianna Fáil Government who thought that 17,000 or 18,000 private and local authority houses per year would be sufficient for the eighties. They put that on record.  When I became Minister I brought up the figure to 26,000 and the present Government should be attempting to keep the number growing. Because of inflation they are not prepared to find the money and the numbers are not as high as they should be and will continue to drop steadily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two reasons why money is forthcoming for private houses.  The first is that during the term of the Coalition Government I brought the building societies back from the 19th century. They were operating under an Act passed in 1899 and I brought in a Bill in 1976 which allowed various types of organisations to invest in building societies.  The Government now guarantee building society finance, which they did not do previously.  When we joined the EMS, for good or ill, money came back from abroad and much of it was invested in building societies.  That money is now running <Col N="2201" /> out, and the Minister must be careful that he does not find a situation in which the building societies are unable to lend any more money.  They are tightening up on their lending system, and some of them now require £2,000 to be invested for six months or £1,000 for 12 months before they will give a loan.  If the societies run out of money the Minister will realise the seriousness of the position.</P>
    <P>The building societies pay a common rate of interest and there is no competition between them in regard to lending money.  However, some of the societies seem to consider that they are entitled to spend substantial sums of money on sponsorship.  If extra money is available it should be to the advantage of those who are paying mortgages or those who are lending money.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this situation.</P>
    <P>Local authority houses which were planned long ago are now being finished off, and these are the houses represented in the figures the Minister has given. Does he know that he himself has given an allocation of money only once this year for houses started up to 31 March? Not only has he not given a second allocation but there is no money available from the Department to enable local authorities to start any new houses after 31 March.  Will the Minister deny this before he leaves the House?  Will he say whether or not there is money for the erection of local authority houses started after 31 March?  My information is that there is no such money and that there will be a dramatic drop in the number of local authority houses being built.</P>
    <P>When the Minister took office he admitted in a document published shortly afterwards that in June 1977, 70 per cent of families looking for local authority houses consisted of a man, his wife and one child.  Would the Minister care to hazard a guess as to what percentage of those on the housing list is represented by families of that size?  We again have big families on the housing list who have as many as five or seven children.  I received a letter from a man this morning <Col N="2202" /> stating that he is living in a rented house and paying £10 a week.  He acquired a site and offered it to the county council who told him they were building only three houses this year and had already started them and that, therefore he had not a hope in the world of getting one.  Is that not a lovely spectacle for a man with a family?  I know a man who has five children and who is living in a caravan.  He has a site but the local authority cannot build a house there because they have no money.  The Minister does not seem to be <i>au fait</i> with the situation and he should own up to that before he comes into the House to tell us the facts as he sees them.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister know that local authorities have money only to carry out essential repairs to less than half a dozen local authority houses for the purpose of selling them during the year?  Does he know that each local authority has a list as long as my arm of people who want to buy houses but cannot do so because of this?  It is all right to say that they will be able to buy them at the price which was operative when they first applied for them.  There is nothing about the rents they will have to pay in the meantime for months and perhaps years.  It is a bit much to ask a man to pay a rent of £11 a week for years when if he could buy a house he would be paying that off the price of it.  Instead of that he is putting it down the drain.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced a new rent scheme this year and said that he had prior consultations with the National Association of Tenants Organisations.  I should like to put on the record of the House that there were no negotiations carried on as such with NATO.  What happened was that the Minister read a long speech to them in the Custom House.  He refused to give them a copy of the speech subsequently.  One of his officials handed across a list of the new increases and said that they were not negotiable.  If that is the Minister's idea of carrying out negotiations with a representative group he should have another look at it because he does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    <Col N="2203" />
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no negotiations on the proposals which the Minister put up.  I am glad the Minister of State. Deputy Connolly, is here because during the week he referred in the newspaper to this kind of thing and said that statements made by an organisation, which in the past had not been found to be so reliable, were not correct.  When I took over that office there was a two and a half year rent strike going on because the former Minister for Local Government had been carrying on the same antics. I settled that strike and a guarantee was given by the then Minister for Defence on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party before the 1977 general election that if they were returned to office they would continue to negotiate on the same terms as had been agreed with me.  Now that has been thrown overboard and the Minister has the hard neck to say he carried out negotiations when none were carried out.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think NATO would agree with a case I came across in Ballivor, County Meath, of a deserted wife with eight children, the eldest 12 years of age and the youngest three years of age, paying 93p a week?  She was drawing social welfare benefit of £60 a week.  She got a bill from the local authority for the new rent rate of £6.53.  When she queried it she was told this was the arrangement set down by the Department of the Environment and that there was nothing that could be done about it.  Is it not a fact that the poorest of the poor in such houses have been asked to pay rents they cannot afford?  The only way they can afford them is by going hungry or allowing their families to go hungry. This is the caring Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was looking at the manifesto and what it said about rents.  It appears as if when Fianna Fáil were writing the manifesto they had their tongues in their cheeks and thought it was something that would go down well.  They thought the people would swallow it hook, line and sinker and as a result vote for them. There is no way if Fianna Fáil knew the <Col N="2204" /> facts that they could have written what they did about rents in black and white in the manifesto and then make people pay the rents they are asking now.</P>
    <P>I know it is popular for Ministers and Fianna Fáil backbenchers to talk about new wage agreements and what is happening about unemployment.  We know, according to the Fianna Fáil bible, the manifesto, that they were going to wipe out unemployment overnight.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, said there would be no dole queues.  I do not know whether he knew what he was talking about or not.  I believe he did not know because if he did he would not have spoken like that.  He said there would be no dole queues and that they would find work for everyone, particularly school leavers.  They would have to be looked after because they were our future.  Of course they are but they do not have much chance of a future from the present Government. Having got the votes to put them back into office they conveniently forgot all about school leavers.  A number of them have been employed on AnCO training schemes.  They build something which is required and are paid about £20 a week. Most of them are glorified labourers but they are told they are being trained to be plasterers, bricklayers, painters and so on.  It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education spoke about £5 million which would be given out but nobody was told it would be matched pound for pound with what local people put up.  If a local organisation cannot pay up the money they will receive none of the £5 million.  We heard of cases where organisations were told they would get grants of £70,000 if they could put up £70,000.  How can such money be found?  Why not tell the truth and say one will get the necessary money if one is able to raise the same amount and give people time to do so?</P>
    <P>The situation under the present Government appears to be one of making lots of rash promises and suddenly finding there is no way they can be carried out.  In order to get out of them they try to colour the situation by pretending <Col N="2205" /> things are what they are not.  We heard a lot about what working people would get back under PAYE.  We were told the budget would make a lot of people very happy.  I wonder if it has.  Most of us dealing with working class people know that very few of them are getting anything out of the budget.  Not only that but because of the changes which were alleged to have been made and the understaffing in the income tax office I have received many complaints from constituents.</P>
    <P>I received a letter this morning from a married man who has five children and works with Bord na Móna at Ballivor. That man told me that he has sent two income tax forms to Dublin seeking his tax free allowances from April 1980 but had not heard anything since.  He expressed the view that £42 per week was not much good, after tax, to him and his family.  His income is £70.22 per week but, because he does not have his tax free allowance he is getting £40 per week to feed his wife and five children.  That is Ireland under Fianna Fáil and it is the same situation that exists under the social welfare scheme.  How many social welfare recipients have written to Members, called to them or begged them to get something done about their social welfare benefits?  The greatest mix-up that ever occurred here was in relation to the introduction of the PRSI.  For some extraordinary reason nobody was able to ascertain whether or not cards had been stamped, and people who had been stamping cards for 20 or 30 years, and never drew any benefit, were told that their 1978 cards had not been received although they were sent in in bulk from builders, manufacturers, local authorities and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Yet, people were told that sickness benefits could not be paid, that they could not have their teeth seen to or obtain optical or maternity benefit because their cards were not in.  The cards had been sent in but somebody made an almighty mess of this with the result that benefits were not paid.</P>
    <P>Every meeting I attend people complain <Col N="2206" /> to me that they have not received their benefits.  I receive letters daily from old age pensioners complaining that they have not received their due benefit or, when they get their benefit, they are not paid the increase due to them since last April.  The only reason I think this situation exists is because the civil servants are very much over-worked.  I have sympathy with those civil servants who deal with social welfare and income tax. Those in the Department of Social Welfare must deal with up to 60,000 claims for sickness benefits weekly and more than 100,000 unemployment benefit claims.  Those officials are very pushed, but people are left for weeks and months without benefit although they have contributed to the scheme for years. That is not good enough and something must be done about it.  Of course, there is little point in asking any member of the Government to do anything about it. We will chase it ourselves and, eventually, we will get it cleared up.</P>
    <P>Since there are now 15 Ministers of State and 15 full Ministers, including the Taoiseach, there should be enough people going around to the offices to ensure that the jobs which should be done are done.  As Deputy Kelly stated, we have the extraordinary position of having 30 Ministers, an Attorney General, a Ceann Comhairle and a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, out of the Fianna Fáil Party and, although the service should be better, it is not.  People are complaining that things are getting worse.  There is little point in taking things easy.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of education.  It is difficult to try to explain to parents who have children going to school why the books they are now being asked to buy cost so much.  I met a woman today who has six children going to school and the cost of books for one of her girls was £11.50, for one of the boys £10, and so on down to the lowest which was £7.  Her husband's net take home pay is £55 to £60 per week. How can she pay money for those books?  That woman was told that the money must be sent to the schools by tomorrow or otherwise the books cannot <Col N="2207" /> be bought.  Free education, how are you! In addition, practically every school committee sends out circulars asking for subscriptions to buy what is required in the schools.  Who can resist such appeals? A primary school was supposed to have been sanctioned for Navan months ago but, at last, the sanction has just been received.  We are told it will be opening in September, but construction work will hardly have commenced by September.  What are the children in that area to do in the meantime?  In relation to St. Oliver Plunkett school in the same town it was announced that children under five should not be brought to the school although there are 70 ready to start, 79 on the waiting list for next year and 83 for the following year.  I have no doubt that that school will be looking for old pre-fabs that are not in use elsewhere to try to accommodate those children.  Is that the type of education we were promised by the Minister when in Opposition? The Minister said a lot then about reducing the sizes of classes and the necessity to have better accommodation for children.</P>
    <P>I should like to read a letter I received on behalf of Drogheda VEC which states:</P>
    <P>We wish to make representations on behalf of Drogheda VEC, Drogheda Vocational Schools' Parents Association, and Drogheda branch of the Teachers' Union.  We are protesting against the inordinate delay by the Department of Education in dealing with the following problems which have arisen mainly through the vast increase in numbers of students attending the day schools in Drogheda and the proposed opening of a community college for 900 students in September 1980.</P>
    <P>(1)  The VEC cannot accomodate all students for 1980-81 in one school.  Yet the Department have not sanctioned the proposals of the committee to retain the King Street school for day classes.  If this is not done many students will have to be turned away in September. <Col N="2208" /> (2)  The Department of Education have not sanctioned the appointment of principals for the schools.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Department have not sanctioned caretaking staff for the community college although this is liable to be handed over by the builders at any time.  Vandals could wreck this £1 million school in a couple of days.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Department have not sanctioned the committee's proposals for office staffing sent in almost 12 months ago.  Additional staff is needed for the additional work and responsibility arising from the great increase in numbers of students and activities over the period 1979, 1980, 1981 and projected for many years to come in this expanding industrial town.</P>
    <P>(5)  Additional teaching staff for the additional intake of pupils has not been sanctioned.</P>
    <P>We feel that this go slow attitude on the part of the Department sets at nought the endeavours of the committee and its staff to build and equip their very large new school, that it is irresponsible to the students and is, in fact, impeding the VEC from properly carrying out its duties as laid down in the Act of 1930.</P>
    <P>That statement is an indication of how strongly the people of that area feel.  I could go on if I had time outlining the number of schools in County Meath that require extensions and areas where new schools are required.  For some extraordinary reason the Department succeed in holding up such work by, after agreeing to one site, suggesting an alternative and going back over the ground again. When the project goes eventually to the Office of Public Works the Department sit back.  Of course, the person who can get money quickly out of the Office of Public Works would need to be a magician, and the Minister is aware of that.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is very wrong &mdash; it is possible that more than the <Col N="2209" /> Government are to blame for this&mdash;is the condition of many Garda stations.  A number of Garda stations are new and others are well looked after, but many of them are atrocious, appalling.  I have tabled a question about Drogheda garda station, which is located on the corner as one approaches the town from the Belfast road.  Those coming from the North with an inquiry call at that station. The station is filthy, dirty and with old electric wires pulled out of the walls. The accommodation is the worst I have ever seen in a public building.  It has not been painted or cleaned for God knows how long.  The two cells have dirty stinking matresses in them, and those held over from the courts are detained there. The two toilets were originally in the Garda station and have been transferred to the prison part of the station &mdash; Two holes in the ground in 1980.  In such a station gardaí and bean-gardaí are expected to operate.  Many of the offices are in the cellars with little light coming through and rubbish thrown in the corners. There are pieces of old electric fires, mattresses and broken furniture thrown around those rooms.  The day room where the general public meet the gardaí must be seen to be believed.</P>
    <P>The best thing the Minister can do is to have a look at the accommodation. There is little point in the Office of the Public Works saying that they are looking for new accommodation, because that is three or four years away.  A large number of gardaí who are operating in that station require accommodation now.  They required it two years ago. Perhaps we were as much at fault as the Government are but Fianna Fáil had a long time before that to do something about it.  But nothing has been done about it.  Linoleum on the floor is creased up, covering bits of the floor and not covering other parts; there is no paint and the windows are dirty.  I do not know how any official Garda station can be operated in those conditions.  The sooner the Government realise that there are more important things than buying <Col N="2210" /> an executive jet to fly people to and from Brussels the better.  They should be spending that money on things the country really needs.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the House, a crack was made by a Fianna Fáil backbencher who obviously has not been reading the signs. He does not realise that since the Taoiseach has already scraped the barrel he is hardly likely to go down to him to make a Minister of State of him.  Obviously he came in in an effort to show that he was still there.  He said that the Labour Party had no policy except on divorce.  Labour have a motion before this House that there should be an all-party committee set up for the purpose of considering what can be done about divorce, if anything can be done. Anybody standing up in the House and starting to talk or proposing a motion &mdash; or any of the parties on their own attempting to do it &mdash; is simply looking for publicity.  What we want is what the Taoiseach himself suggested very recently, an all-party committee to deal with this matter.  There is no other proposal from the Labour Party before this House, nor is there likely to be.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that those who are looking for something to criticise might go a bit further than that because the 1967 committee on the Constitution, of which I had the honour to be a member, made a recommendation that in certain circumstances divorce might be considered. I understood from Mr. Lemass, who had just retired as Taoiseach, that agreement had been reached between himself and some of the Hierarchy that it was necessary because there are a big number of people who have got Church annulments, who are not married ac cording to the Church but who are according to the State and they are left, like Mahommed's coffin, between heaven and earth and they can do neither one thing nor the other.  They are entitled to have their situation looked into and there are many other cases which need attention.</P>
    <P>There are many people not of the majority faith who have no objection at all to divorce if it is necessary.  I do not <Col N="2211" /> believe we should have the kind of free for all divorce that exists in other countries.  But it is a matter that we cannot hide away from.  It has to be discussed. The floor of this House is the place to discuss it; an all-party committee should be set up and if we do not want it so be it, and if we do want it the Constitution must be amended or a new Constitution introduced.  I do not want to have anybody saying that we want to introduce divorce on our own.  Even if we did it would not be possible but we do not want to do so anyway.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in opposition they said that they would do great things for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  They were going to completely revamp labour relations to prevent the trouble that they felt might be caused.  There were no strikes in the Post Office for many years except one by the engineering staff.  Fianna Fáil were not rightly in office when there was a strike and there has been one strike after another since.  They promised to update the telephone service but if the telephone service could be worse I would not like to see it.  Up in the office that I occupy there is one telephone for internal calls and one for outside calls.  Yesterday I dialled 20 times before I got through on a call and when I did there were two other people talking on the line.  This is happening in 1980.</P>
    <P>My time is up on this item and I will not detain the House any longer except to say that Fianna Fáil TDs, and particularly Ministers, might do some reading during the summer Recess and they might learn something.  I was in this House for over 20 years before I became a Minister and I had my own views on how Governments should be run.  After four-and-a-half years in the Department I realised that there were two sides to the story and now I can see things in a very different way.  I would suggest that if Fianna Fáil Ministers in particular would read the election manifesto of 1977 over the summer Recess, they might come back here, call the Taoiseach up to his office and tell him to, for God's sake, offer his resignation <Col N="2212" /> to the President because Fianna Fáil are either the greatest crowd of charlatans this country ever saw or they have been conned into producing something which has really got them into trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly):</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks about housing. The Minister has already referred to the level of housing completions.  Last year we completed almost 26,400 houses. Our commitment in this line still continues. When we took office the SDA loans were only £4,500 and the income limit was only £2,150 for a single person and, for a married person with a family the maximum was £2,350.  When I was appointed last December I asked the Minister to have this increased.  I am glad to say that the SDA loan on new houses is now £12,000 and the income limit is £5,500.  Some here in the House have said that the £12,000 SDA loan is not enough.</P>
      <P>My information from the local authorities throughout the country is that there is a very heavy demand on this new house loan and it shows that it was a step in the right direction.  The same applies also to the reconstruction loan.  It was increased to £4,000 and the income limit has been increased also.  I have not heard any criticism from anybody about this.  The Opposition have not said what they would do about the economy, about finance, about inflation. They have a duty to do that.  Opposition Deputies cannot come into this House and criticise what we are doing without making suggestions.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Tully.  I never got into any hassle with him and I do not intend to.  Deputy Tully referred earlier to the telephones. When the Coalition were in office the Minister of the time was preoccupied with other matters and of course he had no time to look after any of that.  We had to take over and try to rectify the position which was left by the Minister of the time who chose to go to a foreign land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2213" /> Industrial relations were also at that time in a mess and things suddenly came to the boil.  We had to take over from there and we have a programme in that respect.  The Minister for Communications has been dealing with that aspect in great detail since taking up office and his predecessor did, also.  It is all right for the Opposition to come in and complain about what we have done.  All the Opposition Members &mdash; I am not referring to any one individual&mdash;en bloc have failed to produce proposals.  The people will want to know what they intend doing and will expect to be told.  Nothing has been produced so far in the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully commented on the manifesto.  Nearly all of what was stated in the manifesto has been implemented with regard to income tax, housing.</P>

      <P>They do.  The matter of differential rents was raised on a number of occasions.  In March last, details of changes in the national rents scheme for local authority dwellings were circulated to local authorities.  The changes provide for a revised formula for fixing maximum rents of new and existing dwellings which will result in a more equitable spread of maximum rents over all rented dwellings.  Minimum differential rents have been increased from 10p to 15p per week and fixed rents by 30p a week. Subsidiary earners in differentially rented houses will continue to contribute one-seventh of any income over £14 a week, up to a maximum contribution of £1.50p a week.  The income to be assessed for differential rent is the income from any sources including social welfare payments allowances for shift working, children's allowances, disabled persons' allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2214" /> Considerable play has recently been made on the increases from 50 per cent to 100 per cent in assessment of social welfare payments.  This change was made to eliminate the anomalous situation under earlier differential rent schemes where some social welfare payments were assessed at 50 per cent and others at 100 per cent.  To compensate for the effect of any rent increases which arise from the assessment in full of income, particularly in the lower income groups, I have made substantial increases in the present assessable income to which rent fractions apply.  The lowest fraction of income hitherto assessed for rent purposes was one-twelfth of income up to £19 a week.  Under the 1980 scheme, incomes up to £36 a week will be assessed at only one-twentieth and the upper limit of one-seventh will apply only where assessable income exceeds £55 per week.  The new scheme is designed to ensure that tenants who can afford to do so will pay their fair share of rent.  I am satisfied that it provides that no tenant will be required to pay a rent which he cannot reasonably afford. I want to elaborate a little on that.</P>

      <P>If there is a case of hardship and it is brought to my notice, I will look into it, and the local authorities still have the power to do that.  I want to make this quite clear &mdash; the average rent per week on all local authority rented houses in the country is £3.50 a week.</P>

      <P>I have never interrupted anyone and I do not intend to.  I want to give the facts and if Deputy Tully, or anybody else, does not want to listen to the facts, that is all right.  These <Col N="2215" /> are the facts of the situation.  Where there is hardship, it is open to the local authorities to investigate the case and the managers that I know of the local authorities throughout the country in my opinion are all fair-minded men.  Let us have a look at the average cost, all over the country.  It is costing only £3.50 a week, on average.  We must get the record right.  There has been I admit a lot of talk in regard to rents and in regard to the new scheme.  I am putting the facts here as they are and as they were given to local authorities.</P>
      <P>In relation to private housing, Deputies are no doubt aware that my Department administers a scheme for house price control in relation to new houses.  In August last year the Government decided that all the main lending agencies should require loan applicants to furnish a certificate of reasonable value where a dwelling was being purchased.  As a consequence of that, there has been a substantial increase in the number of CRV applications and we have been able to maintain a satisfactory service.  Decisions are normally issued within three weeks of the receipt of the necessary information.  The fact that average new house prices stabilised in the second half of last year reflects the success of the Government action.  In the first five months of this year price reductions as a result of CRV applications resulted in a saving of £1.27 million. That is to be highly commended.  The six year structural guarantee scheme operated by the house building guarantee company with the co-operation of my Department registered in the first two years of operation 913 building firms and 13,600 houses have been protected.  The fee charged by the Department for providing three inspections under the guarantee scheme has been revised to take account of the increased cost of the service, and it now stands at £20 a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to local authority housing I am reasonably satisfied that we will be able to maintain progress, and I am satisfied with the improvements in relation to house loans brought about by increased <Col N="2216" /> income limits.  The improvements in this area are most attractive.</P>
    <P>In relation to house improvement grants, Deputies know that with a few exceptions they were terminated early this year.  We have 60,000 applications on hands and there must be at least one inspection in each case so the House will appreciate that it is impossible to arrange an inspection and pay the grant immediately the work is finished however much one would like to do so. However, I am doing everything in my power to ensure that delays are kept to a minimum.  The fact that in the first five months of this year 16,000 house improvement grants were paid reflects the urgency with which the Department are treating this matter.  I have no doubt that some Deputies are frustrated, but I am doing my best to accommodate all Members of the House who approach me with the problems of constituents.  I will always continue to be fair.  Extra accommodation has been provided in O'Connell Bridge House along with extra staff to deal with the problem and inspections are now running at around 2,000 a week.  I am also employing extra inspectors to speed up the process, and any improvements that can be implemented will be implemented.</P>
    <P>A question was asked earlier as to whether I had given any direction that all correspondence in relation to grant applications should come through my office.  I gave no such direction either in writing or verbally.  Anyone who wishes to contact a member of the Oireachtas or any official in my Department is free to do so.  I expect help and to be told what the position is.  I have been informed recently that things have improved a lot.  I hope to be able to make still more improvements.  I am not happy with some aspects, but we are working on them and the House can rest assured that anything that can be done will be done.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Minister, the Government and myself I thank the staff in my Department, especially in the housing grants section, for the manner in which they have dealt with the people and the <Col N="2217" /> Members of the Oireachtas over the long months.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening Deputy Willie O'Brien said that the position in O'Connell Bridge House was so bad that he could not get up the stairs.  I have been there every day and have never seen that.  When the grants were terminated there was a big number of people there for a week but from then on there have been no queues.  It has been a very orderly process, I am glad to say, and I am grateful for the forbearance of the public.</P>
      <P>I should like to have more money to undertake more projects that I have in mind in my Department, but anybody who was in Government knows there is a limit to the money available as there has always been.  We must make the best possible use of the money at our disposal. In saying this I am not alluding to any particular local authority, but I should like to put this question to county councils and corporations: are we getting value for our money in respect of hire of machinery for road work and other works?  In part of the country I pass through I see machinery lying idle perhaps for an hour or two.  These machines cost local authorities a lot of money and in the end it is the taxpayer who must pay.  I would like to suggest &mdash; and it would not mean any loss of employment &mdash; that some of this work might be put out for tender and we might get better value.  I have no firm views on the matter, but it is worth examining, because I am not satisfied that in hiring machinery we are getting value for money.  Local authorities should look into this question.</P>

Some people maintain that if some of the major works were done by contract we might get better value without any loss of employment, and this should be examined.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for replying to Deputies.  That is now happening and is welcomed.  It is not often we get that kind of response from a Minister or Minister of State.  There is just one point &mdash; the Minister probably hands it over to the Department at that stage and the follow-up does not seem to be as good as the initial reply.  Perhaps this is something he could check.  It is a service we got in Government but we are not getting it in Opposition.  If we decide to follow a political line we are committed to it.  If we go to a Department, we follow a departmental approach.  Some of us, for reasons best known to ourselves, decide to make a political approach and that approach should then follow through to the end.</P>

      <P>As regards rents of local authority houses I raised a matter with the Minister by way of Dáil Question.  I happened to be abroad at the time it came up in the House.  Members of the Defence Forces, of the Naval Service and the Army do not get overtime; they get allowances.  These allowances are added up when it comes to determining their weekly rent.  If they worked in industry only their basic pay would be considered, without overtime.  They are being discriminated against in the assessment of rents.  Those allowances should be excluded and only basic pay should <Col N="2219" /> be taken into account in fixing their rents.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that we are doing enough in regard to local authority housing. In our area where there is massive growth as a result of an industrial explosion so to speak this is a matter that should be examined urgently.  It may not always be a question of money.  The situation in the south Cork area is so serious at present that we should think in terms of system built houses.  The delay is so long in dealing with builders and the whole set up so cumbersome that we must think about system built houses or otherwise we shall become an area of caravans.  Nobody wants that to happen.</P>
      <P>Our roads are in a bad state.  As one who knows something about maintaining farm roads I am concerned lest we allow them to deteriorate too far.  The patchwork being done at present is not good enough.  Unless something is done quickly we shall face a major roads problem.  Much the same argument applies to the whole Government approach to transport.  Despite the fact that our roads are being allowed to deteriorate and that there are more and more heavy vehicles appearing on these roads, railways are being closed down.  This is something that cannot be tolerated now. We made mistakes in the past and some railways were torn up.  We can now see what a mistake that was.</P>
      <P>The Cork-Youghal line has proved a very important link in the past for sugar beet and summer travel.  I appeal to the Government to ensure that that line is maintained and that the trains continue to run.  A year or two ago it might not have been such a good proposition to transport goods by rail because road transport was freely available and accessible, but I can see a time not so far distant when sugar beet growing in the east Cork area might be just viable by having a good rail link to Mallow or wherever the processing station is.  The same applies to fertilisers and all agricultural inputs.  Without that link a very vital supply line for farmers could be cut off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the Minister's new idea <Col N="2220" /> of a cheaper loan with overseas borrowing. I would like to be a little more reassured about how cheap that will be in the end because a deutschmark at 10 per cent could very well end up as a deutschmark at 20 per cent.  I hope we know where we are going with regard to this borrowing.  This loan is supposed to go for future development.  I am more concerned about those people who have already developed and have spent substantial sums of money in doing this. Any money we can lay our hands on should go towards helping those people. They are mostly farmers who are on the way up.  They are progressive people and they have spent a lot of money.  At the time they decided to spend it they did not bargain for the inflation situation.  They could not have bargained for 20 per cent interest rates.  They must be helped now. There is no use talking about confidence in agriculture, because there can be no confidence in it until the Government make a positive move to help those people.</P>
    <P>Those people are the leaders of the future.  Some of them may have been a bit too courageous and may have overspent, but a man who is not courageous in agriculture or anything else will not achieve anything.  They could not have foreseen the disastrous situation we are facing this year.  Everything possible will have to be done to help those people. The only way to help them now is that the ACC and the commercial banks should be given money to subsidise loans to those people.  That is not a unique concept as is has been done on the continent. We are already doing this in the Department of the Environment, where certain categories of people qualify for local authority loans at preferential rates.  The same thing should be done in regard to agriculture.  This is not money down the drain.  The spin-off will come in confidence, the continued progress of the agricultural sector, and it will take the gloom and eventually the doom out of the air.</P>
    <P>We are talking pure rot about land at the moment.  We are waiting for a new land structure but in the meantime <Col N="2221" /> nothing is being done in that Department. There were 40 acres of land in my area put on the market by a multinational oil company, Irish Refining and the Land Commission had not the price of the 40 acres.  There are young farmers looking for this land.  Nobody from the benches on the other side can deny that the Land Commission had not the money to buy that land.  We are not buying land.  I hope that realism will come into this matter.  We are not talking about hard cash in relation to this.  Even though I do not like land bonds why can they not be used in the case I am referring to and in many other cases to buy land?  If people were given this land they could be made viable and we would prove that there is a future for agriculture, that we are not at a standstill and that the Department of Agriculture have confidence in their industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement about the removal of the resource tax. Farmers already have about five different taxes, such as the co-responsibility levy.  There is no credit due to the Government for removing this tax because it was a penal tax and should never have been introduced.  The Taoiseach should tell the Minister for Finance that this tax is being removed. The Minister defended this tax in the Seanad the other day.  All the Fianna Fáil Senators voted for it.  I hope there is some communication between the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance in relation to this matter and that they will both say that this tax is really going.</P>
    <P>The whole trend of the Taoiseach's statement was on a European inflationary situation and a difficult European situation.  There is no such thing as a difficult European situation.  The European farmers are doing extremely well, because most of them are dealing with single figure inflation, bank rates of 8 per cent and 9 per cent, growth rates of 5 per cent and 6 per cent, and they are very happy with the package offered by Brussels this year.  What about the Irish farmer and the Irish industrialist?  He is <Col N="2222" /> talking about 20 per cent inflation, 20 per cent bank rates and less than zero growth rates.  The Irish farmer is expected to compete with the European mainland against those conditions.  If the Government are serious about doing anything for the people the inflation rate will have to be reduced.  It will have to come back to single figures.  Our bank rates will have to come down and money will have to be put into growth areas.  We cannot bury the púnt in the ground so that nobody can touch it.  Money will have to be released to the people who know how to use it, at the right rates.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister for the Environment refer to pollution.  Pollution and pollution control will cost money in the future.  Our inland fisheries and estuary fisheries will be determined by pollution control.  The local authorities are the worst polluters of all.  They have now decided to put raw effluent into Cork harbour.  It is all very well to have done that in 1014, when people did not know anything better and when there was not the same problem.  It is only since chemistry and industrial development took over that we have problems in our estuaries.  Human effluent is bad enough but it is not as bad as chemicals and the various biological treatments which are killing our fish.  The Minister should take this statement and his document, recently produced, to its logical conclusion and direct all local authorities, before our fishing industry is wiped out, to treat all urban, municipal and industrial effluent.</P>
    <P>Industry is going through a bad period at the moment.  I appeal to the Government to look at places like Youghal and the textile industry.  This industry can be saved.  In a couple of years' time there will be a swing round again and we will not have those industries.  While the buildings will be there we will not have the skills going back for one hundred years.  We are telling those people now that they will get their redundancy pay, their pay related and we will bring in a new industry.  A new industry is badly needed in the Youghal area.  I welcome the efforts of the IDA to bring in new industry <Col N="2223" /> but I would like to see more effort being put into keeping the industries we already have.  We are doing nothing to rescue industries which are going through a bad time.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the industry in Cobh, the Verolme dockyard, which has such a large employment content. What is the reason for all the shilly-shallying about the two naval vessels? Why are they not on the stocks?  When the people opposite were on this side of the House they succeeded in bringing the whole work-force concerned on to the streets of Cork city.  The Minister for Labour should impress on his colleagues the urgent need for putting those ships on the stocks.  This would convince the work force that the Government are interested and that the ships will be built. We are waiting also for a B &amp; I boat and for an ICL vessel.  In this regard there have been many promises but not any action.</P>
    <P>There is chaos, too, in the fishing industry. I have no desire to talk about the manifesto, but there was much emphasis in that document on a 50-mile limit. Would the Government reiterate that such a limit is needed badly in the light of such factors as the size of overseas vessels, the types of nets involved and because of the numerical strength of these vessels?  A 50-mile limit is imperative if we are to save our fisheries. We are not being either parochial or insular in this instance.  We are talking about saving an industry that has supplied herrings to the fishermen of Europe in the past.  We have the breeding grounds for the herring, and if we are not to be allowed protect those breeding grounds nobody else will do the work for us.  These other peoples are totally ruthless and irresponsible.  The only way we can cope with the situation is by pushing them outside a 50-mile limit. Our fishermen would not have any effect on these stocks if they were to fish them up to the year 3000.  Apart from our not having the vessels, we have not the will. We were always a cautious and responsible people.</P>
    <P>When we talk about fisheries we are <Col N="2224" /> including the salmon fishermen, to whom all sorts of promises were made in 1977.  I appeal to the Government to allow the salmon fishermen a full season and to give them some latitude with regard to nets, to allow them the 45 mesh net.  If we do this we will find that we will have their co-operation.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that is regrettable is that our fishermen are in conflict with the Navy.  That situation could be resolved by allowing the salmon fishermen a full season and by giving them some latitude in regard to nets.  If we do this we can rest assured that the Blackwater as well as the other rivers will be stocked with salmon.</P>
    <P>My main responsibility is in the area of tourism.  We should be doing everything possible to help this very valuable industry.  It is an industry that has grown from a second-rate and neglected source of revenue to an industry in its own right involving revenue in the region of £400 million.  It is an industry that is 99 per cent Irish owned and controlled but it is beset by many problems.  These include very high inflation rates, the Northern Ireland troubles and the high costs that prevail here.  In addition, the industry is confronted with a new problem, that is, strong overseas competition.  I have not been a prophet of doom so far as this industry is concerned but the forecasts are not good.  There are many cancellations with the consequent empty hotel rooms.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Bord Fáilte for fighting so hard not only this year but last year also.  They realise that their accountability is to the nation, that their shareholders are the taxpayers of Ireland and they are endeavouring to do the best job possible.  However, if we could recognise the problems in regard to tourism we would have won half the battle.  In the past we had few problems so far as this industry was concerned. We were known as Ireland of the welcomes, a country made up of friendly people, but while some of us at any rate may still be friendly, our country is not any longer considered to be the place to come to for holidays because word has <Col N="2225" /> got around about the high cost of such items as petrol, cigarettes and drink here.</P>
    <P>Another factor that is militating against us is the savage competition among the various countries for tourists. Countries which up to now have not been involved in the tourist sphere, for example, Yugoslavia and Greece and even the United States, are competing very hard for tourists.  The US are launching a massive campaign that might be regarded as being less than fair. For instance, there are advertisements for two weeks holidays in Miami for £300 but when people go there they find that the two weeks are spent in sizzling temperatures, an aspect that is not referred to in the advertisements.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate is higher than is the corresponding rate in any of the other countries with whom we are competing for tourists.  The Government's fiscal policy and their budgetary decisions are a direct blow to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, there is the all-embracing factor of transport, both access transport and transport within the country.  In the area of access transport the various bodies involved, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus, CIE and the B &amp; I face a dilemma.  The carriers are obliged to pay their way and, consequently, they give priority to commercial rather than to tourist interests.  Carriers are inclined to rationalise at times of recession but this is a time when they should co-operate with Bord Fáilte in order to help the board.  At the end of the day the carriers would be the beneficiaries.  At this time, too, there is need for much courage on the part of the carriers.  We are asking that the Government underwrite the carriers' risk.  That is a fairly minimal requirement, but it is one that must be implemented.</P>
    <P>There is a clear-cut case for the Government to offer petrol subsidies to tourists.  It has been pointed out to me that overseas visitors rightly resent paying this penal tax to another State.  Car hire firms are at a serious disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their UK and USA counterparts <Col N="2226" /> because car hire is 50 per cent more expensive here than in those other countries. This is due to the high cost of motoring here which results from the savage import tax on cars as well as to the 15 per cent VAT on car hire turnover. Obviously, the removal of that 15 per cent would help the car hire firms to a large extent.</P>
    <P>All the factors I have mentioned add up to more costly holidays for those who decide to come here.  If the hotel and guest house industry is to survive and prosper the Government must begin treating it as an industry and not merely as a reliable source of revenue.  In order to encourage hoteliers to improve their standards finance must be made available to them from the ICC at preferential rates of 12 per cent as is the case in respect of industry and of a 10 per cent top rate of profit tax.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism talked about cheap money for industry.  This money has been there all the time, and it is to be welcomed, but in this context the Minister stopped short of tourism.  He should go further and extend this facility to hotels and guesthouse owners for development work.  Such development is necessary in the interest of encouraging tourists to come here.  Because so many tourists nowadays do not wish to become involved in the high cost activity of travelling around the country once they have reached here, every effort should be made to help hoteliers and guesthouse owners to provide such facilities as tennis courts and so on.  But some action in this regard should be taken now.  There will not be any point in talking about the industry when the House resumes in the autumn.  By then the 1980 tourist season will be history. Now is the time to make cheap money available for the development of the sort of facilities I am talking of.</P>
    <P>Other action that the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, should take now is to remove VAT from food consumed in hotels and to remove the VAT that applies to farm <Col N="2227" /> guesthouses the owners of which are operating on very low margins.  Then hoteliers would see that the Government were serious about helping them and they would be able to hold their prices. There is no doubt we are pricing ourselves out of the game.  Many hoteliers are trying to exist on bank loans at high interest rates and they are unable to pay back their loans.</P>
    <P>When talking about pollution I said that an important factor is the general appearance of the place, and we have been falling down badly.  Our roads are a disgrace.  The potholes have begun to make an appearance even in the streets of our towns and cities and it is not unusual now to find trenches all over the place.  Our roads must be put in order and our hedgerows will have to be trimmed. In the Cork City Hall we have the audacity to put up a notice warning people about the penalties for not getting rid of noxious weeds but anyone driving along our hedgerows will see buachallans, docks, thistles and all other sort of weeds flourishing and the first south western wind that comes along takes the seeds away all over the countryside.</P>
    <P>In the interests of tourism we must let visitors see that the country is still inhabited, that we have not deserted it.  We must improve our roads, trim our hedges, clean up our beaches and provide picnic areas with proper facilities.</P>
    <P>It has been forecast that tourism will be the world's greatest industry by the year 2000 and therefore the long-term future of the industry here should be a matter of prime concern for all involved. VAT should be removed from all hotel meals.  At present it adds 10 per cent to hotel meals.  VAT should be removed completely from the farm guesthouse operation.  It should be removed from car hire turnover on which it is now standing at 15 per cent.  Loans at preferential rates should be offered to all hotels and guesthouses, a rate similar to the ICC rate for industry &mdash; 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Tourism merits a special Ministry, not just tagged on as an afterthought to any <Col N="2228" /> old Department.  It received only scant attention when the Minister was presenting his Estimate last week.  A full Department of Tourism would mean proper financing for the industry and a recognition of its importance.</P>
    <P>Every section of the industry and everything relating to the industry must receive detailed attention.  Applications for grants and loans must be dealt with promptly.  Finance must be made available to encourage young farmers and house owners to provide tourist accommodation of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>I now call for a nationwide clean-up of the countryside.  With regard to this we must surely be the dirtiest nation in Europe.  Everywhere you look you see the results of the litter louts.  Even local authority dumps leave a lot to be desired.  Our rivers and streams must be cleaned up not merely of visible debris but pollution-free as well.  Our beautiful lakes and estuaries merit special attention. Here I must make an urgent appeal to save our harbours.  Where in the world will you find a more beautiful amenity than Cork Harbour, a source of joy not merely for overseas tourists but for the many thousands who live in the area? We must oppose with vigour the reckless proposals by the Cork County Council to dump raw sewage into the most beautiful area of East Ferry.  A &ldquo;Save the Cork Harbour Campaign&rdquo; must be initiated and supported by everybody in the harbour area.</P>
    <P>In any future engineering programme involving sewage the terms of reference must be clearly stated to the engineers concerned: all municipal effluent and industrial effluent must be treated.  Our tourists coming to the coast for recreation will demand clean estuaries, high environmental qualities on beaches, dunes and coastal waters.</P>
    <P>With regard to our roads we have reached a crisis situation, with potholes spreading like a disease, infecting city streets and quiet country roads.  Public transport is grinding to a halt in Dublin and Cork.  In other parts of the country it is practically non-existent.  A road <Col N="2229" /> closure in one street can halt the traffic in the entire city.  We have never had a properly integrated transportation policy.  Nationally, the road improvement programme is carried out, where at all, on a hit and miss basis.  Any future transportation policy must take into account the role of public transport within our cities and between them, otherwise we will have continuing chaos and a declining environment.</P>
    <P>Our major tourist attractions are our castles, churches, round towers, fine old buildings, dolmens and other ancient ruins.  What would the Americans not give for a Wood Quay or Cloyne Cathedral with its round tower, when their own history starts out with skyscrapers and suspension bridges. Many of these historic buildings are now in danger.  They are urgently in need of being restored and in many cases made safe.  This would be money well spent. These buildings indicate an ancient culture unequalled anywhere in the world.  Ireland was really once an island of saints and scholars and we have the proof in stone and scroll.</P>
    <P>If tourism is to flourish in the future we must endeavour to end once and for all industrial unrest.  We as a nation cannot afford it.  We have a clear example in the UK of the results of industrial chaos. Tourism is a major industry with a huge employment content.  This figure could be doubled with effort, given good will all round.  The Government must work towards full industrial peace.  Bord Fáilte have certainly done their job in promoting &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes, a happy friendly people&rdquo;.  Let us all endeavour to do justice to this reputation.</P>
    <P>As a Christian people violence should have no place here.  The Mountbatten murders and other atrocities have done untold damage to our tourist industry and to our image abroad.</P>
    <P>Credit is due to our many towns who sponsor festivals each year.  In Cobh we have our international Folk Dance Festival which is responsible for bringing many overseas groups of dancers each <Col N="2230" /> year and thousands of tourists to the town.  Every help must be given to the promoters of these events who rely largely on voluntary subscriptions.  Substantial grants must be made available.  At present they qualify for little or no aid.</P>
    <P>Because of a worsening energy situation the likelihood of a changing pattern of tourism is inevitable.  In future our visitors will be inclined to settle in at one venue for a few weeks and hence we will have a demand for a wide range of amenities to keep them happy.  As I have already stated, no one hotel or guesthouse has sufficient finance for this work, hence the necessity for proper amenities expecially at our tourist resorts.  Many of the tourists I have met indicated our lack of boating facilities expecially on our seaboard.  There is a demand for proper slipways and boat rental facilities at all our resorts, especially popular among European visitors.  Sailing is now a major Eurosport and we must cater for it.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with some of the problems as I gleaned them from people involved in the industry and from tourists.  I welcome all suggestions for the betterment of tourism and in my capacity as Fine Gael spokesman will forward its cause to the best of my ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>We in this country in common with the other western parliamentary democracies have been overtaken by economic events in a way that was completely unforeseeable a few years ago. We now face the resulting crisis and have not a choice but to face it in the same manner as our fellow states in the western world.  We must exercise restraint, there must be moderation in demands throughout the whole spectrum of economic activity in regard to wages, salaries, profits, rents.  Metaphorically we have to tighten our belts as a nation. It is not just the Irish nation that must do so.  The strong industrialised nations of the world are engaged in a similar exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seven strongest met in Venice last <Col N="2231" /> week, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Canada and the US.  It is quite clear from the statements issued by them following that meeting that we are in for a very difficult economic situation.  Briefly there is a background to this which is raising a mammoth problem for the world as a whole, not just the western democracies but for the developing world which is struggling to make its way.  In the past year alone there has been an increase of 135 per cent in oil prices.  This resulted in an income loss by OECD countries &mdash; western countries and North American countries&mdash;of about 150 billion US dollars, or 2 per cent of the GNP of the OECD as a whole.  Those 150 billion dollars have been transferred from the OECD world, or the developed world, to the OPEC countries specifically and have not been fully recycled into the mainstream of financial institutions throughout the world that cater for development and expansion particularly in the Third World.</P>
    <P>The real sufferers of this are not so much the nations in the developed world but rather those nations in the developing world, the nations in the Third World, that do not have oil or other energy resources.  These are the new deprived in this situation.  Of course the increase in oil costs has also limited the capacity of the developed world to transfer resources to the undeveloped, Third World, that does not have oil or other energy resources.  This comes at a time after a very enlightened report on the whole North/South problem issued by a Commission under the chairmanship of Will Brandt, in which he emphasised and underlined the urgent necessity of removing the growing disparities between the developed and the developing world.  Just when this report, with its very thorough analysis is presented and the apparent situation that it can be met only by a massive transfer of funds from the developed to the developing world, the developed world itself is hit by countries in the developing world who have oil resources and who have decided to hike the prices to the extent I have mentioned, when the main <Col N="2232" /> sufferers are their own friends and neighbours in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately that is the realistic situation in which the world finds itself at present, in which we must play our part within our nation to grapple with the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder will we sell our oil at cut prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that we have got to find from our own resources the wherewithal to pay for the oil we need for our essential requirements. That is the situation in a nutshell. If we decide to compensate ourselves by wage, profit and rent increases, to compensate ourselves for increased oil prices, then we are really on a mad gallop towards hyper-inflation in a very serious manner.  This applies when one considers that the wealthy or industrialised nations, such as Germany, the USA and the Netherlands, are in the course of concluding wage agreements with their trade unions that discount oil price increases.  When the most advanced industrialised countries in the world are adopting that sort of attitude in a spirit of co-operation between the social partners and the governments of those countries then surely it would be suicidal for us, as one of the weaker economies in the developed world, to follow a course that would widen still further the gap between the better-off countries and ourselves within the developed world.  It is quite clear that we must face up to this fundamental situation obtaining at present: that if there are to be wage and salary increases, increases across the board in the other areas I have mentioned, and price increases, all increases must not take into account oil increases. Otherwise we would be into a situation in which we take on a recipe for disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach pointed out yesterday the fundamental truth linked with what I am talking about, that is, that we are an open trading economy.  In percentage terms we do a higher proportion of trading than any other country within the Community in relation to our GNP. <Col N="2233" /> In that situation we cannot in any way provoke cost increases that interfere with our export competitiveness.  Of course within a democracy this calls for considerable, concerted and co-operative effort from all sectors of the community, and that includes the Opposition parties in this matter as well, who should address themselves to the serious problems affecting our economy rather than engaging in some of the verbosity we have witnessed here over the past two days.  At a time when the world economy is in recession it is unavoidable that we in Ireland cannot escape these effects. We can of course minimise their effects but we cannot escape them.  The challenge with us is to minimise the effects. It lies within our own resources and competence to do so by having a rational and controlled attitude in regard to spending and in regard to increases at every level in coming months.  We just cannot maintain a satisfactory standard of living without having a close relationship with other countries.  Our imports amount to over 58 per cent of our gross domestic product while our exports amount to over 46 per cent of our gross domestic product.</P>
    <P>These facts alone demonstrate that we are bound to be affected adversely by unfavourable economic developments elsewhere.  Having said that, it would be wrong to adopt a fatalistic approach because much groundwork has been laid in the past three years to build up the economy so that it is now in a position &mdash; provided we adopt the necessary measures of discipline &mdash; to withstand the buffeting which inevitably lies ahead.  That is why I want to emphasise the very real progress that has been made to establish an economic base that can survive the storms ahead provided we, as a nation, and as individuals, take the necessary choices and make the necessary decisions to batten down the hatches and ensure that discipline obtains at every level, particularly at the level of wage increases.</P>
    <P>We have had in recent years remarkable progress in regard to our industrial <Col N="2234" /> exports.  Last year alone they increased in value by 24.5 per cent and in volume by 13.5 per cent.  OECD figures show that in volume terms total Irish exports increased at twice the rate of the overall figure for all OECD countries in 1978.  In 1979 total Irish exports were also above the OECD overall rate.  The development of these exports is all the more vital to our economy now in times of difficulty.  We all have a part to play in bringing about export expansion.  But reverting to the central point, we need to be competitive if we are to export. Through the development of our industrial base we have now become a trading country in the most positive meaning of that word.  That means that cost-competitiveness is vital to maintaining the export position of a trading nation.</P>
    <P>Our standard of living depends on our capacity to produce competitively and to export competitively.  That is the vulnerability of the situation in which we find ourselves by reason of following a policy of full employment, seeking to ensure that as many young people as possible are absorbed in gainful employment. It is quite obvious that the home market could not provide the industrial base on which this employment could be developed.  It is quite obvious also that export-orientated industries only could do so.  But export-orientated industries are vulnerable in two respects, firstly in regard to oil increases, or other energy price increases and, secondly, in regard to cost-competitiveness at home.  Cost competitiveness means a wage and salary structure built into the cost of goods being produced at home.  We will not be competitive if we pay ourselves more than the value of what we produce. Neither can we deliver on time and sell at competitive prices if our factories are closed through industrial disputes, another area in which there requires to be the exercise of national will at every level.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is at present engaged in talks with the trade union leaders to secure a new national understanding. I would make a particular <Col N="2235" /> plea on this occasion that the phrase &ldquo;national understanding&rdquo; be understood in its fullest context, in the full content and meaning of those words.  What we require today is national understanding of the problem, and a national understanding of the problem at present confronting us leads on to the fundamental conclusion that, unless we moderate our costs and export competitively, we are into an unemployment situation.  We cannot maintain the rising level of employment which is planned and forecast by the IDA, who hope to have 30,000 new jobs in the coming year, if we have job dislocation whereby existing jobs go to the wall because of rising costs, immoderate wage demands and weeks lost through industrial stoppages.  There is not much point in having a highly expensive job promotion campaign run by the IDA while at the same time older industries are going to the wall and creating unemployment.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the quality of Irish labour and management in building up our industrial base.  I am certain that knowledge of such basic factors as the present world situation, our dependence on moderation at home and our vulnerability to oil price increases, will induce a mood of reasonableness in the approach of both employers and trade unions during the coming discussions on a national agreement.</P>
    <P>One factor which will help to stimulate the economy is the guarantee announced yesterday by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Agriculture to underpin any risk involved in raising foreign capital for industry and agriculture.  That aspect is all important, because it would be fatal in the face of present difficulties to adopt a mood of defeatism.  We are not in a situation which requires the monetarist type of approach which has been adopted by the British Government and which is fashionable in the Federal Republic of Germany.  Monetarism is not the right type of financial management in our circumstances.  Ours is still a developing economy which must face the storms ahead but which requires expansion <Col N="2236" /> to cater for an expanding population.</P>
    <P>The Government themselves are now in the course of asking senior officials and executives of State-sponsored bodies to accept a policy of moderation, and we must ask for a similar moderation in regard to increases in prices and in profits.  At the same time we must continue a policy of controlled expansion so as to ensure that we do not allow deflation to take over from inflation.  We have an inflation problem caused by the cost increases I have mentioned, but it would be wrong to lurch forward into a situation of deflation.  We must steer the ship with a steady rudder in between the two, and this implies combining methods to control inflation by moderation in increases with the stimulus to the economy which is essential in industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>One of the real difficulties facing industry and agriculture is the rise in the price of money, largely caused by the monetarist policy being pursued by the British Government.  Money has become dear but it is available on the European exchange markets, particularly in Germany. One of the main intentions behind the decision taken by the Government last Tuesday and announced yesterday by the two Ministers was to persuade business men and farmers to raise the necessary credit to reflate in areas which can be reflated and to restock businesses which can be expanded and to lead them to where money is available in Europe at cheaper rates than obtain in regard to sterling loans.  As far as sterling is concerned, there is both a credit curb and a rise in interest rates, and the combination of these two factors renders money difficult to obtain and, if it is obtained, renders it very difficult to incorporate in the plans of any farmer or business man because the rates of interest range between 18 per cent and 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>With money available on the German money market and other money markets within the Community and within the EMS, loans are now freely available, particularly in deutschemarks, at interest rates in the region of 12 or 13 per cent. <Col N="2237" /> This amounts to a saving of between 5 and 10 per cent on interest rates currently obtaining in the sterling market.  This is a positive attempt by the Government to instill confidence into the business and farming community.  We are telling them to go out into the money markets where capital is available, utilise our membership of the EMS to obtain this money and the Government will guarantee them against any costs which may arise by reason of exchange fluctuations.  We believe there is very little risk, because we do not anticipate any exchange fluctuations. The fact that the Government guarantee to underpin these loans shows their belief that while there is a very serious economic situation at present it should not deter a small developing country such as Ireland from going ahead with its expansion.</P>
    <P>The most practical way in which we can help expansion is by stimulating the people in the private sector in industry and agriculture who wish to expand.  It was precisely because progressive people in these two basic areas were being hit very hard by the scarcity of credit and high interest rates that the Government decided to show that we have confidence in them and in the fact that there will not be exchange fluctuations and we are willing through the ICC and the ACC to ensure that low interest loans are freely available from the EMS money markets. There is a way open for people who wish to reinvest and expand.  In the last analysis these are the people on whom we depend to get the nation out of its present economic difficulty.  We depend on the entrepreneurs within industry and progressive farmers within agriculture who are willing to raise working capital and embark on a programme of expansion and marketing.</P>
    <P>Export earnings are essential if we are to maintain our standard of living, and the winning of foreign earnings is essentially a matter for business men and workers.  We will give them full backing directly and through the agencies I have mentioned, the Industrial Credit Company and Agricultural Credit Corporation. <Col N="2238" /> This move by the Government highlights the importance of our membership of the EMS.  Were we not members, this would not have been possible.</P>
    <P>The single most important asset we have at present is our young people.  It is often said that the population explosion here during the past ten years poses difficulties for us and raises problems.  Of course this it so, but we should welcome these difficulties and problems because an expanding population means an expansion of brains, ability and capacity. This means that a community cannot remain static but must move forward and that the creative thinking and imagination of young people is available to a greater degree.  Many Opposition speakers and politicians of all parties are running behind public opinion and young people in their thoughts and imagination. I meet young people and they are far more intelligent in their assessment of the current economic and political situation than many people here imagine.  They are aware of the difficulties caused by the oil crisis and of the fact that we are a small trading nation in a large world and must take our place in that world and meet the winds and storms it generates.  They are aware that the Government, no matter from what party or group of parties it is drawn, can do little more except manage. It is the effectiveness of the management of the State we will be judged on.</P>

      <P>Much of the harking back to 1970 which we have heard about in the House in the last few days is sterile as far as young people are concerned.  It is a form of incestuous behaviour, the kind one would see in a goldfish bowl. The commentators, our good friends on the press bench, lobby correspondents and ourselves, tend to get into this incestuous dance in a goldfish bowl.  The people outside are not interested in the whys and why nots of what happened in 1970.  It is irrelevant at present in regard to people's assessment of their position in 1980 and where they will stand in 1984 and 1990.  That is what people are concerned about.  The 18 year olds who were eight years of age in 1970 are not interested in what went on in the affairs of this House at that time.  I have relegated those matters to history and let history judge them.  As far as young people are concerned their view is that there is a difficult period facing the country, so get on with the job.  They want to hear what we are going to do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we in the Government are concerned we are continuing to fulfil our employment targets.  No money will be denied to the IDA in their pursuit of the target of 30,000 jobs.  We are concerned to save existing jobs and this is why we are bringin in the currency guarantee arrangements I have mentioned, particularly in the industrial area, to ensure that businessmen can raise the necessary finances to continue with their industrial <Col N="2240" /> operations and so maintain employment. We will continue with our positive policies in regard to ensuring that the State finances above all else are properly managed and that the budgetary situation is kept under control even if it means a legitimate curtailment of public expenditure.  It is on that basis that we ensure our financial credibility and are enabled to raise the necessary moneys when we require them for capital and expansion programmes and within the ambit of the EMS.</P>
    <P>We should avoid at all times doing anything that would undermine the confidence and ideals of young people.  It is upon them that we depend as a nation in the future.  The kind of language used yesterday by Deputies FitzGerald and Cluskey does not enhance the prestige of the House.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned our parliamentary behaviour will always be such as can command respect from young people.  We certainly do not intend to engage in job filling that disgraced the last days of the Coalition Government of which Deputies FitzGerald and Cluskey were members. There was a situation where defeated Deputies, Deputy Toal and Deputy Esmonde, were launched into jobs in the dying days of the last Government and where the head of the Government Information Services was launched into a controlling position in RTE.</P>

They recognise there are difficulties and want them spelled out.  They want the Government to spell out how they are dealing with them and they want to see that there is management of the economy that can sustain their hope for the future and their hope to live and work in Ireland.  That is the objective of this Government.  We will sustain our aspirations in that manner and do not propose to be obsessed by yesterday's headline. It is not yesterday's headline.  It is not yesterday's headline or the arms trial of ten years ago or today's decisions that are important; it is tomorrow's and next year's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Fine Gael and Labour continue with their present negative policies and attitude.  I am trying to help them out of it.  In the interests of Ireland I would like <Col N="2242" /> to see them raising their sights and thinking idealistically, constructively and responsibly.  That is the only way they can secure government of the country from the young people.  If they want to sink down into depression and negative thinking, irresponsible contributions, harking back to the past, chasing yesterday's headline and so on, they are welcome to it.  I hope they pursue it because as long as they pursue the paths of negative thinking, as sure as night follows day, Fianna Fáil will be the next Government.  The Opposition will be committed to what they appear to be, a permanent Opposition except for the occasional four years in every 20 years when the people say: &ldquo;Perhaps there is something in them and perhaps we should give them a chance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I realise that an Opposition must oppose, but opposing all the time in a negative way is no contribution to the political upbringing and the political thinking our young people are asking from us in Dáil Éireann.  Our young people are looking for leadership and what we can give, above all else, as politicians is leadership.  What we in Fianna Fáil propose to continue to give is leadership and, for the sake of Ireland, I would like to see it coming from Labour and Fine Gael.  Unfortunately, because of their inadequacies there is a spin-off benefit to Fianna Fáil as a political party.  I would rather see a spin-off benefit to Ireland as a whole coming from positive thinking and positive leadership from the Fine Gael and Labour parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to most of the contributions yesterday and took seriously the content of them but today, to the credit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a sense of humour has been introduced into what is a serious debate.  It is a pity.  I advise the Minister, before it is too late, to take up his true position, that of comedian.  There is no doubt, having listened to him, that he is far removed from the reality of the situation that exists <Col N="2243" /> today.  He is as far removed from reality as was the now redundant Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, when he tried to convince our people that we would have full employment by 1982. On that occasion I told Deputy O'Donoghue that he should go to the people who are qualified to prescribe treatment for such a mentality.  I advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has a very responsible position in the Government, to become a little more serious.  The nation demands, and deserves, serious and genuine politicians occupying high office.</P>
      <P>I intend to assess the Government on what they have done to date and to refer to the promises made in 1977.  There is no doubt that in that year Fianna Fáil worked the greatest con trick on the nation and they did that very well.  They obtained such an unprecedented mandate that they could afford to have a Cabinet meeting while a vote was taking place in this House and win that division. I accuse the Government of seriously damaging our economy to such an extent that it will take generations to put it straight.  Irrespective of what Fianna Fáil claim, they took over a sound economy in 1977.  It was not in the condition we would like to have left it but, with a united Government, it could have been built on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Opposition Fianna Fáil highlighted the deficiencies of the National Coalition. They continued to remind the people of the shortcomings of some of the members of the Cabinet and took full advantage of the fact that they had no control over certain situations.  Those members of the Cabinet were not given the credit they were entitled to.  Fianna Fáil kept reminding the public of the increase in inflation.  Some of the finest Ministers that ever graced this House lost their seats because of continuous Fianna Fáil barraging.  Fianna Fáil told the people that they should put out the National Coalition and give them the responsibility because they would be able to control prices.  They promised cloud cuckoo-land, full employment and the increase in the cost of living kept to 5 <Col N="2244" /> per cent.  They told school leavers that they could look to the future with confidence in the knowledge that they would not have to join the unemployment queues.</P>
    <P>What is the record of the Government? Forecasts for 1980 are that inflation will be in excess of 20 per cent and there is no visible sign of that figure decreasing.  Where will it end?  The Central Bank, and the ESRI, have forecast that personal consumption will fall by between 1 and 2 per cent this year.  The Minister should not leave the Chamber; he is the person who asked for a tightening of belts.  He made a plea to tighten our belts but to what?  Should we tighten our belts to a forecast of a drop of between 1 and 2 per cent?  That means a drop in the standard of living, and that is a rare occurrence.  The Minister has removed himself to the luxury of the dining room or, possibly, of the bar, which he is entitled to do, to order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to tell the Minister, and the Government, that they assess the economic situation of the country from the restaurant in Dáil Éireann, not from where they should be assessing it.  They should be assessing it from where their mismanagement is felt more, with the proletariats and those down the country.  The increase granted to old age pensioners a few weeks ago has been completely eroded because of inflation caused by the mismanagement of the Government who promised so much if they were put into power.  We have a very intelligent young electorate and in the next general election the people who were elected here in such unprecedented numbers will get their answer from those young people who are suffering because they have no jobs and no prospect of getting jobs.  Deputy <Col N="2245" /> Colley, when Minister for Finance, announced that these young school leavers would qualify for unemployment assistance, but they never got it.  That is the situation as I see it.  These are the realities.  Thousands of young people are looking for unemployment benefit because they did not get the jobs they were promised.  But they are not getting the benefit either.</P>
      <P>On the unemployment front the situation is frightening.  There are now 94,000 people unemployed.  The CII have said that unemployment is increasing at the rate of 1,000 a week.  Redundancies are now running at twice the rate of last year.  The forecast for this year is that 100,000 will be unemployed when only a few short months ago the Minister at the time, Deputy O'Donoghue, told us that by 1982 we would have full employment. That is the economic picture.  Inflation is running at 20 per cent, 100,000 are unemployed and there are cuts in the standard of living.  The only response of the Government is to cut back on both current and capital expenditure. Nothing is going to the local authorities for spending.  There has even been a substantial cutback in environmental schemes.  The same is true in relation to the hospital capital programmes. If local authorities do not get more finance there simply will be no money to pay the salaries of their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently Labour introduced a Bill to reduce and control the price of land required for urban and industrial development, because the country cannot afford to continue to pay artificially inflated prices for lands required for housing, industries and social facilities.  It was envisaged that this Bill, if accepted, would reduce the price of houses for young couples by as much as £3,000.  That was the reason for the Bill.  But we, as a party, were also conscious of the impact and influence of the spongers.  The speculators, of course, are with Fianna Fáil.  In those circumstances this party fully realised that the odds were stacked against the Bill.  The Bill was rejected and only the Labour Party moved to the <Col N="2246" /> lobby to vote in favour of it.  Again, because of the policies pursued by the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael pursued the same policy on that occasion.  They did not support Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper:</NameTxt>
      <P>I said only the Labour Deputies moved to the lobby.  That should be clear enough for anybody to interpret.  That is what I meant.  That Bill was defeated.  Who are the sufferers? The youth of our nation will suffer, the young boys and girls contemplating matrimony and building their own homes.  They are crucified and sacrificed for the benefit of the wealthy 5 per cent here.  In Limerick city alone there is a waiting list for local authority houses of about 900 to 1,200.  It is poor consolation to the young families that the Government have no money to provide them with the basic need of any family, a house of their own.  It is morally and socially unjust that young families should be condemned to live in appalling conditions because the Government have reneged on their responsibilities. Because of the policy pursued by the Government local authorities are in a very serious position.  There is no money to maintain the existing services, let alone expand on them.  There has been a cut-back in the very essential services in the urban areas because of the inadequate allocation of moneys.  Financial restrictions are placed on city managers. There is no money for repairing and maintaining local authority houses. Finance is not available to purchase materials for that very important work. Consequently the houses are allowed to deteriorate, losing their value and causing great frustration and annoyance to the tenants.  Operators who are out of work ill are not replaced.  This is depleting the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the style of the Minister in charge of the economy.  One of the greatest national assets is the housing stock and here we have a Minister not prepared to live up to his responsibility of having proper standards and efficiency in housing.  The same Minister <Col N="2247" /> recently introduced a revised differential rent scheme whereby the tenants of corporation houses had to meet increases of 500 and 600 per cent in their rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a relative decline in recent years in the role of the dollar in the international monetary system. It is, in fact, an agreed objective of the International Monetary Fund to make the Special Drawing Right, or SDR, the principal reserve asset in the system.  As Deputies will be aware, the SDR was introduced in 1969 as an internationally-managed reserve asset to help to introduce greater stability.  The objective of making the SDR the principal reserve asset, which I fully support, implies in turn a continuing reduction in the role of the dollar.  While the SDR still accounts for only a small percentage of world reserves, a number of specific measures to promote its role have been taken over the past two years and further measures are being considered.</P>

The development of the European Monetary Fund, as such, as distinct from the role of the ECU within the EMS, is under consideration at the moment. The real contribution to international liquidity is envisaged internationally as being in developing the role of the SDR to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. P. Barry</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will publish the regional development programmes submitted in support of Ireland's applications for assistance from the regional fund, if he is aware of the Commission findings that many of the programmes submitted by member states were wanting in various ways, if the Irish programme was found to be so in any respect; if so, if he will give details; and if he will outline various programmes he intends to submit for the 1981 to 1985 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The regional development programme for Ireland submitted to the Commission of the European Communities, in compliance with the regulation establishing the European Regional Development Fund, was published by the commission in August 1978.  Accordingly, the question of my publishing the programme does not arise.  The Deputies will be aware, however, that as this country is regarded as one region for the purposes of the Community's regional policy, our programme was, in effect, a national one and comprised the White Paper on <i>National Development, 1977-1980</i> together with additional analytical and other material as sought in the Common Outline for Regional Development Programmes adopted by the EEC Regional Policy Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2249" /> Regarding the Deputies' second question, I am aware that the Commission published an opinion on the regional development programmes in May 1979. The Commission's opinion was, however, a general one on all the programmes rather than being related to specific programmes.  While it stated that the programmes need to be developed further, it nevertheless agreed that they would enable it to make a better assessment of investment projects which are to receive regional fund assistance.</P>
    <P>I think that it is important to remember that these programmes represented a first effort on the part of member states and were therefore of an experimental nature.  It is to be hoped that the programmes will be constantly improved. The Commission's recommendations to member states on future programmes are designed to facilitate such an improvement, and I can assure the Deputies that they will receive particular attention in the context of the preparation of our &ldquo;second-generation&rdquo; programme.</P>
    <P>Regarding this &ldquo;second-generation&rdquo; programme, I should mention that the Commission have recommended the adoption by all member states of a uniform programme period coinciding with that chosen for the fifth medium term economic programme, that is to say, 1981-1985.  I would expect these programmes to be submitted towards the end of the year or in the early part of next year.</P>
    <P>In addition to this regional development programme, it is also my intention to submit a special programme implementing a specific Community regional development measure contributing to the improvement of the economic and social situation in the border areas in the context of the non-quota section of the regional fund.  The timing of the submission of this special programme will be determined by the adoption of the Council regulations instituting the non-quota section measures. This special programme will also be published by the Commission.</P>

In regard to whether or not it will bè published here before it is submitted to the EEC, that can only be considered at that time.  As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy, he will be aware of the fact that because all of this country is considered as a region within the definitions of the European Regional Fund which was negotiated at the time <Col N="2251" /> by the then Government, the practice has been that we present overall national development policy.</P>

I have indicated to the Deputy that the preparations are already under way in my Department and in other Departments to formulate in detail the outlines of that programme.  I am not saying that I see any objection to publishing that programme at the appropriate time.  It may well be that the decision could be perhaps to formulate a different type of document for the Commission from that which was formulated last time.

This committee grants assistance towards programmes or projects of its own choice, subject to the condition that these should result in the creation of additional employment which would not otherwise be achieved or the maintenance of employment which would otherwise be lost.</P>
    <P>The sum committed to date from the Employment Guarantee Fund is £19.4 million approximately.  However, some savings are expected on expenditures originally anticipated in respect of some of the programmes and projects being assisted by the Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment, and it is estimated that approximately £2.25 million of the Employment Guarantee Fund is still available.</P>
    <P>Following is the table:</P>

It happened under various administrations.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I did not ask that question, but I can understand the Minister answering it.  Will the Minister accept that my experience, when I wanted to collect headage grants for unfortunate people who were deprived because of the postal strike, was that I could not get those cheques without their written authority?  That was quite right, and I am not complaining about it.  But I want to know if the position has changed since <Col N="2259" /> then and are cheques now being handed out to other people without the authority of the person involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Cheques are only handed out on written request from the people concerned.  If the Deputy wants he can have details of the cases I have referred to.  But let us be clear on this.  One can try to make a major issue out of something that has been the practice for a long time.  There has been no change here.  The only change was that certain Deputies collected cheques without request from the people to whom they were directed.  These people subsequently protested.</P>

      <P>A proposal to relocate the gardaí in another building, which would have to be purchased and adapted, is being considered by the Commissioners of Public Works in conjunction with the Department of Justice. The proposal, if found feasible, would take several years to mature.  Last year the station was painted externally by the Office of Public Works and was redecorated and improved toilet facilities were provided.  Improvements to the cells were carried out two years ago.  At the request of the Garda authorities two portable offices are being installed at the station to provide new accommodation for PSV and traffic corps staff.  When these are ready for use in about four weeks' time adaptation work will be carried out in a number of rooms in the main building including those vacated by the PSV staff and the traffic corps to provide improved accommodation for the staff remaining within the station.  Internal redecoration of all areas not painted in the recent past will be carried out on the completion of the adaptation work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim:</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 to 26, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware the area known as the Wood Quay site is the property of Dublin Corporation and was acquired by them for the purposes of erecting civic offices for which they obtained planning authority after a public inquiry.  By virtue of a High Court judgment on 30 June, 1978 the area between the City Wall, Fishamble Street, John's <Col N="2268" /> Lane and Winetavern Street was defined as a National Monument under the National Monuments Act, 1930.</P>
    <P>To enable the corporation to proceed with the contract for the construction of part one of the civic offices a joint consent under section 14 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, was executed by the corporation and the Commissioners of Public Works.  On 7 March 1979 the Supreme Court confirmed that this was &ldquo;a valid and subsisting authority to the Corporation to act in accordance with its terms&rdquo; and on 9 March 1979 the Government decided not to interfere with Dublin Corporation in exercising their legal right to proceed with the contract for part one of the civic offices.</P>
    <P>Following discussions between the corporation, the Commissioners of Public Works and the National Museum, the corporation agreed to adjust their work programme to allow further archaeological excavation of the national monument site, and the Government provided the funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>These excavations have continued under the direction of the National Museum, and, as indicated in a recent statement, the Government will be making finance available for the archaeological excavation of the remaining southern section of the site which would be affected by the building works.  This decision arose out of a motion passed at the June 1980 meeting of the Dublin City Council and reflects the Government's concern that the most comprehensive archaeological information be obtained from the site.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the National Museum are fully competent to carry out these excavations in a proper, comprehensive and fully professional manner and that, within the constraints placed on them by the corporation's legal entitlement to proceed with stage one of the building project, they are complying with the broad recommendations of the National Monuments Advisory Council in the matter.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have indicated their intention to preserve the old stone city wall as part of their development of <Col N="2269" /> the site, and discussions have taken place and are continuing between officials of the Office of Public Works and the corporation to ensure that this is done in a satisfactory manner.  I understand that the corporation have extended every possible facility to the National Museum to recover and safeguard all artefacts of archaeological significance discovered on the site.</P>

      <P>In a circular to local authorities on 24 April last we set out guidelines as to the criteria which might be taken into account in the licensing of existing discharges.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that on two occasions recently spillages of asbestos material occurred within the factory referred to.  The causes of the spillages are being investigated by the Department of Labour which is responsible for the administration of the Factories (Asbestos Processes) Regulations, 1975. Cork County Council are the planning authority responsible for enforcing planning conditions relating to this factory. Certain of these conditions require the installation of filters at various points in the premises and general dust control by high-efficiency vacuum cleaners. The purpose of these conditions is to control dust emissions from the factory in the interests of public health.  Following <Col N="2277" /> the spillages the matter was investigated by the county council who have informed me that there is no evidence of any breach of the relevant planning conditions or to substantiate any suggestion that atmospheric pollution resulted outside the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, responsibility for what happened in the factory rests with the Department of Labour, but any external pollution is the responsibility of this Department.  Has the Minister got the result of the monitoring of the emission from the factory chimney stack on any of the two relevant occasions and, if so, was it above the permitted level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning authority cannot be certain that there was not an escape of asbestos dust from the factory because there is not continuous monitoring. The IIRS carry out monitoring of the external atmosphere on a regular basis for the company but they were not monitoring it when the spillage occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, lays down maximum penalties for contraventions of the Act both in the case of summary conviction, which applies to cases taken to the District Court, and for conviction on indictment in the case of offences of a more serious nature taken to higher courts.  In the latter case the maximum <Col N="2280" /> penalty provided for in the Act is £5,000 plus £500 per day for a continuing offence or two years imprisonment or both.  Legislation to increase these maximum penalties is not at present intended.</P>
      <P>Section 10 of the Act also empowers a local authority, the Minister for Fisheries or a board of conservators to apply for a District Court order directing a person appearing to be responsible for a contravention of section 3 by causing or permitting any polluting matter to enter waters, or section 4 by discharging trade or sewage effluent to waters other than in accordance with a licence, to mitigate or remedy the effects of the contravention in such manner and within such time as may be specified in the court order. This could extend to making good any damage caused, including replacement of fish stocks.</P>

      <P>That is nonsense.  Of course nobody could anticipate this particular incident because of the way it happened&mdash;how could any local authority monitoring have prevented such an irresponsible offence being committed? Local authorities are under constant pressure for better implementation <Col N="2281" /> of the Water Pollution Act and I am at present exercising further pressure to try to prevail on them to implement the Act more effectively than it has been.  One of the principal reasons why the Act has not been implemented properly is because there was a go-slow, as local authority members know, because of a pay claim and a working party dispute and so on.  One of the matters which the engineers refused to operate in most counties was the Water Pollution Act. That worked to the detriment of the administration of the Act, but that has been resolved and the Act is being implemented. I expect it to be implemented more effectively.  Of course it would be nearly impossible to prevent the type of spillage that occurred.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I sanctioned interim improvements to the existing water supply in Tralee at an estimated cost of £35,000 under the small schemes programme for 1980.

The relevant contract documents were submitted to my Department in February 1980.

      <P>Under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979, local authorities are responsible for the planning, organisation, authorisation and supervision of waste operations in their areas and they are required to prepare waste disposal plans.  Guidelines have been issued to local authorities by my Department to assist them in the administration of the regulations and they have also been supplied with a draft waste disposal plan for guidance purposes. These plans, which I have requested local authorities to expedite, will indicate the quantities of different types of waste, including hazardous waste, arising and expected to arise in each area and the manner of disposal envisaged for each type of waste.  There are no proposals at present before me in regard to the provision of sites specifically for the disposal of toxic waste.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are degrees of toxicity.  Some wastes which may be described as toxic can safely be disposed of in association with domestic refuse on landfill sites.  Others such as solvents can or are being recycled while certain other categories require to be disposed of at sea or by incineration, possibly abroad.  The choice depends on the particular circumstances and the economics of the operation.</P>

It appears that there is no place in the <Col N="2289" /> country where toxic waste can be dumped. I presume the Minister's Department have a list of the firms producing waste with a toxicity level above that of waste disposed of in normal dumps.  It would be in the interests of the country generally and of his Department primarily to see that there is some method of collecting and disposing of this waste before another tragedy occurs and there is loss of life.</P>

Some types of toxic waste can be dealt with in domestic refuse dumps and I agree with Deputies Barry and Deasy that special dumps should be provided for the other types of toxic waste.

      <P>I understand that the Ballinasloe Urban Council has not yet made a tenant purchase scheme for 1979 or for 1980 due to difficulties encountered in establishing the all-in costs of certain houses on which the sale prices are based.  When these difficulties have been resolved the terms of the 1979 scheme will apply to all applications to purchase received between 1 January 1979 and 31 December 1979.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that 22 redundant employees of a company (details supplied) in County Galway, in which it is understood Udarás na Gaeltachta own a considerable share, are experiencing conconsiderable delay and difficulties in obtaining statutory redundancy benefit; if the firm has issued redundancy certificates; if applications have been made for rebates; and the arrangements being made to expedite the payment of redundancy entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have not received notices of dismissal under the Redundancy Payments Acts in respect of employees of the company in question.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is aware of the procedure to be followed where an employee on dismissal considers that he is eligible to receive a redundancy lump sum payment but has not received it. The employee should apply for the lump sum in writing, to his employer or the representatives of the employer.  If he has not already received a redundancy certificate he should request it in the course of applying for payment of the lump sum. If after a reasonable length of time, say 14 days, the employee has not received either the lump sum or the redundancy certificate he should submit an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to establish entitlement to a redundancy payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the appeal is successful and the employer is still unable or unwilling to pay <Col N="2298" /> the redundancy lump sum the employee can then apply to have the money due paid out of the redundancy fund.  As Minister for Labour, I can authorise payment from the redundancy fund in the circumstances mentioned.  I can also authorise payment where the employee has obtained a redundancy certificate but has not been paid his redundancy lump sum.</P>
    <P>In a lay-off situation, as distinct from dismissal, it is open to an employee who has been laid off for certain specified periods to give notice to the employer of intention to claim redundancy. If the employer does not respond to this notice with an offer of employment and does not concede redundancy the procedures as already outlined for dismissal cases apply.</P>
    <P>If claims for redundancy lump sum payments are received in my Department from employees of this company they will be dealt with expeditiously once statutory entitlement is established.</P>

      <P>A second Young Worker Exchange Programme among the member states of the European Economic Community was established in July 1979.  The objective of this programme is to encourage the exchange of young workers between the member states of the Community.  The European Commission provides a contribution towards financing such exchanges.  No limit has been set on the number of workers who may benefit from assisted exchanges under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition Stagiare Agreements are operative between Ireland and certain states which are not members of the European Economic Community&mdash;Switzerland, Sweden and Austria.  These agreements permit persons between the ages of 18 and 30 years to work in the host country for a <Col N="2300" /> period of 12, or exceptionally 18, months for the purpose of learning its language and receiving vocational training or work experience.  A maximum of 200 places are available each year for stagiares wishing to locate in Switzerland with 50 places available in both Sweden and Austria.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Labour, I act as co-ordinator of the various special youth employment schemes administered by different agencies which were introduced by the Government over the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These special schemes have proved successful, particularly in helping those <Col N="2302" /> young people who have specific employment problems, and they are being continued in 1980.  The four main schemes are (1) the Environmental Improvements Schemes Programme, (2) the Temporary Grants Scheme for Youth Employment, (3) the Work Experience Programme and (4) the Community Youth Training Programme.  Their success may be gauged from the fact that in 1977 only about 2,000 young people participated in them while in 1979 the total participation rate has risen to over 11,000 at a cost of over £10 million.  It is hoped that the number of young people who will benefit from these schemes during 1980 will continue at this high level.</P>
    <P>It is important to see youth as part of the overall labour market and to appreciate that young people stand to benefit substantially from the Government's total job creation efforts.  I refer specifically here to the increased allocations this year for the Industrial Development Authority, the Public Capital Programme and the creation of the Employment Guarantee Fund, which is being jointly financed by the Government and employers organisations.</P>
    <P>AnCO is charged with the provision of a skilled and highly trained work force to enable existing businesses to operate effectively and to ensure that they are in a position to take advantage of all opportunities for expansion.  The availability of a highly skilled and trained work force is also essential to enable the Industrial Development Authority attract new industries to Ireland.  It is expected that 15,000 training places will be provided by AnCO this year of which approximately 75 per cent will be taken up by young persons.</P>
    <P>CERT has responsibility for education, recruitment and training for the hotel and catering industry and in 1980 more than 500 young persons will be accommodated on its training programmes.  I might point out that some of these schemes including the training programmes organised by AnCO and CERT qualify for financial assistance from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2303" /> It is relevant here to refer to the employment opportunities for young persons in the public sector.  The 1980 recruitment programme for the civil service is already well under way as is the recruitment for the Garda Síochána and the Army.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to the House that a sub-committee of the Manpower Consultative Committee has prepared a report on youth employment.  This report is being considered by the main committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Dangerous Substances Act, which I brought into operation last September, I have already promulgated four sets of safety regulations relating to petroleum.  In the area of road transport, regulations have been made for petroleum which is the most common dangerous substance conveyed in bulk on our roads.  These regulations have been designed to ensure that vehicles carrying petroleum on public roads do so with the least risk of injury to persons or damage to property during transportation. Requirements cover the instruction, training and medical examination of drivers.  The safety control measures <Col N="2306" /> for the vehicle cover the construction, testing and inspection of the carrying tanks and associated equipment.  Marking and labelling of vehicles, containers and tanks in an approved manner is mandatory and safety information to deal with emergencies is required to be carried on all vehicles conveying volatile petroleum.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to make an Order within the next month or so declaring twenty-five substances to be dangerous for the purposes of the Dangerous Substances Act.  This list was drawn up by the Industrial Inspectorate of my Department following a survey to determine which dangerous substances are most commonly transported in this country.  This list can be extended from time to time as the need arises.</P>
    <P>I will also bring into operation at the same time as the declaration order a set of regulations controlling the conveyance by road of the twenty-five substances. These regulations will require that containers of dangerous substances being carried in a vehicle on roads must be labelled with information giving the name of the substances together with the appropriate danger symbols.  Vehicles carrying dangerous substances will have to display markings conforming to internationally recognised systems.  The regulations will further require the selection, where practicable, of routes avoiding areas of high population density and areas where contamination may affect water supplies.</P>
    <P>Another set of regulations is in preparation to cover the loading, unloading and storage of the 25 dangerous substances already mentioned.</P>

When I came the Department of Labour in 1977 that Dangerous Substances Act had lain <Col N="2307" /> on the stocks without ever being implemented.</P>

For the Deputy's information it is a very extensive operation.  In 1978 we set about preparing the draft regulations. In 1979 we moved an amendment through this House to enable me to implement the greater part of that Dangerous Substances Act.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary):</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The function of <i>Seirbhís Phoiblí</i> is to serve as a forum for the dissemination and exchange of information about developments occurring or planned in relation to the organisation and management of the public service.  The specific objectives, as set out in the introduction to the first issue, are:</P>
      <P>To publicise significant developments in regard to the management, organisation and renewal of the public service.</P>
      <P>To publish articles on management science which will be of particular interest to public service management personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To foster discussion about the <Col N="2310" /> management, organisation and development of the public service and to provide a forum for this purpose.</P>
    <P>(b)  While I am aware that there are other organs which deal generally with developments affecting the public service, I am satisfied that there is a need for this new journal, which is more specifically linked with on-going activities in the public service and which will help to improve communications between that service and the community at large.  I might add that the Public Service Advisory Council in its latest report, for the year ended 31 October 1979, has endorsed the publication of periodic journals about the activities of Government Departments as being helpful to a better understanding of these agencies.</P>
    <P>(c)  Final costs associated with the first issue are not yet available but the approximate figures are (i) Design, £250; (ii)  Printing, £1,670; (iii) Distribution. There were no specific costs under this head apart from the postage charge, not exceeding £20, for a small number of copies.  Most copies were distributed through the normal Government messenger services without any additional cost.</P>
    <P>(d)  The cost of printing is borne by the Stationery Office and any other costs fall on my Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>(e)  Most of the articles in the Journal were written outside official hours in the authors' private time.  Apart from the staff who were engaged part-time, for brief periods, on reviewing, proof-reading and other activities connected with the publication, the editing of the Journal occupies a small portion of the time of one officer in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper:</NameTxt>
      <P>When concluding I was referring to the savage increase in rents imposed on corporation tenants.  The most disturbing aspect of this adjustment is that it is directly aimed at the less well off.  I am certain that the Minister will have to retract this increase because opposition to it is gathering momentum. If the Minister does not change his policy the people dwelling in local authority houses will remind his party at election time about this foul deed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another racket is going on in relation to SDA houses.  Many young couples are on huge bridging loans and the Minister is allowing this terrible crime to continue despite a reminder from the Opposition.  The building societies will not release loans to young couples until the local authority have taken responsibility for the roads and sanitary services in new estates.  This takes a long time so people have to continue on bridging loans at exorbitant rates.  People can remain on bridging loan for as <Col N="2459" /> long as 12 months and not a penny of their loan will have been paid.  This terrible crime is the responsibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government will tell us that they made a £1,000 new house grant available.  I concede that this was a very wise political move which helped return the Government to office in 1977.  At that time a house cost from £9,000 to £11,000 but today the same house costs from £18,000 to £20,000.  The price of houses today does not go up by hundreds of pounds but by thousands.  My son purchased a house last October for £15,000 from a reputable builder but now the same house costs £18,000.  Do the Government realise that, because of their inactivity in controlling the price of houses in 1977, in a short ten weeks houses went from £15,000 to £18,000. This is the reality.  In the face of what the Government are doing how can people buy homes of their own?  Is there any shame left in the Government?  What has gone wrong?  Do Fianna Fáil think that the electorate will continue to fall for gimmickry like the manifesto?  They will know that when they go to the polls within two years.</P>
    <P>The Limerick City Corporation are losing £10,000 a week in giving gas supplies to consumers.  This is a public utility service and people are entitled to this type of energy.  We need a financial injection from the Government to keep this essential service in operation.  A request from the Limerick Corporation to the Minister for Energy to meet a deputation has fallen on deaf ears.  The Minister is not interested.  The Taoiseach has a Limerick member in his Cabinet and he is equally disinterested.  Is it because of the divisions in the Cabinet? My constituents shall not be penalised because of internal divisions in the Government.  We demand action now. The Limerick City Corporation will go bankrupt like the city of New York if the Minister does not move immediately to relieve this industry.  The banks are on the doorsteps of the gas works to close it down.  It can only be salvaged by a huge injection of capital in the short-term and <Col N="2460" /> in the long-term we must be included in the national grid.  Gas is coming from Kinsale and is a national resource.  It belongs to all the people.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Government of their promises to the trade unions to maintain the labour force at its existing strength.  I hope the Minister is not reneging on this issue.  As well as being an essential service Limerick Gas Works give good employment.  The cost of naphtha has risen by a few hundred per cent since we changed from solid fuel to oil in the making of this gas and this is the reason for our serious financial position in relation to Limerick Gas Works.  I hope the Minister for Energy will give us what we feel we are entitled to, a financial injection in the short term and then include us in his plans for the national grid.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to what I consider to be a disgraceful and shameful decision taken in relation to sport by the Government. In my opinion they made a big <i>faux pas</i> in banning sportsmen and women from participating in the Olympic Games.  The Taoiseach personally disappointed me.  I always associated him with the sporting fraternity.  Possibly I gave him more credit than I should. Any wisdom or foresight would have shown him that one Olympic gold medal winner would do more good in promoting the name of Ireland than all the ambassadors or embassies in our name could do in a lifetime.  The chance of a gold medal in this year's Olympics was never better.  No consideration was given to the trouble to which young sportsmen and women went and to the adverse effect this decision will have on the future of sport here.  The Government capitulated to the whim of Uncle Sam.  The big stick was wielded and a cowardly decision was made.  A glorious opportunity was lost when we could have shown the world that we may be small in size but big in stature, that no matter what size our nation was we would not take dictation from anybody. The Irish helped to build the American nation, a fact of which we are very proud, but we make our own decisions <Col N="2461" /> as an independent nation and we should not foul up sport with politics.  Personally I believe the stain of that unwise decision in the name of our people is on the hands of the Government.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs said earlier that he would prefer to see the seventies going into the history books that will be one piece of history that he will be terribly ashamed of when it is written.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  In that case I must conclude but it would be remiss of me not to say that since the elevation of some of the new Deputies to junior Ministries, in my experience in dealing with most of them I have found them most co-operative and helpful and I want to put that on record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to most of the debate and I should like to pay a compliment to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle whose job it was to protect Members of the House in circumstances where they were under vicious attack.  The type of speech made in many cases, to quote somebody else, diminished the House.  It was the type of attempt to assassinate character with which I have little sympathy:</P>
      <P>The purest treasure mortal times afford</P>
      <P>Is spotless reputation.  That away, Men are but gilded loam and painted clay.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his efforts to keep the level of discussion in the House as high as possible in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been reference to the possibility of a solution to the serious problem that we have by reason of the country being partitioned.  I do not intend to deal in any significant way with this problem although it impinges on me <Col N="2462" /> in my constituency and in my normal work as a politician.  One thing that surprised me about the House was the reaction to suggestions as to a federal solution to the problem and the immediate illogical conclusion drawn when this was mentioned that in some way people who spoke of it as a possible solution were suggesting a two-nation theory.  Members of the House interested in this problem could with benefit study the position in countries where a federal system has been operating in some form.</P>
    <P>Recently, I was at a UNESCO meeting in Sophia and the representative of the Federal Government of Canada at that meeting was the Minister of Education for Nova Scotia, a man who gloried in a name which would not be strange in the purlieus of this House, Mr. Donoghue.  But there was no problem about him acting as Minister of Education from Canada although in fact he was Minister of Education of the Province of Nova Scotia.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the States of the United States and the Federal Government is also one which would repay careful study by people interested in our problem in Ireland.  There are many well-defined rights of which the states are more than jealous, rights that would find very capable exponents in the Six Counties of North East Ireland, posts and positions which would be well filled by the very able people in public life and the very able people that would come into public life if we succeeded in getting some solution to our problem. The Federal Republic of Germany was represented at that meeting by Herr Franke who is the Minister of Education in Lower Saxony.  Again, there was no difficulty in his representing the Federal Republic although in fact he was Minister for Education in one of the Länder and was chosen to represent his country.</P>
    <P>I think some Member of the House referred to Switzerland in this context.  I suggest that before we begin tying two states to anything making a dichotomy we could study with profit for ourselves the relationship between provinces and <Col N="2463" /> central government in Canada, states and Federal Government in the US Länder and Federal Government in Germany and the cantonal arrangement in Switzerland, that is if we want to make any positive contribution and be fruitful in what we say about this subject and if we do not want&mdash;to mix the metaphors a little&mdash;a patron saint of the dog in the manager.</P>
    <P>To come to my own particular subject and interests I have listened to various references to education and education difficulties and I want to put on record some of the achievements of the Department of Education and of my own Ministry in this Adjournment Debate. We hear of the dire economic straits, we hear that as a result education is suffering heavily.  I want to present the House with some unadorned facts and leave the House and the country to judge for themselves.</P>
    <P>I want, first of all, to put on record that there has been an increase of over £100 million or 24.6 per cent in the provision in the Estimates for this year compared with the 1979 Estimates.  That is extra money being provided and there cannot be any doubt about that.  No amount of irrelevancy can cloud that fact.  That fact is stubborn.  It may be said that we should not be making comparisons but, for the record, I want to say that the gross Estimates of £510,513,000 &mdash;it cannot stop at that as the House knows&mdash;for education this year compares with an Estimate of £273,794,000 in 1976, the last full year of the Coalition term in office.  This represents an increase in real terms&mdash;those are the two words that are emphasised most in debates on figures and statistics in the House&mdash;of 11.5 per cent.  The capital provided in my three years as Minister totals £149 million compared with £91,580,000 in the last three years of the former Administration, an increase again in real terms of more than 20 per cent.  I have listened to all the statements of doom in the course of the debate and I want to refer to the positive measures I mentioned at the outset.  I recently announced a comprehensive range of <Col N="2464" /> reductions in the pupil&mdash;teacher ratios in national schools.  Three hundred additional teachers will be employed this year for the purpose of reducing class size and providing remedial instruction in our schools.  I am continuing this year also the provision introduced in 1979 of providing remedial teachers ex-quota in post primary schools.  A further 100 teachers of remedial education will be placed in remedial educational positions this year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have come to the aid recently of our secondary schools by taking over the payment of the pay-related social insurance and by meeting the full costs of substitute teachers, a substantial injection of funds to secondary schools of the order of £2.8 million has been made.  In a time of financial restraint this is a significant contribution by the Government to secondary schools and is an effective answer to those who allege that there is discrimination against secondary schools.  We have made a provision of £1.565 million for the continuance of the youth employment scheme and, as the House knows, £5 million has been made available from the tripartite fund for sport and recreational facilities.  The record of any individual year will stand on its own feet.  It is appropriate that I refer to what has been done because the greatly increased provision for education this year is a reflection <i>inter alia</i> of the significant expansion in educational services introduced in the last three years.</P>
    <P>I want to summarise the major improvements that have taken place.  At primary level the pupil&mdash;teacher ratio has been improved on four occasions since 1977.  In all, since that time 1,700 additional teachers have been appointed bringing the total number of teachers from 17,300 to 19,000.  Of this increase some 1,000 have been deployed to reduce class size and to provide for remedial education.  As I have already mentioned, a further 300 will be appointed in the 1980-81 school year for the purpose of reducing class size and expanding the provision for remedial education.  As far as remedial teachers <Col N="2465" /> are concerned the 197 already appointed since 1977 and the further recruitment this year will bring the total of remedial teachers to over 600.  In addition, we are close to reaching the stage when the large national schools will have a remedial teacher specially appointed to provide remedial education for backward pupils.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House also that we are trying to concentrate our attention on the 40:1 pupil&mdash;teacher ratio schools and it is about those that parliamentary Questions usually are put down.  Nevertheless, it is true to say that in many schools we have pupil&mdash;teacher ratios of as low as 14:1 and some points higher in the range up to 20:1.  Quite a significant number of our pupils are taught in that particular pupil&mdash;teacher ratio atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The capitation grant which was not increased in 1976 or 1977 has been doubled for the primary schools from £6 to £12 for 1979/80.  By any standard an increase of 100 per cent over three years is no mean achievement.  The facts speak for themselves.  Schemes for secretarial assistants and for the employment of caretakers in the larger primary schools were introduced.  These schemes have given employment to some 500 people. Seventy nine child care assistants have been recruited for schools for the physically and mentally handicapped. These schemes I have mentioned are new schemes and they have a social extension, they have an educational one and they certainly have an employment one.  They are schemes which should occur to people whose social conscience is refined, who are committed to educational finance and particularly to people who are anxious to provide opportunities for employment in the State.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level the pupil&mdash; teacher ratio was reduced in secondary schools, in community and comprehensive schools and in vocational schools. As a result of these improvements over 800 additional teachers have been appointed in post-primary schools.  The scheme for the provision of secretarial <Col N="2466" /> assistants was extended also to the larger secondary schools.  At the same time, the non-teaching staff in vocational schools and in regional colleges was significantly increased.  In all, over 500 non-teaching personnel were appointed.</P>
    <P>The tuition grant in lieu of school fees in secondary schools was increased in two stages from £50 to £70 per pupil.  In addition, a special grant of £2 per pupil was paid to secondary schools in December 1979 towards the increase in the cost of energy.  This grant has been retained for the present year.  I have already referred to the part resolution of the cash crisis of secondary schools and the significant improvement in the finances of the secondary schools by the Department assuming responsibility for the payment of the pay-related social insurance contributions and undertaking the payment of full salary for substitute teachers.  In all this year this will cost £2.7 million.</P>
    <P>The higher education grants were dramatically increased within the past two years.  The maximum grant has been doubled in the period from £300 to £600.  Perhaps more significantly and more importantly for somebody who wants to get there, the eligibility limit has been increased from £2,950 to £6,100.  I am particularly pleased that last year a big break through and one with great potential for the future, was made in adult and recurrent education.</P>

      <P>I have heard this speech before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the scheme for the provision of adult education organisers.  Last year 50 organisers were appointed by vocational education committees. I look forward to these officers playing a dynamic role in the extension and furtherance of adult education throughout the country.  I have plans for the utilisation of these officers for a significant contribution to third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, too, a scheme was introduced for the employment of 100 youth development officers who will also <Col N="2467" /> play an active and dynamic role in the development of our young people. Measures taken in relation to the provision for youth employment deserve special mention.  In 1978 a scheme employing 1,300 young people was implemented at a cost of £1 million.  In 1979 a further £1.5 million was spent on additional projects employing more than 2,000 young people.  This year, as I have stated already, a sum of £1.565 million is being provided.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that many of the improvements made have resulted in the creation of a large number of teaching and non-teaching posts.  This increase in posts will continue to confer advantage in the schools over a long number of years ahead.  It must be remembered, however, that the cost of many of these improvements will also increase annually through the awards of increments on the scales of salary of those who have been recruited.  There is a tendency for people when looking at one year in isolation to decry the provision made in that year. They conveniently overlook the fact that not only has provision to be made for the new services introduced but that provision has to be made for additional costs arising as the years go on.  In this regard, it is relevant to refer back to the statistic I quoted earlier that compared to 1976, there has in this year's estimates been an increase of 11.5 per cent in real terms in the allocation for educational services.</P>
    <P>I now want to look forward and to look at the possible scenario for the future.  First, it is a truism, but one that does not lose any of its value by being repeated, that improvement in the level and quality of the educational system can only come from economic growth in our society.  No Minister for Education can wave a magic wand and obtain all the financial resources he needs.  Additional funding will be determined by the growth in our economy.  We are all too painfully aware of the effects on our open economy of the world-wide depression, the huge increases in oil prices by the OPEC and other oil-producing countries, and the consequent need to transfer more and more of our resources abroad. <Col N="2468" /> These external factors are of such dimension and our economy is of such an open nature that growth in GNP presents us all with a formidable challenge. Anyone, even with the least imagination, can guess what a Minister for Education would be able to do with even half of the £800 million that must be transferred this year to the oil-producing countries in respect of that part of our energy that is derived from oil.</P>
    <P>In education it places a responsibility on me as Minister to ensure that the tax-payer is getting the best possible value for the money expended on the various educational services.  I can assure the House that my Department and I will see that that objective is achieved.  In the context of scarce resources the concept of priority must prevail all the more.  The House well knows the host of demands being made on me for this new service or that new service and for additional funding of existing services.  There are few Members in the House who have not from time to time made representations to me in one matter or another.  We must all be conscious of the fact that a choice has to be made between competing interests. Moreover, we must realise that in choosing to fund one kind of educational service we must not do so at the expense of another and perhaps equally desirable service.  Because of many factors not least the continuing growth in the school-going population which will continue&mdash;albeit at a slower rate&mdash;to the end of the decade, the scope for massive improvements and innovations in the educational system is limited.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is my responsibility to the Government and to the House to determine the order of priorities for State spending on education. Obviously, our first requirement must be to cater for the many thousands of additional pupils seeking places in our educational institutions.  This year, for example, it is expected that an additional 14,000 students will need to be provided with school places, other ancillary services and with the most expensive input of all, that is, teachers to instruct them. This is a hidden factor which many people <Col N="2469" /> do not realise has got to be provided for each year in framing the Estimates. The Government and I have already decided that priority should be given to the first and second levels of the educational system.  Primary education in general needs our support and we shall press ahead to do what we can in this sector.  In particular the socially and economically deprived pupils merit all the support we can give them.  There has to be a positive discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged.  Education must be styled to the cultural background of disadvantaged children and to prepare them for whatever job opportunities are available.  This will be a priority in educational policy in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>Our society must become a more caring society and be prepared to make sacrifices for the disadvantaged.  I know that I can count on the professionalism, the dedication and the commitment of our teachers at all levels to do their part. For my part, I will continually strive to obtain the maximum resources to finance the work.  But financial resources of themselves will not solve the problem&mdash;the love, the care, and the concern of all involved in education, whether in administration, in management or in teaching, will be required.  I am satisfied that the goodwill is there.  It merely requires to be harnessed and directed.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me I want to turn to and concentrate on a fundamental issue facing educationists today.  I refer to the need to provide that kind of education that meets the challenges of the technological age, to provide for the demands of our continually developing industrial society without harming our children and to enable our children to avail themselves of the job opportunities as the manufacturing sector of the economy in particular expands.</P>
    <P>I accept that the basic objective of the educational process is the development of the individual&mdash;morally, mentally and physically.  There is the added objective <Col N="2470" /> of preparing the pupil to take his place in society and in the work force.</P>
    <P>This is something that I feel very strongly about.  Both at national and at international level considerable research is needed in this domain.  We should have experiments, research and study into the question of what is the best possible form of education for our young people up to, say, the age of 16.  We do not believe that the objective of our system should be to educate for any particular advantage to any particular enterprise. What we should be doing is trying to find what is the best curriculum for our students, both male and female, a curriculum that will leave their minds most creative, most flexible and most adaptable.  Because it seems to me that, as the remaining years of this century pass, we will have a position in which our people will need to acquire new skills.</P>
    <P>What I am talking about is flexibility, creativity and adaptability of mind in respect of education which will leave people capable of changing either their jobs or their skills several times perhaps without losing the freshness which such an education should give them.  The subject is a complex one and one to which there is not any ready-made solution. But it is a field in which research, study and tests should be undertaken.  I am on record already on that particular matter when it was raised at an international gathering and when I gained considerable support from the Minister for Education in the Netherlands for the views I expressed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to parents to encourage their children to have open minds in regard to job opportunities.  It has been said in the past that we have not been brought up to think in terms of employment in manufacturing industry but it is realised generally that this situation will have to be remedied.</P>
    <P>There are worthwhile career opportunities for our young people in industry and it would be a great pity if, through lack of guidance or through any kind of inbred prejudice, young people should confine their career objectives to any narrow sphere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2471" /> We have had considerable growth in industry, particularly in the electronics sector, in a brief period.  The job opportunities in that sphere are great and it would be a great tragedy if we had the expertise which is available now in our educational system but did not have people with the will to undertake these jobs. Our education system has demonstrated to industrialists that it can respond to their needs.  The seventies was a period of great expansion in technological education.  It was the decade which saw the establishment of NIHE Limerick, the opening of nine new regional colleges and the setting up of the NCEA.</P>
    <P>The establishment of these institutions was a deliberate diversification of the structure of higher education.  This diversification will be continued in the eighties.  NIHE Dublin, will be opened in October next.  Work on the construction of the new building for the College of Commerce has been commenced.  Planning for the second phase of NIHE Limerick is well advanced, as is the new School of Engineering at UCD.  The extensions to the last three RTCs&mdash;Carlow, Athlone and Letterkenny; all the others have been extended already&mdash;will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>Four new regional technical colleges have been recommended to cater for the Greater Dublin area and preliminary planning for them has begun.  Arising from the recommendations of the Manpower Consultative Committee, the Government have made available in the current year a sum of £1.8 million for the setting up of conversion and other courses to meet the estimated manpower shortage in certain engineering and electronic areas.  The authorities of the higher education institutions have responded efficiently and quickly and have set up the courses required.</P>
    <P>The education system is geared to provide the education and training required. The jobs in these areas are there. What is needed now is to ensure that all available places on these courses, particularly in engineering and electronics, will be filled.  The guidance counsellors <Col N="2472" /> have assured me that the interest in getting places in these institutions has been heightened.</P>
    <P>In all this, of course, it may be that pupils and parents lack information concerning in particular the value of qualifications obtained in regional technical colleges.  I would hope that the many career guidance counsellors in our post-primary, particularly the secondary, schools would ensure that the pupils in their schools will be given all the information necessary to acquaint them of the various courses available.  I am glad to learn of a school-industry link scheme, now being carried out on a pilot basis, which aims to promote a greater understanding and awareness among young people of the career opportunities available to them in industry.</P>
    <P>I would like also to see a greater participation by second-level students in technical subjects, particularly at senior cycle level, where they can be introduced to subjects such as senior engineering, building construction and mechanical drawing.  I have had correspondence from people in the schools who are afraid that in many cases the very high standards in vocational schools are becoming more like their nearest secondary schools and that therefore many of the senior students are neglecting the areas which I have just mentioned.  This is evidenced by fewer candidates for those subjects in the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer in passing to a reference made by Deputy Horgan this morning to the Tussing Report and its projections.  Professor Dale Tussing did a very good job in his examination of the possible needs of our educational system in the next number of years, but I take issue with his right to campaign politically on some of his findings even if I have not a quarrel with his <i>modus operandi.</i>  I challenge his pessimistic conclusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to get an opportunity at the end of any Dáil session to have a look at what has been happening.  One of the areas I have some <Col N="2473" /> responsibility for is urban affairs.  When one examines the track record of the previous administration under Deputy Lynch and the new one, particularly in the last year, one will not find any concern whatsoever for any development in the urban renewal areas, in conservation, in the whole developments of the urban concept.  When the inter-departmental committee on inner city development issued their comprehensive report we hoped that at last we would see tackled all the anomalies besetting our urban areas.</P>
      <P>That was a very good report because it identified the problems, and set out solutions for them, none of which would have involved major costs.  That report appears to have been shelved and there has not been a peep from the far side about it, possibly because it was the brainchild of Deputy O'Donoghue, and anything he had anything to do with must be cast aside like an old boot&mdash;the present administration cannot be tainted with it.  That, of course, is a rather shortsighted and narrow attitude.</P>
      <P>That committee made various recommendations involving youth: employment, education, vandalism, housing, job experience.  One has only got to walk around our cities, particularly Dublin, to see the steel-shuttered shops at night, depriving people of the old pleasure of window-shopping.  Not alone can people not window-shop any more but they cannot walk the city streets in safety. They cannot park their cars.  I read today about a visitor's car being stolen on two occasions.  Recently we read of three people being killed because a car had been stolen.  We are experiencing a general breakdown of law and order.  We see social deprivation in our inner city. Schools are overcrowded because of the socio-economic background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report to which I have been referring recommended that the teacher-pupil ratio should be not higher than 20. Waxing eloquent about education, the Minister for Education a few moments ago mentioned the teacher-pupil ratio, but he said that the parliamentary questions <Col N="2474" /> being put down referred only to schools in which there was a teacher-pupil ratio of 40.  I am talking about the real needs in education.  Nothing whatsoever appears to be happening in this area.  For example, there is no question of youth officers being deployed in these areas, no proper formulation of a youth policy for people who need guidance and who have not got it in their homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about a 24 per cent increase in moneys allocated to education in the 1979 budget.  To people who are not benefiting from it that means very little.  The people about whom I am speaking do not have a strong voice in society but need the support and help of society to lift themselves out of the abyss in which they find themselves. The blueprint is there but, alas, this Government are not interested in tackling any areas of social injustice. They seem concerned only with public relations exercises.  For example they have blown hot and cold on farmer taxation. As soon as the heat comes on we see their total change of attitude and they run for cover.  They were proposing to modify the school transport system. This generated further heat, with headlines in the press, when the Minister made a statement to the effect that he would not proceed with that plan.  Those are some examples of areas in which this Government govern by reaction.  They float something and when the heat is generated, they back-track.  This constitutes a recipe for every pressure group in the country to pressurise the Government when anything unpopular is proposed.  What do they do?  They run in the face of this pressure.  It is moral cowardice at its worst.</P>
    <P>This Government were given a thumping majority.  We may talk about strong government.  They are strong numerically but certainly not in courage. Their only thought is how they can literally con the electorate again because that was precisely what they did in 1977 when their slogan was: if you have a problem we have the solution.  Their slogan in 1980 is: if you have a problem we have got a commission.  That is the <Col N="2475" /> new gimmick and puts matters on the long finger whether it be in connection with labour disputes, income tax, electoral boundaries or whatever.  Is that what governments are elected to do&mdash;to pass on the buck, delegate responsibility, hedge, procrastinate?  It is not.  But it seems to me that this Government and Taoiseach are consumed with the thought of the next general election and how it can be won, how they can pull the necessary strings to win it, how they can do the popular thing so as to be seen to be nice people.  We witness these dispicable acts day after day.  I am quite serious about this, I do not think our people are buying this for one moment. They were fooled a few years ago and are now only awaiting their opportunity at the next general election to demonstrate their disgust by putting this Government in their place, and that is in opposition.  It gives me no pleasure to come in here and be critical but their record is there for all to see.</P>
    <P>In the area of housing, for which I have some responsibility, costs have risen by 24 per cent from May 1979 to May 1980.  We hear quoted all sorts of grandiose figures.  One can talk endlessly about percentages and gloss them over but the local authority housing programme will be dramatically cut back.  For example, in Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member, they received approximately a 6 per cent increase on last year's allocations, this with a 24 per cent increase in housing costs in the past year.  One does not have to be too bright to foresee the cut-back that must be effected as a result, and that is in regard to housing only.</P>
    <P>This Government announced the £1,000 new houses grant to a fanfare of trumpets.  Then, when a further oil crisis arose, they decided they would give heating grants for conversion purposes. That was a great idea.  But, when they found that that was costing a fair amount of money, what did they do? They eliminated those grants altogether. God knows the grant for heating conversion purposes in the sum of £600 was not a great deal but at least it was <Col N="2476" /> something.  Now it has been abolished. As soon as that grant was abolished I appealed to the Minister to allow some grant for homes with outdoor toilets and no bathrooms.  That request was turned down flatly.  God knows people today living in homes without bathrooms or with outdoor toilets could not be said to be living in the eighties as far as housing is concerned: far from it.</P>
    <P>Again I requested the Minister if, in designated areas, he would consider allowing grants for the maintenance or preservation of older houses, when again the reply was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I predict that this will lead to dereliction.  If people living in older houses are not given grants to maintain or repair them&mdash;and I was advocating a higher grant than the miserable £600&mdash;then we shall witness the dereliction of houses, again placing a further burden on capital for the building of more houses rather than conserving, developing and improving existing older houses.  That is the only sensible course to take but the Government ran away from that suggestion; they threw it out the window.  In stringent times I would accept that there would have to be cut-backs on grants not absolutely essential, grants for porches and so on.</P>
    <P>Old parts of Dublin, Cork and Limerick contain houses where bathrooms are required and where the brickwork needs pointing.  If this work is not done there will be major urban blight.  The present Government have no programme for the development of the inner cities.  When the Coalition Government took office in 1973 there was a commitment to inner city housing and the positive results can be seen.  Since this Government came to power there have been soundings and white papers, but the clear indication has been that inner city housing is not a sound proposition economically.  A city without people will die.  People are now being driven out of inner city areas and the Government are presiding over a situation of doom.</P>
    <P>The whole area of local authority is under serious threat.  The allocation to local authorities this year has been increased by about 10 per cent over last <Col N="2477" /> year's allocation but there has been an increase in costs of between 20 and 24 per cent.  This means that there must be serious cut-backs.  It is difficult to walk around our cities without twisting or breaking an ankle in the potholes in rundown areas.  We were once proud of our cities because they had character and history but now they are being run down.</P>
    <P>There is the same attitude towards pollution. I asked a question some time ago about the emission of pollution from heavy vehicles and I was told that nothing could be done yet.  It appears that the police are powerless and buses and heavy lorries can emit the pollution which is ruining the health of our children and damaging our buildings.  In 1983 the EEC will bring in some regulation with which we must conform.  If this regulation were not to come into force it is obvious that nothing would be done in regard to pollution.  One must question why the Government have to wait for action by the EEC.  Can they not bring in legislation to tackle this serious problem of pollution which can have such serious consequences for the health of the people residing in our cities and those who travel to them daily to their places of employment?</P>
    <P>There is another area of silence.  I refer to the High Court decision on the matter of tenancy and rent control of pre-1963 premises.  The matter has now been referred to the Supreme Court and questions have been asked in the House.  Will any action be taken to ensure that people are protected?  The answer given is that the matter is <i>sub judice.</i>  The courts of this land are making decisions which the Government should be making, and this is being used as an excuse by the Government.  They must re-examine the whole question of rent control and consider how to alleviate hardship if these controls disappear.  Many elderly people live in rented accommodation and we have a duty to protect them.  The Government should have made a statement to the effect that if rent control is <Col N="2478" /> removed they will subvent the rents of people in this category.  It is terrible that people in the autumn of their lives should have to live in terror waiting for a court decision.  I represent an older part of Dublin and I am not exaggerating the fear which exists among elderly people there.  I try to alleviate it as far as I can but the Government must clearly state that they are prepared to subvent their rents.  The precedent has already been established because this is done in the local authority housing area where rent subsidies are paid.  People who own their own houses are all right.  They do not have to pay rates but they must maintain their houses.  People in private rented accommodation must be protected.  We are told that the matter is now <i>sub judice.</i></P>

Can they say to a landlord that he may not put up the rent or terminate their tenancy because the matter is <i>sub judice</i>?  Of course they cannot do so because the court did not say that.  The cases which are on appeal are those cases which were heard by the court.

      <P>It will be falling on deaf ears as usual but it is no harm to have it on record that the whole situation is not as they say it is.</P>
      <P>These are some of the matters this Government are running away from. Their whole attitude towards the less well off in society and the surveys that have been done clearly indicate that any benefits&mdash;God knows there are few&mdash;that are conferred are conferred on those who have.  People who have not&mdash;large families, low income groups and so on&mdash;are not getting anything.  In local authority areas there has been a savage rent increase.  I know of a case where a man lives in a dungeon of a room.  It is in an old fire brigade station, more than 200 years old.  His rent went up by £1.50, and that for one room with no toilet or other facilities and with flagged floors.  Is that a sense of social justice?  Have the Government any conception of the way people are living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the whole rent situation.  The way it was handled with NATO was very bad.  They are a responsible body.  An agreement was made with them by the previous Government in 1973 that they would negotiate rent increases and come to some reasonable agreement on them.  Prior to the general election an agreement was made with them by Fianna Fáil.  It was a document signed by a Minister saying <Col N="2480" /> that they would agree to carry on the same formula and agreement.  Less than three years later they have thrown that agreement back in the face of NATO saying that they are not interested and they will tell NATO what they will do.</P>
    <P>That is not the way to govern or bring about peace.  If that is the kind of negotiations entered into by the Government no wonder we have industrial strife throughout the country.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to reconsider the question of rent increases.  Rent increases are necessary from time to time.  They should be negotiated with NATO, who represent the vast majority of tenants.  The Government chose to ignore that.  They sent for NATO, talked down to them and told them that this is what they were doing.  That is a recipe for disaster and disruption, which is something none of us wants to see.  If that is the attitude of the Government towards responsible bodies, God help us. It is no wonder we have chaos not only in that area but in the industrial area also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the Deputy had another half-an-hour I doubt if he would improve his performance to any extent.  In this debate there are many areas that have been and must be referred to.  In our economy at present we are at a vital stage of our development. We have a young work force and we face the future with a young work force.  This will continue to expand over the next few decades.  We will have to provide them with worthwhile employment and a reasonable standard of living. They are a tremendous asset in our society and economy.  This will be a difficult objective, with the future forescasts there are for the world economy, but it is one the Government are committed to. We are taking steps to use to the best possible advantage the asset that our young people represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On youth employment, I want to <Col N="2482" /> assure Deputies that the youth employment situation is more favourable than some commentators have suggested. Deputies will no doubt be aware of the developments in this area following on the 1975 recession.  Our experience, which was similar to that of most western countries, was that youth unemployed increased much more rapidly than unemployment as a whole.  In 1977 unemployment in the 15-24 age group, which stood at 42,000, accounted for 42 per cent of the total unemployment, while youth made up only 28 per cent of the labour force.  Faced with this high level of youth unemployment, the Fianna Fáil Government recognised that the problem would not be, solved merely by an improvement in the economic situation and that employment schemes specifically for youth would have to be drawn up.  New youth schemes were introduced and existing ones were expanded. Last year these schemes provided places for well over 11,000 participants compared with only about 2,000 in 1977.  Expenditure on youth employment schemes amounted to £10.8 million in 1979.  While we cannot say precisely what the present level of youth unemployment is, all the indications are that it has declined considerably from the 42,000 figure obtaining in 1977.  The rapid expansion of youth employment schemes, the record increases in employment in the last few years, and the continuous declining trend in the live register in the period from June 1977 to December 1979 all point to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that because of unfavourable developments in the economic situation, internationally and domestically, the trend in unemployment has been increasing in the first five months of this year.  However, all the major youth employment schemes are being continued and this will ensure that any increase in unemployment due to the present recession will not fall too heavily on our young workers and school leavers, as happened during the term of office of the last Government.  The allocations for these schemes from all sources, which amount to almost £10 million, will allow them to operate at <Col N="2483" /> near to last year's level.  It is now estimated that employment generally has increased by 17,000 in the year ending April 1980, despite unfavourable conditions pertaining internationally and domestically.  More than 9,000 of this increase were within the manufacturing industry sector.  The employment incentive scheme has held steady this year and that is an encouraging and good indicator.</P>
    <P>I see the principle obstacle to an achievement of full employment at present as the high rate of job losses.  If we could contain or, indeed, reduce these losses we would achieve faster progress towards our national objective of full employment.  The Government have already several schemes in operation to help firms in difficulty.  I believe that with the help of our social partners we can achieve more.  I was pleased to learn of the welcome extended today by a neutral observer to my colleague's announcement last night in the House of aid in the form of working capital to industry.  I have no doubt that will have the effect of saving many thousands of jobs that might otherwise have been threatened.</P>
    <P>On industrial relations it has often been said that good industrial relations have little news value and that it is only strikes, or the threat of them, which are likely to make the headlines.  Little publicity is given to the fact that most differences between workers and employers are resolved through the normal collective bargaining procedures in a calm, peaceful and sensible atmosphere. Estimates of days lost due to industrial disputes show a considerable improvement. I have already given figures for the first quarter of this year and, as I indicated to the House, it was the best quarter since records were first kept in the Department.  The estimates for the first half of the year are now available to us and the figure is just over 200,000 days lost compared with 1,315,000 for the same period last year.  That shows a substantial improvement, but we must not be complacent about those improvements. We cannot be complacent about good industrial relations.  They must be <Col N="2484" /> worked at by both sides.  Procedures must be used and they can be used much more effectively than the use of the strike weapon, which does not help anyone but is so often resorted to.  In saying that I am not trying to convey that the cause is on one side or the other.  Indeed, experience has shown that it can be on either one side or the other, or both.  It is encouraging that there has been such a substantial improvement.</P>
    <P>I hope the trend continues.  We know only too well that industrial relations are an extremely complex issue in which emotions and attitudes rather than logic and reason sometimes take precedence.  I must pay tribute to the patience, dedication and skill of the many managers and trade union representatives who devote so much of their time working hard to seek out solutions to the many difficult issues which are part and parcel of the industrial relations scene.  Because of the commitment and dedication of those hard working people, whose work never becomes public, possible dispute situations are averted.</P>
    <P>Wherever two sides to a particular dispute fail to come to an agreement through direct negotiations the industrial relations service of the Labour Court is readily available to assist parties to resolve disputes.  I should like to repeat the encouragement I have often given to parties to use those services to the fullest possible extent.  It is vital that, when direct negotiations fail to bring about a settlement, the parties involved should jointly avail of the industrial relations service as an impartial third party to assist in reaching a settlement.  In the whole industrial relations scene one aspect is more important than any other, and that is the question of communications. Good communications can mean so much in the work place; and if communications are right between all groups concerned they can help tremendously to avoid conflict.  In the discussion document I issued on worker participation a chapter was devoted to codes of practice for information flow and communications. I have always felt that that is an important aspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2485" /> I have noted a number of criticisms of the Labour Court in recent weeks.  The annual report, which was published earlier this afternoon, shows the very large increase in the value of work undertaken by the court.  They held 622 hearings and issued 575 recommendations as compared with 545 recommendations in 1978 and 462 in 1977.  Members of the conciliation service chaired over 1,300 negotiations in 1979, an alltime high number, and prevented many difficulties arising.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the national understanding.  The current national understanding will finish for some workers next week and, as Deputies are aware, I am discussing a new understanding with the social partners.  I will make every effort on the Government's behalf to reach a satisfactory solution to these talks because we believe that with the present economic situation we must have some order in the management of our national affairs. Agreement on moderate wage increases would enable further progress towards the maintenance and creation of employment. Our objective as a Government is full employment and that is extremely important from the point of view of the country.  It is important that we make use of the asset of having a youthful work force.  Moderate wage agreements will go a long way towards overcoming the considerable economic problems ahead of us.  It would give us a sound base and the desired stability on which to chart our way through whatever storms may lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to my responsibility for Public Service and the pay cost which are a direct charge on the Exchequer.  This year's budget provision of £1,487,000 for these costs represents an increase of more than 28 per cent on last year.  The size of the increase in the bill for the public service and indeed the effect on the finances of the Exchequer are matters of very serious concern in the face of the economic difficulties with which we are faced.  I am concerned at the number of claims which are being <Col N="2486" /> made for special pay increases in the public sector.  All of these groups have received in full the general increases under the national pay agreements and almost all of them have received in addition special pay increases within the last year or so.  When it is realised that such groups enjoy relatively sheltered employment it is not unreasonable of the tax-payers and the Government on their behalf to have a serious view of those claims.  I would ask the staff concerned to bear in mind the over-riding need for restraint in pay demands and to temper their expectations.</P>
    <P>When considering the question of pay policy in the public sector one must have regard to the features which distinguish it from the private sector.  First, it employs about a quarter of the total work force of the country.  Second, it is relatively free of the constraints of the market place in that some or all of its costs fall on the taxpayer.  Third, it provides a bewildering range of services in locations all over the country.  This gives rise to unique problems in the area of pay determination.  There must be a general acceptance of a system of determining pay rises which will be fair to staff in the huge variety of public service jobs and will provide adequate incentive for performance and efficiency and which, at the same time, will be in line with the national policy and with what the economy can afford.  To achieve and to operate such a system in a reasonable way requires an element of co-ordination by central Government.  Otherwise specific groups could achieve levels of pay not as a result of fair comparisons but because of their superior bargaining position that companies in the competitive sector could not match and stay in business.  The perceived inequity of such an outcome could only result in resentment and a sense of grievance leading to industrial unrest among their less well placed colleagues and to unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have heard some speakers during the past few days commenting on the commitment of the National Coalition to various reforms, various areas of <Col N="2487" /> progress.  The commitment might have been there on paper but certainly there was no real positive commitment of a financial or practical nature.  We heard about it; we read more about it.  But nothing positive or practical was achieved.  A positive example of the way in which we are adapting our institutions is the setting up of an ombudsman service.  The Bill for this passed through the House recently.  It will give effect to the recommendations of the all-party committee and represents a most significant milestone in the development of the relationship between the public, the Oireachtas and the public service administration. The development of that relationship is extremely important in our modern circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention also the importance of mobility in the higher levels of the civil service.  My commitment there is complete.  The need for greater mobility is accepted by all.  I look forward to rapid progress being made inachieving this important objective.  In this House last week the leader of an Opposition party made references to the necessity to impose a solution to this problem.  I do not share that approach. As I said, my commitment is complete. But he knows as well as anybody that there is a need for discussion and consultation in getting agreement on a subject such as this and I look forward to meaningful negotiations, useful progress being made by all sides in achieving the necessary mobility to which I refer, not just for the sake of that mobility, but to develop the public administration along lines that will make that development more suitable, more adequate to the changing needs of our society.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I would like to refer to briefly.  Yesterday morning I listened with some interest to part of the speech of the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy FitzGerald.  Not for the first time in this House he made certain innuendoes, implied certain things.  It is very hard to know what he meant.  As usual he was not saying anything concrete or positive that one could investigate, that one could understand.  I say to Deputy <Col N="2488" /> FitzGerald that he should come out from his hiding place behind these innuendoes about interference in the public service in some areas.  Let him come out from his hiding place.  I challenge him to come in here to this house and to say specifically a name or bring to my attention any complaints he has and he can rest assured that I will have them investigated and will have action taken on them.  But I do not believe he can do that.  I believe he will come back again with innuendoes in an attempt to tarnish the reputation and the integrity of this Government.  My integrity as a member of the Government is as valuable to me as is the integrity of any other Member of this House.  I can and will defend that integrity. Deputy FitzGerald's game is the oldest and lowest game in politics.  It is one that has been used for so long by so many simply because the people playing this game had no policies which could be exposed or explained.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has positive complaints or proof of any mismanagement or wrongdoing, I can assure him that they will have my full attention.  If he produces the facts to back up his charges, they will be investigated and action taken on them.  In the meantime, I remind him that while he is busy indulging in those attempts&mdash;which, as I said, are the lowest of all political forms of leadership&mdash;to tarnish the reputation and integrity of this Government, he should first look behind him, look over his shoulders at his own benches for examples of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This would be a good opportunity to talk a little of my own experiences as some sort of a help to Deputies of all parties who wonder about the developments which have taken place in our democracy in my time and, of course, before my time.  Recently, at the ceremony to commemorate W. T. Cosgrave, references were made to the remarkable achievements of that little man, in so far as he moved out from the dreadful civil war period into this House. It was his job, from very tenuous raw material, mostly of dreadful hatred and all the consequences of an internecine struggle, to build up a democratic society.  With the help of the other parties, eventually a parliament was created and the Houses of the Oireachtas came into existence.</P>
      <P>An attempt was made to retain a kind of democracy which is unique in western Europe, with wonderful freedoms.  With all its faults&mdash;and we all know it has its faults&mdash;the 1937 Constitution provided many safeguards; there was the proposal that members should simply meet here and, as Deputies, decide on the election of a chairman, and little further instruction to parliament beyond that.  Since that time, of course, great changes have taken place.  We have had the evolution of parties and, with the evolution of the three main parties, I suggest a progressive erosion of liberties.  There is no doubt that the democratic idea of free debate and discussion is a very challenging one and, to the fearful, a very threatening one.  I should like to refer&mdash;and I think it would be in order on the Taoiseach's debate&mdash;to what are the progressive moves away from democracy which I, anyway, have noticed over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the election of the Taoiseach, I expressed my grave fears that there might be an even more noticeable erosion of those liberties under his leadership.  I have seen the change from the situation where individual Deputies could move motions and where individual Deputies could move Bills.  I believe that this is a very healthy position, from the point of view that one could not, as a small party, <Col N="2490" /> small group, or individual, expect to have ideas accepted or pass laws, although this did happen on occasians&mdash;my colleague, Deputy Jack McQuillan, did succeed in having one Bill passed in the House.  This is now quite unthinkable, because of restrictions imposed on all parties by agreement within the parties on the rights of individual Deputies.</P>
    <P>Recently, I was unable to have a subject of great seriousness and importance even debated in this House because of the limitations on the number of Deputies required in order to have a debate.  That is something which the Deputies should consider from time to time and, as I said, wonder as to whether they are happy with this development. The limitations of the penalties imposed on Deputies, the appalling Pavlovian punishment and reward stimuli to which each Deputy is subjected by party whips and by the incentive of office at some later period in some later Government, have greatly restricted discussions and debate and driven discussion, debate and the democratic idea back into the party rooms or to the party caucuses.  The place is a lesser place for that.</P>
    <P>I am not native enough to believe that one can live in a state of anarchy, with no suggestion of any kind of overall control or agreement on ideas for legislation or laws.  At the same time I have noticed in recent months the attenuation of freedom of debate and discussion, liberty to debate and discuss sometimes ideas which are not acceptable to most of the Deputies but which, at the same time, are ideas which are acceptable throughout the rest of the world.  While I accept that in relation to motions and Bills, there is nothing very much that one can do except lament the passing of freedom.  There was one procedure in this House which I valued above all others.  All Deputies valued it greatly.  It is the whole idea of parliamentary questions. As a Minister I recall my apprehension coming into the House for parliamentary questions because I never knew what would be asked; nobody does.  Parliamentary questions are a <Col N="2491" /> remarkable process which no manager of a manufacturing industry has to go through weekly on the day-to-day workings of a company.  It is a remarkable phenomenon.  Every Department can be asked to account for themselves.  They can be asked the number of Christmas cards sent out and about the amount of money to be spent on a multi-million pounds hydro-electric scheme.  I have always greatly admired the fact that this phenomenon exists.  It is one of the features of parliament which makes it more worthwhile to be there, this day to day control of the Executive by the ordinary people because we of course represent the ordinary people.  We have the right of access to the doings of the people that we put into the Executive and people such as the Taoiseach, the leader and Prime Minister of the country.</P>
    <P>Recently I attempted to ask questions on an issue of grave importance which I realise is of great sensitivity.  I want to make my position clear.  I was not seeking to make trouble.  I was deeply shocked by what I had read which was a grave assault on the integrity of certain Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the process of parliament recognises the separate individual position of each Deputy and each of us must conduct ourselves according to our lights as to the proper behaviour of a Deputy representing the public.  I take Deputy Cluskey's point that we have discussed it to some extent but I am very surprised that a limitation has been accepted by the leader of the Opposition and to a lesser extent by the leader of the Labour Party, in this debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate where it has been traditional to debate the various matters that come <Col N="2492" /> before us during the session.  I take Deputy Cluskey's point that there should not be a re-trial once somebody has been tried and found innocent.  I would be the last to believe that this was a desirable process or a permissible one. I submit that there is one very important complicated factor here.  I am not concerned by what <i>Magill</i> says for my own reasons, but about what has been said about us in this House and about our behaviour in this House.  This is something that we have a right to consider. Was this rightly attributed to this man?  This man's reputation is at stake also.</P>

      <P>The Chair is telling Deputy Browne not to proceed on those lines.  This House is not a court of law and I sincerely hope that if even Deputy Browne is put into the dock in this House there will be somebody in the Chair to protect his rights the same as every other Member's rights in the House.  I am asking Deputy Browne not to continue on those lines.  The Deputy has half an hour to deal with a very full and wide debate.  Every other Member of the House has obeyed the ruling of the Chair.</P>

      <P>We will examine the Government's performance during that period.  The Opposition leaders, Deputies FitzGerald and Cluskey, directed most of their criticisms at the performance of the Government since the present Taoiseach took office, and particularly at the Taoiseach himself.  I do not mind criticism, and I am sure the Taoiseach does not mind criticism, but what we were subjected to here yesterday and again tonight was to a large extent a personal attack on the Taoiseach, which was unbecoming of the leaders of the Opposition, and was used by them as an attempt to divert attention from the real achievements of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>It is a well recognised debating ploy to throw up a smokescreen in an effort to divert attention and to cloud issues at a time when you have no answer to the known performance and achievements of the Government.  The opposition have clearly shown in their contributions to this Adjournment Debate that they have no alternative policies to offer to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>In stark contrast to the lack of cohesion and direction in the Opposition's approach, the Taoiseach and his Government have given the people practical, effective and decisive management of our economic affairs at this difficult time.  In the short time available it would not be possible to list the many worthwhile achievements of this Government. I will confine myself to the areas for which I have direct responsibility.</P>
      <P>In the budget we recognise that circumstances at that time were difficult. The pre-budget prophets of doom predicted disaster.  After the budget Opposition Members were speechless, then and since, on the whole subject of social welfare increases and taxation improvements. They have remained deafeningly silent on this subject, preferring to theorise and postulate on the future.  Old age pensioners, widows and other long term beneficiaries received a 25 per cent increase in their benefits.  The unemployed and disability benefits went up by 20 per cent.  From 1 July children's allowances will be increased by 28 per cent.  The Government, therefore, have clearly honoured their commitment to protect the weaker sections of society.</P>
      <P>Looking at taxation, 83,000 people, those in greatest need of relief, were removed from the tax net&mdash;8,000 of them are pensioners.  The married mother working at home for the first time got recognition in the tax band allowances and so did the working wife. This is real social change and redistribution of resources.  It is beginning right now as the new tax free allowances are coming into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can Deputies Cluskey and FitzGerald deny these real practical improvements in the distribution of wealth, achieved at a time of great economic difficulty, when we are rightly committing our greatest resources to the most fundamental of social objectives, the creation of new <Col N="2510" /> jobs and the maintenance of those under threat?</P>
    <P>Turning particularly to the health services, we are dealing with one of the major sectors of public activity in the country. Indeed, the Health Vote is the biggest single category in our Exchequer requirements.  As Minister for Health I recognise that if we are to have health services to meet the needs of the people we must be willing to spend money on them.  Since 1977, and indeed in all earlier periods when Fianna Fáil have been in office, we have not been slow to give the money needed to provide a good health system.  Practically all major developments in the health services have taken place when we have been in office. The total expenditure on health services in 1977 was £344 million.  In 1980 we are spending £688 million, double the level of expenditure of 1977.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous improve ments in recent times in the hospital services. Eligibility levels have been raised to £7,000.  The entire population are now entitled to free hospital services.  Those who are over the £7,000 limit pay only consultants' fees and the effective means to deal with that are through the VHI scheme.  The drugs refund scheme has been extended to the entire population. Expenses greater than £8 per month are refunded.</P>
    <P>We have a huge hospital development programme in progress costing £28 million this year.  In all, 304 projects are involved in the programme.  Building is in progress in 91 projects, planning in 160 projects, 50 per cent of which are at an advanced stage, and 36 projects were completed recently.  Despite economic difficulties real progress is being made in this area.</P>
    <P>Today I circulated the new Mental Health Bill which will repeal existing legislation and bring us into line with modern thinking.  I have circulated the Bill at this stage to give Members of the Oireachtas time to consider the Bill at length before the autumn.</P>

      <P>Time is limited because of the unruly behaviour of the Opposition and I will have to omit some of what I was going to say and go to one of the major points I want to make.  We are particularly concerned about the position of the disabled.</P>
      <P>I am glad to announce in the House this evening that I am setting up a National Committee for the Year of the Disabled.  The United Nations Organisation had designated 1981 as the International Year for Disabled Persons and has requested each member state to establish a national steering committee to co-ordinate and encourage activities for the disabled during that year.  I have now appointed a committee for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the committee will be Mr. Joe Malone, Director General of An Bord Fáilte.  The other members of the committee are as follows:&mdash; Brother Alfred, Director of the Brothers of Charity Centre for the Mentally Handicapped, Kilcornan, County Galway, Miss Anne Foley, Department of Labour and Honorary Secretary of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, The Hon.  Lady Valerie Goulding, Senator, Chairman and formerly Managing Director of the Central Remedial Clinic in Dublin, the Reverend Canon Hugh Gray, St. Peter's Rectory, Mountrath, and member of the management committee of the Rehabilitation Institute, Mr. Desmond Kenny, Secretary, Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped, Mr. P. H. Moloney, Executive Director, St. Michael's House, P. O Maitiú, Uasal, Special Education Branch, Department of Education, Eamonn O Murchú, Uasal, national teacher, Dr. Chantal McNamara, general practitioner, Waterford and Dr. Joseph Robins, Department of Health. The Secretary to the Committee will be Mr. Paul Barron, Department of Health. Members of the National Committee are appointed in their personal capacities and not as representatives of any particular organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these measures I am also appointing an advisory council representative of the various interests in <Col N="2512" /> the field of the disabled as well as more broadly based groups.  I shall announce details of the membership of this advisory council shortly.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to the International Year for the Disabled.  I look forward, with the full support of the Government, to making a significant contribution to the disabled during that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It is generally accepted that our economy is in a very bad state.  It is accepted, I think, by most commentators that never before was our economy in such a shambles.  We had a new Taoiseach elected some months ago.  After quite a build-up about television and radio appearances, the Taoiseach appeared on television.  On that occasion the country in general expected from him a state of the nation speech.  The electorate expected some guidance, some suggested solutions to the problems we all knew existed.  What happened?  We had the problems spelled out in the greatest detail, problems we all knew existed, about which none of us had to be told.  But sadly lacking from that speech on that occasion, or indeed from any speech the Taoiseach has made since, was any solution or any suggestions as to a solution.  The only idea the Taoiseach seemed to put before the people was that in general they should tighten their belts, that they should forego their rights and really sacrifice everything in the interests of the country. I am afraid that attitude is necessary; I am afraid we do need a tightening of the belts.  We do need our people to practise economic patriotism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time like this it is necessary that we have leadership of the strongest and most respected character.  It is essential that at this time we have in office a Government which has the respect of our people, a Taoiseach who has the respect of every Member of Dáil <Col N="2513" /> Éireann, particularly every member of his own party.  Indeed, it is necessary that we have in government, a party who, while in Opposition, preached the same economic patriotism as the Taoiseach is preaching today.  It is necessary that we have a Government seen to be consistent, that we have people leading this country who fought the last general election on the basis of reality, not a Government which, while they were in Opposition, told the people there were no difficulties, that there was no need for belt tightening, that all they had to do was to vote themselves a better time and, if they voted Fianna Fáil into power, all of their difficulties would be over.  It is hard to expect the ordinary plain people of this country to listen to a Government who, while in Opposition, said there were no problems, who were elected to government on a manifesto that seemed to contain the solutions to everything.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to expect the plain people of this country to accede to the request of a Government led by a Taoiseach who stands discredited before the electorate and the people of this world in the public press.  How, I ask, can the people of this country be expected to follow the leadership of a Government led by a Taoiseach who, with a number of his Ministers, stands discredited&mdash;I will say it&mdash;in the <i>Magill</i> magazine, that has been published here and is serialising an episode which projects the present Taoiseach and a number of his Ministers in government as very doubtful characters, as people who have blotted their copybooks, as people who are not worthy of the confidence of the electorate. That is the state in which this country finds itself at present.</P>

Surely I am entitled to make the case that I think it is particularly unfortunate for this country of ours that we have a man and a Government in power making this appeal to the country in the national newspapers while those same people are being criticised in the clearest fashion in another magazine whose circulation has increased enormously as a result of the publication, and that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not normally share the views of Deputy Noel Browne and I am on record here and in Seanad Éireann as saying that I disagree with him.  I stand up here in defence of the right of every Member of this House to raise on an Adjournment Debate matters that are relevant. It is because I believe that a Member of this House, Deputy Browne, has been wrongly deprived of his right to <Col N="2517" /> speak that I have been forced to adopt this attitude.  If anybody is to blame, I regret that it is the present occupant of the Chair.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in this very sorry three days at Leinster House.  I do not think any Member of the House is happy with what went on here for the last few days culminating tonight in Deputy Browne being suspended from the House because he sought to raise during the debate something which the Chair has been consistently ruling for the past two days could not be raised in the debate. As a consequence of that and in an effort to raise a number of points of order the Leader of the Labour Party withdrew his <Col N="2520" /> party from the House so that there is no concluding speaker from that party to this important debate on the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Last week when this party had a motion down on the economy to be debated in Private Members' Time the Chair ruled it out of order because he said it anticipated the Adjournment Debate.  I questioned that ruling on 17 June at column 795 of volume 322 of the Official Report on the basis that if your ruling held, nothing could be debated between the time you made the ruling and the Adjournment Debate.  I asked the Chair:</P>
      <P>Can a Deputy not speak on any subject he wishes on an Adjournment Debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct, and on the matter that the Deputy proposes to raise tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything can be debated and that means that anything that comes up between now and then could be ruled out of order for debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with precedent, yes.</P>
      <P>The Chair's ruling was, in his own words, that anything could be debated during an Adjournment Debate.  I do not want to go into the merits or demerits of the magazine or the article in it about which the Chair ruled.  I do not know if what was said in it is true or not.  Some Members of the House obviously do know whether it is or not.  I do not intend to bring the subject of that matter before the House tonight.  What I am bringing before the House, regretfully&mdash;I want to assure the Chair that it is nothing personal against him&mdash;is the ruling of the Chair in this matter.  That ruling now becomes a precedent of the House so that in future the Chair can choose to rule out from an Adjournment Debate a particular subject for some reason even though the traditions of the House and all the precedents are that any matter can be debated on an Adjournment Debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that Deputy Barry is taking this in the right spirit.  The Chair would say at this stage that serious allegations against any Member of the House cannot, would not and were never allowed to be raised casually on a debate of this kind.  They could only be brought to the House on a formal motion against that Member. That has been the ruling of the House down the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go on challenging the rulings of the Chair but obviously the Chair could not know whether serious allegations about misconduct óf Members of the House were being made until the words had been spoken.  At no stage did you allow the proceedings to get to the stage where actual allegations were made.  It is unfortunate that the tradition that on the Adjournment Debate, on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach, the weaknesses of any member of the Government could be exposed by members of the Opposition and, indeed, members of the Government were free to hit back at members of the Opposition during that debate, is being broken.</P>
      <P>A new precedent has been established that there is control on an Adjournment Debate.  The ordinary rules of good conduct must apply at all times.  Deputies should be careful about what they say to one another.  They should be careful not to make charges in the House, although the law of privilege allows them to do so. They should use that very sparingly and carefully.  I cannot accept that on an Adjournment Debate a ruling such as the Chair gave yesterday could hold or should be treated as a precedent in this regard.  It is serious for the House.  I shall leave it at that but when we come back or during the recess, in a calmer and cooler atmosphere, we shall have to look more deeply into that ruling because it is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Chair would not wish nor would any Member of the House wish to see another Member attacked here.  We must maintain that, if this is a democratic assembly elected by the people, we will have the traditional right, the historic right and the right by precedent to speak on any matter we choose on the Adjournment Debate.  If it is a debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach obviously if we feel that the holder of that office or any TD appointed to hold office under him in that Government is open to attack, he will be attacked by the Opposition. That has always been the tradition and will continue to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now move on to the debate and what has been said in it.  This is an Adjournment Debate and, after the first six months since the Leader of the Government changed, it is quite obvious to everyone that even though the Leader and certain personnel in the Government have changed we still have the same irresponsible Fianna Fáil Party with the same irresponsible policies that three years ago did such damage to the economy.  Anybody present at another Adjournment Debate, or who looks at the record when Deputy Lynch was Taoiseach, in December 1977, would see that the then Taoiseach listed a number of pluses in the economy: increasing exports, falling inflation, increasing numbers of people at work, balance of payments <Col N="2523" /> under control and the level of borrowing brought down.  He referred to those as being a sound basis on which to build.  This sound basis which he correctly said was a good base on which to build future growth in the economy was as a result of the policies patiently and prudently pursued during the latter half of 1975, 1976 and the first half of 1977.  These were following through to the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Government during the first six months when Deputy Lynch was Taoiseach. Anyone looking at the same economy now would find it difficult to recognise the sound economy we handed over in July 1977.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that the prime cause of the present difficulties in the economy was the increase in the price of oil over the last 18 months.  We pointed out on numerous occasions the damage such an increase can do to the economy.  The first such waves shook our economy in 1973-74 and the National Coalition have gone through all the monitoring of methods to counteract that damage.  It was irresponsible and reprehensible of Fianna Fáil in their manifesto and election campaign of 1977 to go ahead and gamble with the jobs of our people in the manner they did.  They are now reaping the reward for their actions, their policies and their performance at that time.</P>
    <P>We now have an inflation rate of 20 per cent and our unemployment is the highest for five years.  The business sector get an attack of the jitters if they look into the future because they see so many things they will not be able to deal with. We will have to depend more on the private sector to act as the engine to pull this economy out of the slump into which it is now slipping.  The budget in 1979, and this year, seriously damaged our second major industry, tourism.  We have a balance of payments deficit of £750 million and an oil import bill running up to £800 million.  Our growth in exports&mdash;thankfully there is some growth&mdash;is slowing down and our No. 1 industry, agriculture, is reeling under a series of body blows and a lack of attention <Col N="2524" /> and concern over the last two and a half years.</P>
    <P>Members of my party who come from rural constituencies have told me that they have never known the farming community to be so depressed, fearful for the future and lacking in confidence as to what they should do or what the Government are willing to do to help them get out of their difficulties.  We also have the frightening series of redundancies that have been occurring in almost every industry daily since the beginning of the year.  The Taoiseach has told us that the problems we are facing are budget and balance of payments deficits, excessive borrowing and high inflation. At 20.2 per cent for the last 12 months our inflation is certainly amongst the highest, if not the highest, in EEC and OECD countries.  The figure for mid-February to mid-May of 7.4 per cent is certainly one of the highest.  The Taoiseach was hopeful that this level of inflation was at a peak.  Why is it so high?  That is a mystery to Members on this side of the House, to economists and those concerned with such matters outside the House.  It has been obvious for the last 18 months that with the pressure amongst OPEC members for an increase in the price of oil, the turbulent situation in Iran and the strike in the oilfields there, that the world would be short of oil resulting in internal pressure on OPEC members to push up the prices. In spite of that being known in mid-1978 the Government in their budget of 1979 did not take any account of what was likely to happen during that year.  They did not take any account of what the rest of the world saw as an inevitable hike in oil prices.  Indeed, some of the price rises had taken place by the time the budget was introduced.  The Government did not do anything to try to counteract those inflationary pressures.  In fact, they did worse.  In the same month they introduced the budget in 1979, they twisted up inflation by removing the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>From January 1979 when the budget was introduced and the food subsidies were removed our economy which was <Col N="2525" /> going forward in growth&mdash;we had left it with the strength the previous Taoiseach spoke of&mdash;started to have problems. Most other countries foresaw, catered for and took steps to alleviate the effects of the obvious inflation on their economies.  Inflation translates itself into non-competitiveness, into loss of jobs, into bigger budget deficits for government and into a sorry mess like our economy is in.  Even up to the middle of last year Ministers were still talking about a 5 per cent end of year inflation. When that phrase was trotted out first in February 1978 it took some time to discover exactly what was meant by 5 per cent end of year inflation.  Eventually, it was admitted by the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development that what was involved was an expectation that between August and November 1979 inflation would be at the rate of 1.25 per cent and if one multiplies that by four one got 5 per cent.  Therefore, one had an end of year inflation rate of 5 per cent.  It may be that that is a legitimate enough method of calculating inflation but if we apply the same method of calculation to the last quarter for which we have figures, February to May 1980, when the increase in the consumer price index for that quarter is 7.4 per cent, the mid-1980 rate of inflation is 29.6 per cent, using the same method of calculation that was employed by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Minister for Finance 12 months ago, presumably with the concurrence of all the members of the Government of which the present Minister for Finance was a member. Deputy FitzGerald, on the morning of the budget of this year, said that the effect of the budget increases would be to put the yearly level of inflation up to nearly 20 per cent.  On that day the Taoiseach scoffed at the idea; he said it was nonsense, that the budget was only responsible for a 3.8 per cent price increase and it was ridiculous of Deputy FitzGerald to say that it would push the rate of inflation up to over 20 per cent. But we saw last week when the figures were published who was right and who was wrong.  Deputy FitzGerald was <Col N="2526" /> right.  In fact he underestimated what the effect would be.  He said it would be something over 6 per cent; it turned out to be 7.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Regretfully we are still not finished with the inflationary effects of the budget.  Until the end of this year they will be working their way through the economy because many of the damaging measures in that budget as they affected costs in industry have still not been fed out as far as the consumer.  So we can look forward, for at least another quarter and maybe two quarters, to the effects of the budget on the consumer price index. This was foreseeable.  There were enough inflationary pressures being imported into this country due to the price of oil. Nobody denies that the increase in oil prices over the last eighteen months was serious for the economy.  Nobody denies that they had an effect on inflation and consequently on our competitive position. But what the Government will not admit is the damage they did in adding to that inflation by putting taxes on oil products which had a further serious effect on the economy.  Yesterday the Taoiseach referred to the worldwide damage that was done to the economies of every country by the increase in oil prices.  That is true.  Every country importing oil had to pay this increased price.  But every country in Europe except Ireland took steps to protect their economy from the effects of those increases and the action of the Irish Government was not to minimse the damage being done to the economy but, by adding further tax, to multiply it. That is the primary reason why the economy here is, to put it no stronger, in such a worrying condition at the moment.</P>
    <P>If one is to read between the lines there is much exhortation in the Taoiseach's speech.  He has made three or four speeches on the economy since he took over the office of Taoiseach and every one of them was strong on setting out what is wrong with the economy. Everybody in this House and, indeed, people outside this House are well aware <Col N="2527" /> of what is wrong with the economy.  But the speeches were very short on solutions to deal with the problems.  The Taoiseach listed the problems himself: the balance of payments deficit, the current budget deficit, excessive borrowing and a high rate of inflation.  If there is any clue as to how he intends to deal with the problems it is in the fact that he twice said that he would not deflate the economy and will protect the less well off sections of our community.  But the budget is deflationary.  The cuts in the capital programme are deflationary because they do not provide the same funds in real terms as were provided last year in the infrastructure sector and other sectors.  Therefore one must presume that if he is not going to deflate the economy there is some method by which he is going to at least keep the country ticking over.  This cannot be done on the amount of money available for the capital programme for the balance of this year.  The alternative is that he is going to inflate the economy.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister for Finance is speaking later on he will let us know what that solution is because I suspect that what the Government are going to do is abandon their borrowing target, that, come the end of this year, on the basis of a real or indicated show of oil from the drillings at present going on off the west coast&mdash;even though it is doubtful from the evidence that will be available this year that such a course of action will be justified&mdash;they are going to abandon the borrowing ceiling imposed by themselves in the budget.  If they do this and bring in more funds that will certainly help to bring about an improvement in the economy.  But the Government must remember that if they do that&mdash;and it applies equally to their excessive borrowing for the last three years&mdash;they are deliberately adding to inflation in the coming years.  That is what will happen; there will be a permanent topping up of inflation if they abandon their borrowing targets for 1980.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister deny or confirm that.  Further borrowing will add to the inflationary <Col N="2528" /> problems of the next Government of this country so that when we are over there I will be reminding whoever is standing here that part of the inflation is due to the fact that in 1980 Fianna Fáil deliberately abandoned borrowing targets.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the appalling lack of confidence which has gripped our business sector in the last few months should be of great concern to the Government and, indeed, to all of us.  Inflation affects our competitiveness which, in turn, affects our employment levels.  Any Deputy in this House would agree that the number one priority for any Government in this House, given the age structure of our population, for the next 20 years, at least, must be creation of jobs to cater for an expanding young population.  We cannot do that unless we also create the climate in which the people who make investments continue to do so to allow these jobs to be created. This Government have failed to do that by deliberately adding to the inflation rate by their Budget and by deliberately putting extra costs on the very people that they are, at the same time, imploring to export more, be more competitive, make more investment to create more jobs.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Confederation of Irish Industries published a report six weeks ago in which they list the four biggest hindrances to expansion of business and investment at the moment. One of those was the duty put on what are called &ldquo;other oils&rdquo; in the last budget. There is no doubt that this is the cause of many of the present redundancies.  It was represented by some speakers during the Budget debate and the debate on the Finance Bill as being a conservation measure.  It is not.  It is a cost on industry and is a cost that only businesses in this country have to bear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The people with whom we are competing, whether in the United Kingdom, Germany, France or any other country, have not to bear this tax. <Col N="2529" /> Not alone is this tax affecting us when we try to get a market in France against our British competitors, but it is affecting us in the United Kingdom when we try to export our goods there.  Most tragically, it is affecting us here at home when we try to fight off imports.  It has been listed, by the people who should know, as one of the four serious, damaging influences on business at the moment.</P>
      <P>Damaging as the budget's effect was on business, what is equally damaging at the moment is the restriction on credit.  I must say a word about the announcement made last night by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  I am delighted with this announcement, which heralds benefit to business and certain help to many industries which find that they cannot stay in business if they have to pay 20 per cent interest on loans. These people cannot borrow abroad, because the Government will not underwrite the exchange loss on any such borrowing.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced a £15 million Deutschmark loan, to be administered through the Industrial Credit Company. The details are not apparent, except that the maximum which any one firm can get is £¼ million, or half of their capital. The ICC may have enlightened business people today as to the other conditions attaching to this loan.  I hope it will not be a replacement for a normal bank overdraft.  The position would in that case be no better, except of course, to the extent that the money would be at a smaller rate of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This money should be available on top of their normal overdraft.  It should not necessarily be for capital purposes, for the building up of plant or machinery, but for normal working capital, to finance stock, because at the moment, due to inflation they must find that much extra capital to buy in stocks.  They are paying very high interest rates for that capital.  Their creditors are squeezing them as much as possible because they have exactly the same problem, whereas their debtors are doing the reverse, trying <Col N="2530" /> to extend their credit.  They have the problem with banks as well.  There should be as few conditions as possible attached to the granting of this money to businesses.  It should be for ordinary working capital, as long as conditions of repayment are adhered to or agreed to. It should be left to individual businesses as to what use they put the money to.</P>
    <P>It has not been made clear whether this money has been restricted to manufacturing businesses, but there are two other sectors which should be involved. Inflation affects the distributive trades and the tourist industry just as much as it affects manufacturing industry. Even allowing that the distributive trades take advantage of this, it would be of benefit to manufacturing industry because a lot of problems with manufacturing industry arise from the fact that with the depressed state of business the distributive trades find it difficult to pay for supplies.  The trades find it difficult to dispose of goods and consequently are unable to pay the manufacturers. The vicious circle is affecting everybody in business.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that this loan be available, not alone to the manufacturing business but to the distributive trades and, particularly, to the tourist industry, which perhaps more than any other industry has been damaged by this Government in the last two years.</P>
    <P>When we came into office in 1973, tourism had been on a steady decline for a number of years prior to that.  In every single year that we were in Government, the value of tourism increased and that trend continued into 1977-78.  Last year was the first time tourism started to falter in that growth, specifically due to the actions, or non-actions, of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government last year, in their pig-headedness over the postal strike and the ostrich-like behaviour of the Minister for Energy&mdash;as he was at the time&mdash;Deputy O'Malley, over the petrol situation.  This had serious and damaging effects on what is usually referred to as our second major industry.  Not content with that, knowing that tourism needed a shot in <Col N="2531" /> the arm, a fillip to help them get back on the growth pattern again, this year's budget provided the final knock-out blow to tourism.  Indeed, the increase in the price of drink, cigarettes and particularly petrol appears to have escaped the attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>The areas that benefit most from tourism are those areas where industry is least likely to be established. Therefore every Government must be continually sensitive to the needs of tourism and to the beneficial effect to the economy of ensuring that we have a healthy tourist industry that encourages people to go to the remote parts of the country.  This Government have done the reverse.  They have made it more expensive to get to the remote parts of the country by adding on 20 pence a gallon to the price of petrol.  Our prices for beer, spirits and petrol are now notably different from the price of the same commodities in our prime tourist market, the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>There is another indication of the damage this budget has done to the economy.  In this morning's papers there is a report of the Irish Distillers Group's annual general meeting in which the chairman said that as a result of the penal taxes imposed by the budget they would have to postpone capital investment until trade improved.  The chairman said that unless trade got better their work force would be put on short time in the autumn.  That is a direct consequence of the budget, vouched for by the chairman of one of our most profitable companies.  As a result of the budget, investment has been postponed significantly.  Anyone who makes an investment makes it in the hope that he will see a return on the investment over the years.  If one runs a huge factory or a backroom craft somebody is employed but if the investment is not made the jobs will not be there.  As late as this morning there was evidence in the papers that precisely what we said last February is now happening.  We said that the budget would damage the economy and particularly tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2532" /> It is still not too late if the Government have the will, to make funds available to remedy some of the harm that is being done to tourism.  It is necessary to immediately give promotional funds to Bord Fáilte and that they employ all their staff in hunting up business in the United Kingdom but also on the mainland of Europe and in America.  This must be done not through the normal process of discussion and inter-Departmental briefings.  If the red tape is cut the Minister for Tourism, if he is interested, could direct the Minister for Finance and the Government to make funds available immediately.  Then some of the damage done to the tourist industry could be undone in the latter half of this year.  It is very important that the Government have an appreciation of the value of tourism.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see why the Government should have added to the price increase already imposed on oil products by the OPEC countries.  It is easy to see that the damage being done by OPEC is sufficient without our Government doubling what the OPEC countries have done.</P>
    <P>I praise the Tánaiste who since he changed Ministries has been very active in the energy sector.  The Minister has been approaching this in the right way by examining every possibility so as to reduce our dependence on oil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.  The Minister has had the benefit of our document, in fact I suspect, a preview of it.  However, so far it is only talk.  The Minister is saying all the right things, he is making all the right sounds as a start.  The Minister is certainly better than Deputy O'Malley who was doing and saying all the wrong things.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste is doing a lot of talking but we would like to see some action.  I would certainly like to know the Tánaiste's attitude to nuclear energy as he managed to blur this whole <Col N="2533" /> picture since he came to office.  I asked the Minister a question, to which there was a written answer today, if he had seen a report published by Exxon which said that at the turn of the century we would need three nuclear stations here. This report seems to be well put together by a big company and I feel it is authentic. It is about time we faced up to building nuclear stations if they have to be built although I hope they will not have to be built.  There is no point in starting in mid-1995 to plan for nuclear energy because all the other options did not work out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and the Government must firmly decide if the situation in relation to energy here is to be taken care of without resorting to nuclear energy.  If we have not to resort to nuclear energy I would be pleased for two reasons; the first is that like everybody else, I have a fear of what may happen with a nuclear power station and the second is that the cost of three nuclear power stations on an economy like ours would be enormous. If there is no alternative to nuclear power I am willing to accept that rather than see my children without jobs or energy in the period around the turn of the century.  We cannot forever long finger decisions like that in the hope that the electoral disadvantage of making a decision in favour of nuclear energy will not catch up with us. Somebody must say firmly what they believe in this regard.  To give Deputy O'Malley his due he came out firmly, right up to the time he lost responsibility for energy and afterwards, in favour of nuclear energy.  The Deputy may be wrong but he at least had the courage to say what he believed to be the solution to the problem of energy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing I wish to say about the energy situation and again it relates to this morning's papers and the accounts of the Dublin Gas Consumers' <Col N="2534" /> Company reproduced there.  There appears to be an impression that providing natural gas to that company would be the salvation of the company.  That may well be right if they get the gas at a price that is very much below the oil equivalent price.  As I understand the policy of An Bord Gáis&mdash;and I believe it is the policy of the Government as relayed to them&mdash;they are to sell natural gas at an oil equivalent price.  I have no way of knowing whether it is true but I understand that it is on that basis that they are negotiating with the Cork Gas Consumers Company at present.  I do not know what benefit natural gas at an oil equivalent price would be to the Dublin Gas Company if their energy bill is to be the same at the end of the day&mdash;there are much more fundamental problems to be tackled in that company&mdash;unless the Government decide rather than give continuous subsidies or hand-outs to give them natural gas at a price that is only 25 or 30 per cent of the oil equivalent price.  We have not been told by the Minister for Energy or the Government what is their policy in this regard.  The Dublin Gas Company, judging by the remarks of their chairman and members of the staff one meets occasionally, are under the impression that if given the gas they will get it at a price much below the market price that will allow them to compete with other forms of energy.  I should like the Minister to clear up that point.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a word about agriculture and the announcement by the Taoiseach in his speech yesterday that the resource tax would be removed at the end of the year.  This is a tax imposed at an unfortunate time on a sector of industry&mdash;because agriculture is an industry&mdash;that has been most unfortunate in the past two years.  It was insensitive of the Government to think that without any examination of a persons' ability to pay he should pay £3.50 in the £ on rateable valuation over a certain figure. Having done that and arranged to collect the moneys this year the Taoiseach said in his budget speech that this was intended to be only a temporary tax.  Now he has said that at the end of the year it will <Col N="2535" /> run out and that is the latest explanation of what will happen.  If the Government decided that the resource tax will not operate beyond 1 January 1981, why did the Minister for Finance resist writing that date into the Finance Bill a fortnight or ten days ago?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>Apparently the Minister does not agree with Deputy Kelly.  The Minister was pressed very hard by many rural Deputies here but he refused to put the date 31 December 1980 into that Bill on that occasion.  Yet a fortnight later the Taoiseach comes in here and pulls the rug from under the Minister's feet. He had spent one-and-a-half or two hours defending his stand of not putting in the date and then this happens and the Taoiseach says it will be all over on 1 January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach then pulled the rug from under his feet.  That resource tax was unfortunate and silly but even sillier was the spectacle of the Taoiseach dashing out to Dublin Airport a month ago to welcome back Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, who had come from Brussels with his victory under his arm of 4 per cent. Deputy O'Donoghue, Deputy Calleary and every other Deputy knows that 4 per cent would not go one quarter of the way towards meeting the increase in costs experienced by the agricultural sector in the last 12 months.  You do not fool anybody when you engage in that <Col N="2536" /> kind of publicity stunt.  That is what it was.  The Taoiseach is not fooling anybody when he engages in that kind of publicity.  I would far prefer to see him at the summit in Venice or at the Council of Ministers in Europe telling the British Prime Minister that part of the cause of the common agricultural policy problem of surpluses is the insistence of the British Government and Mrs. Thatcher on special treatment for commonwealth countries.  That is part of the reason for surpluses in the EEC.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Taoiseach reiterate yesterday that they would defend the common agricultural policy because we can say it is the only economic policy that is being followed through in the EEC.  He has plenty of friends in Europe for that and he should count on them and they should not allow themselves to be pushed around with a 4 per cent increase which is totally inadequate to meet the cost increases experienced by farmers not only in this country but in West Germany also where the common agricultural policy is of great benefit.  They should be warned now that this will not do next year and whatever case it is necessary to make, whatever lobbying has to be done between now and next March, should begin immediately to ensure that the price increases that will be negotiated at that time are adequate to restore to our farmers the degree of prosperity they had two years ago.</P>
      <P>We are here six months after a change of Taoiseach, not a change of Government, and we are now on the Adjourment Debate which has been a sorry debate in many ways.  It has been sorry for two reasons, first, because I think it did not do the dignity of the House any good and, secondly, and this is more important, I think it diverted attention from the failures of the Government, from the bubble-bursting we would have gone on with here to expose the myth that is the present Taoiseach and the blunders that are his Cabinet.</P>

      <P>On one matter certainly I can agree with Deputy Barry when he said at <Col N="2537" /> the end of his contribution that the tone and nature of the debate was regrettable and did not reflect any credit on the House.  I suggest that tone was set by the leader of his own party in the very first contribution by the Opposition to this debate.  Of course it is acceptable, valid and proper that one should challenge the Government's capacity for economic management, should charge them with mismanagement, should produce figures on which to base arguments in support. Those arguments I hope to answer effectively. When one adds to that, as Deputy FitzGerald deliberately did, allegations affecting the character and integrity of the Government stating that this Government collectively under the leadership of the Taoiseach were unfit to govern, unsuitable for government, undermining the role of the public service&mdash;I shall deal with that in detail when I come to it at the appropriate time&mdash;one can then see that the Leader of Fine Gael set a tone which, unfortunately, was taken up by many speakers subsequently in the debate leading to the conclusion that Deputy Barry reached that it did not reflect credit on the House.</P>

      <P>I hope my time will not be curtailed as a consequence of Deputy Kelly's interruptions.  The first thing I want to say in relation to economic management is that Deputy FitzGerald opened on a theme &ldquo;I do not propose to follow the Taoiseach in his numerous excursions to the outside world.&rdquo;  In the development of this speech subsequently he charged the Government, the Taoiseach in particular and the Government in general with distortion, implications not only of mismanagement but of misrepresentation of many issues of fact.  I want to say that from the first moment of Deputy FitzGerald's speech he was distorting the reality.  Deputy FitzGerald knows that it is not possible to look at the economic condition of this country in isolation, to attribute all the faults as he did, to Government mismanagement, to attribute everything from high interest rates, as he did, to Government lack of control or, as he put it, taking up the available credit and ignore the reality which exists all around us at this time. Deputy FitzGerald was clearly guilty in that the very things with which he was <Col N="2539" /> charging the Government, the balance of payments deficits, the budget deficits, the level of inflation, the reduction of growth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I was asked to contribute to the winding up of a debate my time was taken up with interruptions.  I hope we will not have the same pattern tonight.  I want to illustrate what I have said by reference to a number of facts.  Many of them are all too obvious in the economic international recession we see at the moment. There is no need for me to repeat them because they are staring us in the face. Those who wish to ignore the reality may do so.  I would like to point to two further examples to illustrate the significance of them in this country at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, oil prices this year will actually increase by something less than £300 million over the cost of oil last year.  That, in real terms, would represent <Col N="2540" /> the amount that would provide 2,000 jobs for our people in infrastructural development this year.  The increase alone over last year would provide that. Some may suggest that we should ignore that reality when that number of jobs are automatically taken by the impact of the oil prices.  That is a very graphic illustration of just how serious that impact is. There is another matter which is only just emerging.  People talk of the level of growth in the OECD countries, which will be well below half of that achieved last year.  Current indications are&mdash;this figure has not yet been stated in Ireland&mdash;that in the second half of this year it is quite likely that the level of output in the OECD area will actually fall by a significant percentage.  We will, in fact, get a negative growth as distinct from what we even have at the moment in the OECD area.  This illustrates that the problems which Deputy FitzGerald would have us ignore as not being realities affecting Ireland are realities affecting every other country in the world.  It is important, therefore, that we make some other comparisons which Deputy FitzGerald in particular will not like to be reminded about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a lot of gobbledegook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the oil price increases have taken place repeatedly over the past two years may have robbed the whole matter of novelty, unfortunately, but it must not blind us to the magnitude and severity of what has happened by comparison with the experience in the middle seventies.  In 1973-74 the price of a barrel of oil rose by about 7½ dollars.  Since the beginning of 1979 the increase has been 19½ dollars, almost three times as much as it was in 1973-74.  The increase in our oil bill in 1974 was £141 million and the increase in 1979 was £180 million.  This year, as I have already indicated, it could be about £300 million.  The increase for the two years combined at £480 million is over three times the 1974 increase, which was the highest increase experienced during the disastrous period of the Coalition <Col N="2541" /> Government.  Deputy FitzGerald went on to imply that because there is such a failure here all the indicators are indicators of gloom and doom in an effort to undermine the confidence of the people, which is so vitally important and, also of course, in an effort to undermine as he saw it, their respect for locally elected Government.</P>
      <P>I want to make some comparisons which will not comfort Deputy FitzGerald.  He stated that the forecast of a fall of 1¼ per cent in investment in 1980, which was contained in the Central Bank's annual report was subsequently revised to 5 per cent.  He inferred that this would turn their estimate of a marginal growth in total output into a decline in output.  Such is not the case. The Deputy will know that even taking what has been recognised to be the relatively pessimistic view of the bank the net effect on output growth of the revision would be far less than he suggests because of the high import content of the investment.  However, in reality the outlook for investment is considerably brighter than even that suggested by the Central Bank.  I would like to indicate that there will be overall growth of a level above that forecast certainly above the very pessimistic presentation which Deputy FitzGerald wants to convey.  When it does come it will follow two years of quite exceptional growth in investment.  The benefit of an investment growth of 15 per cent in real terms in 1978 and 1979 will continue to be seen in the economy this year.  I want to compare that with that of the Government of which Deputy FitzGerald was a member. I am puzzled by his claim that in the last two years in office of that Government investment was rising by 10½ to 12 per cent a year.  The official statistics show that in real terms growth investment fell by 4 per cent in 1975, that it rose by 2½ per cent in 1976 and that the increase in 1977 was 5.75 per cent, this acceleration occurring after the new Government had implemented their proposals to stimulate the economy and to restore confidence in investment.</P>

      <P>I do not know what contribution, if any, Deputy Collins made to this debate but if he did intervene I should hope that the level of his intervention was somewhat higher than the level of those interjections.  In 1979 investment accounted for more than 30 per cent of our GNP and will do so again this year.  That is significant.  The highest level achieved in this respect in any year of the previous Government's duration was just marginally more than 25 per cent.  The level of investment measured as a proportion of GNP and which we have now reached&mdash;regrettably for the people opposite but fortunately for the country&mdash;is the highest in the Community, indeed, one of the highest in the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald suggested that for the first time in two decades we will have failed to maintain the kind of economic growth necessary to compensate for a deterioration in our terms of trade.  In response to his suggestion that we would look for statistics to challenge his statement, I would refer to Table 8 of the current CSO volume which shows that in 1974, the volume of GNP adjusted for terms of trade fell by almost 4 per cent. The same table shows that it was not until 1977 that the real value of GNP adjusted in this way surpassed the level which had been reached even in 1973. So much, then, for the Deputy's allegation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry's statement was incorrect as the priorities we have applied in allocating our public expenditure programme demonstrate clearly.  I recognise that there has been a curb on public expenditure but I note that Fine Gael called for further cuts in public expenditure.  However, wonder of wonders, they failed to indicate where these cuts should be made.  They did say, though, that the cuts should not be made in the areas of either housing or social welfare.  We know that there were no cuts in those areas this year.  We have applied the maximum amount of the increases of the order of 25 and 30 per cent and even more in the areas that we regard as priorities for jobs.</P>
      <P>When the Opposition say that we should reduce our borrowing and effect further expenditure cuts, would they mind telling us also in which areas they would propose that the cuts be made, other than those areas in which cuts have been made already?  Would they indicate also how they would intend to achieve the miracle of cutting the borrowing requirement further than has been the case already?  So far there has not been any indication from them as to how they would achieve these miracles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald implied there was nothing in the budget which has succeeded, that everything that was contained in that budget has caused greater problems than the ones we had before. The priorities that are applied in respect of public expenditure form part of any budget exercise.  The equity in the budget in terms of taxation and social welfare benefits, for instance, has achieved considerable consensus from the public.  I wish to speak about the imbalances in the balance of payments and to remind Deputy FitzGerald that we tackled this question particularly in relation to our borrowing requirement in the context of <Col N="2545" /> reducing the balance of payments deficit. The House will know that the balance of payments deficit has been adjusting.  I indicated at budget time and again since then that in total figures the balance of payments may be of the same order of magnitude as was the case last year.</P>

      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a clear vindication of the strategy I pursued in the budget and of the credit policy that we are pursuing with the approval of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that there is progress in a situation in which there is a deficit that is more or less in line in real terms with the figures for the previous year, especially when one considers that our import bill for oil will have increased to the order of something in the region of £300 million, a £300 million improvement which, apparently, Deputy FitzGerald would wish were not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to illustrate further how that improvement can be seen now and particularly since the budget, because the effectiveness of the budget in curbing the balance of payments can be seen in the monthly trade figures.  Before the budget&mdash;in January last&mdash;we had a record trade deficit of more than £200 million.  Since the budget there has been a dramatic fall, the deficit falling steadily from February to April.  The average deficit for the four months from February to May has been roughly 60 per cent of that for January.  This is a major fall and a notable achievement. That is progress.  There has been a dramatic fall also as a consequence of budget strategy in the rate of increases in consumer goods imports.  The rate of increase <Col N="2546" /> in this category on the corresponding months of last year had fallen from 49 per cent and 54 per cent in the first few months of this year to 25 per cent in April and to only 8 per cent in May.  Our imports bill in May was higher than in April but not because of consumer goods imports.</P>
    <P>As Deputies opposite may know, because the world knows, it was because of the increase in oil prices.  Transport equipment played a part as well as iron and steel products and industrial machinery.  The last items give the lie to the notion that we have a stagnant industrial sector.  The final conclusion to be drawn from this is that in the absence of the increase in oil prices&mdash;though as I have said there is a recognisable and welcome trend&mdash;the trade deficit for the first five months of this year would have fallen by £65 million.  In the time available to me I do not think I will contrast that with the experience of the Opposition when they were in Government. I will leave it where it should be left, in the hands of students of history.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with other priorities that are clearly evident in the Government's planned approach to the management of public finances and the development of the economy.  Here I will deal particularly with education and youth employment.  As the Taoiseach said when he opened the debate, one of the major problems facing us and Europe is that of youth unemployment.  That is not a quote from the Taoiseach's speech; it is the considered decision of the heads of government of the EEC.  In Europe the average trend is 37 per cent of the population being under 25 years of age, and in so far as that is a problem in Europe, one can see how the position is aggravated here where the average pattern is 50 per cent under the age of 25.</P>
    <P>To cope with that it is highly important that, in our planning for education and in the reaction of the public to that, we ensure that we maximise the training programmes and the education programmes, in areas that will promote growth activity and opportunities for our young people by the redeployment of <Col N="2547" /> resources in this area.  I will answer Deputy Collins in relation to the Education Estimate.</P>

Too much has been wasted in pursuing, over a period, satisfying outlets.

      <P>I want to welcome the responsible attitude of the partners to the tripartite committee, the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry, with whom I have been engaged in discussions on this matter on the Government's proposals and, I may say, particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Obviously the need for this scheme proposed by the Government has been accepted by them. Perhaps I may now give some further details of it which will be announced in further detail through the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee this afternoon decided, by way of confirmation, to allocate £2 million from their fund to launch their scheme.  This will enable the Industrial <Col N="2551" /> Credit Company to raise up to £50 million in deutschemarks for on-lending to manufacturing industry free of exchange risk.  The cost to the borrower at present is expected to be about 13 7/8ths per cent which will include a contribution of 7/8ths per cent towards the exchange risk.  This contribution and the £2 million from the employment guarantee fund will be paid into a special account in the Industrial Credit Company and will bear interest at the ICC's best rate.  Any exchange loss will be charged against this account.  Similarly any gains will be credited to it and any shortfall will be financed by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme is to provide additional working capital for small and medium sized manufacturing industry.  Eligible firms will be those with up to 250 employees and up to £2,500,000 fixed assets.  Loans will be provided for periods from three months to five years.  The maximum loan to any one company will be £250,000.  The scheme will operate for a maximum period of five years.  The Government believe that this scheme will make a major contribution to industrial output and employment at present.  It should remove the inhibitions of many firms about borrowing abroad as well as enabling them to raise funds at a competitive rate of interest.  I am confident that industry, which has long sought this facility, will respond positively and quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with some other aspects of the Government programme and plan which is evident from all I have said so far but also from the response which we are getting from the various sectors in, admittedly, difficult times.  In relation to agriculture, which forms a major element of our economic development plan, it is particularly so when the balance of trade remains a critical factor in our imbalances. Anyone sitting in this seat, anyone sitting in any government, will recognise that the contribution which <Col N="2553" /> agriculture can make is a major one.  The important thing is to encourage productivity on our land and in the agricultural sector generally.  To do that in a period of restricted credit&mdash;and that is what it is, and one must acknowledge it&mdash;it is vitally important that the agricultural sector concentrate on productive employment. Unfortunately there is evidence that the manner in which credit was used last year particularly was not to the maximum benefit of agriculture nor the role which agriculture can play in our economy.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the pattern of the use of credit one finds that a very considerable portion of it was taken up in land purchase, sometimes in competitive land purchase, at great cost to the credit pool available and at great cost to the successful farmer&mdash;if one might call him such&mdash;in this case.  Unfortunately also a very considerable portion of it was used in over-investment&mdash;I think one can say&mdash;in farm plant and machinery.  For that reason, after consultation with the farm organisations&mdash;and we have had very useful, positive consultations with them at every level&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture in his normal role, the Taoiseach and myself&mdash;and also in the course of their contribution to the planned development of our economy&mdash;have stressed that it is vitally important that the emphasis be laid on the area of productive investment.  As a consequence of some of our consultations with them I introduced amendments to the Finance Bill which removed the restriction of 30 per cent capital allowances, say, for farm buildings, for farm improvement works and indeed farm plant in farm buildings, all of which will make a major extra contribution to the productivity so badly required in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say also that, in consultation with my colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, I am making available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash;in addition to the scheme to which the Minister for Agriculture referred this morning, further details of which no <Col N="2554" /> doubt will be given later&mdash;authorisation to borrow a further £25 million, over and above that already borrowed by them, £50 million, for on-lending to Irish agriculture.  I have instructed the Agricultural Credit Corporation that this on-lending will be directed specifically towards the productive sectors of agriculture.  Hopefully&mdash;and I have no reason to doubt&mdash;because of the limited pool of credit and because of the experience which some farmers have had in over-expending themselves in land purchase or in farm plant or machinery, we will see now a readjustment appropriate to the reality of this moment and appropriate also to the great potential of agriculture.  This adjustment will in fact be supported constantly and effectively by this Government.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have been able to announce a scheme similar to that which has been agreed in respect of industry.  I have always seen&mdash;as have this Government&mdash;that these two elements in our community are not only interdependent but are the mainstays of our whole economic development.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the second element of Deputy FitzGerald's attack on the Government I want to assure the House that the planned approach which I have demonstrated exists even in the budget this year, in our examination of public expenditure, in our definition and pursuit of priorities, will be pursued, will be seen to be pursued in such a way as the country can respond to it, to take us through what is a difficult time, but nontheless take us through successfully in a way that will prove the capacity of this Government and their clear and deliberate policies.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the second aspect of things which unfortunately, at the beginning, set the theme and tone for this debate. Those are especially the attacks made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and the allegations and implications in his contribution at the beginning.  I do not have responsibility for the Department of Justice.  But let me say, in passing, the Minister for Justice <Col N="2555" /> dealt effectively with this in the House yesterday, as he has done on many other occasions.  I want to say once again that the Leader of Fine Gael used a subterfuge here last week on the Estimate for the Public Service, in the absence of the Minister who could reply, the Minister for Justice.  He used that occasion to repeat allegations and innuendoes knowing that the Minister who is responsible was not here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the occasion to raise those issues was during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  It is easier to pursue the self-righteous path, to make a virtue of it and then to leave a stain on the character of this Government which could, if it were allowed to go uncontradicted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In fact, I am the Minister responsible since through the Revenue Commissioners I have responsibility for the customs service and I will reply in some detail.  Deputy FitzGerald must be aware of the fact that to base his allegations on unproven charges is very damaging, even to him.  It is certainly damaging to the standards of public life of which he professes to be the true and only guardian.  Most of his allegations were based on allegations made recently in the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the general secretary of the Association of Customs and Excise Officers.  I repeat what I said last week about this matter.  Immediately <Col N="2556" /> the allegations were made I contacted the Revenue Commissioners and sought details to confirm or otherwise the allegations made.  This is what the position is at present.  There was a second interview last Sunday during which the general secretary said that he was prepared to substantiate his allegations with dates and names and that such substantiation could be provided by Tuesday or Wednesday morning.  The actual words used were: &ldquo;We will have a queue outside his office on Tuesday or Wednesday morning&rdquo;.  They meant of course, my office.  Not having received any substantiation in response to my request I immediately contacted the Revenue Commissioners again.</P>

      <P>The impression was created that all the information was there, but I am still waiting for it.  One or two allegations were made by the general secretary concerning the Border seizure of a lorry by the customs authorities.  I should tell the House that this incident took place in the Lifford area as long ago as the period between December 1976 and January 1977.</P>

      <P>I have been assured by the Revenue Commissioners that the legal decisions taken in that case were taken on legal advice by the Revenue Commissioners and there was no question of political representations affecting their decision in any way.  As far as I am aware, they became aware of representations only after a court decision had been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2557" /> While continuing to pursue my inquiries with the Revenue Commissioners, I have not as yet received any specific information about the second allegation of recent interference by a Government Minister.  If, as suggested, there were evidence of that interference it would be a simple matter to present it.  I believe the interference is alleged to have been expressed as a demand. I am still waiting for anything to substantiate that allegation and until I have that information it will be recognised that the matter cannot be taken further.</P>

There will not be any vindictive action by this Government.  I am entitled, nevertheless, to have furnished to me through the proper channels such information as is there.  I have not as yet received it and I do not want Deputy FitzGerald to imply from that fact that only he or his party under his leadership could be trusted to ensure that officers who make complaints will be protected. Where complaints are justified they must and should be made.  I have ensured in discharging my function that people will not be punished for making complaints.  I am obliged also to ensure that the function of Government which is vitally important <Col N="2558" /> will not be undermined by unproven innuendo or allegation.</P>

      <P>As Deputy FitzGerald knows, the Revenue Commissioners have statutory powers and from time to time Deputies, including Deputies from his own party, make representations through me&mdash;there are named Deputies in that party who have made them through me&mdash;and they are passed on as a matter of course to the Revenue Commission. They exercise their statutory responsibility and then reply to me or my Department.  That is the position at the moment and it is the only position I know to exist.  If Deputy FitzGerald wants to imply from that process corruption in this Government, I think he will have to travel a little bit further.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. P.

      <P>Ireland received £25.55 million from the quota section of the European Regional Development Fund in 1979.  It is expected that £47 million will be received in 1980.  The money is used to finance additional investment under the public capital programme, and no change in this arrangement is proposed for 1981.  Under the fund regulation, the share of the overall assistance for general infrastructure throughout the Community may not exceed 70 per cent of the total and subject to this limitation it is the Government's policy to use the fund mainly for the improvement of infrastructure.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the <Col N="2317" /> Deputies' question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  A Commission proposal, which has been discussed with my Department, is presently before the Council for a regulation instituting a special Community regional development measure contributing to the improvement of the economic and social situation on both sides of the Irish Border. The measures proposed by the Commission are designed to develop the tourist potential of those areas and to encourage the development of artisan enterprises. The duration of the programme shall be five years.  As in the case of any action supported by the European Regional Fund requests for assistance under the non-quota section must be submitted by the member state and must be financed jointly by the Commission and the member state concerned.</P>
      <P>I would not favour the expansion of the non-quota section as at present constituted. The criteria laid down for the type of measures that may be supported by the non-quota section are far too restrictive.  I would expect, however, that the amended regulation for 1981 and subsequent years will provide for greater flexibility and in that event I will reconsider my attitude.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the cost of giving a rebate of tax to all couples whose claim, if they had taken court proceedings, would be similar to that of the Murphy couple, judgment of whose claim was given by the Supreme Court earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a rebate of tax would arise in the case of persons who suffered tax by deduction under PAYE or who had already paid tax on foot of an assessment.  In addition, however, there would be the question of the treatment of persons who had not paid the full tax liability for those years whether by inadequate deductions under PAYE or because assessments had not been <Col N="2318" /> made or, where they had been made, had not adequately covered the total income of the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>If, therefore, the decision on nonaggregation of incomes of married couples were to apply for the two years 1978-79 and 1979-80 the years for which the Supreme Court held that Mr. and Mrs. Murphy were entitled to repayment, the cost to the Exchequer would be in the region of £44 million. If application of the decision were limited to cases of <i>earned</i> income, the cost would be about £35 million.</P>
      <P>I might add that, if the terms of the majority decision of the Supreme Court were to be departed from, it is not clear why rebates of tax and the revised treatment should be given to taxpayers for the years 1978-79 and 1979-80 only.  Indeed, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court held that the appropriate period was six years.  Those who had suffered tax on the then existing basis for 1977-78 and earlier years would claim that they were equally entitled to like treatment for those earlier years.  Depending upon how far back this favourable treatment were to be applied, the cost to the Exchequer could be well over £100 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the figures which I gave on 29 May are very tentative estimates.  They are, however, of sufficient accuracy to bear out the point which I made, that the costs attributable to the Northern Ireland situation are a substantial drain on Exchequer resources.  The costs incurred on extra security in the Republic arising from the situation in Northern Ireland are made up principally of two items, namely, expenditure on the <Col N="2319" /> Defence Forces, and expenditure on the Garda and Prison Services.  In 1969-70 these accounted for approximately £1 million each: in 1975, for approximately £20 million and £10 million respectively; and in 1979 for approximately £40 million and £19 million respectively.  In 1980, it is tentatively estimated that the extra costs of the Defence Forces will be £57 million, and of the Garda and Prison Services, £24 million.  The figures which I gave on 29 May also included some smaller items, which, for example, in 1975 amounted to over £2 million, the bulk of which was accounted for by personal and property compensation.  Incidentally, the figure of £35 million which I gave for 1975 should read £33 million.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the schedule of major works contained in the road development plan.  The plan provides for flexibility in the timing of these projects, having regard not merely to the availability of finance, but to progress by the road authorities in planning, design and the acquisition of land by agreement or by compulsory purchase.  Taking these factors into account, it has been possible to allocate funds this year to eleven schemes which were not originally scheduled to commence before 1981, in place of nine schemes which the road authorities might otherwise have commenced this year.  While it has not been possible to meet the level of investment projected in the plan for all schemes this year, this does not of course affect the full implementation of the plan to which the Government is committed.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities are obliged by section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966, to assess at least once every five years the supply and condition of housing accommodation in their areas.  The last such assessment of housing needs carried out by authorities determined the level of accumulated needs at 30 June 1976 and prospective needs in the five-year period ending on 30 June 1981.  The assessments provided the basic data for the formulation of national housing policy generally since then.</P>
      <P>The Government are now anxious to assess the level of house building requirements over the next few years in the light of the progress made since 1976 and to facilitate the forecasting of capital requirements for housing on the basis of need.  Accordingly, on 31 January 1980 I asked housing authorities to carry out an overall assessment of housing needs, in a more standardised manner than on previous occasions, in order to determine the level of accumulated need as at 31 March 1980 and the prospective needs in the five-year period ending on 31 March 1985.  I requested the authorities to furnish my Department with their assessments not later than 30 September 1980.  I also asked authorities to carry out sample surveys of houses in their areas for the purpose of the assessment of needs where an adequate survey had not been undertaken within the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In carrying out the assessment of housing needs, authorities have been asked to have regard generally to guidelines described in a manual entitled &ldquo;Housing Needs Assessment&rdquo;, prepared by An Foras Forbartha in conjunction with my Department.  The manual takes into account established international practice in housing needs assessment.  In carrying out the sample survey of the <Col N="2327" /> housing stock authorities have been asked to use the techniques described in guidelines entitled &ldquo;Conducting a sample survey of the housing stock&rdquo;, also prepared by An Foras Forbartha in conjunction with my Department.  These guidelines provide step by step notes on survey techniques which will facilitate housing authorities in conducting the survey and ensure a standardised approach to the question of sampling.</P>
    <P>A survey will entail the inspection of 500 to 1,000 houses in an area and will generally be done on a county borough and a countywide basis only.  Some of the larger towns may also conduct a survey. When carrying out the survey housing authorities will be seeking information about the age, structural condition, and standard of facilities in the housing <Col N="2328" /> stock.  A standardised survey form is being used generally and, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to append a copy of the form to my reply in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha are assisting the majority of authorities by provision of the necessary documentation, training the personnel involved and analysing the survey returns by computer.  Some authorities are already engaged in carrying out the survey, while the balance are making the necessary detailed preparations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recent survey by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union Youth Committee on the operation of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  Even though the survey is a very limited one, covering only 310 young people in two second-level schools in Dublin, it will be a valuable addition to the information which is being assembled on the working of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, contains a general prohibition on the employment of children under school leaving age, which is at present 15 years. However, section 4 of the Act provides that children under 15 years but over 14 <Col N="2342" /> years may engage in employment within very strict limits, as laid down in the section.</P>
    <P>There have been more than 1,500 inspections in connection with the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act since it came into force.  In addition the Department's inspectors, in the course of their general inspection work, have investigated the position in regard to the Act, where appropriate.  There have been two successful prosecutions, papers have been sent to the Chief State Solicitor in four further cases, and prosecutions are being considered in a number of other cases.</P>
    <P>The Act has been widely publicised and a special poster was distributed to schools and youth organisations a few years ago.</P>
    <P>Experience in the enforcement of the Act has thrown up a number of problems and accordingly a review in depth of the provisions of the Act is being undertaken in my Department with a view to possible amendment.  When amendments are proposed the House will have an opportunity to consider fully the long-term position in relation to the employment of young persons.</P>

      <P>Statement by Minister for Education on Report of Board of Visitors of the National Museum for the year 1977/78.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum of Ireland for the year 1977/78 has been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with statutory requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2361" /> The Minister for Education has noted the comments of the Board of Visitors and wishes to make the following observations. Both he and the Minister of State at the Department of Education are continuing to take appropriate action to improve conditions in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has had a number of meetings with representatives of the Board of Visitors regarding the question of accommodation and the future development of the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Specific measures as follows have been taken in relation to the museum: During the past year, additional accommodation at 7/9, Merrion Row was fitted out and these excellent premises have been handed over to the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Following the Government's approval, in principle, of proposals for the provision at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, of conference facilities, alternative accommodation was sought for the National Museum material stored there.  Suitable premises have since been acquired at Daingean and the transfer of the material in question is proceeding. Special arrangements are being made to ensure that security precautions, temperature and humidity control will be up to optimum standards.  The relevant experts with ancillary staff have been recruited to ensure that the collections are removed with maximum efficiency and safety.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for works to deal with the outbreak of dry rot, leaking pipes, and these are in the hands of the Office of Public Works. These works, which include opening up, treatment, reinstatement and redecoration are at an advanced stage and are proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Thirteen new posts have been created in the National Museum.  Of these, nine have been filled to date and arrangements are being made for the filling of the remaining four posts by open competition to be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister of State has been actively promoting the development <Col N="2362" /> of a policy in relation to the establishment of museums at selected centres throughout the country.  A series of meetings has been held with the National Museum Development Committee, an ad hoc body, which consists of representatives of regional development organisations. Certain locations outside Dublin have been suggested as possible centres for museums.  The implementation of this policy would have the two-fold effect of decentralising the museum service while, at the same time, alleviating pressure of space and staff in the National Museum.  The Minister regards the strengthening of the National Museum and the development of a policy of partial decentralisation as being mutually supportive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not conscious of a general demand for the introduction of the type of scheme referred to in the question.  The National Museum pursues a policy of acquiring items of national and local interest from the resources available to it and co-operates with local museums in making appropriate arrangements for their display.  I would not have a function in relation to regulations governing the import of items from abroad.</P>

      <P>The general position is that nurses employed in a permanent pensionable capacity in health boards are entitled to pensions under the local authority superannuation scheme and are not insured for contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  Equally nurses employed in a permanent pensions capacity in the voluntary hospitals are entitled to pensions under the voluntary hospitals superannuation scheme and are not insured for contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  There may be some nurses retired from other areas of the health services about which my Department would have no information.  There may also be some nurses in the voluntary hospitals who did not opt to join the voluntary hospitals superannuation scheme in 1969 when it was established.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The EEC programme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty ends on 30 November 1980 and under the relevant Council decision a report giving an assessment of the results was to be submitted to the Council of Ministers by 30 June 1981.  To span the period of approximately two years between the end of the pilot programme and the commencement of any measures adopted as a result of the evaluation of that programme, the EEC Commission submitted a Supplementary Interim Programme which was put down for discussion at the meeting of the Ministers of Labour and Social Affairs of the Council in Luxembourg on Monday, 9 June 1980.</P>
      <P>At that meeting one delegation was not prepared to accept any proposal before a final evaluation of the present pilot programme had been made.  As unanimity was required on the matter the proposal would have then been rejected had I not put forward, on behalf of the Irish Government, a compromise proposal whereby the Commission would present a detailed initial evaluation of the programme at the next Council meeting in November.  The Council accepted my proposal.</P>
      <P>When the evaluation report comes to hand the Government will consider what attitude it will adopt at the next Council meeting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are unreservedly committed to tackling poverty and has repeatedly given positive proof of this commitment.  As an example I might mention the measures taken in the budget which provided increases of 25 per cent and 20 per cent respectively in long-term and short-term social welfare payments and introduced a number of other improvements in this area.  In the field of administrative reform my colleague, the Minister for Justice, has established the Legal Aid Board to administer the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice.</P>
      <P>In addition, the National Social Services Council is being re-organised and strengthened to enable it to better contribute to the development of personal social services.  The health boards in association with many voluntary organisations are providing additional day care centre facilities for the old and handicapped.  In the long-term, the protection of the old, the widowed and the invalided from poverty will depend on the development of a national earnings related pension system which I regard as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>In her preface to the recent Second Interim Report of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty the chairperson stressed the pilot nature of the programme and pointed out that the report should be seen as preparing the way for a final evaluation report later this year.</P>
      <P>I have taken note of the views expressed in the report and, in addition to other measures which I am examining, I am awaiting the final report of the committee to assist in determining what manner of continuing action should be taken to combat poverty in our society.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has satisfied himself with the situation whereby a window, in receipt of a widow's pension, suffers a reduction in pension on attaining the age of 66 due to the application of a stricter means test; and whether he will take steps to remedy this unjust anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1979, removed the upper age limit for receipt of widow's non-contributory pension. Prior to the enactment of that Act, a widow's non-contributory pension ceased when she reached old age pension age, that is, 66 years, and her means were automatically re-assessed for non-contributory old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>A recipient of a widow's non-contributory pension may now therefore receive that pension after age 66 unless she wishes to claim a non-contributory old age pension.  If she so wishes her means are re-assessed.  However, if it is to her advantage to remain in receipt of widow's pension she is advised accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any widow at present in receipt of non-contributory old age pension at a reduced rate may apply for a widow's non-contributory pension, in which case <Col N="2405" /> her means would be re-assessed on the basis prescribed for the latter pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already intimated in reply to previous questions on this matter it was not possible, because of the short interval between the date of this year's budget and the dates from which the increases in the rates of pension had effect, to have pension order books at the increased rates printed and issued to the pensioners before their existing pension books expired at the end of March. In order to avoid a situation where the pensioners would have no books on which to receive payment from the beginning of April it was necessary this year to have two issues of pension books prepared for the 330,000 pensioners in the country.</P>
      <P>The first issue of books at the prebudget rates was made in March and the books were in the hands of the pensioners to enable them to receive payment at these rates from the first week in April.  The second issue which provides for the weekly increase was completed before the end of May.</P>
      <P>Two supplementary pension order books in respect of the person concerned were issued to the designated post office and they are available for collection by him at that office.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his recent assurance that where it emerged from investigation that factual assessment in relation to social welfare benefits to small holders in the west of Ireland would not be to a persons' advantage, such persons could continue to receive the same payments they had been getting on a notional assessment is being implemented; if instructions issued to social welfare staff do not allow implementation of this assurance; and if he will quote the statutory regulations relating to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to have <Col N="2407" /> misinterpreted what I said in regard to this matter which I have referred to on two recent occasions in the Dáil.  What I said on both occasions was that if it emerged that factual assessment would not be to the advantage of the smallholder he could continue to remain on notional assessment.</P>
      <P>In the vast majority of cases where it is found to be more advantageous to remain on the notional assessment the applicants continue to receive the same payments as they had been getting. However, in a small number of cases factual assessment may disclose additional means which had not been declared when the initial application was made or which had been subsequently acquired and not disclosed such as capital or extra land.  Such items must be taken into account and affect the rate of unemployment assistance payable even though the applicant may remain on the notional system.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the system of notional assessment applies only to the estimation of the yearly income from the farm.  Other income must however be assessed on a factual basis and taken into account for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the law or in the instruction in regard to means assessment.</P>
      <P>The main legislation governing the calculation of means for unemployment assistance purposes is contained in section 13 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, as amended.  The factual assessment of farm means is calculated in accordance with section 13(1)(c) of that Act and paragraph 3 of the Unemployment Assistance (calculation of Means Regulations) Order, 1934 (S.R. and O. No. 34).</P>
      <P>The notional assessment of farm income is calculated in accordance with section 8 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, as amended by section 4 of the Social Welfare Act, 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation giving the option of factual assessment is contained in section 9 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, as <Col N="2408" /> amended by section 5 of the Social Welfare Act, 1979.</P>

    <P>In considering the level of charges in force at the airport car parks, I have due regard to a number of factors, including the level of charges at private commercial car parks and at other airports.  Car parking charges at the three State airports are substantially below those obtaining at Heathrow and Glasgow airports and compare favourably with charges for private commercial car parks in the Dublin city area.  I would also point out that the airport car parks are maintained to a high standard and are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  In all the circumstances I consider the level of charges for car parking at our airports to be reasonable.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>In common with other Ministers who are responsible for State-sponsored bodies, I welcome the NESC Report on Enterprise in the Public Sector as an important contribution to discussions on the future development of the public service and particularly on the relationships between central Government and State-sponsored bodies.  Because a number of the issues raised in relation to organisation and personnel matters are relevant to the work of the Public Service Advisory Council, the Minister for the Public Service is asking that council to take the report into account in its deliberations.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach met the chairman and chief executives of the main State-sponsored bodies primarily concerned with economic and commercial development on 9 June 1980, and had a wide ranging discussion with them on matters arising from the NESC Report, on the development of enterprise in the public sector and on the contribution which the State-sponsored bodies can make to economic development.  It was agreed to hold a further meeting.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the chief executive of Aer Lingus-Aer Linte was associated with the study.  I have no doubt that his wide expertise was of considerable benefit to the study group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report made a number of wide-ranging recommendations including a recommendation that where new enterprices are being established, these should be set up as separate corporate entities in order to establish working practices appropriate to the particular enterprise concerned rather than to the parent body.  The study group report did not recommend that in cases where State-sponsored bodies have diversified into areas which are removed from their original remit these activities should be <Col N="2422" /> separately identified in the accounts of State-sponsored bodies.  I should mention however that the ancillary activities of a number of the State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department are already separately identified in the accounts of these bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been any curtailment of normal working hours at Cork Airport, nor is there any shortage of air traffic control personnel there.  The airport operates on an 18-hour day and staffing <Col N="2424" /> levels are geared to operation on this basis.  The existing Air Traffic Control complement is sufficient to provide a limited number of extended or all night openings at the airport.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to the debate on the Adjournment in the Seanad on 18 June last in the course of which the Minister of State at my Department explained fully the background to the re-scheduling through Dublin of certain charter flights originally organised to operate this Summer from Cork to Palma and Lourdes.  The charters in question, as originally scheduled, involved over 60 flights outside the published opening hours for the airport and my Department were not advised sufficiently in advance to permit arrangements to be made to provide air traffic control facilities outside normal hours.  In view of the disruption and inconvenience which re-scheduling would involve for travellers, I arranged for my Department to carry out an exhaustive examination of all the options to see if anything could be done.  However, I was advised that the maximum number of extensions that could be safely accommodated within the existing resources was four to five per month.  An additional consideration was that, in the main, the charter series concerned involved only one aircraft on each of the nights for which extended opening hours were required and the cost of keeping the airport open for one extra flight would have been very difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>During the current strike, Aer Lingus are not operating any charter flights out of Cork.  When the situation returns to normal, the company plan to avail of the four to five extensions per month to facilitate the inclusive tour series between Cork and Malaga.  The Cork-Palma and Cork-Lourdes series are being transferred to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that this situation should not recur and I have asked Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to examine the position for 1981 and to make early proposals to my Department so as to give adequate time for consideration of the possible recruitment of extra Air Traffic Services personnel.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the statement referred to by the Deputy.  I would refer him to the arrangements envisaged, which have been mentioned publicly on a number of occasions, for an assessment and review of the nuclear power project.  The Deputy will be aware of the assumptions made in the press report to which he refers on such questions as economic growth rates and the possible energy mix by the year 2000.  In looking at possible developments between now and the end of the century there is obviously <Col N="2427" /> very considerable and legitimate scope for debate on how various relevant factors will turn out.  These variable factors include the effects on energy demand of the downturn in the world economy which will continue to affect national economies, the savings that may be achieved through conservation and diversification programmes and the possible contribution from renewable sources of energy and from greater or more effective use of indigenous resources.</P>
      <P>We need to get a better assessment of these factors than we have at present.  I have already announced certain initiatives, for instance, the possibility of an extended natural gas grid, a scheme for practical testing of wind power capability, the increased use of turf and coal for electricity generation, a review of possible additional hydro-generation and the biomass project.  I have also taken the first steps in a major review and reorientation of energy conservation programmes.  When we have gone some distance further down the road on these comprehensive programmes we will be in a better position to assess what our future energy requirements will be and how these can best be met.</P>

I am consulting with various interests on this. Because of its very specific role in relation to the development of our bog areas I could see Bord na Móna having a special role in providing technical advice on the many problems that can arise for the private bog developers.  There are other organisations such as the sugar company which might also have a significant contribution to make in this area.</P>
    <P>There are a number of existing incentives to encourage private development of bogs.  The Central Development Committee give grants of up to 60 per cent towards the cost of turf cutting machinery for private bog development in Western areas.

      <P>I have no knowledge that the British National Oil Corporation have begun or <Col N="2433" /> intend to carry out seismic work in the area in question.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware that a consortium comprising the British National Oil Corporation and British Petroleum was awarded, in February 1977, a licence in respect of four blocks in the UK designated area off the North West.  As parts of two of these blocks lay within the area claimed by this country the Irish Government counter-designated the relevant parts of these two blocks.  Letters were sent in May 1977 to the two companies concerned informing them that part of two of the blocks they had licensed from the UK were seen by the Irish Government as falling within its jurisdiction. To date no work has been undertaken in these blocks.</P>
      <P>However, it came to my attention, in April of this year, that BP, the operator for the consortium, intended to carry out seismic work in the blocks in question and that part of this work would cover the counter-designated blocks.</P>
      <P>My Department informed BP, through their Irish subsidiary, that part of the area they held under licence from the UK was claimed and designated by the Irish Government and that no company had the right to carry out exploration work in our designated area without first obtaining a licence to do so.  Not having received a satisfactory reply to our informal approaches, my Department wrote formally to BP on 23 May 1980.</P>
      <P>I am still awaiting a reply from BP but they have not started their seismic work and I understand that the programme, which was to have commenced sometime this month, has been postponed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is very difficult because of uncertainties about future prices to predict accurately the bill for the current year but on the basis of the latest information to hand it is estimated that the oil import bill for 1980 will be of the order of £800 million.</P>

      <P>Proven coal reserves are as follows: 10.7 million tons of anthracite in the Leinster and Slieveardagh coalfields; 18.3 million tons of semi-bituminous coal including low grade coal (crow coal) in the Connaught coalfield.</P>
      <P>On the basis of rather insubstantial data it is estimated by the Geological Survey Office that probable or possible additional reserves are as follows: 12 million tons of anthracite; 19 million tons of semi-bituminous coal.  No information is available as regards offshore reserves of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Geological Survey Office is engaged in continuing study and field work to up-date its records and maps of coal deposits with a view to acquiring a better appreciation of the nature and extent of the coal reserves.  During the course of a recent visit to the offices of the Survey I discussed this work with the Director and his staff and I emphasised the importance of the studies in our current situation.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to a recent Question, various parts of the coalfields are being worked at present by private concerns. Other companies with coal mining expertise are displaying considerable interest in obtaining facilities to explore <Col N="2435" /> and develop parts of the coalfields which are not being worked at present.  The question of mining rights under the Minerals Development Act, 1979, has to be determined by the Mining Board in respect of large areas of the coalfields and when it becomes possible to grant facilities to these parties considerably more information will gradually become available regarding the extent of the coal reserves.</P>

      <P>The question of reciprocal voting rights was raised in the context of direct elections to the European Parliament in June 1979 but no agreement was arrived at.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of granting reciprocal voting rights in local elections has been <Col N="2437" /> under consideration for some years in the context of the granting of &ldquo;Special Rights&rdquo; to citizens of the Community as envisaged in the final communique of the Paris Summit meeting on 9/10 December 1974.</P>
    <P>The suggestion to grant reciprocal voting rights in local elections, to which Ireland has taken a positive attitude, presents serious difficulties for some member states.  The question of granting reciprocal voting rights in national parliamentary elections has not been considered.</P>
    <P>From inquiries I have made, and given the difficulties that have been encountered in regard to reciprocal voting rights in local elections, it would be premature at this stage to envisage Community action in regard to reciprocal voting rights in national parliamentary elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are planting trees on virgin bogs in parts of North Kerry.  I understand, however, that as far as possible seasonal lettings are made available by that Department to those <Col N="2452" /> requiring turbary in these areas.  I also understand that that Department are prepared to examine and consider any proposal from competent and reputable bodies for the development of any specific bogland area in their ownership with a view to production of turf.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, because of the size, relatively shallow peat deposits, poor drainage properties and steep gradients of many of these bogs, large scale mechanised turf production from them by Board na Móna would not be economic.  Another factor militating against their development by Bord na Móna is the short production season which would result from the high rainfall and humidity caused by their altitude and location.</P>
      <P>I have already stated on a number of occasions that one of my objectives is to encourage private development on bogs which are not suitable for mechanical large scale commercial exploitation on the lines normally undertaken by Bord na Móna.  With this in mind my Department are currently considering the formulation of a programme to co-ordinate and promote bog development by private interests.</P>
      <P>I feel that the energy potential of the bogs in the ownership of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry needs to be specifically examined and I am arranging to have this done.  The maintenance of a satisfactory programme of reafforestation and the utilisation on an economic basis of suitable turf deposits are both important national objectives.  I am confident that arrangements can be adopted which will enable the pursuit of both these desirable objectives to be accommodated.</P>
      <P>While the formation of appropriate programmes will obviously take time I intend to put forward specific proposals at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was not entitled to unemployment benefit at the date of his claim on 29 July 1979 as his 1978 insurance card, on which his title depended, had not been lodged.  It has now been established that the card was received in the Department in September 1979 but the notification of this information to the Employment Exchange, Waterford on the 19 September 1979 does not appear to have reached that office.  The claimant's contact with the local office ceased on 14 October 1979.</P>

      <P>She was paid maternity allowance from 7 February 1980 to 15 March 1980 and disability benefit from 17 March 1980 to 30 May 1980 at the full rates.  In view of the award of social assistance allowance she was only entitled to these benefits at half the appropriate rate in each case.</P>
      <P>A payable order for £304.94, being arrears of social assistance allowance, less the amount of maternity allowance, and disability benefit overpaid, issued direct to the person concerned on 24 June 1980.</P>
