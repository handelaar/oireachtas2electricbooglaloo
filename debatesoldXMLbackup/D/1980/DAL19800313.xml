      <P>I cannot indicate to the Deputy at the moment but, speaking from recollection, it has been circulated and it is really a question of finding time in the queue at the moment.  The Deputy knows that we are concentrating on the budget, but thereafter there are a number of Bills, one of which is No. 16 to which the Deputy refers, which it is hoped to take as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say something about the Employment Guarantee Fund Bill.  At 5 o'clock yesterday I was informed by our Whip that the Government wanted all Stages of this Bill, which had not been printed or circulated at the time, to be taken next week.  It is a bit unreasonable to expect the Opposition to take this measure when it has been part of the national understanding for the last three or four months.  The funds were provided in the Estimate circulated a month ago.  For the Government to come along and say that they want all Stages on the following week with less than 24 hours' sitting time is not reasonable when it could have been done a fortnight ago.  I understand the position <Col N="2057" /> is that they cannot get the money from the employers if they do not have the Bill passed before 6 April.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the reason I had been given.  If that had been explained earlier we would certainly have facilitated the Government.  We can certainly see the necessity for the fund and we approve it, but it is unreasonable to expect all Stages in a two-day sitting week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill could not be introduced until one could precisely estimate what was the level of surcharge, which has now been determined at .35 per cent, to yield the amount of £10 million.  It was not possible before this to estimate that precisely, particularly in view of budgetary changes and the lifting of the ceiling to £7,000.  In fact, it was felt that it might be more than .35 per cent.  Now that it has been estimated, it is being introduced as quickly as possible after that.  I can tell the Deputies that the tripartite committee have agreed on this. The House has already discussed it on the Supplementary Estimate last year, so I cannot imagine the Deputy being taken either without notice or otherwise on the issue of principle or on the issue to be discussed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite patently nonsense.  The figure could have been estimated long before this.  A question by <Col N="2058" /> me was answered by the Minister&mdash;last week.  I think it was&mdash;which gave a precise figure of the amount of money to be collected under what used to be called the stamp for the increase from £5,500 to £7,000.  Therefore, if the Minister wanted to get a figure for £10 million it was quite easy to calculate it from that.  I do not understand what new factors have arisen between the signing or acceptance of the national understanding and today that made this so urgent or that indeed allowed the Government to be so tardy in introducing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>When moving the adjournment last evening I was saying that no previous budget was as well predicted or as correctly foretold as the present budget.  This is because of the open nature of the Fianna Fáil Government and the public figures released regarding the good housekeeping of the Government in 1979, a year that was a most difficult one for all open economies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance made public the pre-budget estimates prior to the budget.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="2060" /> laid all their cards on the table and because there were no cover ups or misleading of the public, every thinking and caring person was aware of the nation's financial state and financial needs.  Individuals were able to see what might be done to ensure our progress under the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  A proof of this was the Wednesday morning papers of 27 February being able to forecast accurately enough a cut in PAYE, a rise in social welfare payments and the fact that there would be a rise in indirect taxation. All the predictions of the media, people outside the House and the Opposition, were far from being fully accurate.  What the Minister for Finance did took the Opposition's breath away and gave more breadth to our economic confidence.</P>
      <P>This budget cuts PAYE tax payable but by a much greater margin than the Fine Gael or Labour Parties anticipated or expected or even dreamt of doing themselves.  In the words of the Taoiseach this budget is a land mark on the road to achieving equity in taxation. It is good to be reminded in 1980 that when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition in 1976 the need to cut into income tax and benefit married couples was published in our economic document and was later very much highlighted in the 1977 manifesto.  In 1978 our Government committed themselves to the full implications of income splitting.  What the Government did in the budget regarding taking another giant step in changing income taxation is but an affirmation of Fianna Fáil's traditional position and is proof positive that we mean business. The 1977 manifesto promises are being fully delivered and, irrespective of what the Opposition parties say, are being delivered on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Minister's frank and fair budget concerning taxation many families are now considerably better off. There are large increases in the size of income tax bands and substantial increased tax allowances for PAYE taxpayers. Since the budget we have heard nothing from those who moralised about the eroding of respect for the married state.  How often was it said in the past <Col N="2061" /> two years that our taxation system made it financially more profitable for people to live together rather than to be married.  Where are those moralisers now?  We have yet to hear any praise for what the budget does to quell the apparent scruples of those mercenary minded moralisers.  We are fully aware of the improvements that have been introduced in the budget for married couples.  Income splitting has been introduced for all married couples effectively giving them double the single persons' tax bands as well as double the personal allowance representing a major social advance in enhancing the place of the family unit in the community.</P>
    <P>For people in the lower income group complete exemption from tax will apply to the single person under £1,700 per annum and to married couples with less than £3,400 per annum.  Marginal relief will apply above these limits at a rate of 60 per cent.  That aspect of the budget will ensure that 75,000 people who are now paying tax will be exempt in this tax year.  That is just one aspect of the many good things and forward thinking introduced in the budget.</P>
    <P>I see in this budget one which sets the country along the road towards self help. It must increase people's faith in themselves to help themselves.  It cannot be described and is by no means a surface or handout budget.  What it does to increase a family's income it does in such a way that the family earner and his dependants can see that it is he himself who increases the income.  In its taxation programme, it is an incentive to increase production.  It rewards increased production. It will build up a sense of worth and independence and make employees less dependent on the State.  Increased production and less dependence on State aid among those in employment who are willing and able to work will help boost growth in the number of jobs becoming available and being created for the coming generation of young workers.</P>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil came into office in 1977 they have always shown themselves to be a caring Government.  We <Col N="2062" /> have committed ourselves to looking after more and more and bettering the less well off and less privileged in our society.  Nobody can deny that we have done most for the needy in our community. Social welfare beneficiaries in the past two years under Fianna Fáil have received average annual increases in the region of 10 per cent.  We are all fully conscious of the need to increase this annually.  Can anybody deny that the Minister's declaration of increases of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent in this budget is to be applauded?  When we had the Coalition Government in office, particularly at budget time, it was always emphasised that they did most for the less well-off.  I would challenge any member of the Opposition to deny that at no time in the history of the State were increases of this order ever given to social welfare beneficiaries, because never before was such a significant increase given to the under-privileged and less well-off in our society.  There is no need for me to emphasise the real value of that increase to the poorer sections of the community irrespective of what the Opposition party may say in regard to inflation and so on.  This significant increase constitutes a big step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The only way the Opposition can dare criticise this part of the budget is to make outlandish and gloomy predictions about a very high inflation rate which would negative those increases.  But, despite the current inflation rate, I feel confident that when we come to introduce the budget next year the under-privileged and less well-off sections of the community will have had their best year in many, in fact the best in the history of this State irrespective of what inflation occurs in the meantime.  Indeed I might add that solid, realistic and factual predictions of the inflation rate for 1980 show that it will not be anything like that totted up by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>When the State increases its benefits to those in need and to those people employed who need incentive&mdash;and this is being done on a large scale in this <Col N="2063" /> budget&mdash;it means also that the State needs more money.  I read recently an article by a financial expert on the budget who advocated and praised many of the increases granted by the Government. But, when it came to the Government needing more money in order to provide these increases, the same writer baulked. His anguish was that in 1980 £1,080 million would be collected by way of income tax.  Every honest citizen knows that if the State is expected to provide services, aid and a living for all its citizens it must collect the money somewhere.  Some financial, political pundits expect the impossible, but the ordinary man in the street has no objection whatsoever to paying tax.  Indeed the PAYE demonstrators were not against paying tax but were lobbying for the payment of equitable taxes.  It is as simple as that.  The reason those people were marching on the streets was that they were for the payment of an equitable amount of tax; they were not against paying income tax.  Naturally they know they have to pay a certain amount to ensure that the country and the economy are kept moving.</P>
    <P>I believe this budget achieves equity more than any other in the history of this State simply because it constitutes the development of Fianna Fáil fiscal and economic policies.  Down the years we were all fully conscious that people in general, and politicians in particular, were of the opinion that changes were needed in the tax code.  This Government is the first in the history of this State to tackle that matter in an efficient and proper way in this budget.  Again, as in the past, it was left to the Fianna Fáil Party to put that into effect.  Another factor that makes the payment of tax tolerable for people is when they realise that money is being spent where it is most needed, where it will best promote progress and prosperity.</P>
    <P>Above all other trends of government policy which emerged in this budget the most important economic one is that of land and industry being encouraged to generate their own wealth, reinvesting it in order to ensure its preservation and <Col N="2064" /> promote growth.  State aid and grants are to be available as primers only.  Farming and industry must increase their production, recognising the need for a constant increase in production.  They must get into world market places, creating and financing their selling force because production and selling are the key notes to success.  The State, of itself, cannot increase production or sell products; it can only encourage them, and that encouragement is being given by this Government.  The expertise involved in both farming and industry should ensure that no effort is spared in that direction. I feel confident that we have the expertise in both those fields to ensure that the appropriate market places are explored and that the essential improvements will be achieved.  It is essential that farming and industry should work hand in hand. The budget brings about a situation whereby the tug-of-war that seems to exist between the PAYE sector and the farming community can be resolved.  The farming community are fully conscious that they have to pay an equitable share of taxation and the budget ensures that the section of that community who are taxable will pay their share on the basis that if they do not earn money they will not be liable.  It is as simple as that.  The farming community are conscious of that and see the accounts system as the fairest system.  The notional system has been abolished, a move I agree with. That system, particularly last year, proved to be very unfair.  It would always be unfair when farmers had a bad year.  Farmers assessed under the notional system last year paid a lot more money in taxes than if they were assessed under the new accounts system. For that reason I welcome the decision to abolish the notional system and I am confident that the farming community agree with it.  I believe they will accept that the accounts system is the best system.  Farming is big business in this modern age.</P>
    <P>The budget seems to be saying gently to an over-dependent workforce, industry and agriculture, something with which we must agree and act upon in the <Col N="2065" /> eighties, that the State does not owe us anything.  We have to learn the sane economic fact of life that if one contributes in one's capacity as a worker and a taxpayer then one is a genuine partner with one's country.  The budget generates that theme.  The Minister for Finance was referring to that when he dealt with pay policy on budget day.  He told us that success or failure in dealing effectively with pay policy problems would depend critically upon incomes, the climate of industrial relations and a shared community concern.  I endorse his convictions that the overall impact of the budget will be seen as making a positive contribution towards restrained responsible pay agreements.</P>
    <P>Nobody will be asked to take less than equitable pay but we must all accept what is enough, having regard to the economic climate of the day, financial circumstances and the prosperity hopes of a sharing and caring community.  The budget generates amongst workers a frame of mind which helps them share the anxiety of the Minister for Finance in this direction.  The best results for the nation contained in the budget are the indications of progressive and developing policy.  There is a soundness about its aims which should gladden any sensible business person.  We are not simply going to pay for services; that is counterproductive. The growth of public pay and pensions reached a staggering £1,158 million in 1979, an increase of 25 per cent on the 1978 figure.  On the other hand the public programme at £1,154 million is 15 per cent above the 1979 out-turn and 42 per cent of this programme in 1980 will be devoted to improving the productive capacity of the economy, including an increase of 22 per cent in the provision for industrial promotions by the IDA and so on.</P>
    <P>That represents very positive spending and, in a difficult year, is allowing sufficient funds for continued expansion of job creation to which Fianna Fáil and indeed the nation must be committed.  The budget also emphasises the need for industrial peace because it is only in such a <Col N="2066" /> climate that increased job creation can occur.  I feel confident that the Taoiseach's speech to the nation shortly after he was elected to the office, was taken into account by all our people.  He got the message across in a proper and efficient manner.  He stressed that it was essential this year that we have industrial peace and that every effort be made to ensure that it prevailed.  I am confident that heed has been taken of that sincere request.  The budget demands that we face up to harsh economic realities which are largely due to outside unavoidable economic circumstances.  We are all conscious of the fact that the world oil crisis has been a severe blow to many countries, particularly to young industrial countries like ours.  I am not playing politics when I say that the deficit which the Government had to tackle this year was largely due to the world oil crisis.  The Government must also face up to the harsh economic realities.  The increase in taxation on petrol will lead to restraint in consumption and this in turn will aid energy conservation, a benefit that will outweigh whatever may be added to the inflation rate by the increase concerned.</P>
    <P>The other big increases in taxation are on non-essential items such as cigarettes, beer and spirits.  There is no obligation on anyone to purchase such commodities. As one who has been involved for a long number of years in the licensed trade I am fully conscious of the development during the past number of years whereby young people would seem to be drinking far more than they should be drinking.  Naturally, this is a matter of much concern not only to parents but to all responsible persons.  Perhaps the increases in drink prices will go some way towards reducing the consumption of alcohol among our young people.  All reasonable people must agree that if a government must raise extra revenue they are justified in increasing taxation on what are known as the old reliables.</P>
    <P>This is an intelligent budget for an intelligent people.  It is an informed budget for an informed public.  Also, it is an equitable budget and a budget that <Col N="2067" /> should encourage moderation among a people who are in need of moderation. More than anything else, however, it is a budget for expansion in the eighties.  To this extent, we have a start on the rest of Europe.  I am satisfied that anybody who studies the various proposals will realise that the Government are going a long way towards rectifying the economic situation, a situation that would have arisen regardless of which party were in power, as a result of the world oil crisis.  I am confident that the people are rowing in behind the Government in their efforts to rectify the situation and I am confident also that the Taoiseach has the full support of the people in regard to the various proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate and of making reference to the state of the economy.  The last speaker seems convinced that the budget has the approval of the people generally but I suggest that the Government put this to the test and let us find out how the people will respond.</P>
      <P>In common with the Fianna Fáil manifesto, the budget has created far more problems than it seeks to resolve, There is nothing in the budget that would seem to help to resolve the economic disaster in which we find ourselves.  All we have is a cosmetic exercise aimed at covering up an ugly economic situation. No one can deny that we are in the throes of a serious economic depression which is affecting the lives of our people and which is causing misery to many individuals and groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of stabilising prices and restraining inflation, this budget will only fuel the flames of inflation and will lead to chaos in regard to prices.  Regardless of what has been said by the various Ministers there is no great evidence of price control but there are continuous rounds of price increases.  We had them before the budget and immediately afterwards. Housewives are bewildered in trying to meet the cost of the weekly food bill.  Each week they find that they need more money to buy the same <Col N="2068" /> amount of goods as they bought in the previous week.  There is certainly not evidence of price control in the supermarkets.</P>
    <P>There is evidence of officers of the Department visiting smaller shopkeepers in towns and villages but little evidence of price control in supermarkets whose prices are changed from day to day and sometimes even a number of times each day, always upwards.  Working-class housewives and social welfare beneficiaries are in this way being exploited as never before, and the wage increases and concessions in the budget in respect of PAYE and social welfare benefits will be frittered away as a result of rising prices and consequent inflation.</P>
    <P>We all know that Fianna Fáil Governments have been highly professional in presenting package deals of the type contained in this budget which have been done with great care and sophistication, designed to please and to placate, but when the goodies are analysed I am convinced that this package will blow up in the faces of the various categories whom it is supposed to be designed to benefit, in the same way as the manifesto promises blew up after a short time.</P>
    <P>As time passes, the supposed concessions given in this budget will prove to be sleight of hand of the type we have come to expect from Fianna Fáil Governments, who give with one hand and take away with the other.  Experts who have been analysing the alleged concessions to PAYE workers more and more have been coming to the conclusion that these benefits are illusory.  The 20 per cent to 25 per cent increases given in social welfare benefits in my opinion are also illusory. Fianna Fáil have been gloating about the large increases given to social welfare beneficiaries, failing to realise that they are being outstripped by price increases and inflation.  Unless something is done to arrest these trends the working class generally will be worse off this year than ever before.</P>
    <P>For that reason I appeal to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, the Taoiseach and other members of the Government to recognise these facts. <Col N="2069" /> They have been unable to stop inflation, and in order to maintain the low living standards of those on social welfare benefits, the widows, the aged, the sick and the unemployed, there is a bounden duty on them to increase these benefits again in October.  The Coalition Government, in times when prices were not rising nearly so fast and therefore inflation was not nearly so rapid, provided for two increases annually, one in the budget and another in the autumn.  The previous Minister, Deputy Cluskey, showed his concern for those people by providing proper increases at regular intervals after carefully analysing cost of living and inflation trends.</P>
    <P>This Government have a similar obligation: because so little is being done to control prices they must give further compensation to the underprivileged in the autumn.  I ask the Minister for Finance to place on record when he is replying to this debate whether it is the intention of the Government to continue the practice of the previous Government to provide October increases for social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that doubts are being cast on the effectiveness of the changes in the taxation system.  Those of us who have looked at the situation are satisfied that changes in taxation bands and rates will give the biggest concession to those with the biggest incomes.  A married man with three children, and a wife not working outside the home, on £80 per week will get back the princely sum of only £1.60 a week.  A man in a similar situation on £120 a week will benefit to the extent of nearly £4 a week.  A man on £200 a week will benefit by £12 a week, and if a man is earning double that amount, £400 a week, the budget will give him back nearly £42 a week or £2,178 a year, more than many workers are receiving in wages.</P>
    <P>To my mind the increase in children's allowances is an illusion.  Anyway, any increase given will be whittled away because this year the increase has been matched by a reduction in the income tax allowance.  The net gain for a family <Col N="2070" /> on the 35 per cent tax rate is only £4 a year for the first child and £10 a year for each child thereafter.  There has been a net fall, therefore, of State support for the children of lower paid parents, who have been losing out steadily under Fianna Fáil budgets by comparison with others in the community.</P>
    <P>Taxation experts who, I imagine, have not a political axe to grind, have gone on record in our daily newspapers in an effort to alert people to their true position in regard to the tax concessions in this budget.  The following comment appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 11 March concerning taxation and the budget:</P>
    <P>Taxpayers' feelings of euphoria engendered by the recent budget are misplaced.  The Government have got away with it again.  Through a mixture of shrewd political planning and judicious public relations Ministers have managed to diffuse the tax bomb for a little longer.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from another article:</P>
    <P>Married couples are expected to gain most from the change in the personal tax provisions of the 1980 budget.  However, the potential gains are not as significant as most people appear to believe.  Even with sustained pay increases, many married couples could still find their living standards lower in 1980 than in 1979 due to the combined effects of inflation and the personal tax code.</P>
    <P>These are not my words; they are the views of the experts.  Here again we have this giving with one hand and taking away with the other.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that it is more difficult now to exist in this country than ever before, the main reason being the high cost of living.  Shopping today is a very sobering and bewildering experience for housewives.  With the crazy spiralling of prices damage has been done to our tourist industry.  We are simply pricing ourselves out of the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the budget was regarded as the economic barometer, the <Col N="2071" /> occasion when we had to contend with price rises and taxation and it was possible to deduce the economic trend for the rest of the financial year.  We have had a number of budgets prior to the present one.  There was a budget after it and we are threatened with an autumn budget. Apart from the increases imposed before, in and after the budget there are more mini-budgets to come.  There is the increase in the social welfare contribution and it is forecast we may expect an increase of 20 per cent in postal charges, TV licences, telephones and so on.  We are no longer confined to a major budget to resolve our problems and as an illustration of that I should like to place on record the trend of events for this year.</P>
    <P>Less than three months of 1980 have passed.  At the start of the year we had various price increases: there was an increase in the price of cigarettes in January, an increase in the price of coal of £3 per ton and an increase in the price of gas of 16 per cent&mdash;the fourth increase in eight months.  There was also an increase in the price of flour.  In the middle of January there was a major announcement by the Minister for the Environment that is bound to have the most serious repercussions on standards, amenities and employment.  I am referring to the restraint placed on local authorities confining them to an increase in rates of not more than 10 per cent of last year's figure.  Every county manager knows that is totally inadequate to provide for further development and to maintain standards.  It will not allow local authorities to maintain essential services.  Employment is seriously threatened and yet there is talk about this budget being good for the economy and for the creation of more jobs.</P>
    <P>Worse was to come.  Before January was over the same Minister gave news that shocked and appalled those of us concerned about local authority affairs especially in the important area of housing. The Minister, Deputy Barrett, announced the abolition of grants for repair and reconstruction, the abolition of the energy-saving grants as they are <Col N="2072" /> more popularly known.  There was an increase in the loan for new house building from £9,000 to £12,000 but that was inevitable having regard to inflation.</P>
    <P>I know we have had a debate on this matter during the past two days.  It will have serious repercussions in the building industry apart from denying people the facility they had to improve their homes.  The Minister's announcement dealt a deadly blow to co-operative building enterprises.  I am aware of the intrinsic work of co-operative building in my constituency.  The people involved have done very good work.  They have built housing schemes of the finest type in Clonmel, Carrick, Fethard, Waterford and many other places.</P>
    <P>When the Minister raised the loan to £12,000, he stipulated that the facility which county managers and county councils provided whereby people were given a separate loan to purchase the site be withdrawn.  My council, South Tipperary, were able to assist co-operative building groups by giving them a loan of £3,000 or £4,000 for the purchase of a site on a long-term basis over 30 or 35 years and gave the £9,000 loan on top of that.  Long before the present Minister made the £12,000 available these people were getting £12,000&mdash;and more.  We now understand that local authorities may provide £12,000 only.  This has meant the abolition of the facility whereby people were given separate loans to purchase sites.  It has meant the end of co-operative building of the kind I know.  I earnestly appeal to the Government to realise the damage they have done in that area and undo it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>That was in January last.  Talk about budgets, about economic indicators&mdash;a few days afterwards, on 28 January, CIE fares were increased by 20 per cent. This was all to take the sting out of the budget proper.  Bread, the staff of life of the poor, was taxed the same day, and milk was increased in price.  The standard loaf went up 5p and milk was increased to 13p.  There is a budget for you.  In February we had another budget: ESB accounts were increased by <Col N="2073" /> 20 per cent, 60p per week on a £25 two months' bill.  This followed 10 per cent in October and 20 per cent last June.</P>
    <P>Coal went up again in price.  We anticipated an increase in liquor and beer prices in the budget but they did not wait for the budget.  On 4 February the pint went up 2p, spirits went up 3p.  On 18 February petrol was attacked again.  We knew that perhaps petrol would jump in the budget but there again they jumped the gun: they wanted to soften the blow. Petrol went up 7p to 10p per gallon and home heating oil 6½p to 9p a gallon.  On February 20 we had the revelation of the estimates for the various departments of State and, to our consternation, many of these estimates showed massive cut-backs which are bound to have very serious repercussions as time passes. Nearly all Departments are involved but the most serious cuts are in housing, education, health and agriculture and public spending generally is hit.  This public capital programme cuts all forms of social spending.  That comprises a little of what transpired in January and February this year without going back to 1979 or further.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the budget proper. In that much-lauded budget, which so much had been done to defuse, petrol, diesel and liquid petroleum gas went up 20p a gallon; the excise duty on cars went up from 35 per cent to 40 per cent; cigarettes up 10p for 20 and <i>pro rata</i> increases for cigars and tobacco; the glass of spirits went up another 16p; we had 6p more on the pint; 40p on the bottle of table wine and 10p on the gallon of cider; 30p on table waters.  VAT was increased from 20 to 25 per cent; the charge for motor car registration went up from £5 to £10 and in the case of motor cycles from £1 to £5.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is accepted generally that one of the items responsible for giving Fianna Fáil the greatest majority of all time was the abolition of tax on cars. Here we see an abandonment of the solemn promise made in the manifesto, one of the gimmicks which gave this <Col N="2074" /> party such a massive majority here. Driving licences went up from £2 to £3. The notional method of farm tax was abolished but there are many strings attached which I shall take up later.  The threshold of liability to tax was lowered from £50 to £40.  Capital allowances are to be confined to plant and machinery only and a resource tax is to be applied to farmers with holdings of £70 valuation&mdash;£3.50 per acre.  Income tax child allowances were reduced from £218 to £195.  These are some of the measures in the budget.  It did not end there.</P>
    <P>One might feel entitled to assume that would be the limit of the bludgeoning of our people but within a very short time of those massive increases throughout January and February we had further increases. The cylinder of gas which is essential in most poor homes here, especially amongst the underprivileged, went up by nearly 80p a cylinder, and petrol was driven up still further by 2p a gallon.  Cigarettes increased still further. What kind of crazy behaviour is this? Where is the budget?  Where is the fairness?  Where is the honesty of administration in practices of this kind? Where is there any evidence of cohesion and understanding between Ministers when this can happen?  I feel pretty certain that it is not the end of the story. There is more to come; there is more in store for us.</P>
    <P>I remember very vividly, and the nation will remember as well the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, my colleague, Senator Justin Keating, being vilified in this House on prices, pilloried in the press on prices, continually lampooned on television on prices.  Many fine men lost their seats in this House by a campaign of character assassination carried out on them on this issue of prices.  Now, prices are soaring as never before, unbridled.  Before this year is out, we shall have exceeded 20 per cent inflation.  No one now denies that fact.</P>
    <P>The man who vilified most of all the then Minister, Senator Justin Keating, is now presiding over this debacle&mdash;Deputy <Col N="2075" /> Desmond O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He is presiding over this ruinous situation which he promised he would resolve.  Mind you, there is little whimpering in the country. We were all savagely attacked at that time.  The present complacency amongst all shades of public opinion in the press and the media is difficult to understand. You did not see much about prices, or the budget on Frank Hall's show last night, no.  He dealt with less controversial, more innocuous subjects.</P>
    <P>You cannot blame the price of oil or the Arabs for this sorry trend of events. No one compelled this Government to abolish the food subsidies.  No one compelled them to remove the food subsidies and, at the same time, remove the wealth tax from our millionaire classes.  The decision to remove the food subsidies was a cold-blooded, calculated, deliberate act, which they knew would increase the cost of living for the most underprivileged of our people.  The removal of the wealth tax is difficult to understand but it did demonstrate to all of us a most shocking example of social injustice, of pandering to the rich and exploitation of the poor.  It was an act which will not easily be forgotten or forgiven, which marks this party which governs our country at present as a party incapable of, bereft of, social justice.  It is clearly a party which fostered greed in its manifesto, pandered to materialism.  The gimmicks were good, the promises were lavish and the Government are now reaping the whirlwind of economic ruin and virtual bankruptcy to which they have subjected our country.  Now that things have gone haywire and backfired they cannot complain. They have sowed the seeds of their destruction in that manifesto and, unfortunately, all of us are reaping the whirlwind. Neither can this Government be listened to with interest or hope for a response when they call for responsibility and restraint from certain sections of our people, especially in a situation where our working classes can see their standards being lowered all the time by unbridled price increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2076" /> I feel that the workers of this country and the unions which represent them will not be intimidated by threats of antiunion legislation, threats of penal legislation, designed to curb the activities of the unions.  We are well aware that union bashing has been a feature of this administration in recent times, as was particularly evident at their Ard Fheis.  We have seen before, in this House, attempts being made to curb the legitimate activities of our unions.  I am certain there are people around this House who, if they got half a chance, would try to destroy the concept of trade unionism.  I am sure, too, that they have learned the lesson, as Mrs. Margaret Thatcher has, as Edward Health before her, that you cannot legislate to force men to work if they do not want to work.</P>
    <P>The direction of labour is only possible in a dictatorship.  In essence, unless inflation is halted, unless prices are controlled, wage increases will be worthless; living standards will fall; social welfare beneficiaries will suffer.  I have proved, by my remarks, that the so-called goodies of this budget are of a very transitory nature and will fade away quickly to nothing.</P>
    <P>I talked earlier about the cut-backs in Estimates.  I expressed concern about employment, by reason of what was being done in the local authority area.  I am further concerned that there is an abandonment of the alleged policy of providing more jobs in this budget.  I am concerned that the Minister for Finance made no reference to the employment maintenance scheme in his speech and concerned also about the abolition of the Department of Economic Planning, which had a useful purpose in providing more jobs.  I listened to the speech of the Minister for Labour, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  It is clear from that speech that, far from providing more jobs, the employment maintenance scheme, which was of such great value, is about to be abolished.  This is the scheme which was designed to aid those industries which were in economic difficulty&mdash;the textile, clothing, canning and footwear industries. About 370 firms involving <Col N="2077" /> 30,000 workers have benefited under the scheme, we are told by the Minister, with total cumulative payments of over £12 million up to the end of 1979 of which £7 million was paid in that year.  Some 30,000 workers benefited by the scheme. The withdrawal of the employer maintenance schemes can have most serious consequences.  It would have been a far better thing if the scheme were never introduced than that it should be withdrawn in this fashion.  The Minister implied that it was because of an EEC regulation that he was obliged to withdraw it.  That does not stand up to examination.</P>
    <P>We observe that when the French, Italians or British want to have their way in respect of preserving the interests of their communities or sections of it or their industries they proceed to do certain things in defence of their people.  There is nothing to stop the Minister from continuing with this scheme.  Its abandonment will place many of these factories in peril and place the jobs of the workers in jeopardy.  These are vulnerable industries which successive Governments have had to protect, nurture and develop as best they could.  They have now entered a free trading situation but are still subjected to unfair trading from low cost countries.  We have a right to protect them.  There is a regulation in the Rome agreement which ordains that in the case of any industry which is seriously threatened the Government of that country have a right and duty to protect it.  I earnestly appeal to the Government to reconsider the continuation of the employment maintenance scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be an acceleration of the youth employment schemes.  I do not thank this Government all that much for the work done in this area especially when it is realised that for every £100 spent on youth employment schemes we now derive £55 from the European social fund.  In that kind of happy situation any Minister should be pleased to accelerate the activity in this area and put more and more of our young people <Col N="2078" /> to work.  Previous Governments did not have that tremendous financial aid but they carried on as best they could.</P>
    <P>It is in the area of the industries to which I have referred, clothing, footwear and tanning, that the greatest damage can be done by the withdrawal of the scheme to which I referred.  I wonder if advance notice has been given to the industries concerned.  What consultation, if any, has taken place with the unions concerned?  Does the Minister realise the damage that can be done by the withdrawal of an incentive of this kind whereby £5 is paid for every worker in these industries?  I do not accept that Brussels said there was no way out.  We are a small country and to my knowledge every successive Minister in the EEC concerned with this area was made aware of the vulnerability of the textile, clothing and tanning industries here.  We are all aware of the damage which free trade has done in that area and of the loss of jobs over the years when the swaddling clothes of protection were removed and these industries were exposed to the icy blasts of free trade. There are now aids within the EEC and methods to be used.  The British have been using this system for a considerable time.  They have been aiding their industries by subsidies of this kind.  If they can do it why can we not?</P>
    <P>I spoke about the Estimates for various Departments.  There was a worrying statement from the Minister for Health in respect of hospital charges when the Minister clearly intimated that there were too many admissions to our hospitals and that they should be curtailed or controlled more effectively.  In my area it was not necessary to make such a declaration because it is extremely difficult at times to gain admission to hospital.  Our hospitals are usually full up and there is a continuous bed shortage.  One is only admitted if one really needs to be admitted.  One is not retained in hospital longer than is necessary for recovery.  This kind of statement from the Minister for Health has serious implications.  If we are to economise it is far better to do so with <Col N="2079" /> the material things of life than toying with the lives of people and patients in hospital.  There is a great danger that this admonition by the Minister will be taken too seriously in certain areas and that when people have gained admission to hospital, they will be thrown out prematurely with great pain, hardship and, let us face it, death resulting from such a declaration.</P>

      <P>I would hope that the Minister for Health would retract that statement and if, because of the implications involved, he does not, then I would hope that the Taoiseach, who held that portfolio until quite recently, would countermand that kind of order.</P>
      <P>I took notice in particular of the speech of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, an area in respect of which I have a particular responsibility in the House.  I want to avail of this opportunity to appeal to him and the Government to have special regard to a development which I regard as most reprehensible, that is, the dumping of fish around our coast.  I have questions down to the Minister asking if his attention has been drawn to the growing tendency to dump fish rather than making it available for human consumption and if he will make a statement on the matter.  I have further questions asking the Minister if he will ensure that our fishermen are adequately compensated for their labours and that catches of fish are made available to the public at prices they can afford, in particular to the poorer sections of the community for whom fish has become a luxury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is scandalous that this should occur in a Christian country.  We have seen the naked face of capitalism throughout the world with the burning of mountains of potatoes and wheat, with petrol being poured over them.  We have seen the mountains of butter in Europe but at least it was disposed of for human consumption. That this dumping of fish <Col N="2080" /> should happen in Ireland is utterly disgraceful and reprehensible at a time when so many of our poor would dearly love a meal of fish.  Fish is scarce, dear and, in our inland towns, precious.  Surely it is possible for the Minister, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the various agencies to find a method of distributing this precious food to our people, not to mention the hungry millions abroad, rather than dumping it back into the sea, spitting in the face of a bountiful nature. Having risked their lives to secure it, the fishermen spray dye on it and dump it. This is done rather than that a human being would gain a morsel of it.  I never thought I would see the day when that would happen in this country.  I ask this Government to stop this nefarious practice immediately.  By all means let us compensate our fishermen and maintain them in decent standards.  Nobody has spoken more fiercely here than I in respect of securing good standards for these men, not merely in their everyday lives but in sickness, infirmity and old age.  But let that horrible practice cease. Let us find a way of distributing this precious commodity to the people who need it.  Why can it not be refrigerated? Why can it not be distributed?  If necessary, why can it not be sent abroad if there is a surplus here?</P>
    <P>On that solemn note, deploring such a situation in a poor country with so many poor people, I appeal earnestly to this Government to stop that practice: it offends, it revolts, it cries out to heaven for justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief in my comments on this budget.  Firstly, I welcome the concessions given and improvements effected in the position of the older sections of our communty, the improvements in old age pensions generally and especially the improvement in their tax position.  It was a major irritant for our senior citizens to be in receipt of an old age pension, and perhaps a contributory pension, from their place of employment, barely making ends meet, but at the same time being asked to pay tax on a portion of their income.  It is that aspect of the budget I welcome <Col N="2081" /> most, from the points of view of the improvement effected in the pension position and also the increased allocations to those over 65 years of age who can now have an income of £4,000 per annum without paying income tax and those over 80 years of age who can have an income of £5,000 per annum free.</P>
      <P>The general taxation measures will improve the position of the PAYE earner. Not alone will it improve the position of those within the country, but it will also improve our position relative to that of Northern Ireland and our neighbours in the EEC.  Firms here found it difficult to recruit the most highly qualified people for our high technology industries when our tax situation was not nearly as good as in the case of many of our partners in the EEC.  Therefore that aspect of the budget constitutes a major advance in equity, a major improvement of the position within the country, in that we will now be able to attract the best brains and indeed bring home some of our sons and daughters who pursued academic careers in universities around the world but who may be anxious to return home and contribute to our economy.  Formerly such people, because of our very low tax bands, our almost penal taxation at a relatively low income level, found the rates of remuneration unattractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other major sector of the community who pay tax are the farmers.  In the last two years most people have become aware of the problems not alone for the farming community but for the non-farming sector, when on the one hand the farming community felt they were paying their fair share of tax while the non-farming community felt that the farmers were in a privileged position. There was almost a confrontation between the urban dweller, the PAYE taxpayer and the farming community, but the new taxation measures in the budget will certainly reduce that tension.  At the same time they will not prove a penal form of tax on the farming community. The threshold has been reduced from a valuation of £50 to £40.  In the long term I would not like to see any system of taxation <Col N="2082" /> based on PLV because of the inconsistencies of that system but I accept that in the short term we cannot do everything at once.  It must be remembered that marginal reliefs will apply and that we now have a simplified system of accounts which will make it easier for those who are brought into the tax net for the first time.</P>
    <P>It was important to make those concessions because the agricultural industry is of great benefit to the country. The PAYE sector should appreciate that 44 per cent of our workforce are dependent, directly or indirectly, on farming or agricultural produce.  Since our entry into the EEC we have had a better opportunity to sell our agricultural produce abroad and the farming community have had for the first time an opportunity to develop.  Up to now they were not in the position to pay tax.  There is a lot of misunderstanding with regard to that.  I welcome the decision to give liberal concessions to encourage those involved in the thriving agricultural industry.  It is important that the non-farming sector appreciate the position of those people; they depend on each other.  It is important to appreciate that farmers who earn a lot of money will be paying their fair share of tax under the accounts system.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Social Welfare that he make an effort to improve the situation in relation to recipients of prescribed relative allowances, those who must take care of incapacitated relatives.  The allowance is of tremendous benefit to those people and has meant that fewer incapacitated people take up hospital beds.  However, the allowance is restrictive in that if one has three people living in a house the allowance is not paid.  An improvement in that situation would prove of great help to many people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should reconsider the amount of interest allowed tax free on savings.  Up to a few years ago many young people managed to save money to pay a deposit on a new house and they were encouraged to do so, but there is little encouragement now because one is allowed only £70 interest <Col N="2083" /> tax free on deposits.  I am not an economist but I cannot see any justification for such a low allowance.  It should be remembered that those who put money on deposit have already paid tax on their earnings.  If they have up to £800 on deposit they are taxed again on the interest they earn on that amount. People should be allowed to invest at least ten times the figure which would earn £70 interest per year because of the amount of time that has elapsed since that limit was set.  A change would encourage more people to save in order to raise a deposit for a new house or house improvements.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to increase the amount of loans for new houses from £9,000 to £12,000 and the raising of the income limit to £5,500.  I was also pleased to learn that the loan for house improvements has been increased to £4,000.  Another aspect of the budget which I welcome is the trimming of public finances and the reduction of our dependence on borrowing.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis on productive areas and on our export opportunities. The decision to increase the allocation to the IDA by 22 per cent at a time of general cut-backs is also welcomed because we must keep encouraging industrialists to commence operations here.  The IDA have been doing a good job in this regard and money allocated to them is well spent.  However, they should put greater emphasis on regionalisation to encourage the siting of industries in rural areas where the population is falling and unemployment increasing. That would take some of the pressure off cities in regard to traffic and housing.  In many cases there are fine facilities in rural areas such as harbours. In Cork the major effort by the IDA is in the area of Cork city where they have acquired up to 2,000 acres but there are fine facilities in other areas of the county.  I am referring in particular to west Cork.  Bantry can boast one of the finest harbours in Europe but the IDA do not own one acre of land in that area. I hope the IDA with the increased allocation, will buy some land in that <Col N="2084" /> area.  I emphasise Bantry because the recent census revealed that two areas of County Cork showed a reduction in population, the Beara and Schull peninsulas. Bantry is located between those peninsulas.  That town is losing its population because there are no job opportunities. That is to be deplored when one considers the tremendous harbour facilities that exist there.</P>
    <P>There is a 28 per cent increase in the allocation for telecommunications. Every Member of the House must be aware of the difficulty experienced by individuals in having telephones installed, but in some cases too there is difficulty in this regard for industrialists and these people need telephone and telex systems for their businesses.  Because of the situation that prevailed in the telecommunications area we were in danger of cutting ourselves off from the rest of the industrial and commercial world but the provision within a relatively short time of the best telecommunications system possible is one of the best investments we can make.  In addition, it is an essential investment in terms of the efforts made by the IDA to attract industrialists to this country.</P>
    <P>There is a 44 per cent increase in the allocation to the ESB.  Rural Deputies will be aware of the problems of the farming community who are trying to improve their standard of farming by acquiring new electrical devices and so on but who are not able to get an adequate power supply.</P>
    <P>There is a very big increase for Córas Tráchtála.  This too is to be welcomed having regard to the work done by this body in marketing our products.  There would not be much point in our increasing production in this relatively small country if we were not in a position to export the goods we produce.  Córas Tráchtála have the task of trying to find the best markets for our products. It is important that they be given the necessary finance to enable them to do the best job possible and they have been doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>However, there have been difficulties in some areas.  Deputy Treacy referred, <Col N="2085" /> for instance, to the fishing industry.  It is difficult to understand the reason for any food product being destroyed.  There are difficulties too in the dairy industry in terms of butter mountains and skim milk powder mountains.  There would not appear to be any solution on the horizon to these problems.  The European Commission, and in particular their product management committees, should at this stage of the evolution of the whole Common Market be in a better position to undertake some forward planning in respect of these food markets.  When so many people are starving in different parts of the world it is tragic that first-class food products are either being dumped or left for a long time in cold storage.  This means that they are not being used to the best advantage of the producers.</P>
    <P>There are problems too in the pig industry. Indeed, the situation in this industry is so bad that unless a unified approach is adopted by all the parties concerned irreparable damage will be caused to the industry, an industry that is worth £200 million to the economy. The price of Irish bacon on the British market is £300 per tonne less than is the price of Danish bacon on the same market.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission are only marketing about 40 per cent of our bacon products.  The situation is that the commission and the individual bacon factories are in competition with each other, under-cutting each other and contributing generally to the fragmentation of the industry.  There is not enough emphasis on such matters as inspection of factories, better production techniques, a higher standard of hygiene and greater consistency in the quality of our pig products.</P>
    <P>Another matter which the Minister might give some attention to is the increase from 10p to 30p in the tax on table waters.  Many families buy packs of soft drinks and for them an incresase of the magnitude concerned will be quite an imposition.  The soft drinks industry employs between 7,000 and 8,000 people. Another factor in this increase is that, at <Col N="2086" /> a time when young people are being encouraged to be responsible in regard to the consumption of alcohol, they will find that soft drinks also will be very costly.  There is a need also to protect the industry.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make is one for the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and relates to the contributory old age pension.  There is a small number of people who do not qualify for this pension because stamps to their credit prior to 1953 are not taken into account in determining eligibility.  These would be people who started work in the late thirties and in the forties and who made their contributions regularly up to 1953 but because these stamps are not taken into account some of these people cannot fulfil the requirement of the mandatory number of payments for a contributory old age pension.  Perhaps in a future budget the Minister would eliminate this anomaly.</P>
    <P>The budget is very fair in terms of the redistribution of wealth.  It is particularly fair to old people.  It has taken 8,000 of our old people out of the tax net and about 75,000 people who earn less than £1,700 out of PAYE liability.  The budget has been fair to farmers and will be of benefit to the entire economy because the money being provided will be spent on expanding production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget has caused an air of gloom rather than optimism because it will not lead to economic growth.  I will refer mainly to two areas of concern, agriculture and tourism.  An atmosphere of great doubt pervades the agricultural sector, particularly dairying, and this is particularly noticeable throughout Munster where the co-operative giants in dairy processing are operating.  This air of gloom has been caused by the Government's attempt to unload an inequitable share of taxation on those engaged intensively in dairying. The comparative liability on small farmers with valuations below £40 is small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will we get away from the outmoded system of assessing tax on valuations? The system of determining PLV <Col N="2087" /> should not be applied in modern times. For instance, in Northern counties such as Monaghan valuations were determined according to suitability of land for growing flax.  In Munster the suitability of land for wheat growing was the standard, and land near the coastline was assessed on its usefulness for the production of sand, gravel and seaweed for fertilisers. Such a system should not apply these days.</P>
    <P>As I said, this budget particularly victimises the dairy farmer who is discouraged from expanding his production. I wonder does the Minister for Finance appreciate the value of dairy production and does he realise the input of machinery and fertilisers necessary, different types of machinery for different seasons.  I can tell him that his new impositions on such farmers, particularly the resource tax, have had a strong reaction among farming organisations and this is obvious from the statements made by the IFA and the ICMSA who have been unusually strong in condemning the budget.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a drop in agricultural output and the prospects for 1980, particularly in the cattle trade, are very gloomy.  Now this new resource tax is casting a shadow over the entire industry. I wonder if this new form of taxation on farmers has anything to do with the preponderance of Ministers from outside rural areas?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that this resource tax on farmers is a temporary expedient.  I am afraid it is a substitution for another tax, the 2 per cent levy last year on farm production which was dropped on 1 January this year.  In fact, in 1979 many farmers were paying this levy on losses.  This year all farmers with valuations of more than £40 will not have rates abatement and this disadvantage must be added to the new resource tax.</P>
    <P>In fact, the farmer with a valuation of £40-£42 and who is not liable for income tax could be in an even worse position than a man who has to pay tax because he can offset his rates bill against his income tax.  The man with a valuation of <Col N="2088" /> £40 is paying double the rates he paid previously.  It is very difficult to understand the reasons for this vicious tax on people who have an uncertain income and who have held onto their holdings during the years despite that limited income. These people did not build up their businesses on the basis of a 40-hour week&mdash;many of them worked an 80-hour week.  At some stage there will be recognition of the long hours worked by people in the farming industry and I hope that will come sooner rather than later.  Those engaged in the fertiliser and the tractor industries have said that their sales are not as buoyant as previously. The present tax system for farmers is short-sighted, immature and ill-advised.</P>
    <P>People engaged in the tourist industry&mdash;particularly in areas remote from major centres of population&mdash;have grave reservations about the budget.  An accumulation of factors has made the future most uncertain for the owners of guesthouses, hotels and those engaged in farm holidays.  Tourists from Britain or from the North of Ireland are immediately confronted with our high cost of petrol&mdash;a gallon of petrol costs 32p more here than in the North of Ireland. This makes the prospect of a 200-mile journey to a seaside resort most unattractive to the tourist.  I ask the Minister for Finance to consider issuing some type of voucher to tourists in order to reduce costs for them.  There is little point in Bord Fáilte and the tourism bodies doing a relatively good job in promotional work if tourists find that the cost of living and the cost of travel is higher here than obtains elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Another factor that will discourage tourists is the extraordinary tax put on drink.  There has been an increase of 16p on a glass of spirits, 6p on a pint of beer, 10p on a packet of cigarettes and an increase of 30p per gallon on mineral water.  The owner of a diesel car will have to pay an extra 20p per gallon on diesel.  All of those factors combine to make this country less attractive to tourists.  The Minister for Finance should do something to redress the wrongs in the areas of agriculture and tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" /> There has been much adverse comment on the recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment with regard to reconstruction grants.  In their manifesto Fianna Fáil said they would introduce a scheme for house improvement grants.  They did this and it was welcomed, but now they have decided to abandon the scheme.  Even worse, they have decided to abandon all reconstruction grants and grants in respect of group water schemes have been reduced by 8 per cent.  This will hit people of limited means.  It will affect people who purchase their house from the local authority.  It has been the practice that when tenants become owners they tend to improve or extend their premises. These people have modest means and they wish to make the best of their houses.  Small contractors and builders providers are worried about the Government's decision.  They know that their sales of building materials will decline. Even the individual block-layer, plasterer and electrician will have less employment.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister for Finance at some stage this year would introduce a supplementary allowance and give some scope to the Minister for the Environment to maintain the relatively good record he has established since he was appointed.  It is very unreasonable to expect that he should carry the can when retrenchment is being made and he is not allowed adequate finance in areas with great scope for employment. I hope the combined wisdom of the Minister's colleagues in the Cabinet will enable them to understand that we have a nation of comparatively small farmers and many workers.  In my own county 70 per cent of the farmers are in holdings of under £20 land valuation. You cannot continue depriving people of what they have been accustomed to and expect that the party responsible will hold its popularity.  I am not clear whether the Minister for the Environment is responsible for the local improvements scheme.  Are you responsible, Minister?</P>

      <P>Seriously, I am referring to this reduction which is not peculiar to Clare; others have had to accept reductions also.  I shall attempt to show that it is a more serious loss to Clare. Everybody appreciates the importance of developing areas where we have energy.  We can boast that we have turbary galore in our country, but in order to gain access to these places containing <Col N="2091" /> hidden energy one must in present transport conditions have an adequate road system.  I would have expected that the Government would have thought it necessary to inject adequate capital for this purpose, even double last year's amount, in 1980 and show their concern for developing this energy by increasing grants.  For some peculiar reason it is not done.  I ask the Minister to use his influence in this area and at least to give some increase on last year's allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>You may have fewer roads to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, we have a very long list.  When a three years' wait is involved and you get a reduced allocation you probably end up by doubling or trebling the delay. Meanwhile deterioration will increase and the outlay will be much higher.  The Minister would be saving money if he were to divert money in this direction. Money is spent in areas in which some people doubt it is as advantageous as in the areas I mention.  I hope the Minister will take particular note of my remarks and that we shall have some result.</P>
      <P>We in the west experienced, particularly last year, the disadvantages of a prolonged Post Office dispute as a result of which tourism suffered.  We had also hoped for improvements in the telephone system.  I must say publicly that the Clare exchanges, even the manual exchanges, are equal to the best in the country.  I have no complaints from any source about the standard of service provided by the workers.  But the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did not tell us and neither did the Minister for Finance tell us about the proposed increases.  Why they were not mentioned in the budget the Minister knows best himself, but we can anticipate huge increases in postal and telephone charges during the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the increases which have been mentioned and those on which the Government have remained silent are contributing to an increased cost of living. In fact, they are wiping out some of <Col N="2092" /> the goodies which the Government announced. When you reach the stage that a person on a widow's pension, for example, will get three loaves of bread for £1 you wonder where the cost of living will stop or what social welfare increases should be given to compensate for the outrageous escalation of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell Deputies about the rise in the price of coal and the 20 per cent on electricity, all combining to make miserable the lives of people of very limited income.  We had great hopes for education, that we would see in the budget some improvement in the raising of standards of our schools and the erection, where necessary, of replacement schools.  We can remember when the former Minister for Education, Deputy Peter Barry, in his wisdom, decided some time ago that the journey to school for children of tender years would end and that rural schools&mdash;two-teacher schools in particular&mdash;would be retained.  The present Government and their predecessor had conflicting views on that.  They had in mind the establishment of central schools, with convoys of buses taking children of tender years to school every morning.  In the light of the present energy crisis, Deputy Peter Barry had foresight.</P>
    <P>We now find that finance to bring up the standard of national schools is not made available.  We find too many schools in the country where basic hygienic facilities are not available&mdash;not even water or sewerage.  Money is not available to bring about school improvements. This strikes at the very foundation of education in the primary areas. We may, however, have another budget in which there may be provision for the schools I have referred to, but at the moment there does not seem to be much hope of this.</P>
    <P>I must express my disappointment and that of the farming community at the unequal share of taxes to be borne by the smaller man, which is resented.  I hope that conscience will influence the people who have made those wrong decisions and that that, coupled with the activity <Col N="2093" /> which will be promoted by the farming organisations, will bring about a rapid redress of the wrongs in those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution I intend to deal in particular with matters pertaining to my own Department of the Environment. We all realise the importance of this Department to our society and to our local communities in regard to improving standards of living and giving the necessary services to people throughout the country at local authority level.  This year, between grants and the Public Capital Programme, my Department will be making available £540 million to local authorities paid through the Department. To make a comparison, three years ago, in 1977, this sum amounted to £281 million, so we are talking about virtually doubling the amount of money in the space of three years.  This is a substantial increase in a short time.  This is not the only money available to local authorities or spent by local authorities throughout the year.  They have their own revenue also which they collect&mdash;rates and charges for services and so on&mdash;and the total amount will be £740 million this year, in 1980.</P>
      <P>I presume that everyone is aware of the notification which I have sent to local authorities regarding the rating situation and the 10 per cent. limit.  It is necessary to have a limit, as I am sure most rational people will agree.  It is a budgetary matter and must be aligned to other Government spending within the context of the budget.  It is necessary to have some limit on the increase in rates. Not only is it a protection to some extent for the Exchequer and the taxpayers, but it also serves as a protection for the remaining ratepayers, namely farmers, industrialists, business people and those who continue to be liable for rates.  It protects people in these categories from drastic increases and from having to carry more than their share of the rates burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> The Government and the Exchequer are now the biggest contributor to the rating system and the money spent.  We are the biggest ratepayer now; that is what it amounts to.  In 1976 the Exchequer, particularly on the agricultural grant, contributed £1 out of every £4 raised through the rating system.  In 1980 the Exchequer's contribution will amount to £3 out of every £5, between grants in lieu of the domestic rate and the agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>A liability of this size cannot be permitted to be open-ended, as I hope we all appreciate.  To secure a fair alignment of local Government needs with those of other sectors, the limit has been imposed. This year, in 1980, the Exchequer will contribute a total of £144 million to local authorities in respect of rates on domestic dwellings, agricultural land and farm outbuildings, secondary schools and community centres.  There is no question of local authorities expenditure being held back to 10 per cent, I should point out, over the 1979 figure.  For example, in the past two years limits to rate increases were also applied.  The limit last year was 10 per cent and in 1978, 11 per cent.  In those years because of valuation buoyancy and other factors local authorities were able to budget in their gross current expenditure for increases of 17 per cent and 17½ per cent in 1979 and 1978 respectively.</P>
    <P>This is a very important factor which must be borne in mind.  These increases have enabled very significant improvements to be made in local authority services. I am confident that in 1980 local authorities by good management of their own resources will be able to maintain their services at reasonable levels, as they have done in previous years.  In many areas there will be scope for real worthwhile improvements and, as I have explained, the 10 per cent is not strictly 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Some councils have criticised this, but it should be remembered that only three years ago the rating authorities were striking the rate themselves.  As far as the authority was concerned the percentage increase could have been regarded as <Col N="2095" /> open-ended.  The last time they struck a rate was in 1977.  I will give some examples of the figures for different counties and the percentage increases decided on in that year.  Cork Corporation's rate increased by 5 per cent and Kerry County Council's&mdash;where they seem to have had a big problem earlier this week with regard to striking the rate&mdash;increased by 5.2 per cent.  Very few went over 10 per cent.  Dublin County Council increased their rate by 5.5 per cent in 1977.  Critics should be reminded of the fact that when they had freedom to strike a rate they imposed an increase of between 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  The restriction which I am held responsible for is not as grave as people try to make out.  With buoyancy the increase is far more than 10 per cent.  The rates are not placing the restriction on counties that some local authorities would have us believe.</P>
    <P>As regards the building industry, output grew very rapidly in 1978 and 1979. A growth rate of over 14 per cent was achieved in 1978 and an estimated growth of 12 to 14 per cent in 1979. Some 10,000 additional jobs have been directly provided in this industry since July 1977.  An estimated 3,000 further jobs have been provided in ancillary industries such as building materials, manufacturers and suppliers.  Despite economic difficulties the Government's commitment to the industry continues into 1980.  The overall Public Capital Programme in 1980 is estimated at £1,154 million which represents a 15 per cent increase over last year's level.  The increase in the portion of the Public Capital Programme which directly affects the building industry is greater, at more than £722 million, 18 per cent higher than in 1979.</P>
    <P>The remarkable growth in output since 1977 has been a great boost to the confidence of an industry which had previously gone through a very severe recession.  It also brought its problems. The evidence of over-heating towards the end of 1978 became more obvious in 1979.  There were widespread shortages of labour and some materials.  This led to worries among people in the industry <Col N="2096" /> about the capacity of the industry to cope with continuing very high levels of annual increases in output.</P>
    <P>Housing is the most important sector of the building industry.  The number of new houses completed in 1979 was 26,544 compared with 24,000 in 1976, 24,548 in 1977 and 25,444 in 1978.  This improvement in the number of new houses results directly from housing policies which have been pursued by the Government.  Capital provided to finance the housing programme has increased from £100 million in 1977 to £159 million this year.  The Public Capital Programme allocation for housing has been increased in the current year to more than £182 million.  This amount is the second largest allocation to any sector in the programme.  By contrast I can recall that public capital expenditure on housing dropped from £115 million in 1975 to £105 million in 1976 and to £100 million in 1977.</P>
    <P>Home improvements grants have been mentioned in the debate.  The Minister of State in my Department dealt with this during the week in Private Members' time.  I should point out that, apart from discontinuing the home improvements grants, as announced in January we increased the loans available for house improvements. One can now get an unsecured loan of up to £1,000 and with reasonable security up to £4,000.  People who qualify for these grants are not left bereft of any moneys to carry out the necessary improvements.  A lot of money allocated was used for unnecessary improvements although many people really needed to extend their premises by building extra bedrooms and so on. Some improvements were not as necessary as we would have liked them to be.  It is a question of spending the money available for housing in a manner which would be more beneficial to the people really in need.</P>
    <P>We also increased SDA loans from £9,000 to £12,000.  We increased the income limit to £5,500.  When I became Minister in 1977 the income limit was £2,350.  That is an appreciable increase and makes it possible for people to <Col N="2097" /> provide their own homes, as most Irish people wish to do.  The same increases apply to the low rise mortgage scheme, which is a worthwhile one.  As people living in rented local authority dwellings avail of this scheme, more local authority houses become vacant and are available for those who cannot build their own houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be discussed with the Minister for Finance.  It is his responsibility.  We made £10 million available for bridging finance at the end of last year, which was a help.  I do not hear as much criticism of the non-availability of bridging loans as there was, say, at the end of last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pay any bridging finance.</P>
      <P>Of course, the £1,000 new house grant continues for those who qualify; that has not been discontinued.  With regard to local authority housing we have undertaken to keep the level of building as it was for the last two years. Last year we built a total of just over 6,200 local authority houses.  We intend to keep up that level of building during the current year.  My colleague, the Minister of State in my Department, dealt extensively with housing and so on this week, I shall not go over that ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report to the House that significant progress has been made in the provision of water and sewerage services.  Since I became Minister in 1977 the capital allocation for public water supply and sewerage schemes has been increased from less than £25 million in 1977 to £40 million in 1980, an increase of over 60 per cent. I have been able to approve, for commencement, a total of 123 major public schemes estimated to cost £85 million. Also in 1979 I increased the cost limit <Col N="2098" /> for small schemes from £20,000 to £30,000.  To finance this greatly increased level of investment the Government have availed of every opportunity to procure financial assistance for water and sewerage facilities from EEC sources.  In the last two-and-a-half years or so the EEC have approved grants totalling £11.4 million from the European Regional Development Fund for public water and sewerage schemes.  In that period grants totalling £2.6 million have been approved from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, FEOGA, for public and private rural water schemes.  Loans totalling £128,500,000 from the European Investment Bank have been approved for public water and sewerage schemes. Many of these loans will qualify for interest subsidies arising from our membership of the EMS.</P>
    <P>Naturally the increased flow of finance to sanitary services is having an impact at local level.  Major schemes now in progress include the greater Dublin Drainage Scheme at a total estimated cost of £36.5 million and the Liffey Aqueduct Water Supply Scheme at a total estimated cost of £9.8 million. These two schemes should cater for the water and sewerage requirements of Dublin into the nineties and can be expanded to cater for longer term requirements.</P>
    <P>The Government have ensured that, in catering for the needs of Dublin, the needs of other areas have not been overlooked.  Major schemes in progress in other areas include the Cork City and Harbour Water Supply Scheme, at an estimated total cost of £42 million, the Shannon South Shore Water Supply Scheme, at an estimated cost of £6.6 million, and the Castlebar Water Supply Scheme at an estimated cost of £8 million.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous upsurge in the number of private group water supply schemes by local communities with generous grant assistance from the Government.  The Government have substantially increased grants for these schemes from a maximum of £200 per <Col N="2099" /> house to a maximum of £300.  An additional grant of up to £200 is payable for farm supply.  The Government have taken over liability for supplementary grants formerly payable by local authorities, thereby relieving ratepayers of the financial liability that involved.</P>
    <P>As a result of these Government measures State expenditure on group scheme grants increased from £1.1 million in 1976 to £4.3 million in 1979. The number of domestic water installations, by way of group schemes, has increased from 6,187 in 1976 to 10,940 in 1979, or by 77 per cent.  The future prospects for group schemes are bright. At the end of 1979 work was in progress on schemes to provide piped water for approximately 8,200 additional houses and nearly 200 schemes have been designed to serve a further 6,850 houses.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware already of the Government's commitment to the improvement of the public roads network. The Road Development Plan for the eighties outlines the priorities for State investment in this area.  The Vote provision of £47.969 million for road grants in 1980 provides for continuing progress along with the maintenance and improvement programme, particularly in relation to the national routes, in line with the objectives of the plan.  On foot of this provision I have been enabled to allocate grants totalling over £53 million this year.  Compared with the level of grants in recent years this represents a significant commitment by the Government to tackling the deficiencies in our roads system.  The recent deterioration in the maintenance standards of some of the principal roads has been a source of great concern to me and my Department. The factors contributing to this situation&mdash;weather conditions, costs, increased numbers of heavy vehicles &mdash;make it imperative for road authorities to have a greater awareness of the urgency of remedial measures. The Road Development Plan has identified, as a priority, the preservation of the road infrastructure to a satisfactory level of service, thereby ensuring continued benefit from previous investment <Col N="2100" /> in the roads network.  The other consequences of a poor standard of maintenance, particularly on heavily trafficked roads, will become readily apparent in increased fatalities, serious injury to road users and in damage to vehicles. In conjunction with the notification to road authorities of the grants for 1980 I have brought especially to the attention of each city and county manager the urgency of the maintenance problem and the importance of early identification and treatment of deficiencies.  In that context I am particularly pleased that I have been enabled to make grants for the maintenance of the national routes totalling £9.3 million, representing an increase of more than 40 per cent over the normal maintenance grants allocated for these routes last year.</P>
    <P>During my term as Minister for the Environment I have given much consideration to the promotion of safety on the roads.  Positive steps I took towards that end include amending legislation on drunken driving in 1978 and, later, measures for the compulsory use of seat belts and crash helmets.  I am glad to put on record that additional moneys which are being made available this year to the Medical Bureau on Road Safety, which carries out analysis in connection with drunken driving suspects, and the National Road Safety Association, which organises programmes and publicity on road safety, will enable both bodies to carry out their activities on an increased scale.</P>
    <P>The exceptional provision made for the local improvement schemes in 1979 enabled local authorities to go a long way to catching up with outstanding work.  Returns which I received showed that applications on hand have been considerably reduced.  Nevertheless, I am pleased that we are able to provide a further £2 million for the service this year which is of such benefit in particular to our western counties where the need is greatest.</P>
    <P>A budget debate tends to be concerned for the most part with practical financial and economic matters.  That is inevitable, but these are not the only important <Col N="2101" /> considerations in our modern society.  Good environmental conditions are more highly valued now and more in demand than in earlier times.  Many of the major financial provisions in the budget have environmental implications. Industrial and agricultural developments, housing, roads and sanitary services can have far reaching environmental consequences.  Environmental conditions in our country are not without blemishes and black spots, but the condition of our natural resources and amenities and the quality of air and water over the country as a whole cannot be equalled in many countries which have higher material living standards. We have to be careful to maintain the good quality and to act to restore the position where damage has occurred.</P>
    <P>The growth and movement of population, the expansion in industry, the changing patterns in industry, the increase in tourism and so on are in themselves all healthy developments, but they can and will bring additional environmental pressures and we have to be geared to deal with those pressures.  The Government are responding to this need. As the first Minister for the Environment I have been assigned the general responsibility to promote the protection and improvement of the environment.  I have been entrusted with the specific function of preparing for Government approval proposals for a national environment policy and keeping this policy under review.  Such a policy would formally indicate the objectives to be achieved.  It would be a means to ensure that the needs of the environment are given adequate consideration when major decisions affecting it are made.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Council which I set up to advise me generally in this area have already furnished a preliminary assessment of what is involved in their report, Towards an Environment Policy. This document has been published in order to encourage public debate.  The report has been widely distributed and is at present being re-printed.  Frankly, I would have hoped for more public attention being given to the report, especially <Col N="2102" /> by the media, as a positive development of genuine public interest.  I have written to the council encouraging them to continue to expedite their work in this area.  I expect to have definitive advice from them on the question of policy later this year.  I will then consider what further decisions and commitments in this area will be appropriate. We have to be sure that our own legislative system is developed in line with the new needs.  The legislation on the physical planning system and on water pollution has been updated and improved in recent years.  Other aspects of the control system, those relating to waste collection and disposal, air pollution and noise abatement are being examined to see what further improvements are needed.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring forward proposals for additional legislation in this area as soon as possible.  The collection and disposal of waste poses serious environmental problems.  The problem tends to grow with population increases, greater urbanisation and economic development.  There is one aspect to which I wish to refer, the European Community's regulations of 1979 which I made on 7 December 1979 and which will come into force on 1 April 1980. Those regulations give effect to the EEC framework directive on waste which is designed to ensure that human health and the environment are protected against harmful effects caused by the collection, transport, treatment, storage and tipping of waste.  As from 1 April it will be an offence for a holder of waste to permit its disposal by any person other than a public waste collector or a person holding a permit under the regulations.</P>
    <P>Any person who decides to dispose of waste himself must do so in a manner which will not endanger human health or harm the environment.  The responsibilities of local authorities in regard to waste have hitherto been limited to household waste.  They are extended by the regulations to all types of commercial and industrial waste, with certain limited exceptions.  Local authorities will be obliged to prepare waste disposal <Col N="2103" /> plans for their areas.  They are empowered to issue permits to persons for treating, tipping or storing waste on behalf of other persons and to supervise the collection and transportation of waste.  My Department have issued detailed guidelines to local authorities regarding the regulations.  I have asked that local authorities adopt a co-operative approach with the private sector disposal industry.  The respective roles of the local authority and the private sector in waste disposal are complementary. The provision of adequate facilities for the disposal of industrial waste is an essential part of the infrastructure required for the establishment of new industrial projects.  My Department have requested local authorities to pay particular attention to the need which exists for such provision to be made in their waste disposal plans.</P>
    <P>Many worthwhile schemes have been carried out under the environmental improvement schemes programme, which has now been in operation for two-and-a-half years.  Subject to certain guidelines, the selection and execution of works has been the responsibility of local authorities.  Works undertaken have been of environmental, recreational or amenity value to the community.  They have included the provision of parks, open spaces, playing fields, playgrounds, other sports facilities, picnic sites and car parks in areas of scenic attraction or recreational utility The works carried out have mainly been of continuing rather than temporary benefit.  To a significant extent most of the more pressing needs have now been met.  The need to curb expenditure on services not absolutely essential will mean some contraction of the environmental improvement schemes in 1980.  A total of £3.2 million is being provided in 1980 of which £1,500,000 features in my Department's Estimate. The Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment set up under the national understanding have approved of the allocation of £1.7 million from the special employment guarantee fund for environmental works.  This money is expected to provide employment of 250 <Col N="2104" /> man years, largely for young people.</P>
    <P>An adequate level of investment in the fire service is essential for the protection of life, of property and of employment. The capital allocation for fire stations and equipment has been increased significantly in the past few years.  It is my policy to promote the development of all aspects of the service in order to enable it to meet the growing demands being made on it.  This year's allocation will enable local authorities to press ahead with their programmes for the provision of urgently needed fire stations and for the acquisation of modern fire-fighting equipment.  As a measure of the progress being achieved I should mention that 12 new fire stations or extensions were completed during the past two years, that nine are at present in the course of construction and that a further 12 are expected to commence this year, In addition, there were approved by my Department in the past two years proposals for financing the purchase of 34 new fire appliances.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to outline the main provisions of the budget that concern my Department.  As I have pointed out, there are not any serious cut-backs though some people maintained when the Book of Estimates was published that there were cut-backs.  Instead there are substantial increases in all sectors with the exception of local improvements and environmental schemes in respect of which there is a small decrease.  The local improvements schemes were at a standstill up to 1977 but they were revised by this Government.  Since then much work has been carried out by the local authorities in respect of roads which come under these schemes.  The number of outstanding schemes has decreased considerably in the past couple of years.  I should have been more happy if additional moneys could have been made available under the scheme in some counties, but we have endeavoured to make the money available in areas in which the need was greatest.</P>
    <P>Much excellent work has been executed, too, under the environmental schemes.  These schemes were of a temporary <Col N="2105" /> nature and were designed to create employment.  They were effective and they are not being cut-back completely as there is still some money available for them.  This will enable much work to be effected in the current year.</P>
    <P>The allocation to local authorities of the sizeable sum of £540 million, or twice the amount that was made available to them in 1977, is a manifestation of the commitment on the part of the Government to enable local authorities to provide services for the people at local level, service to which people are entitled.  It will be seen then, that again the Government are being very generous in the provision of moneys for such work as road structure improvement and the provision of water supplies.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent increase in rates has been criticised, but as I have pointed out the buoyancy in each local authority would be much greater than 10 per cent. Although domestic dwellings have been derated, new houses continue to be valued by the Valuation Office and my Department are responsible for paying the rates on these new buildings.  In some areas the buoyancy is as high as 18 per cent.  When the local authorities were striking a rate in 1977 they were very reluctant to strike an increase of the order of 10 per cent.  Very many of them were striking a rate of increase of 5 or 6 per cent and up to 9 per cent in some cases.  This was at a time when they had freedom to do so.  Having regard to the buoyancy situation the 10 per cent increase is a generous allocation.  Before people rush in to criticise in this area they should have regard to their own records when, as members of local authorities they were striking rates.  They should compare what happened then with the increases of the last three years of, respectively, 11, 10 and 10 per cent. These controlled increases protect the rated sector such as farmers, business people and others who still pay rates. These people will not be called on to bear any part of the burden of the rates for which the Exchequer assumed responsibility when we were returned to office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to comment generally on the budget and then to consider some aspects of it in greater detail. While we are discussing the annual budget we are in the difficulty that every other day there is what amounts to a budget.  I condemn strongly the way in which the Government since being returned to office have been gearing people to expect harsh budgets.  We have had the Taoiseach and the various Ministers telling the people that they must tighten their belts, that the situation is bad and that we must live within our means. Prior to this year's budget each Minister was engaged in making his own contribution to the production of a reasonably favourable budget.  In his Clarecastle speech the Minister for the Environment announced that the Exchequer would benefit to the extent of about £20 million as a result of the discontinuance of the reconstruction and repair grants for houses.  I shall deal with this change at a later stage.  The Minister's attitude in this regard would seem to be indicative of the way in which the country's finances are being managed.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to say that there are not some people who will benefit from the budget.  I have conceded already that in some areas there are worthwhile concessions, but it would be unforgivable of me to say that the budget tackles in any worthwhile or effective way the problems of our economy.  The budget has fuelled the fires of inflation, and in respect of job creation and of our greatest industry it will do untold damage while in other areas it will not have any effect one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which worries me slightly.  In recent years budgets have seemed to favour groups with the strongest muscle.  This was most pronounced after last year's budget in which the Minister decided&mdash;in my opinion it was daft&mdash;to introduce the 2 per cent levy on farmers.  The farmers took to the streets and brought organised pressure to bear on the Minister.  Some of his backbenchers rebelled, and the Minister had to do some rethinking.  In a <Col N="2107" /> period of three months the levy was on, off and on again.  Eventually the Minister capitulated in part and went back on his budget speech.</P>
    <P>We had PAYE workers in the streets. On the day of their march I had occasion to drive through about five towns in County Cork to attend a local authority meeting and it was frightening to see the numbers in the streets demanding PAYE relief.  Because of that pressure, because of the collective strength of the PAYE workers' organisations, the Government rushed to their apparent rescue.</P>
    <P>All this makes it appear that if any group have the numerical strength all they need to do is to take to the streets and put on pressure.  Therefore, it looks as if groups who are sufficiently numerous and who have sufficiently strong organisations will succeed if they show their strength and that those who are weak will not succeed.  It is an undesirable trend which has created a very bad image of the Government, particularly since 1977.  It has projected an image of Government weakness at a time when Fianna Fáil have 84 Dáil seats.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a Government of moral courage who will not take decisions simply because they will be popular and perhaps buy votes.  A Government should take decisions even if they are unpopular.  It is very easy to govern if you do not take unpopular decisions, if you take the line of least resistance, but the long-term interests of the country may demand otherwise.</P>
    <P>Earlier I spoke of inflation and the effect of the 20p a gallon increase on petrol.  The Minister for Finance described this as a discretionary tax.  I am surprised because the Minister for Finance was elected in a constituency largely rural.  He must realise that this increase in the price of petrol will be detrimental to most people in rural areas because it will affect every industry, particularly the major one of agriculture, and it will start off another spate of wage and price increases.  In rural areas workers have to travel up to 26 miles to get to work, for instance, in Castlemore <Col N="2108" /> Brickworks in my constituency, and this increase in the price of petrol will cause considerable hardship.</P>
    <P>When we talked about increases in oil prices we blame the Arabs.  They are not the only cause of the inflationary spiral, because when we find Ministers contributing to increased prices we must blame them, too, for inflationary trends and we must say that we have some Arabs at home as well.  The Taoiseach has made the frightening statement that inflation may be running at 20 per cent before 1980 is out.  I describe it as frightening because it will affect the entire economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment who has just finished his speech &mdash;modesty has never been one of his strongest points&mdash;went through a long list of water and sewerage schemes completed and extra houses built, and he compared all this with the achievements of the Minister for the Environment in the National Coalition, particularly in the earlier part of 1977.  He spoke of the statutory limit of 10 per cent imposed on local authority financing.  He referred to the time when local authorities were free to strike their own rates and he said that in those days they did not come near a 10 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>I agree it is necessary to impose some control, particularly when a smaller number of ratepayers are paying larger amounts and when people are put to the pin of their collar to pay higher rates. However, it is wrong to impose a 10 per cent limit at a time when local authorities are faced with a massive backlog of work and when they need more money to get it done.</P>
    <P>One would think from his speech that the Minister is unaware of the problems cited by Deputy Taylor earlier, particularly in regard to roads.  Not so long ago, after seven requests the Minister met a deputation from Cork County Council in regard to the allocation of money for roads.  We were looking for an increased allocation for county roads in particular.  I do not wish to score any political points when I appeal to the Minister to do something about our <Col N="2109" /> roads which are so bad that it will take a massive injection of capital to improve them.  One could shelter from a shower in some of the potholes in our roads in County Cork.  Indeed it has been said of them that if your car hit one of the potholes it would go into orbit.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think the Minister for the Environment can boast of achievements in the past three years.</P>
    <P>Every member of a local authority is aware of the problem of pollution.  I know the Minister is concerned about the matter and is anxious to help.  In many areas raw sewage is pumped into rivers because of the lack of money to provide proper treatment plants.  This is happening in County Cork and the Minister knows it.  I am glad that the Minister dealt with the question of refuse collection because this is creating problems for the environment.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority and have been chairman on a number of occasions.  I am sure the difficulties we encounter in Cork are not peculiar to that area.  One problem is the acquisition of sites for properly controlled refuse dumps.  We must make sure that people will not have to take to the streets again to demonstrate against the location of dumps.  This is an important matter that must be tackled.  The record of the Minister and the local authorities in this area is not good.  They should insist that refuse dumps be properly controlled and supervised and not pollute the environment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the Government's decision to discontinue reconstruction grants from 1 February.  I do not care what the Minister said with regard to other areas where money is being provided.  One cannot get away from the fact that in 1978 there were 60,000 applicants for reconstruction grants.  The Minister of State present has experience of local authority matters and I am sure he will agree with me that the question of housing for young married couples is an important one.  Even though the reconstruction grant was never very attractive, at least it was an incentive. <Col N="2110" /> There was also a reconstruction loan available.  Many young couples on finding that they could not afford a new house reconstructed old rural cottages with the aid of a grant or a loan.  This gave them a reasonable home.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the problems faced by couples with young families who have to live in mobile homes.  In County Cork a family must be on the waiting list for a house for two to five years.  I do not know what is the position in some of the larger cities; it appears a family would nearly need a football team to qualify for a house.  I know the situation existing in my part of the country because I am chairman of the Southern Housing Committee of Cork County Council.  Members of local authorities are approached every day by people who are living in squalor, in caravans and in mobile homes, in which they must rear their children.  It was a disastrous step to discontinue the reconstruction grants because it has removed from our housing pool a number of old houses that will not be repaired now.  When we are discussing the Estimate for the Department of the Environment I shall deal in detail with water schemes, particularly group water schemes, and the problems confronting many of those engaged in such work.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the concessions given to old age pensioners, to the PAYE sector and to the other reliefs granted in the budget.  In my view the budget was anti-farmer and anti-rural. Once again there is the threat on the part of the farming community of a reaction to the resource tax and the prospect of a repetition of what happened with regard to the 2 per cent levy.  It does nothing but damage when people take to the streets. It gives bad example to young people for whom we are trying to provide employment. We want to encourage them to be law-abiding citizens.  The farming community have got a raw deal from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment created further problems for the farming community when he reduced the threshold for the agricultural grant to <Col N="2111" /> £40.  I have a question down to the Minister asking about this matter and inquiring about the amount of revenue to local authorities in any given year.  I know that in County Cork the income from that would be approximately £880,000 in one year.  Farmers with a valuation of £40 do not know that their rates increase will mean they will be paying more than £300 extra rates in County Cork as a result of the removal of that grant.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for the Environment, as a result and arising from the Supreme Court decision in the recent Murphy case what is the position where you have a farm in joint ownership of husband and wife of over £40 land valuation.  What effect will the Supreme Court decision have on that sort of situation? Further, what is the position in regard to two farms held in ownership by a husband and a wife?  Is there to be an aggregate or are they entitled to be assessed separately for rates purposes? It does not matter whether it is rates or tax, whatever way it is paid it is an imposition on the farming community.  A £40 valuation does not represent a very big farm and in my opinion it is a severe hardship on those who will be called on to pay up.</P>
    <P>Generally on farm taxation, I believe farmers should pay their fair share but nobody has yet defined &ldquo;a fair share&rdquo;. Even though the Minister for Finance spent considerable time talking about equity I do not think this budget will be remembered for equity in imposing taxation; I think the budget contains some inequities. I am pleased that the Minister&mdash;this is a personal view &mdash;decided to provide a mobile tax advisory service for people and farmers in particular who are coming into the tax net for the first time.  There is considerable confusion and there is fear of the unknown among the vast majority of farmers.  They are neither trained nor accustomed to keep accounts; they work hard; they are not good at books and do not keep accounts.  They are terrified that a tax inspector will descend on them some day and that they will be in difficulties <Col N="2112" /> in trying to provide the necessary documentation and so on required by those people.  I am glad they will have access&mdash;free of charge I take it&mdash;to an advisory service that will inform them about their tax position and that there will be an easing-in of people coming into taxation for the first time.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to question, in relation to the farming community, tax on accounts. I have a personal view on this. The State and everybody in it owe a deep debt of gratitude to progressive farmers who have used their resources to produce the maximum from the land they possess.  There are too many producing the minimum from valuable resources which the country can ill afford not to use fully.  I am dealing in particular with the dairy industry.  Many progressive dairy farmers have now achieved more than a cow per acre. They work hard and there is a family input. Anybody with experience of dairy farming will agree that at this time of year there is no end to the hours a farmer, his wife and very often young children will contribute to the enterprise in which the more they produce the more they pay in income tax.  We owe nothing to the land owner whether resident or not; we owe nothing to people who sit on a valuable resource and do nothing with it.  I therefore say that our tax code should be so geared as to ensure that it will act as an incentive to increased production rather than a disincentive.  I believe that a disincentive in farm accounts can and will create a drop in production.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said the resource tax will be introduced at a valuation of £70 and over and he said the threshold will not be changed for three years.  I think that is rubbish because the Minister does not know whether he will be there for that time.  If you go back to the manifesto of 1977, which is well remembered by every farmer who feels betrayed by it, there was a commitment there, in order to get votes from farmers, that the notional system would remain and that it would be optional and that there would be a fairer <Col N="2113" /> system of taxation for the farming community. That has gone by the board and how does the Minister expect, with that background, that the people will accept this from him?  The thresholds will not stay at £70 or at £40; like everything else, they will keep closing in to bring in more and more.  That is the attitude of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I forecast at the beginning of the year that there will be a serious drop in milk production.  That will have the effect across the board of reducing job opportunities and employment which are very important factors.  The jobs created from the agricultural industry are good jobs if the raw materials are produced from the land and are not dependent on imports. We should therefore try to promote the industry and encourage expansion in it so that the necessary jobs will be created.  That is not happening; the trend is the other way.  I know there are other factors outside the control of the Minister such as disease eradication which has particularly hit the dairy industry. If you have somebody producing 100 gallons of milk a day who can, if he has the resources and facilities, produce 150 gallons a day, then by so doing there is right through an increase in jobs through more people employed, fertiliser producers and handlers, farm machinery owners, in processing, manufacturing and transport.  Everybody benefits.</P>
    <P>I did not like the attitude of the Minister for Agriculture yesterday and his arrogant approach to farmers' problems.  When we had a recession in 1974 we turned to the agricultural industry and it saved us.  We should be giving it every incentive and encouragement possible and providing a tax system which would not act as a disincentive. While farmers are talking about coming into the tax net for the first time, whether this is on or off, you have the artificial manure subsidy abolished, lime transport subsidy abolished, the beef cattle incentive scheme abolished, inheritance tax, which of course is adjusted now, the 2 per cent which was on and was off, a levy for disease eradication to be paid by farmers; dairy inspection <Col N="2114" /> charges introduced, a dramatic increase in rates with the removal of the agricultural grant down to £40 valuation as proposed by the Minister for the Environment; you have the levy imposed on State funds to the CBF drastically cut, the inactivity of the Land Commission due to lack of funds.</P>
    <P>You also have the new super levy proposed by Mr. Gundelach, an increase in labour costs, in ESB charges, fuel charges and so on for the farming community. I think it is necessary to have a system where all those things could be abolished and at the beginning of any year a farmer would be able to say: &ldquo;I have to pay so much; I will meet it.  The incentive is there to create and work harder so that the demand can be met and anything over and above that tax is my own.&rdquo;  Whether it is a question of rates, of levies or tax, the farming community at present do not know where they stand as regards the contribution they must make to the local authority or the Exchequer. These are the things I would ask the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance and the Government to consider because the future of our primary industry is involved.  Farmers were misled by the Fianna Fáil manifesto in 1977 which gave certain guarantees that were not honoured at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that rat infestation is a greater problem today than it has been in the past.  I would not favour arranging an &ldquo;Anti-Rat Week&rdquo; since if there is widespread but sporadic use of rat poison by untrained persons it could lead to rats getting a sub-lethal dose and as a result becoming immune to poison.  The occupiers of premises are statutorily responsible for the control of rats on their premises and I would advise occupiers who may have problems with rats to contact their health board for expert advice or assistance in dealing with rats.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to co-ordinate the efforts made by industry, health boards and local authorities.  An individual firm may seek to exterminate rats by the laying of poison but a firm 100 yards away may not take any such measures.  Efforts should be co-ordinated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for rodent control in their own property and will normally investigate a case.  Officers of the health boards will pursue the matter and we would be very concerned to co-ordinate efforts in any area which is not under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the health hazard, rats will gather where refuse or waste food is dumped.  Food can be contaminated by <Col N="2116" /> rats and the rats themselves are dangerous.  They can also carry a serious disease called Weil's disease, though few of them do so.  Workers on farms and in sewers are liable to contract it.  It is a very rare disease and we all agree that rats should be exterminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that rat numbers in County Dublin have increased at least ten-fold due to difficulties in regard to refuse collection and also agree that because of the increase in rat numbers the dangers outlined have also increased?  Repeated reporting of this to the local authority and the health board during the past couple of months does not seem to have had any effect.  Are there any steps the Minister's Department can take to bring about a reduction in rat numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that the general rat population has increased. If there is rubbish gathered in a particular place naturally the number of rats there will increase.  If there are any instances of widespread infestation we will be glad to pursue them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Staffing of the general hospital at Portlaoise is in the first instance a matter for the Midland Health Board.  Proposals from the health board regarding extra staff for the hospital, including porters, attendants and nurses, were received in my Department in January 1980.  These proposals will be examined in the light of the allocation of funds to my Department for the current year.</P>
      <P>A casualty unit is provided at the hospital.  The health board applied in 1978 for approval for two extra nurses to meet the needs of this unit.  These two additional posts were approved by my Department in March 1978, but it is understood from recent inquiries to the health board that the casualty unit has not yet opened because it is now felt that two extra nurses are not adequate to staff it.  I am prepared to have this examined but consider the delay in opening the unit regrettable, seeing that the staff the board sought in 1978 had been agreed to then.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of persons between the age of 65 years and 66 years who are currently in receipt of unemployment benefit, if he is aware of the resentment on the part of such persons retired from their employment at having to sign on each week in the local employment exchanges on the basis that they are allegedly available for work and in receipt of unemployment benefit until they officially qualify as old age pensioners, and if he will make alternative administrative arrangements for the payment of benefits to such persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons between the age of 65 and 66 years who are currently in receipt of unemployment benefit is about 1,100.  Apart from the representations made by the Deputy, I am not aware of any complaints from persons over 65 regarding the present arrangements for payment of unemployment benefit in their case.</P>
      <P>One of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit is that the claimant must be capable of and available for work.  When signing the unemployed register each claimant is required to sign a declaration that he fulfils this and the other statutory conditions, and this requirement cannot be dispensed with.  Payment is made in respect of the period covered by the declaration.</P>
      <P>I am having the signing arrangements for claimants over 65 years of age examined within my Department.  I would point out to the Deputy, however, that such persons already have more favourable signing arrangements in that they are not required to attend more frequently than once a week.  It may be, too, that less frequent payment of benefit would not suit many such claimants and might create certain difficulties for them. However, it may be possible to do something on an optional basis and, as I have said, I am having the matter examined.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that 1,100 people throughout the country have a humiliating experience of signing on each week even though they are over 65, have no prospect of alternative employment and are obliged to present themselves in the official context of being available for work?  They are not offered any employment and have no prospect of obtaining it.  In those circumstances, those people, very often suffering the trauma of immediate retirement at 65 years, deserve a little bit more than to be dragged in each week for signing, which is almost irrelevant.  I am glad to note that the Minister will change the arrangements.  Would he not consider that there is urgency in that regard?</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there is any undue delay in processing noncontributory old age pension claims.</P>
      <P>In straightforward cases the issue of a pension book to an old age pensioner takes about six weeks from the receipt of the claim, since it is necessary to visit applicants to investigate their means before a decision as to entitlement can be made. I do not think that this constitutes a long delay.</P>
      <P>It may be that the Deputy has the more complex type of case in mind such as blind pension, where medical examination is involved, or the case where evidence is awaited that a Deed of Transfer of property has been properly completed.  The latter type of case inevitably takes longer, largely for reasons outside the control of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the total amount of pay-related social insurance contributions and statutory interest outstanding as of the latest available date by employers already deducted from the remuneration of their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the pay-related social insurance collection system employers have since April last been obliged to transmit each month to the Revenue Commissioners a bulk payment to cover the pay-related social insurance contributions payable in respect of all of their employees.  The return form accompanying the monthly payment gives no details of the make up of the payment nor does it identify the employees to whom the payment relates.  At the end of the tax year, however, employers will have to furnish to the Revenue Commissioners a special return showing details of the contributions appropriate to each employee during the year.  On receipt of this return from the employers it will be reconciled by the Revenue Commissioners against the monthly payment already received and it will either balance with them or otherwise show an underpayment or overpayment position. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that pending receipt of these <Col N="2129" /> end-of-year returns from employers it is not possible to quantify the extent of underpayments during the year arising from employers' failure to remit their full liability every month.</P>
      <P>Some employers fail to submit their monthly return by the due date, and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in these instances vigorous pursuit action is taken to enforce the furnishing of the outstanding returns.  In such cases the amount of arrears of pay-related social insurance contributions, if any, will not be known until the monthly return is furnished in due course.</P>
      <P>The total of statutory interest outstanding as at 31 January 1980 which relates to monthly payments of contributions by employers which were received after the due date is approximately £1.3 million.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister entirely satisfied that there is sufficient liaison between his Department and the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that prompt and immediate returns of pay-related social insurance contributions are made by employers?  Is he satisfied that the old arrangement whereby an employee could check up almost immediately with the Department as to whether returns had been sent in ceases, and now one is dependent on a computer read-out at Revenue Commissioner level?  Finally, are the Revenue Commissioners in agreement that the period of waiting to cross check against an employer is excessively long so that some employees may have been criminally defrauded of money which is deducted out of their income?</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the relationship between the amounts paid by employers, employees and by the Exchequer towards the costs of social insurance benefits.</P>
      <P>It is set out in section 39 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, that any amount by which the income of the social insurance fund for any financial year is less than its expenditure shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  It follows, therefore, that the amount of the Exchequer contribution to the cost of social insurance benefits is a residual figure which may vary in accordance with trends in numbers claiming benefits and in the amount of contribution income collected during the year.</P>
      <P>In recent years the Exchequer contribution to the costs of social insurance benefits has been approximately 20 per cent of the total expenditure on benefits and no change is planned for 1980.  After account is taken of the costs of the rate increases and other improvements announced in the budget the Exchequer is expected to contribute a sum of about £86 million for social insurance expenditure in 1980.</P>

      <P>One would assume the Department would at least follow the negotiations.  This scheme is being reviewed at the moment at EEC level. There was a real possibility it would be extended beyond December 1980.  As the scheme was first introduced through an Irish Government initiative, the fact that this Irish Government have withdrawn funds from the national committee has seriously undermined any possibility of having this scheme extended at EEC level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it quite clear that the Government have not withdrawn any funds.  They made provision for funds to cover the current term.  The proposals to extend those terms are under discussion in the Council of Ministers at working party level and no decision is expected for some months. As I said in my reply, the amount of money provided for the 11-month period is slightly more than that provided for the same period last year.  As Minister for Social Welfare I am particularly interested in the outcome of the Commission's proposals.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he is being, to say the least, misleading when he tries to convey that the committee's allocation from the <Col N="2135" /> Government has been slightly increased? In real terms it has been drastically cut and this will have very severe repercussions on the work of the committee.  The reduction in the Government's allocation will lead to the termination of the scheme.</P>

      <P>If one takes as a yardstick the retirement pensions which are payable at the age of 65 to insured workers who retire from insurable employment <Col N="2137" /> and satisfy the statutory contribution conditions, on 29 February 1980 there were 31,000 retirement pensions in payment.  Some of these pensioners are over pension age and should be classed as old age pensioners, but as the rates of old age and retirement pensions are the same there is nothing to be gained from changing the pensioners from one category to another.  It is estimated that approximately 28,500 retirement pensioners are over 66 years of age.  I would have to get more specific information for the Deputy on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if his attention has been drawn to the large scale imports of low-grade, low-priced fish from third countries into the EEC; the amount involved; by what member states this fish is being imported, and if he will raise the matter urgently with the European Council and the European Commission in view of the disastrous effects of these imports on the livelihood of Irish fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concern in the Irish fishing industry about the current reduced level of prices which is attributed to imports from outside the EEC.  This matter has already been taken up with the appropriate bodies in the EEC.  Information on recent importations of fish into the Community is not yet available from the statistical offices of member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that if we have to wait until we get evidence of the records the damage which is being done and has already been done will be perpetuated and continued in the meantime without let or hindrance? Waiting for records may not be the answer to what is an urgent, immediate problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices paid recently for fish are lower than they have been for some time and that has been the case for the past few months.  There is a certain amount of doubt as to the reason for this.  Imports from third countries have been mentioned but no figures for them are immediately available.  It is felt that the 200-mile zones which Canada and <Col N="2144" /> the US have got may have made the US more self-sufficient and perhaps supplies from Iceland, Norway and Denmark that would normally go to the US have now come to the EEC markets.  There is also a trend of opinion that suggests that Canada have caught a lot more fish because of their 200-mile limit and they have sent them at low price into the Community.  I mentioned that at the last meeting.  There is also the question that in return for permitting Community vessels to fish in Canadian waters Canada might be anxious to be allowed access to our markets with her fish.  This is something we will have to keep a watchful eye on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the main fault at present lies in third countries importing fish into the EEC.  It is scandalous to think that we are dumping Irish fish at present while fish are being brought into the Community. The Irish fishermen suffer drastically.</P>

    <P>1.  Small quantities were also disposed of as mink-food or pet-food.</P>
    <P>2.  The EEC intervention system for fishery products is operated by recognised producer organisations of fishermen who withdraw from sale fish which does not reach a certain price level according to species and grade and dispose of it subsequently for purposes other than human consumption. Fish is not sold to an official intervention agency as is the case with agricultural products.</P>
    <P>3.  Figures given are provisional and may be subject to slight adjustments.  Quantities of herring withdrawn and methods of disposal are available in respect of only one producer's organisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for education and training of fishermen, including control of the National Fishery School at Greencastle, was transferred to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in 1979.  The question of setting up a second training centre at Dunmore East, County Waterford or elsewhere is, therefore, a matter for the board in the first instance.  I am informed by the board that the need for such additional facilities will be regularly reviewed in the light of experience and established needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister whether, in any review or consideration of adding to the existing facilities, whatever they may be, he will take a look at the original ideas in the setting up of Greencastle school?  It has not been utilised fully in the sense that it was intended to be.  It is at the primary level, if I may put it that way, and much more needs to be done than is being done at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the first priority is to develop a programme at Greencastle and to give the best possible facilities available to the greatest number of fishermen there.  We also run part-time evening courses for fishermen around the coast as local demand warrants it.  We should ensure that we give the best possible facilities in Greencastle first and improve there before we decide to do anything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, along those lines, but I ask the Minister to consider a stage further than what merely has been done, admittedly quite well, to date at Greencastle. The original plans went much further than that and there was the thought of an ever-expanding industry with all its ramifications, and that the role of the training schools would not just be solely that of training fishermen or skippers because there is far more to fishing than that.  Thirty thousand workers have not, as yet, been touched <Col N="2148" /> upon in Greencastle, or anywhere else for that matter.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1980. - Financial Resolution No. 19: General (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the subject of the taxation of farmers.  It is not possible to discuss the budget within the confined context of what is within the budget.  A considerable amount depends on the action taken in the year prior to the introduction of the budget, and the decisions taken by the Government are also relevant in this discussion.  I was querying to what extent the budget shows an improved picture of our country's economy in relation to the creation of extra employment, to industrial development and to the solving of the basic financial difficulties which still exist. In my opinion, nothing has been done to tackle these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister devoted a considerable amount of his time to the cost of energy and the £800 million bill confronting the country in relation to our oil imports. When the Minister talks about a discretionary tax on petrol, if we relate it to our present national transport system, it looks rather silly.  If we are serious in our efforts to conserve energy we must, first of all, examine our transport system and encourage a considerable amount of our people to use a proper, reliable transport system in commuting from one area to another in relation to their employment, business or industry.  We should have a <Col N="2159" /> transport system which we could induce people to use.</P>
    <P>I do not want in any way to criticise our rail system, but our buses are nothing short of scandalous at present.  I do not see anything in the budget or in the Minister's proposals to try to improve the situation.  The vast majority of our buses are fit for the scrapyard.  It is a regular feature to see buses broken down on the side of the road every other day and the majority of them are positively filthy.  The Minister and the Department of Transport should examine that problem on a national basis and try to make the transport system a worthwhile one.</P>
    <P>Regarding free school transport, almost every parent of children availing of it is regularly and constantly complaining to public representatives and there is a grievance.  It plays hookey with the educational system if buses are often not in time, or break down.  I am sure the first man who would admit that would be the Minister in charge, Deputy Tunney. In many cases a service is not provided at all.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made on the contributions to social welfare benefits. These constitute a big increase, taken in the context of the budget.  I was interested in Deputy McMahon's question to the Minister for Social Welfare as to whether the Government had any intention of reducing the age for a noncontributory pension down to 66 years. During the four years of the National Coalition Government the age was brought down from 70, where it had stood for half a century, to 66 years.  It is urgent now that the Minister should consider putting on a par those who are not in a position to avail of a contributory pension, those who are self-employed and not in insurable employment.  It is desirable that they should not have to wait another year for their benefits. When one considers the 25 per cent increase in old age pensions it is a disturbing feature of Government activity that during the summer recess a considerable amount of increases took place, but this Christmas recess must be a record in <Col N="2160" /> many instances&mdash;certainly, as far as price increases were concerned, it broke all records.</P>
    <P>Even gas has been increased by almost 70 per cent within a year.  This is a huge increase for quite a lot of our old age pensioners who depend on gas for heating and cooking, not to mention the free fuel, which is also a scandal.  More money was provided for this and better concessions given in the early seventies than today.  Then there are the increases in the price of bread and butter and the necessities of life, which hit the poorer sections.  In a recess or an inflationary period, the most vulnerable&mdash;the poor&mdash;are the first to be hit.</P>
    <P>I express disappointment with the budget on another point.  I have been saying here, and said it two years ago, that it is bad for our economy that there is no incentive to save, particularly among our young people.  It is so important that some time should be devoted in our national and primary schools to educating our young people on the urgency and necessity to save.  It is true to say that we penalise people who save. In the Finance Act of 1967, the then Minister for Finance, who was the former Taoiseach, introduced a Bill which created for the Revenue Commissioners the right to investigate any deposit account in a bank or any investment in a financial institution.  At that time, every £ over £70 interest on a deposit account was liable to income tax.  One can imagine the situation where a PAYE worker saving for a house, a car or for any other reason has paid tax under the PAYE system, is thrifty and saves and is caught for the second time.</P>
    <P>Many of our laws at present are going through interesting phases.  Some are being tested in the Supreme Court and found to be repugnant to the Constitution. There are a number of laws which could be examined in relation to this particular problem.  This is an area in which Government Ministers&mdash;and since 1967 there have been a number of Ministers&mdash;have not taken action.  There must be an incentive to save and an incentive <Col N="2161" /> to work.  Consider the case of someone getting married and building a house.  The Minister made a big boast about the increase in the amount of the loan and the increase in the income ceiling to qualify for a loan, but there is still a large bridging gap between the amount of loan and the cost of a house.  How can people save to build a house if they are penalised for doing so?  This problem must be tackled immediately.  The incentive to save as well as the incentive to work is very important, in my opinion, and consideration of it is long overdue. The ceiling in deposit account interest has stood at £70 for a long time.</P>
    <P>The question of housing brought it to my mind that the Minister for the Environment in his speech mentioned the number of houses being provided.  When he was asked a question about bridging loans he said he had no experience of difficulties now.  I can assure the Minister that there are great difficulties in providing bridging loans.  He made the point that he is not in charge of them and that they are the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I accept that. However, the Minister for the Environment should instruct local authorities that SDA loans should be paid in part far earlier than when the house is secured at 75 per cent.  In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said that it was a matter for local authorities and they have full powers to do it.  The Minister should take action and give such a direction to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the budget was anti-rural and anti-farmer and that it sounded the death knell of the tourist industry.  A number of people in recent years spent a lot of money providing modern and well-equipped guesthouses and hotels in rural areas.  We did not have a good year last year and it appears that this year will be far worse.  We must ensure that we are in a position to attract tourists who will spend money here which will have a spin-off for the whole economy.  To a large extent we have a clean environment. We have protected it up to a point and a number of people from abroad <Col N="2162" /> buy houses here for their retirement. Costs are rising every other day and we must be careful not to price ourselves out of the market.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we must reduce borrowing and he is right.  This situation did not occur overnight.  It takes £545.6 million to service the national debt.  If that money were available for services what an amount of services it could provide.  The Government must give the lead and live within their means.  It is their job to set the example when they are asking people to live within their means.  The Government cannot borrow themselves into prosperity.  We must realise that nobody owes us a living.</P>
    <P>Nothing is free.  When we talk about free education, free transport and so on somebody is paying for it.  This must be realised.  The Taoiseach in his television broadcast on the state of the nation came across as giving the people the true picture.  Two or three weeks later a Bill was introduced to appoint extra Ministers of State.  That appears as if it is a pay-off for services well given to the Taoiseach in the campaign to have him elected.  These are the things which people fall foul of and are sceptical about.</P>
    <P>This debate affords us an opportunity of discussing the State's finances and the direction in which we are going.  The budget has not come to grips with the problems of inflation or unemployment and has not got our finances right.  To conclude on the note on which the Fine Gael spokesman on finance opened his remarks, the Fianna Fáil Government have got it wrong again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise it is impossible to find any new aspect of the budget that has not come under close scrutiny at this stage because so much has been said about it already and so much has appeared in the media.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing such a budget which was well received despite pessimistic forecasts made in the press in the days preceding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget found general acceptance and it is the kind of budget we need in the present economic circumstances.  Its main objectives are aimed at establishing <Col N="2163" /> a more equitable income tax system and protecting our economy from the damage threatened by internal inflationary tendencies thereby mintaining the economic and social advances of the last few years.  When international economic and trading circumstances become more favourable we will be able to make another big advance in growth and economic development and in creating greater prosperity for the people.</P>
    <P>The most noteworthy and talked about aspect of the budget was the way in which the Minister met the demand and irrefutable need for reform of the income tax code.  Not even the most convinced campaigner for change expected so much to be done particularly when all the predictions highlighted the financial difficulties involved in making any change and pointed out the constraints under which the Minister would have to operate.  The Minister succeeded.  Income splitting will benefit thousands of families.  That and the tax concessions granted go much further than the recent Supreme Court decision demanded.  This can be instanced by the fact that it will cost the Exchequer over £130 million in a year where a strict observance of the court decision would have cost a mere £20 million.  It is futile in the face of these figures to seek to maintain that these concessions and changes were brought about solely under pressure of the courts decision.</P>
    <P>Another guage of the spread or distribution of the benefits contained in the budgetary income tax proposals is the fact that, as a result of the changes in the rates of income tax and the taxable bands to which they will apply, 75,000 people who were in the lower income tax band are taken out of the tax bracket altogether and that the staggering total of 180,000 people will pay tax at the 35 per cent rate, who without the changes would have been paying at a higher level. These figures prove the significance and impact which the changes in the income tax code will have on the incomes and standard of living of those to whom they will apply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> In addition the old and disabled have received very welcome additional reliefs. It is only proper that this category of people be thought of and protected against the ravages of rising prices.  All of these changes are proper and are needed to protect the incomes of all people, all wage earners, against the inflationary trend of recent years.  They were necessary also in order to remove the disincentive to work and greater productivity which the old income tax code tended to foster.</P>
    <P>In the last few years farmer taxation has proved to be a controversial and almost intractable problem.  The Minister's proposals in this regard also are fair and equitable.  No section of the community can expect to enjoy living with the benefits of the State if they are not prepared also to shoulder their fair share of the financial burden inherent in the provision of those same benefits for the whole community.  Farmers and farmer organisations have always been foremost in proclaiming that they like every other sector were prepared to pay their fair share of income tax.  The introduction of the £40 PLV threshold for tax liability, with marginal relief to £49 and income tax to be paid on the accounts system, is reasonable.  These proposals, taken with the assurance that these rates will remain static for three years, with the Taoiseach's assurance given in this House last week that the resource tax was not envisaged as a permanent element of farmer taxation, should go a long way to reassuring farmers that the income tax code will treat them fairly and is not designed to extract from them any more than their fair share.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the raising of the restriction to 30 per cent of net profit on the amount of capital allowances claimable for such farming activities as fencing, land reclamation and farm building.  That, together with the three year guarantee of static rates of taxation, afford the farmer an opportunity of planning ahead for a reasonable period. While making these comments on farmer taxation I am conscious that not too <Col N="2165" /> many farmers in my constituency will be affected by the budgetary income tax proposals.  Nevertheless, farmers, be they big or small, have a lot of common ground.  I and the small farmers I represent realise the important place that farming plays and will continue to play in our economy.  Nobody would like to see anything done which would in any way hinder progress or development.  There is nothing in the budgetary proposals that will affect the development or future of farming, despite the gloomy predictions sometimes made by Opposition speakers.  I, coming from a small farm background, realise that farming is a seven day a week job and that farmers are entitled to some concessions.  Farming can be a very difficult enterprise to manage and profits can vary considerably from year to year.  I accept that farmers constitute a very hard working section of our community.  They cannot go on strike because, as has been said, one cannot invent a five-day or four-day cow, one cannot get one's livestock to go on strike.  Therefore certain incentives and concessions must be made to the farmer community.  Nevertheless the budgetary proposals and the assurances of the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance go a long way towards reassuring farmers that they will get a fair deal under this Government.</P>
    <P>The people who await the budget annually with the greatest expectancy and hope are the social welfare recipients because these people have no other means of maintaining the value of their income. I am glad the Minister did not fail them this year.  The increases granted of 20 per cent and 25 per cent are generous and should more than compensate them for any rise in prices in the coming year. It is only right that that should be so, that a caring Government and Minister, a Christian society, should show concern for that sector of the community who because of infirmity, old age, handicap or whatever cannot provide for themselves. It is only right that they be catered for to the full limit of the State's resources and be protected against the <Col N="2166" /> ravages of inflation.  I am sure all of this group will welcome the increases provided for in the budget.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to make a request to the Department and Minister involved in the administration of these benefits.  In so doing I am conscious that other speakers on both sides of the House have already adverted to this aspect of social welfare payments.  I often feel that much of the personal satisfaction that social welfare recipients would gain from increases granted in this and in previous budgets is blunted by the often unduly long delays involved in the processing of many new claims, especially those on appeal.  The Minister should do something to streamline this process to make it easier for those who apply to come into benefit sooner without having to go through the tortuous, protracted procedures which apply at present.  Oftentimes those procedures cause mental agony.</P>
    <P>To meet the bill for improvements in benefits and the tax concessions some indirect taxation had, unfortunately, to be imposed.  Those increases must be viewed against the background of the improvements in the budget.  There was speculation prior to the budget that the increases would be a lot higher and those predictions were made without anticipating that tax concessions would be as far-reaching as they turned out to be. The increases in indirect taxation have been accepted as reasonable and necessary by the public.  I have heard little groaning after the budget about the increase in the price of beer and tobacco. I am not saying that people like paying additional tax but on this occasion they regarded the increase in the budget as reasonable and justified.  They appreciate very much that the revenue being raised will be put to good use.  We must also take into consideration the discretionary aspect of this increased expenditure. People can control the amount of extra outlay they will be involved in participating in social occasions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extra taxation on oil products we must accept that there is <Col N="2167" /> a message there to the effect that oil will be a problem with us for many years. We depend on oil for 85 per cent of our energy needs.  It costs us a lot and, therefore, we must conserve it.  In establishing the Department of Energy and appointing the Tánaiste as Minister for Energy, the Taoiseach has emphasised the importance of the quest for oil and the economic utilisation of our sources of energy.  If we discover oil off our shores I do not believe that product will be any cheaper.  In the meantime we must make a greater effort to ensure that our native sources of energy are utilised and developed to the full.  I was glad to see that additional money was allocated in the capital programme for the ESB and Bord na Móna.  In addition to the involvement of Bord na Móna in the development of our bogs there are many small bogs that could be developed if farmers were encouraged to do so by grants.  It is a pity to see bogs that were utilised in the past now deserted.  The access roads to those bogs are overgrown.  Until something is done about the drainage of those bogs and the access roads to them it will be difficult to encourage individuals or groups to develop them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase provided for infrastructural development purposes. We have heard many complaints in this debate about roads.  It is true to say that our road network leaves a lot to be desired and that applies to all counties. We should realise also that in the last two years there has been a 45 per cent increase in the amount of money devoted to the improvement and development of our road network.  It is unfortunate that during that time the price of materials has escalated.  The inclement weather last year did not help road conditions. While this problem is nationwide I should like to bring a problem concerning my county to the attention of the Minister.  My county must be the only one where there is a significant mileage of public roads waiting to be tarred.  People use those roads daily and one can imagine their condition in inclement weather.  People should not be expected <Col N="2168" /> to tolerate such conditions.  Our county councillors have always endeavoured to proceed as fast as possible with the work of the black topping of these roads.  As this situation, so far as I know, is peculiar to County Mayo, perhaps the Minister could arrange that this year and next year additional grants would be made available in order to enable us to clear the backlog in respect of these roads and thereby eliminate the social injustice that is being perpetrated on the people of that county in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to note that there is an increase of 22 per cent in the allocation to the IDA and I take this opportunity of congratulating that body on the success they have had in their efforts to attract industry to the country.  Up to ten or 12 years ago industry was unknown in my county but now the dramatic results of the efforts of the IDA during the past decade are obvious in terms of the number of our people who are employed in manufacturing industry, an increase of the order of 250 per cent.  The policy of building advance factories is very sound but in my county some of the smaller towns have been excluded from the present programme.  I trust that when the next programme for advance factory building is being drafted those towns will be included.</P>
    <P>It has been my opinion always that many of our smaller towns which have the necessary infrastructure could well accommodate more of the smaller type industry.  During the past few years efforts have been made to direct some industry to the smaller towns and where there are efforts have been successful the towns concerned have been revitalised and have been given the necessary impetus to forge ahead and become more viable and productive.  In the early days of the IDA the emphasis seemed to be on catering for the bigger industries and to locate these industries in the bigger centres of population but there is now the realisation that many of the smaller centres can equally cater for industry with the result that there is a reversal of the original policy much to the advantage of the smaller towns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> Educational and training are important aspects in this whole question of attracting industry to a town and in this context I should like to raise the matter of educational facilities in my constituency. There is a very popular demand growing in County Mayo for some form of third-level educational institute and I hope that the Minister will take note of the pleas made in this regard. Our county is the third largest in the country.  It has a total of 37 second-level educational establishments and a total enrolment of more than 9,000 pupils. There are third-level educational institutions in places that are not as big as our county so we must have a very strong case for the establishment of such an institute. A report published recently indicates that by 1986 extra places will be required for about 30,000 students and this is all the more reason for us in County Mayo to be anxious that some of those places will be provided in our county.</P>
    <P>The Minister has on his desk a request to establish an agricultural college at Ballinafad on premises recently vacated by an Order of priests.  The application has been supported by the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture and those responsible for the project have made an irrefutable case for it.  I hope the Minister will listen to them and give a favourable reply.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for Agriculture yesterday refer to the £25 million in land bonds to be made available by way of capital to the land Commission.  There is still great need in my constituency for further land acquisition to facilitate the restructuring of holdings and to provide land for development farmers in order to make their holdings viable, but I agree with the policy aimed at dividing land already in Land Commission possession before proceeding to acquire further land.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to see an increase in the capital budget allocations for telecommunications and transport. Tourism is a very important industry in the west and the importance of good <Col N="2170" /> communications, whether by way of telephones or roads, needs to be stressed. I hope we will see a rapid extension of automatic exchanges to principal centres in the west.</P>
    <P>On the question of transport I would draw the Minister's particular attention to CIE rail services to Mayo.  There is need for improved rolling stock in that area and I hope that in the near future the Minister will provide us with modern carriages.  I would point out that we are only looking for the type of coaches that are standard in other areas.</P>
    <P>Still on the question of communications and tourism, I should like to refer briefly to a project mooted by some enterprising people in the west.  Connacht is the only province without an airport. Its economy is heavily dependent on tourism.  We are not seeking a large sophisticated structure.  We are thinking on the lines of an airport capable of taking charter planes to be sited in such a way that it can be extended later, if necessary.  I suggest that economic development of Connacht depends on such a facility and I hope that any proposals submitted in this respect will get an encouraging hearing from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Once more I congratulate the Minister and the Government on producing a budget that has been so widely accepted because of its obvious gearing to the economic difficulties the country is experiencing. I hope it will enable us to take off when national and international economic conditions improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Times have changed under the new Fianna Fáil regime.  The last speaker referred to a budget.  I should like to talk about all the budgets since Christmas, because hardly a week has passed in which the price of something or other has not been increased.  What we are discussing today is just one more budget.  Leading up to this last budget people were conditioned to expect bad provisions.  Since its introduction, Deputies on the other side have been engaged busily trying to make the public <Col N="2171" /> forget that as each day passes the price of something has been changed.  Have Fianna Fáil Deputies forgotten, or do the public recall, that reconstruction grants and central heating grants have been taken away and that the prices of gas and electricity have been increased? We have been told that the cost of telephones and postage will be increased; there have been increases in the price of milk and at least 40 per cent of the items that people eat and wear have been increased in price.  All this took place in the first couple of months of 1980.  Now we have the taxation system geared to indirect taxes instead of direct taxes. Some people may welcome this because they have been told they will benefit financially.  This is not so.  If we take the motoring public alone, they will be paying £125 million extra and the concessions given to the PAYE workers will amount to only £131 million, which means that petrol users will contribute nearly all of the benefits to be enjoyed by the taxpayers.  It was generally accepted that a change had to be made in the PAYE system.  Probably the change made has not been big enough.  Many of us would like to see the PAYE sector encouraged to work more and to pay less tax.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about only one budget in this debate.  Since the beginning of the year increases have been imposed practically every week and if it is not an increase in price, Fianna Fáil are blaming somebody else for the muddle they have got themselves into in the past three years.  Like the previous speaker I come from one of the western counties and the budget was a drastic one so far as we were concerned.  People in the west think they have been totally discriminated against by the Government. It appears the further one lives from Dublin the more one has to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motoring public have been hit very badly.  The charges imposed in this area will affect particularly people from areas such as Galway Mayo, Kerry, Cork and Donegal.  For example, in Donegal there is neither a railway service <Col N="2172" /> nor a proper bus service.  We are relying on a skeleton type of public transport service.  Thank goodness some private operations are starting now to give the public some kind of service.  It is true that when Deputy Ryan was Minister for Finance the price of petrol was increased by 15p per gallon but the difference between that occasion and the savage increase inposed in this budget is that when the National Coalition increased the price it was done as a result of an increase occurring in the Middle East.  Since the beginning of this year petrol has been increased on three occasions. First there was the increase of 10p which everybody forgot when they heard about the 20p increase and a few days after the budget there was a further 2p increase.  We cannot blame the Arabs for this savage imposition.  It was imposed by Fianna Fáil to pay for the promises they made in their manifesto.  The position now is that a gallon of petrol is 30p dearer here than in Northern Ireland and the same difference applies in the case of diesel.  To anybody's way of thinking this price difference is dreadful.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should cast our minds back to the Fianna Fáil manifesto when they told the people they would remove car tax.  They did that and it is only right to give them credit.  There was an average saving of £30 to car owners. However, it has not been spelled out that Fianna Fáil have increased the price of petrol between this budget and the previous increase by 32p per gallon.  In an area like my constituency the average motorist travels about 400 miles per week.  If one works out the miles travelled and multiplies them by the 32p increase one gets an answer of £4.20 per week that the motorist has to pay.  Instead of paying £30 per year on tax the motorist will pay more than £220 per year for the increased cost of petrol alone.  People are beginning to realise what has happened.  They know that when they now spend £10 at the petrol pump their tank will only be three-quarters full.  This savage increase will yield more than £125 million to the Exchequer and it has been imposed by the new Arab Fianna Fáil Government. <Col N="2173" /> Some people living in Border areas are going to Northern Ireland to purchase petrol and that is quite understandable.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increase in the price of petrol, the Government have told us that the excise duty on new cars is being increased.  In the past few weeks some of the main Fianna Fáil speakers have been talking about co-operation between Northern Ireland and the South.  Let us talk about co-operation on the prices front.  Are we encouraging people in the North to look across the Border when there is a 30p difference in the price of a gallon of petrol?</P>
    <P>It is estimated that one in four of the population owns a car.  Fianna Fáil have announced they will increase the excise duty from 35 per cent to 40 per cent.  At present even in the case of the smallest cars&mdash;the Ford Escorts and Minis &mdash;there is a difference of £1,000 between prices here and in Britain and in Northern Ireland.  The difference is £1,500 to £2,000 in the case of larger cars.  This money is not going to the manufacturers.  It is going into the coffers of the Exchequer to pay for the promises made by Fianna Fáil in their manifesto.</P>
    <P>It worries me that we are fast becoming one of the most expensive countries in Europe.  I was in London recently and it was obvious to me that this country is much more expensive.  Grade for grade, hotels are cheaper in London as are food, clothes and items in the supermarkets. We must consider seriously where we are going with the spiralling inflation that has taken over the country. It must be a cause for concern that a country of our size with a population of three million people will have one of the highest inflation rates in Europe in 1980.</P>
    <P>The price of petrol should not have been increased.  There is uproar in every town and village with regard to the savage increase imposed by the Government. Petrol will cost everybody more, the transport companies, the tourists and industry.  We must remember that in some parts of the country we have no railway or bus service.  I hope that the <Col N="2174" /> Minister of State will take specific note of the position in which we find ourselves living in a cinderella county.  For example, in Donegal we have no railway.  We have four express buses leaving the capital and going to Donegal.  The only other bus service we have, particularly in the north and north-east, is the Lough Swilly service.  Rumour has it at present that the Lough Swilly company intend to pull out of County Donegal completely because, as I understand it, they are not getting any subsidy from the Government here.  We have been talking about cross-Border co-operation and trying to get grants to help people survive in cross-Border areas.  Here is a problem that will raise its head in the very near future when the bus company will have to pull out of east and north Donegal because of inadequate funds from the Government.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine, Deputy Conaghan, put down a specific question in the Dáil on 5 March 1980 and the answer given by the Minister for Transport was that there was an interim arrangement to ensure the continuity of road passenger services in the area served by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.  The question of future arrangements for these services was being examined and a decision would be taken as soon as possible.  I suggest that the Minister enter into serious discussions with this bus company and see if the Government here could help them in some way.  In the budget I note that CIE, even though getting £55 million in subsidy at present are, I understand, getting a rebate of 5p per gallon on diesel oil.  That being so, I suggest that all bus companies, whether private or the same as the Lough Swilly company in Donegal, should get this rebate.</P>
    <P>Private bus operators are working successfully because, I take it, CIE are not providing an adequate service in a particular area.  If private operators do not get some help such as a subsidy some of them will go under.  Such a service is much needed in areas like the north-west, Galway, Kerry and west <Col N="2175" /> Cork.  At present the Government are not encouraging these operators but they are encouraging CIE to get a greater subsidy which will have to be paid by us, as taxpayers, eventually.  There should be more forward thinking about the communication system in relation to buses.  If CIE are not able to operate efficiently in some of these remote areas and if a private bus operator or the Lough Swilly company are willing to provide a service they should get a subsidy and should certainly get a rebate on the same scale as CIE.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited a certain country abroad where the taxi owners were encouraged to do much of the work that CIE would be doing here.  When they imported a car to do taxi work they had to pay no excise duty and in turn they were limited as regards the fares they could charge.  One could travel anywhere in that city for the equivalent of 50p.  I do not suggest that you could reduce the price here to 50p but one of the greatest costs taxi operators here are up against is the cost of their vehicles.  I think what is wrong in Government at present is that we are carrying on in the same old dogged way instead of trying to think up new ideas and provide a more exciting kind of community.  Perhaps the taxi operators here should be encouraged to work on cheaper fares and the only way that could be done would be to try to give them cheaper vehicles and also fuel rebates.</P>
    <P>In the city I visited one could travel anywhere in a taxi, perhaps for a half hour, for 50p.  We all learn something abroad.  That was one of the things I learned on the last occasion.  Perhaps the Minister for Transport here should seriously consider having a better type of transport service.  Later, I shall deal with the roads and with congestion in Dublin. I think that the taxi service more than anything else should be encouraged even in places like west Mayo or west Galway.  If there was a taxi available that would run perhaps 100 milles for £5 it would be well worth while.  At present a visitor at Dublin Airport who wants a taxi to County Clare, for instance, would <Col N="2176" /> probably be quoted about £50.  It happened to a friend of mine last summer. How could we expect tourists to come if they are to be lacerated with prices like that?</P>
    <P>Our transport policy has been relaxed in the past couple of years as regards bus routes and private operators.  It should be further relaxed.  Where CIE are not giving an adequate service, if there is a private operator willing to do it, he should be encouraged.  Perhaps a similar system could be introduced whereby we could legalise cheaper fares and encourage people to travel more cheaply by giving bus operators vehicles free of excise duty.  Unless we do something like this I do not know what will happen.  It is beginning to cost so much to live in the places about which I am speaking that we are encouraging people to come to cities and towns, and this is socially unjust in the long run.</P>
    <P>There was not enough clamour when the railways were being cut back 20 years ago.  Many lines were closed down because they were not paying and the right decision was not taken.  We did not look to the future and the situation will worsen during coming years.  These railway lines should have been kept and we should encourage more freight traffic on the railways.  One of the greatest problems in this city is the traffic problem.  The journey from Phoenix Park to here can take the best part of an hour.  As people become more prosperous the number of cars will increase and some thought must be given to a highway or ring road for Dublin.</P>
    <P>The budget has been savage for the motorist.  He may gain a certain amount through PAYE changes but he will pay in the region of £220 extra in the price of petrol alone, not taking account of the increase in the price of cars and the increased registration fee.  The motorist will realise that he is being hoodwinked.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the fishing industry.  I happened to meet a trawler-man last Saturday and he told me he has estimated that the diesel used in operating his fishing boat from the port of Killybegs will cost an extra £700 per <Col N="2177" /> week.  Admittedly he has a fairly big boat and the average figure may be about £400 per week per fishing vessel.  Fishermen will not be able to afford their boats during the next few years because of these massive cost increases.  They will need a very large increase in the price of fish and will also need to catch greater quantities.  Many of them are set for a very rough passage.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the budget for mushroom growers and tomato and hothouse owners to get a rebate in relation to fuel costs and a similar arrangement is made for CIE.  This should apply also to fishermen.  Many of them will not be able to exist without such a rebate.</P>
    <P>How many people realise that our fishermen are competing against fishing vessels from other EEC countries?  The French fleet receive a subsidy from their Government towards the cost of oil for their boats, yet here we have an industry in its infancy and the Minister for Finance has decided that fishermen can afford to pay an extra £400 or £500 per week.  Most of our fishing ports are far from Dublin and when the fish are landed they must be loaded on to lorries for the long journey to Dublin.  In the case of Killybegs the journey is 400 miles.  The cost of diesel oil will put the livelihood of fishermen in jeopardy and they will have to ask the public to pay more for fish. The intervention price of fish is so low at present that they must be dumped back into the sea.  On the one hand there are spiralling costs, particularly in relation to diesel oil, and on the other hand disastrously low prices for fish.  The Minister must consider these problems before there are redundancies in this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry told the House earlier today that about 250 fishermen are in arrears in payments on their boats.  If something is not done urgently then in six months time there will be many more fishermen in arrears.</P>
    <P>What about the indirect line being taken by the Government?  Has anyone mentioned the BIM cutbacks in their offices? <Col N="2178" /> Does the Minister for Finance realise that the allocation for the production of literature designed to encourage people to eat more fish has been cut back from £30,000 to a meagre £10,000 for 1980?  The cookery demonstrators who have been doing such a good job in showing people how best to cook fish are not being allowed to do as many cookery demonstrations as in the past and their jobs may be in jeopardy.  This is because of the indirect budget whereby every Minister has been told he will have to cut corners because we are fast running out of money and we will not be able to borrow on favourable terms unless there is a cut-back.  The Minister should tell BIM not to cut back in the area of demonstrations.  I have already explained how hard it is for fishermen to make a living and mentioned the low price being paid for fish.  It would be entirely wrong to cease efforts to encourage people to buy and eat more fish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to raise this matter on the Adjournment because of the seriousness with which I view the cut which has been inflicted on the money available to the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty.  I do not think there is any single act that gives a better insight into the philosophy, both political and otherwise, of the Taoiseach and his Government than the decision to make a cut of approximately £122,000 in the allocation for the Committee and their work.  When I spoke on the appointment of the Taoiseach on 11 December last, as reported in volume 317, column 1342 of the Official Report, I made the following observation:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His lack of understanding of the position of recipients of social welfare and of the major problem of poverty in our society is perhaps best illustrated by his attitude&mdash;on taking <Col N="2179" /> up office and persisted in over the last two-and-a-half years&mdash;towards the National Committee to Combat Poverty.  He has obstructed the work of that Committee in every way possible, short of taking any action that would have political repercussions against himself.  That, also, would run contrary to his persistent aim of maintaining his personal ambition to be where he is today&mdash;Leader of Fianna Fáil and is yet to be voted Taoiseach in this House.</P>
    <P>On 11 December last I predicted what has happened in the budget with regard to the National Committee to Combat Poverty, on the basis of my knowledge of the attitude of the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Social Welfare in relation to the work of that Committee.</P>
    <P>Everything that Committee sought to do, their expertise and detached assessment of what was required to be done in order to achieve the elimination of poverty in our society, was anathema to everything the Taoiseach and his Government stand for.  I am not talking about a group of left wing radicals, even by the Taoiseach's definition of such.  I am talking about a group of people who in their field had acquired a well justified reputation for their expertise and concern in the field of poverty.  They came from all walks of life, members of the clergy, religious orders down to trade union officials and social workers, irrespective of what their political affiliations may have been.  On appointing them it was my belief, although I was not sure because it was not a matter of consideration, that some of them actually subscribed to Fianna Fáil.  They were appointed purely on the basis of their expertise and their concern in the field of poverty.  They were not and would not be subject to any political interference e or dictation.</P>
    <P>In a preface to one of their draft reports they mentioned something along the lines&mdash;I am subject to correction as to the exact phraseology not to the train of thought&mdash;that it was essential to recognise that if poverty was to be eliminated in our society there must be a <Col N="2180" /> redistribution not only of existing wealth in our society but in the power structures within our society and that we could not continue to alienate between 20 and 25 per cent of our people who live in poverty.  That was deleted because the Taoiseach found it objectionable to his political thinking and his philosophy of life.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has now carried that particular antagonism towards the work and objectives of the Committee by taking the first decisive steps to putting this Committee out of business.  The cuts this year could not be justified economically. We are talking about a budget of approximately £3,000 million and the cut in the allocation is £122,000 of what they sought.  The Minister at Question Time today said that the Committee's allocation had not been cut and, in fact, they had retained the same rate.  In 1979 they spent £549,800 and this year, allowing for a 16 per cent inflation rate, they sought £622,000 and they were allocated £500,000.  In money terms that was a cut of nearly £50,000 and in real terms sufficient to put this Committee out of business.  It is more serious when we realise that it coincides with the year when the operations of the poverty Committee are up for review at EEC level.</P>
    <P>I recall in 1974, when as a junior Minister in the last Administration, I was under the direction of the then Tánaiste, Deputy Brendan Corish, I put forward at EEC level proposals that the poverty projects would be taken up by the nine member states.  This committee had been established here and financed nationally before the EEC initiative was taken.  The creation of the EEC projects at EEC level was closely identified with Ireland. There was a very warm response from people concerned in the poverty area throughout the other eight member states towards our initiative.  It was seen that there was a positive input by Ireland instead of, as we were traditionally seen, looking for something out of the EEC. Although it was a positive input into the thinking of the EEC and the operations of the social policy of the EEC we also gained financially.</P>
    <P>To prove further that this money <Col N="2181" /> could not be taken away on economic grounds but purely on political antagonism towards the work of the committee, their objectives and their professional assessment of what was necessary we have to look at the EEC. In 1975, the first year the committee came into operation, they got £30,435 from the EEC, in 1976 they got £108,630, in 1977, £130,445, in 1978, £165,500, 1979 £234,550 and in 1980, £238,000. When we are now undermining the work of the committee at national level the operations of the committee are under review at EEC level.  It will be clearly seen by our fellow EEC members that the country which sponsored and promoted this committee in 1974 are now abandoning them nationally and hence at EEC level.  I have no doubt that the decision by the Government will finish the work of this committee nationally because the Taoiseach and his Government are opposed to it.  They have always been antagonistic towards that committee, and because of their action in cutting back the allocation the committee will finish at EEC level.  This will not only affect the 20 to 25 per cent of our own people but tens of thousands of people living in poverty throughout the EEC.</P>
    <P>I can give two further examples of the economic necessity for a cut-back of £100,000 in a budget of £3,000 million. There is the fact that in the budget&mdash;I mentioned this before and I do so again because it also clearly illustrates what the priorities of the Government are&mdash;the Minister for Finance announced that he was granting £100,000 &mdash;almost exactly the same figure&mdash;to a national organisation, the GAA, to compensate them for having to pay VAT on hurling sticks.  I do not want to be misinterpreted as attacking the GAA, a great national organisation, but I would like to know what their priorities are, hurling sticks or the 25 per cent of our people living in prverty.  If they were asked, where would that £100,000 go?  I have no doubt that the vast majority of the members of the GAA would agree with me that in any Christian society the priority would be to combat poverty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> Another example of the priorities of this Government is the Navan Chamber of Commerce getting a grant of £100,000 to build an exhibition hall. There are not many votes in poverty and because of the development of our society it is very difficult to get across to people what is really happening within the 20 to 25 per cent.  Back in the thirties and forties nearly everyone was living in poverty; they had that in common and had an insight into and understanding of what poverty meant to them and to their children.  Now that has all changed. There has been economic growth and development.  Progress has been made on a number of fronts and approximately 75 to 80 per cent of our people live in relative affluence.  It is very difficult to get across to them and to marshal their support in getting something done for the other 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>I believe the Taoiseach has made that assessment in political and vote terms. He realises there are more votes in hurling sticks than in hungry children, that there are more votes in hurling sticks than in people living in appalling housing conditions where opportunities, where they exist, are marginal; children go to first-level education in crowded classrooms with no jobs at the end of it or jobs that will only last two or three years where they will be exploited.  Is there a full realisation even here in this House that within half a mile of where I am standing children will go to bed hungry tonight and it is nothing unusual; most nights they go to bed hungry. Within that 20 to 25 per cent it has been estimated that there are 215,000 children and the future in Christian Ireland is not very bright for them.</P>
    <P>But the Taoiseach believes &mdash;and I believe somewhere he indicated publicly that if a person is poor he is poor through his own fault.  No thinking person could objectively give that assessment. Those people are poor because the machinery and structures of this State were constructed in such a way as to make them poor and they have been revised over the years to ensure that they <Col N="2183" /> stay poor.  Unless there are fundamental changes in our whole economic structure, in our whole social structure, in our power structure these people will stay poor.  The Taoiseach is a very smart man indeed, highly intelligent.  He realises that and he realises that if that assessment comes out from a committee of the calibre and reputation of the poverty committee that it will be listened to by the media and conveyed by the media to the general public.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to speak in a detached way about this subject if one has an insight into what it really means in human terms.  We have a number of burning political issues at the moment, tax on farmers, tax on PAYE workers, job creation and national understandings. All of them have power groups behind them, people who are well organised, usually well financed, very articulate and with considerable political muscle.  There is very little political muscle behind the people who live and are condemned to live in poverty.  If we allow this committee to go out of existence, if we allow its work to be brushed aside and stopped our whole position as a Christian society or a Christian people is called seriously into question.  There are organisations here who should be extremely vocal, not just about this cut of £100,000 which is only symbolical, but about the attitude of the Government towards this problem and their determination and the determination of the present Taoiseach in particular to put an end to the activities of what he apparently regards as being a group of dangerously left wing radicals who are trying to deal with this situation. Anyone who thinks that they are dangerously left wing should go down and look at those people who are on the committee, look at their background, look at their positions, look at their record.  By no stretch of the imagination do they come into that definition.  But if there is not an outcry, if there is not a protest by the trade union movement, by the churches, by organisations like the St. Vincent de Paul Society, I believe they are seriously neglecting their <Col N="2184" /> responsibility to those people because we can have all the charitable lip service, we can have all the do gooders but if we, as an organised society, do not recognise this cancer within our society and the human suffering that is in it and take positive steps to eradicate it we will have forfeited the right to describe ourselves as a Christian people.</P>
    <P>The Minister, even at this late stage should ensure that the working of this committee is not only continued but is financed so that it can expand.  At the moment there are 16 projects which have been undertaken by the committee. They fall into the categories of action and research.  They have, in most cases, shown positive results and in fact their impact upon the communities in which they work has been very positive indeed and extremely encouraging.  I think it is because they have been encouraging, because they have been making progress, because they have been able to convey to these people that they have rights as citizens and that they have power as citizens that this action has been taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to refute the allegations made by Deputy Cluskey especially in relation to my predecessor.  I would like to point out and put on the record the fact that my predecessor approved all the projects which were submitted to him by the combat poverty committee.  Second, he provided adequate funds including Supplementary Estimates to meet the committee's needs including increased salaries under national agreements. Third, he supported the extension of the programme in 1977 for three further years.  In addition, in relation to the philosophy of the Government which has been attacked by Deputy Cluskey, I would like to say once again that I abhor his habit of comparing the GAA and hurling sticks with hungry children and poor housing conditions.  It is grossly unfair of him to put these two elements in juxtaposition with an enormous budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with his view of the Government's <Col N="2185" /> philosophy.  In the budget it was quite clear that the emphasis was to protect and improve the lot of the genuinely needy in our society.  The policy implemented in the budget is quite clear.  Over £90 million has been transferred to those most in need.  We all know the details.  There were increases of 25 per cent for the long-term beneficiaries, 20 per cent for short-term and children's allowances were increased by 28 per cent.  This is a record of which the Government can be proud although there still remains a great deal to be done in relation to poverty and genuine need.</P>
    <P>In relation to the taxation benefits, 83,000 people were removed from the tax net and a further 130,000 have been moved from a higher to a lower band. There is also special aid for pensioners. A married couple who are pensioners now have a tax free allowance up to £4,000.  This in total represents a massive redistribution of wealth to those who are less well off.  To this I add my personal commitment to the development of the voluntary community organisations as the structural means of attacking poverty loneliness and the need for care in our society.</P>
    <P>The EEC programme to combat poverty is due to terminate on 1 December 1980 and taking the shorter period into account the financial allocation to the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty for 1980 represent a slight increase on that for 1979.  The committee have been informed of their allocation and I understand they are examining this situation.  The financial allocation for the committee for 1979 included a supplementary estimate of £50,000 to cover increased pay and other costs during the year.  That amounted to £543,000.  The estimate approved by the Government for 1980 is £500,000.</P>
    <P>The EEC programme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty, of which the Irish programme forms a part, is due to end on 1 December 1980.  At last year's rate of expenditure the sum required for the 11 months of 1980 would <Col N="2186" /> be £497,750 and on this basis the allocation for 1980 represents an increase of £2,250.</P>
    <P>On 26 February 1980 the committee were asked to submit a restructured budget within the allocation provided and until this is received it will not be possible to assess accurately how the programme will be affected.  The committee in a letter received on 10 March have requested a meeting to discuss their financial allocation for 1980, the future of the programme and certain other matters. I understand the committee will submit a restructured budget shortly and I will then be in a position to meet them for a discussion on the matter.</P>
    <P>The EEC Commission have submitted a proposal to the Council of Ministers for an interim programme to combat poverty to cover the period of approximately two years between the end of the current programme and the implementation of any measures decided on as a result of an evaluation of that programme.  The Commission's proposal is under discussion in the Council of Ministers at working party level and no decision is expected for some months.</P>
    <P>The provision made in the Estimates is designed to meet the committee's commitments up to December next and this will give ample time for consideration of the Commission's proposals.  The allocation for the committee in the 1980 Estimate has no bearing on any action to be taken after November and will in no way prejudice the decision of the Council of Ministers on the proposed EEC interim programme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was born in July 1914 and as he has not attained age 66 years he is not qualified on age grounds for an old age pension.</P>
      <P>However, he claimed a retirement pension on 3 July 1979.  As it is one of the conditions for the receipt of such pension that the person must have retired from employment, the employer was requested to confirm the date of cessation of employment.  The employer stated that employment had continued up to 7 September 1979, whereas the claimant had stated in his application form that he had ceased work on 28 June 1979.  As no social insurance contributions were paid in respect of him after 1973, it was not possible to verify from the stamped cards the actual date of cessation of employment.  As he has stated that he was employed from 1974 to 1979 further action is being taken locally to secure payment of the outstanding contributions in respect of this period.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, he has been awarded a retirement pension at a reduced rate of £18.35 from 13 September 1979, increased to £19.35 from 4 October 1979.

      <P>New house completions in 1979 were as follows: (a) 20,330 private houses, including an estimated 450 conversions; (b) 6,214 local authority houses.  Twenty-five of the houses at (a) were provided by the Irish Land Commission and the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I expect to notify housing authorities shortly of their capital allocations for existing commitments on their local authority house construction programmes in 1980, including new work already started this year.  In accordance with normal practice for a number of years past, additional allocations will be made later in the year to authorities for more new work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will forward details of the commitments allocations to the Deputy, with comparative figures for 1979, as soon as they are available.  An initial allocation for the payment of house purchase and <Col N="2154" /> reconstruction loans and supplementary grants is notified to local authorities at the beginning of each year for the six month period ending on 30 June.  A further allocation is made in July.  A separate allocation is not made for house purchase loans.  The allocation also provides for payment of reconstruction and low rise mortgage loans, and supplementary grants.  On 11 March I notified authorities of their initial allocations for this purpose for the period ending 30 June 1980.  Details of the allocation to each authority together with comparative figures for 1979 are as follows:&mdash;</P>

The increased pension will be paid as soon as the decision of the pension committee to that effect has been received.  It is understood that the committee is to meet next week when it is expected it will give its decision.</P>
