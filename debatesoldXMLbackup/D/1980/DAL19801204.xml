      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the constitution of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) adopted in Vienna on 8 April 1979.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, or UNIDO as it is generally known, was established on 1 January 1967 as a result of a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 17 November 1966.  It was established with the aim of promoting and accelerating the industrialisation of the developing countries.  Its mandate also makes the organisation responsible for co-ordinating within the United Nations system all activities relating to industrialisation in the developing countries.</P>

      <P>UNIDO is an integral part of the United Nations Organisation and all member states of the United Nations, together with those belonging to the United Nations specialised agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency, are eligible for membership of UNIDO's international industrial development board.  As at present constituted the board consist of 45 members which <Col N="410" /> are chosen by the UN General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographic representation.</P>
      <P>In fulfilling its mandate UNIDO provides assistance to developing countries wishing to formulate industrial policies, to establish new industries, including agro-based or agro-related industries, or to improve existing ones.  It undertakes various operational activities including measures for effective application of modern methods of industrial production, programming and planning; development, adaptation and transfer of technology to developing countries; and training of personnel.  The organisation assists developing countries in obtaining external financing for industrial projects and assists in establishing contacts between industrialised and developing countries with the aim of promoting co-operation in the field of industrialisation.</P>
      <P>UNIDO at present derives its finances from a number of sources.  Expenses for administrative and research activities &mdash; approximately 33 million dollars a year &mdash; are borne by the regular budget of the United Nations.  Technical assistance activities are financed mainly by the United Nations Development Programme, to which Ireland contributes directly.  In 1979 total project expenditures on technical co-operation programmes amounted to an estimated 70 million dollars of which the United Nations Development Programme provided over 51 million dollars, the UN Regular Programme of Technical Assistance, 3.8 million dollars and the United Nations Industrial Development Fund and other agencies over 15 million dollars. Ireland contributes regularly to the United Nations Development Programme and in 1979 a contribution of £35,000 was made to the United Nations Industrial Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second General Conference of UNIDO, held in Lima, Peru, in March 1975, recommended to the General Assembly of the United Nations that the organisation, UNIDO, should be converted into a specialised agency in order that its autonomy and functions be increased and expanded so that it might intensify and extend its activities.  The <Col N="411" /> conference considered that UNIDO had a crucial role to play in implementing the United Nations Declaration and Programme of Action on the establishment of a new international economic order and that it should serve as a forum for negotiations in the field of industry between developed and developing countries and between developing countries themselves.</P>
    <P>The United Nations General Assembly, in a resolution adopted at its seventh special session in September 1975, endorsed the conversion of UNIDO into a specialised agency.  Following lengthy discussions among the member states of the United Nations over a three-year period agreement on a Constitution for UNIDO as a specialised agency was reached on 8 April 1979.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the new constitution the primary objective of UNIDO shall be the promotion and acceleration of industrial development in the developing countries with a view to assisting in the establishment of a new international economic order.  The organisation will also promote industrial development and co-operation on global, regional and national as well as on sectoral levels.  In fulfilment of these objectives UNIDO will take all necessary and appropriate action and will encourage and extend assistance to the developing countries in the promotion and acceleration of their industrialisation, in particular in the development, expansion and modernisation of their industries by encouraging development and planning techniques, acting as a forum for contact between all countries organising training programmes and promoting and assisting in the development, selection, adaptation, transfer and use of technology, having regard for the specific requirements of particular industries.</P>
    <P>The principal organs of UNIDO when its constitution enters into force will be the General Conference, the Industrial Development Board, the Programme and Budget Committee and the Secretariat.</P>
    <P>The general conference will consist of all the member States, while the industrial <Col N="412" /> development board shall consist of 53 members, and the programme and budget committee of 27 members, with due regard, in both cases, to the principle of equitable geographic distribution.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides that UNIDO's regular budget will be borne by the member states, as apportioned in accordance with a scale of assessment established by the conference.  This will result in a corresponding reduction in the UN regular budget in respect of UNIDO. The scale of assessment for UNIDO's budget will be based to the extent possible on the scale most recently used by the United Nations.  On this basis, Ireland would be assessed at the rate of 0.16 per cent.  Provision also exists for voluntary contributions to the organisation.</P>
    <P>Provision in the Constitution exists for allowing UNIDO to enter into agreements establishing appropriate relationships with other organisations of the United Nations system and with other intergovernmental and governmental organisations and there is also provision for the settlement of any disputes which might arise among members of the organisation.</P>
    <P>Membership of the organisation is open to &ldquo;all States which associate themselves with the objectives and principles of the Organisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Constitution was open for signature by member states of the United Nations at the Austrian Foreign Ministry, in Vienna, until 7 October 1979 and may now be signed at UN Headquarters in New York until it enters into force.  Article 26 of the Constitution provides that it shall be subject to ratification, acceptance or approval by signatory States.  The Constitution will enter into force when at least eighty states that have deposited instruments of ratification acceptance or approval notify the Depositary (the UN Secretary-General) that they have agreed that it will enter into force.  Up to the present time, the Constitution has been signed by 89 States and has already been ratified by 18.</P>
    <P>Ireland has collaborated with UNIDO in a number of areas since it was established and we would hope to increase our collaboration with the new UNIDO in <Col N="413" /> the future.  As a country with a relatively recent history of industrialisation, we are particularly suited to help with many of the problems which developing countries at an initial stage of their industrialisation process have to face.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention two examples of co-operation with UNIDO, which illustrate this point.  UNIDO have a programme of assistance in industrial free-zone operation and for a number of years, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (SFADCo) have been associated with this programme, mainly in the areas of consultancy work and training.  Courses usually cover project appraisal, foreign investment, small-scale industrial and entrepreneurial development.  These aspects are of particular importance to countries at an early stage of development.  Another example is the work in which Bord na Móna are involved in Rwanda.  That country is rich in peat reserves.  Ireland has the technical expertise and know-how for the exploitation of this important resource in a small, poor, land-locked country.  In collaboration with UNIDO and with funds from the Bilateral Aid Programme of my Department, a beginning has been made. Extraction and processing of peat is now under way on a pilot basis.  When production becomes more mechanised on a larger scale, it will mean substantial savings on energy costs for Rwanda.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that UNIDO plans to give more attention to Africa's industrial needs in the coming decade.  The developing countries there face a growing imbalance in imports of manufactured goods over exports.  Increasing dependence on imported oil, consumer goods and foodstuffs has created enormous debt problems for the poorer countries. Given that our own bilateral aid programme is concentrated in a number of African countries, we have a particular interest in African needs and Africa's future.  We welcome the UNIDO emphasis on Africa, therefore, and look forward to more extensive and fruitful collaboration with that organisation in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that a greater meshing of bilateral and multilateral <Col N="414" /> efforts on a regional and local basis is required in Africa, as elsewhere.  We have taken great care to ensure that our bilateral projects fit in with the development plans in the various countries.  It is up to the multilateral agencies to provide a wider framework, one which will enable individual countries to see their development in relation to whole regions and make more realistic assessments of their situation.  While many of the poorer regions will have to concentrate in the immediate future on basic requirements, especially food and rural development, this does not altogether exclude industrial development.  In fact, if their food and agricultural sector is to be placed on a sound footing in the longterm, they must lay the foundations for industrial growth also.  The latter cannot simply be put off, even if a particular country consciously wished to do so.  The important thing is to find the right balance and then to obtain what is required in the way of inputs.</P>
    <P>In one sense, developing countries at this stage have a certain advantage, in that a multilateral framework both for aid and advice now exists.  And this is vitally important for them.  It helps to provide them with a second opinion as it were, enabling them to take a more objective view of bilateral inputs and co-operation. This is a healthy situation provided that the individual recipient country itself is allowed to make its own choices, and provided that the multilateral and bilateral frameworks remain areas of co-operation, not of competition.</P>
    <P>It only remains for me to say that the growing emphasis, within the UN system generally, on the industrialisation needs of developing countries is to be welcomed. In the years to come, UNIDO will have a vital role to play.  As I have said many times of late, the problems of developing countries are now the problems of all countries.  The only real solutions in future will be global ones.  The choice for all is a relatively simple one and it derives from the basic fact of interdependence. Either we use that interdependence to overcome the mutual problem of economic ill-health or we <Col N="415" /> allow ourselves to become the victims of a relationship between developed and developing countries which dooms both sides to economic stagnation and despair.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not being present at the beginning of the Minister's speech.  I had assumed that statements on the recent Summit meeting would take priority this morning.  In relation to this motion, I wish to voice the approval of the Opposition.  Certainly we on the Fine Gael benches approve the Government's support of the Constitution of UNIDO.</P>
      <P>This motion gives us an opportunity to look at the activities of UNIDO in the context of our overall approach to the developing countries.  It was established to promote  and accelerate the industrialisation of developing countries.  Only 7 per cent of the world's industrial production comes from the developing world and it is clear that this huge imbalance is such that unless aid is given to help to increase that figure substantially not only will the developing countries suffer but ultimately all the countries of the world will suffer.  The objective originally outlined at the Lima meeting in 1975 was to increase that percentage to 25 per cent by the end of the century.  In view of the record of aid over the past few years it seems unlikely that anything like that percentage will be achieved.  At the same time we must support any moves towards that aim.</P>
      <P>The Minister points out that there will be an increasing concentration on Africa where we have a substantial bilateral interest.  However, one would not wish to see the exclusion of developing countries in other parts of the world, especially in Central and South America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the increasing complexity of aid operations, there is a great need not just for legislators but for the public in general to be informed as to exactly what is going on and what the different organisations are doing.  Only by an increasing education programme can we get public support for a greater commitment by the Government towards achieving the UN <Col N="416" /> target.  I would venture a guess that not one in a hundred people would know what UNIDO was and it seems that we are not doing our duty in this House in discussing the intricacies of this organisation and then leaving it at that.  I am more and more convinced that the question of informing the public as to exactly how the problem of aid is being tackled on an international basis is of prime importance.</P>
    <P>I am remainded of the fact that the Dutch, who have a very good aid record, are well ahead of the United Nations target of. 7 per cent of GNP; they are up to 1 per cent.  They spent a major share of their budget ensuring that the public are fully informed of what is happening. As a result there is substantial public support for the aid programme implemented by the Dutch government, not just the present government but the last government which changed in 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is likely there will be a change there as well as here next year.  The complexities are not just related to the multiplicity of organisations involved but to the actual difficulty in getting aid to where it is most needed, to ensuring that such aid is put to best effect and to exploring and understanding the problems, due to lack of infrastructure in the countries in receipt of aid.</P>
      <P>This situation is highlighted by the present situation in Italy, which is not a backward country.  Yet they seem to have tremendous difficulty in coping with the aftermath of the earthquake and ensuring that the goodwill of other nations, related into aid, reaches those who are so much in need.  These problems are multiplied a hundredfold in those countries which do not have the facilities which exist in Italy &mdash; proper road and telephone systems and a civil service which should be geared to deal with emergency situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are only a few of the problems that arise in regard to this motion &mdash; to provide help to promote industrial development in the Third World.  Some people here might assume that if they wanted to <Col N="417" /> help a Third World country all they would have to do is provide extra assistance to a local IDA in that country, but such structures do not exist in most of these countries.  In many cases the civil service is inadequate and there is very often a real problem of communication. I am told that in some of these countries where projects are reasonably successful in rural areas the local people who become very proficient in putting the projects through are almost automatically asked by their respective Governments to come into the civil service and are withdrawn from the areas where they have been achieving a lot of benefit.</P>
    <P>These are just a few of the difficulties that arise in having a proper aid programme. Perhaps they point to the need for having a multiplicity of organisations with specialised knowledge involved in those programmes.  At some stage, perhaps even now, questions will be asked about whether there is a need for all these organisations.  I believe many specialised organisations are set up to fill a special need and there is no examination as to the basis for their continuance.  At some time in the international sphere there will have to be a close examination of all these international organisations to ensure that they are not just existing but to see if they have outlived their usefulness and if a certain amount of rationalisation might be of benefit.</P>
    <P>The real point I want to make in this debate is that I believe there is a need for a greater effort to be made to inform our people of the need for aid to the Third World and the complexities involved in getting such aid to the Third World.  From that point of view, we have to look at what we are doing in this area.  I appreciate our aid programme is quite small and I do not propose at this stage to do more than remind the Minister of that. Our figure at less than. 2 per cent of GNP is very small by international standards. While I appreciate that internationally there has been a slowing down of such aid, I believe we should be doing much more.</P>
    <P>The Estimates are in the course of preparation for 1981 and I strongly appeal to the Minister to resist any further pressures <Col N="418" /> to reduce the development aid programme and ask him to ensure that last year's shortfall will be made up and that the appropriate further increase that would in normal times be made for 1981 will be added.  This is my opportunity to appeal to the Minister to fight the corner for development aid and ensure that we can once again hold our heads reasonably high in the international field and point to a reasonable aid programme from Ireland to the developing world.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to the main thrust of my contribution which to a large degree relates to our lack of knowledge of what is happening in the Third World, the difficulties that exist there and what we might do about them.  Here the aid programme is generally administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has a very wide range of responsibilities from the point of view of the United Nations, the EEC and so on and can only devote a limited amount of time to overseeing our development aid programme and to contacts with the Third World.  With the huge number of Ministers of State that we have at present &mdash; most people would consider that we have far too many and that most of them are half redundant anyway &mdash; now is the time to consider making one of such Ministers of State more gainfully employed.  Therefore I would strongly advocate the appointment of one such Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs who would have overall responsibility for our development aid programme and relations with the Third World.  I believe such a step would be a progressive one and that such an appointment might be coupled with greater emphasis being placed on information here at home about the Third World.  I would point out to the House that many other European countries have Ministers for International Co-operation who are concerned solely with development aid programmes and relations with the developing countries.  I am not in any way suggesting that our present Minister be relieved entirely of responsibility in this matter.  However I believe that, with a Minister of State involved <Col N="419" /> and specifically in charge of such a programme, we would be able to make more progress and ensure that there is a heightened public awareness in this country of the need to expand our contacts with the Third World.  With such appointment I think there would be a greater political will providing the necessary funds to play our part better and perform a greater role in helping the Third World.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party I should say that we support the motion before the House. The amounts of money involved are small but, of course, they are fixed by international quota on the basis of 0.16 per cent of the overall budget.  I observe that there is provision for voluntary contributions to the organisation.  I am not sure whether these are voluntary governmental contributions or whether they are related to a contribution by private individuals or organisations.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering a motion like this the House may well run the risk of missing what is really happening in the world at present.  The agency to which this motion refers and which will be created when another 62 or 63 countries like ours ratify this agreement will have very little impact in terms of Third World industrialisation in comparison with the role that the multinational or trans-national corporations are having currently in the world of industrialisation.  I was surprised and somewhat disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the major force for industrialisation in the world today, which is undoubtedly the collective activities of what are now called the trans-national or multinational corporations.  Until such time as the international community at United Nations level, within the EEC and even within the context of UNCTAD, begins to look seriously at the operations of these corporations the real benefits of industrialisation, which are undoubtedly required, will be ceded not to the people who produce the wealth in various countries but rather back to the corporate headquarters, which are usually registered <Col N="420" /> in some multiplicity of tax havens such as Liechtenstein or the Cayman Islands with their official headquarters in London, New York or Paris.</P>
      <P>This House in agreeing to this motion in effect will be agreeing to commit this country to paying a certain amount of money albeit a miniscule amount relative to the total cost, less than 1 per cent, to support an agency which will be facilitating the industrialisation of Third World countries, and there is here a certain emphasis on Africa.  The concern of my party is that taxpayers' money could and may very well be used to the ultimate benefit of private multinational companies or anonymously owned multinational companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a problem related to the whole question of the establishment of a new economic order on the international stage if certain rights and obligations do not travel with it.  For example, I do not see any benefit to the community at large, or to individual countries, if as a result of increased working standards of safety and decent wages being paid in a country such as Italy, the Fiat Corporation and Volkswagen Corporation transfer their vehicle manufacturing plants from that country to Brazil where trade unions are suppressed, where basic human rights are constantly repressed by the military regime.  In what was otherwise a very comprehensive speech introducing this motion &mdash; which merely asks us to ratify the establishment of this separate agency I am sorry the Minister did not refer to that aspect of the whole process of industrialisation.  The major problem facing the economic international community in attempting to achieve the new international economic order to which President Boumedienne first gave voice at the United Nations Assembly in 1967, particularly in the western world, is undoubtedly the massive collective power of the multinational corporations. Many of these corporations have budgets way in excess of medium to small-sized countries.  Their economic leverage, their access to know-how, their manipulation of technology their ability to fund and research educational institutions in the developed world for their exclusive benefit, <Col N="421" /> and indeed their ability to buy or topple Third World countries &mdash; which has been all to well documented &mdash; is awesome.  The democratic international community is fooling itself if it does not recognise that this is a new major economic international force that must be contained within the context of international laws.  The tragedy for this country is that neither within the context of the Nine, soon to become the Ten Members of the EEC, nor within the context of UNCTAD and the United Nations generally, have we begun sufficiently to recognise this.  In part we have a conflict of interest.  On the one hand we have an agency, the Industrial Development Authority, successfully selling the attractiveness of Ireland to the international corporations.  Today's newspaper headlines announce 40,000 job approvals for that agency.</P>
    <P>If every country in the world starts to bid for the favours of these international corporations with tax concessions and grants, the net effect will be that the offers will be increased, the public tax benefits will be enlarged and the people who will ultimately benefit will be the international corporations themselves.  In Belfast we have had the spectacle of the Delorean car project, a most extreme example of the way in which depressed areas in the world, desperate for jobs because of the failure of the economic system, bid for or attempt to bribe industrialists to come in to produce the magic jobs at enormous price.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister's interest in development co-operation will be allowed to mature and develop and that we will not see him here after Christmas with another portfolio.  I hope that in participating in the work of UNIDO, which will now become a separate agency, the aspect of industrialisation I have been talking about on a global scale will be looked at, because it seems to be quite pointless to promote and develop, either on a multilateral or bilateral way, industrial development in certain countries if as a result of that those countries get locked into the machinations and the market framework of international corporations. Specifically, we will not <Col N="422" /> achieve the objectives, particularly in the western world, of shifting the balance of industrialisation on equitable terms from the 7 per cent to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the target figure of 25 per cent of industrial produce in the world by the end of this century if the problem of the multinational corporations is not properly recognised internationally at political level and then dealt with.</P>
    <P>We have this problem domestically in the oil situation.  The corporation tax contribution of &ldquo;the seven sisters&rdquo;, the big oil companies, to the Irish Exchequer is a scandal and anyone who knows anything about the taxation system knows it.  The oil companies can do it because of manipulation: their buying price in one country and their selling price in another, their paper transfers around the globe, registering particular trading companies, a multiplicity of holding companies.  With professional tax advisers they can minimise their net contribution to the world and at the same time get from the world and from organisations like UNIDO tax supports and indeed cash.</P>

      <P>I do not think we can take ourselves seriously as supporters of UNIDO unless we recognise these matters. It is the core of this problem.  The motion before us is quite clear, we are in favour of it and we accept the role of UNIDO in providing a multinational framework of aid and basic advice for countries which need it.  The actual contribution that we will have to make is very small and I hope the Minister will clarify what the relationship in fiscal terms will be of UNIDO, which will be directly funded by state levies, and the UNDP.  The Minister made it clear that UNDP last year contributed about £51 million towards the £70 million estimated budget.  The director general, Mr. Morse, was recently in Dublin and spoke of the financial difficulties of UNDP, and I am wondering how this restructuring will alleviate the problems of UNDP.  I am aware of some of the positive work that <Col N="423" /> organisation have done in the matter of providing advice on industrialisation to emerging countries.</P>
      <P>There are only 18 states, excluding our own, who have ratified or are in the process of ratifying this resolution, and 62 others will be required before the 80-State quota will be achieved in order to establish UNIDO as an independent body.  Perhaps the Minister will give some indication of the timetable within which UNIDO can become a separate agency.</P>

      <P>The whole purpose of the measure before the House is to ensure that UNIDO can operate as an autonomous agency in an effective manner. Heretofore it did not have the degree of independence and permanence now being guaranteed by a new constitution. Effectively, the cost of expert advice, equipment and the forms of technical co-operation to which I have referred, are met by UNDP, and UNIDO is the executing agency of UNDP.</P>
      <P>Primarily, the financing comes by way of contributions from member countries, but Deputy O'Keeffe referred to financing on a voluntary basis.  Special UNIDO projects are financed out of a fund, established by UNDP in 1976, with a funding level of 50 million dollars annually.  Voluntary contributions to the fund began at about one-fifth of the target but they are rising, providing more resources than previous voluntary funds.  In addition to contributions from member countries there is this special voluntary fund, and receipts into that fund are rising steadily. Special efforts are being made to provide a separate special funding mechanism as well.  However, the primary financing is still by way of direct contributions from states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn devoted some time to multinationals.  I will not engage in an argument about the desirability or otherwise of international corporations.  However, they are a fact of life, part of the economic development of mankind. They make a contribution by way of development and employment.  Much of the advance research and development <Col N="424" /> work essential to industry in the future is carried out and paid for by multinational companies.  So there is a positive side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I do not doubt it, but that is all the more reason to regulate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the obvious dangers in excessive power structures of that kind, and within the UN there is a strong awareness of this and negotiations are being undertaken on a code of conduct for multinationals.  We hope to see that code emerging very shortly.  We expect to see a conclusion in the matter next year.  We hope before the end of 1981 we will have established an international code of conduct applicable to multinational companies.  That is the sensible approach: to acknowledge that there is a certain economic dynamism that makes the existence of multinational companies part of the modern, international economic order but that in the greater interest there should be a regulatory code of conduct which will apply to them and ensure that any excesses on their part are avoided.  This international code of conduct will, we hope, emerge before the end of next year with a proper system of implementation as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of the welcome that has been given to this measure, which is part of the whole drive towards a new international order, which is now very much a major objective of UN policy.  We had a special session of the UN some months ago on this whole area.  Negotiations are proceeding towards the specific details of an international economic strategy.  We have already referred in an earlier debate to the Brandt Report.  It in popular form sets out the whole philosophy behind the essential need in the modern world to have an international global strategy towards the creation of an international economic order.  It is for the benefit of the developed world as well as for the developing world that an interaction of interests in this area, both from the practical point of view and from the moral, idealistic point of view, makes good, practical, political and economic sense. From the social and ethical point of view it is also necessary.  We cannot have growing <Col N="425" /> disparities within our world.  If we have them, we will see before the end of this century stagnation in the developed as well as the developing world, because there will not be any market for the technological products and expertise of the developed world.  If the developing world is allowed to proceed into a situation of disaster, tension and conflict, the developed world will begin to stagnate.</P>
    <P>There are from the overall political point of view many dangerous revolutionary strains inherent in the horrible prospect of one half of the world starving through inability to cope and the other half of it proceeding at a pace ahead of it.  There is need for a coincidence of development and investment as well as a balanced and harmonised approach to world development.  I believe that this will require an improvement of the mechanisms through which money and investment can be channelled towards the developing world.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for this motion is that we see in UNIDO an executive agency which will deal with the problem and will provide a proper basis for funding. I believe there will have to be similar reforms in relation to the World Bank and in regard to lending agencies generally. Private lending agencies will have to ensure a more appropriate recycling of funds, which is a major problem in the world at the moment, because of the oil revenues lying dormant in banks and institutions around the world which have not been spread out into investment.  This is a big practical challenge facing the lending institutions &mdash; private, national and international &mdash; at the moment.  We must secure a release of those funds for the required investment in the developing world.</P>
    <P>I would like again to pay tribute to the Irish State agencies and Irish private interests who are playing a very practical role in parts of the world, particularly in Africa.  As I mentioned in my opening speech, Bord na Móna have played a practical role in developing peat resources in Rwanda and Burundi. SFADCo have given advice to a number of countries around the world.  The ESB have given their advice in relation to the <Col N="426" /> construction of power stations and the distribution of electric power.  Aer Lingus have also been involved with a number of developing countries.  This is apart from the number of private agencies which are also involved.</P>
    <P>There is one contribution which we can make above any other.  We do not have funds to distribute on any large scale, but we have a considerable amount of expertise. Since the foundation of the State this expertise has contributed to the economic development of a state that has faced, over the past 50 years, precisely the same problems facing many of those emergent nations.  There is a capacity here that does not exist in many other countries and particularly within the State agencies which have been associated with this development.  Another one I want to name is the Agricultural Institute, which has done tremendous work in rural development.  The capacity and skill we have utilised in building up from what we were, a developing nation, can be translated by us into effective action on the ground by way of advice and help to those developing countries.  This can be given at their request.  They are in a position to make an assessment about what projects we can help.  We can give them that advice and help and, having built up the management and administration on the ground, we can take our departure.</P>
    <P>That is precisely the way we have operated through those various agencies. Deputy O'Keeffe referred to this earlier in regard to the Italian disaster.  One of the main difficulties one meets in developing countries is the absence of administration, management and the application of expertise and skills.  This is an area where we can give very valuable advice and help.  The most important aspect of all is that we are trusted by developing countries.  They see in us a country that can give and which does not have any bad associations with the past.  They realise that in dealing with us they are not dealing with people who are in there for any reasons other than to do the job as effectively as possible.  That trust is a very important factor in the relationship which exists between Ireland and developing <Col N="427" /> countries regarding projects of the kind I have described.</P>
    <P>That is far more important than the amount of money we give.  We can effectively bring about the type of relationship I am talking about.  We are particularly suited for this by reason of our background. What we can offer to give is much more important than sums of money.  Of course, money is important; but what I have just spoken about as our practical contribution on the ground is, I believe, far more important and far more enduring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éreann approves the co-operation agreement between the European Economic Community and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia together with a final act related to that agreement and the agreement between the member states of the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Coal and Steel Community of the one part, and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of the other part together with a final act related to that agreement.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since 1970, relations between the Community and Yugoslavia have been governed by two successive trade agreements; the first a three-year non-preferential agreement from 1970 to 1973 and the second, also non-preferential, from 1973 to 1978.  This latter agreement was tacitly renewed by both sides pending the conclusion of the new co-operation agreement which is brought today for approval by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of this co-operation agreement were negotiated over a period of approximately two years, from February 1978, when the first round of negotiations was held, to February 1980 when the agreement was initialled by both sides. <Col N="428" /> The aim of the agreement, which is of unspecified duration, is to promote trade between the Community and Yugoslavia while taking account of the levels of economic development of both sides.  In addition, it is designed to improve access to the Community market for products from Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>This is a new type of agreement, which is designed to strengthen relations between the Community and Yugoslavia while taking account of Yugoslavia's position as a non-aligned, Mediterranean, developing country.  It is intended to cover as many areas of co-operation as possible.  The negotiations leading up to it were lengthy, reflecting its complexity, but have led to a comprehensive agreement which can form the basis for further co-operation, which respects Yugoslavia's international position, and which underlines the Community's concern to consolidate and diversify its relationship with such an important trading partner.</P>
    <P>The agreement contains four principal sectors of co-operation: economic, financial, trade and labour.</P>
    <P>In the economic and financial spheres, co-operation is envisaged particularly in the areas of industry, science and technology with the intention of making a contribution towards Yugoslavia's economic and social development.  The agreement contains a financial protocol under which Yugoslavia will receive a total of 200 million units of account in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank during a period of five years.</P>
    <P>As regards trade, the Community grants levy-free access to its markets for most Yugoslav industrial products, with the exception of certain sensitive products which are subject to tariff ceilings. In the agricultural area, Yugoslavia is granted concessions for products which are of particular importance to it, namely, baby beef in respect of which Yugoslavia enjoys levy-reduced access to the Community for almost 35,000 tonnes per annum, and also tobacco and wines. In the labour sector the aim is to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination towards Yugoslav workers in the Community and Community workers in <Col N="429" /> Yugoslavia.  The trade and financial provisions of the agreement were brought into effect, pending national ratification, by an interim agreement from 1 July 1980.</P>
    <P>The agreement makes provision for the establishment of a co-operation council which will meet periodically at ministerial level and will enable the two parties to find solutions to any problem that might arise.</P>
    <P>In addition to the co-operation agreement, a parallel agreement was reached between Yugoslavia and the European Coal and Steel Community.  This follows the usual form of such agreements and applies to certain products covered by the European Coal and Steel Community.</P>
    <P>I am sure that these agreements between the European Communities and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will strengthen existing links and help to promote economic co-operation while also recognising the special strategic position of Yugoslavia in Europe. I therefore recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I approve strongly of the co-operation between the EEC and Yugoslavia, but there are a few points that I should like the Minister to deal with in his reply.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, Yugoslavia is a rather unique country.  It is classified normally as a communist country but it has refused resolutely during the past 30 years to accept domination.  Indeed, it has shown its independence in this regard by its condemnation of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia and in more recent times in Afghanistan.  I hope Yugoslavia will not be in the situation of having to issue a further condemnation of Soviet domination in the near future, but that is another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large the western world has helped Yugoslavia to maintain its non-aligned position.  This has been by virtue of the trade agreements which have been in existence for some years between that country and the EEC.  These agreements were entered into in the full knowledge of the political situation in Yugoslavia <Col N="430" /> and in the knowledge that country has agreements also with the COMICON and has bilateral agreements with the Socialist bloc of the eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>Because of the sensible approach of the EEC, they have contributed towards the maintenance of Yugoslavia in the unique position in which it is today and which we hope it will be able to continue to maintain in the post-Tito era.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister as to whether he is totally satisfied with the agreement in so far as it effects this country.  I do not have up-to-date figures but it appears to me, on the basis of the figures I have before me, that the huge gains in regard to trade with Yugoslavia have accrued to the EEC heavies rather than to the smaller countries like our own.  For instance, I know from the information I have here in respect of the import and export figures as between Yugoslavia and some of the EEC counttries that the trade balance in favour of Germany, for instance, is running at the rate of about three to one.  These figures go back some years to 1976 and are related to Yugoslav dinars.  They are mentioned in terms of one million dinars. In 1976 the exports from Yugoslavia to the Federal German Republic were 7,257 in terms of one million dinars while the imports, at 20,858, were almost three times that.  I have some figures also in respect of the trade as between Yugoslavia and the UK.  Again, these show a huge imbalance in favour of the UK.  The figures in this instance are expressed in sterling and relate to 1978.  They show that Yugoslav exports to the UK in that year were of the order of £37 million while the imports amounted to £160 million. The point I raise in this context is whether, in so far as there are gains to the EEC countries from such agreements, these gains are being taken advantage of solely by the big countries.  This raises the question of our trade figures with Yugoslavia, and consequently I should like the Minister, if he has the relevant figures, to let us have them when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I raise this point in the overall context of the moaning and groaning that comes <Col N="431" /> from Germany and Britain in respect of their situation in the EEC.  In increasing volume in recent times we have been hearing from the Germans that they will not continue to be the paymasters of Europe, while the British are saying that they are not getting anything from the EEC, that they are contributing too much to the Community while they are paying far too much for their food.  It is a question of the raising of the imperial flag again.</P>
    <P>I make this point to illustrate one further gain that I see accruing to those two countries from their membership of the EEC by reason of the trade agreements which the Community have with Yugoslavia. It is one of the many factors not taken into account in the context of weighing up the advantages to those countries of EEC participation.  In the future we will have to make continual assessments of those advantages and highlight them.  It seems to me there is more and more evidence of what these two countries in particular construe as being the disadvantages of their membership of the EEC.  It is important for small countries such as Ireland to press the case that on this issue, as on so many others, there are many advantages accruing to those countries because of their membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is important that people here know what may be the adverse effects of such an agreement.  The main area of interest will be in the context of agriculture and the agreement relating to the import of baby beef.  I appreciate that any international agreement we enter into will normally have advantages and disadvantages, and I think it important that they be spelled out not only to this House but to the country.  I have raised in particular the question of agriculture.  There is no need in the context of this debate to highlight the problems of Irish agriculture. The Minister has a duty to indicate clearly to the House and the country if this agreement will result in further problems for agriculture or if it will have an effect on markets to which we might normally be exporting.</P>
    <P>I accept that Yugoslavia is a unique <Col N="432" /> country.  It is non-aligned and despite the most frightful pressures during the years it has succeeded in maintaining its independence and non-aligned status.  Certainly such a history imposes an obligation on the free world, and in particular on the EEC, to ensure that it is not forced back under Soviet domination.  We should be as free and fair as possible in our trade relations with that country. This co-operation agreement goes a long way towards achieving that.  From that point of view and subject to the reservations I mentioned I support the motion seeking approval for this co-operation agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support fully the proposed co-operation agreement between the EEC and Yugoslavia. To do so is consistent with the general policy of encouraging the creation of a new economic international order and particularly, as the Minister said in his speech, since this ensures that Yugoslavs who unfortunately cannot get employment in their own country will receive the same kind of treatment as that given to other guest-workers in the Community. It will also ensure that Yugoslavia can get its new industrial products into Community markets without heavy tariffs although I note that the industrial sector of the Community have put in a proviso excepting certain sensitive industrial products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the history of Yugoslavia and the nature of this agreement, it is not very different to an association agreement enjoyed by Turkey.  However, because of the political realities of the situation an association agreement would not be in accordance with the continuing balancing position Yugoslavia must maintain <i>vis-à-vis</i> the East and the West. I recognise the need for that and I approve of the formula that has been arrived at.  In the context of Eastern Europe generally I hope this may serve as a kind of model for the Community's relationships not just with Poland &mdash; a country that unfortunately is in the news very much recently &mdash; but also with countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania which form a natural part <Col N="433" /> of the European hinterland and to which we should be more closely aligned and intergrated in the context of the economic crisis facing the world.</P>
    <P>I accept the difficulty that must have been encountered in negotiating this agreement.  It is a sensitive area and there are interests in the Community that have to be balanced against the economic interests of Yugoslavia.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply would indicate the nature and detail of the co-operation council.  I gather from his speech that it will be at ministerial level.  Will he indicate what kind of participation and involvement Ireland will have?  I cannot find a reference to the time-table for this agreement. Will it be reviewed within five or ten years or is it an open-ended agreement without any review period?  Perhaps the Minister will give us this information in his reply.</P>
    <P>Following the remarks made by Deputy O'Keeffe, I agree there are implications from the Irish point of view.  We have not a large trade with Yugoslavia for obvious geographical and historical reasons.  I think our potential trade with other EEC countries could be damaged in part by this agreement, particularly in the agricultural sector.  There is a market in Greece and Italy for beef and there will also be markets in Spain and Portugal when those countries are full members of the EEC.  Our geographical position does not help us in relation to these markets. Will the Minister indicate how the agreement in relation to baby beef and beef products generally is likely to affect the Irish sector and will he state if any assessments have been made?  Have the Minister and his Department, in conjunction with CTT, made any arrangements for a full trade mission to travel to Yugoslavia in an attempt to reap some benefit from this opening up of what is, undoubtedly, a two-way agreement?  The Minister's speech is very shy on the cost of this agreement to the Community generally, and particularly to this country.  That is not to say that we are against the agreement, not at all, but the whole thrust of the debate in support of the demand for the creation of a new international economic order is based on the clear, explicit <Col N="434" /> statement of mutuality of interests and of benefit.  No quantified Irish benefit is mentioned in the Minister's speech, but perhaps the scale of trade between the two countries is too insignificant to be measurable.</P>
    <P>The Yugoslav economy and certain aspects of its agriculture particularly in Northern Yugoslavia is an efficient, highly productive area.  They will, undoubtedly, be competitors with us in milk and beef products in the Mediterranean, which is a growing market for such products as the economies of these countries improve.  If one can take the previous figures, the levels of consumption of meat in general, and beef in particular, and of milk products is likely to rise, and since we have all along the line since joining the EEC seen the retardation of industrial growth in part in this country, our major asset is agriculture.  I want to see in what way, in assenting to this agreement, the Minister and his Department &mdash; and, indeed, the other specialist Department officials &mdash; have quantified the net cost to Ireland and various sectors of its economy of this agreement and if they can demonstrate why, in fact, Ireland should agree to this specifically.  Perhaps we could be a little more French or a little more British in seeing what exactly is the cost of this agreement as against the benefits.  In general &mdash; and I do not wish my remarks to be misinterpreted, because we support the agreement and are in no way suggesting that it should be modified &mdash; I should like to hear from the Minister in what way this was quantified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the agreement between the Community and Yugoslavia is an important one from the point of view of stability in Europe.  I do not have to elaborate on the important role which Yugoslavia has played.  The manner in which that very large, underdeveloped country has improved since the war pays a great tribute to the genius and tenacity of its people.  It is important that the Community itself make stronger links between the Community and Yugoslavia, for very important strategic and political <Col N="435" /> reasons.  This was the uppermost thought in the Community's mind in making this agreement.</P>
      <P>Even though we had objections and did a lot of hard bargaining in regard to the baby beef aspect, which was eventually fixed at 35,000 tonnes per annum on a levy-reduced basis, at the end of the day we were the only people fighting in this respect.  All the other eight countries agreed and in the context of the overall situation we reluctantly agreed, primarily because, within the Community, one cannot act in isolation at all times.  If there are strong compelling reasons being pushed by eight of the nine, one cannot hold one's position indefinitely.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise in regard to our trade position that we do not do much trade with Yugoslavia but what we do is, in balance, in our favour.  The figures for 1979 were, imports £1.6 million, exports £5.6 million.  For the first part of this year imports are £1.5 million and exports £4.7 million.  As a matter of interest, our exports are, food products £1.9 million, cosmetics £1.1 million, data processing office machinery £1 million.  Our exports exceed our imports by more than 3 to 1 although I grant that the volume is not high.  We are not in any deficit position, <i>vis-á-vis</i> our trading position with Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>As regards the co-operation council, this is at ministerial level.  What happens is &mdash; and Deputy Quinn rightly said that this is in the nature of an association agreement similar to what we have with Cyprus and Turkey &mdash; that <i>vis-á-vis</i> all of these countries there are regular co-operation council meetings at ministerial level.  For instance, we had one meeting the week before last with Cyprus and one with Turkey.  There will be one held in the new year, the first in 1981, with Yugoslavia, in which their Minister will sit down with the Commission and the Community Foreign Ministers at a special meeting to find out how their particular agreement is working out, exchange views, make proposals and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the agreement we have taken a very positive interest in Yugoslavia. The Irish Ambassador to Yugoslavia <Col N="436" /> has already in the past few months led a delegation from the Department of Agriculture and the CBF to look at the possibilities of trade there.  On their return, they were optimistic about commercial development of Irish agricultural exports to Yugoslavia.  This was a direct follow-up to the question of baby beef. As I said, we has agreed reluctantly to that, entering a <i>caveat</i> at the time that we expected a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  The Department of Agriculture and the CBF experts had gone to Yugoslavia with a view to facilitating other agricultural exports as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the baby beef concession which Yugoslavia had received.  That is a positive way forward.  There has been a direct follow-up to our reluctant agreement in allowing baby beef into the Community from Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised, I think, by Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash; and he and I on another occasion had an exchange of views concerning it &mdash; and mentioned, as well, by Deputy Quinn, is the question often raised by Britain and Germany of their contribution towards the financing of the Community, Germany, in particular, making the case that she, in accountancy terms, pays the heaviest contribution towards Community funding.  The disagreement which Britain had some months ago on the extent of her contribution to the Community was debated. As I have said publicly before, the larger countries in the Community are substantial gainers, by reason of membership of the Community, in the unquantifiable area of free market within the Community and the market access gained by the Community to third countries, such as Yugoslavia, throughout the world with whom the Community have agreements. Community have agreements.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the larger, industralised countries are big gainers by reason of the internal European market on one hand, and the agreements reached by the Community, on the other hand. It is a completely wrong argument merely to point to an accountancy figure, saying &ldquo;That is our contribution to the Community.  We are paying far more than other countries in real terms and, therefore, we must <Col N="437" /> restrict Community spending in the desirable social regional areas concerning transfer of resources leading to a convergence of economies&rdquo;.  That argument does not hold water.  The really big gain to the larger countries and, in particular, Germany &mdash; and Britain also, but not to the same extent &mdash; is the existence of the market and the amount of trade generated by reason of the market and the capacity of the larger, developed industralised countries to make use of that market.  The value both the internal markets and the external markets gained by agreement runs far ahead in real value terms of any small accountancy contribution made to the annual budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,390,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in <Col N="438" /> course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for certain domestic expenses; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet increases in the cost of the services rendered by the Office of Public Works.  The gross additional amount required, £7,940,000 is offset partly by an estimated increase in Appropriations-in-Aid, subhead K, and partly by estimated savings on certain other subheads of the vote, leaving a net requirement of £6,390,000.</P>
      <P>I give hereunder, for the information of Deputies, details of the subheads for which the additional sums are required. The excess under subhead B.1. arises from the increased costs of travelling and subsistence.  Expenditure under subhead E covers a large number of building and construction works on hands and at all stages of progress.  The additional money is needed to ensure that the on-going programme, which contributes significantly towards maintaining employment levels in the building industry, is not retarded.  Subheads F. 1., F. 2. and F. 4. relate to the maintenance, furnishing, heating and lighting of State-owned property, and the additional sums now being sought are needed to enable the Office of Public Works to meet increased costs and wages and to discharge their obligations in these matters.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £85,000 is required under subhead F.5. to meet the cost of reconstruction of Waterford Courthouse which is being undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works pursuant to the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935.  The work has proceeded more rapidly than was expected.  The expenditure is recoverable from the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £1,470,000 is sought under <Col N="439" /> subhead G.2. in order to maintain progress on the arterial drainage construction schemes on the rivers Boyne, Maigue and Corrib/Mask/Robe.  Apart from the benefits which accrue to landowners from the execution of these schemes, they provide valuable employment.</P>
    <P>Subhead G. 3. provides for the maintenance of completed drainage schemes and embankment works, and an additional sum of £156,000 is needed to meet the cost of pay increases awarded to drainage workers during the year.  The expenditure under this subhead is recoverable from the county councils concerned.  A net additional sum of £456,000 is needed under subhead H to meet the increasing costs of servicing the large amount of machinery now in use on the expanded arterial drainage programme.</P>
    <P>A sum of £63,000 is needed under subhead I as more extensive maintenance works than provided for were found necessary at Rosslare, Wicklow and Youghal and expenditure on the coast protection scheme in progress at Enniscrone has been greater than expected.  An additional amount of £90,000 is needed under subhead J. 1. to cover the cost of some excavations not provided for in the original estimate and for increased activity on other maintenance works.  Provision is also made for pay increases due under the terms of the second national understanding.</P>

      <P>We are having so many Supplementary Estimates that we would need a budget.  Quite a number of matters are covered by this Supplementary Estimate. Possibly one of the most immediate problems concerns our surroundings.  For instance, the barrier at the entrance to this House has been out of order for the past two or three weeks.  The people in charge of it employed a private contractor in the past to repair it, rather than the Office of Public Works, because the Office of Public Works are too slow. When they contacted the private contractor recently, he would not do the job for the simple reason that he was not paid for the last job.</P>

      <P>I just want to bring that to the notice of the Minister.  We talk about this House in the debate on the annual Estimate if we are given an opportunity, and if the Estimates are not all passed <i>en bloc</i> at the end of the year.  We talk about the accommodation available to Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann. Five Deputies work in the room I work in.  Together with a typist we work in a room 20 feet by 18 feet.  We try to do our writing and make our telephone calls, if the telephone works.  By virtue of the fact that the telephone does not work very often, it takes longer to make calls.  The typewriter is banging away.  If the Office of Public Works cannot provide the necessary accommodation for Deputies and Senators I would suggest that the provision of silent typewriters would eliminate a lot of the banging and make it easier for Deputies to carry out their work.  I made a similar request before but had little success.  In general proper secretarial equipment is totally lacking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably what happened.  I have often drawn attention to the lack of facilities for Members in this House and there is little point in going into detail about them again, but an effort must be made to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with my favourite subject in relation to this Estimate, arterial drainage and maintenance. I was surprised to see that the Minister had not made any provision to deal with a number of drainage problems which I <Col N="441" /> brought to his attention some time ago. There is an increase in the amount allocated for maintenance but, as the Minister mentioned, that is recoverable from local authorities.  He must be aware of the difficulty local authorities face in regard to the amount of money they can spend.  As a member of a local authority I must complain that the Office of Public Works provide money for such maintenance without discussing the matter with the local authorities.  The fact that local authorities must pay for such work means that their resources suffer.</P>
    <P>Last year I was given a commitment that the maintenance work on the Cregg river would be carried out in 1980, but no work has been done on that river to date. I do not know whether it is proposed to carry out the work in 1981, but the Minister should bear in mind the urgency of the matter.  I was under the impression that after arterial drainage works were carried out the maintenance was done on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister of State the problem in relation to the Corrib drainage scheme. That scheme was carried out in three phases &mdash; the third phase is now in progress &mdash; but it has been pointed out to me that the water gets in a little fast adjacent to the Salmon Weir Bridge.  Apparently the sit has built up adjacent to that bridge and has caused flooding.</P>
    <P>The condition of the Cregg river is the same now as it was before the scheme commenced.  The silt must be removed. I do not know whether the Office of Public Works are aware of this problem but the local fishing interests can outline the difficulties in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The work carried out on the Black river at Headford was not done to the satisfaction of the local people.  As a result a number of areas, Belclare, Caherlistrane and Tulrush are flooded annually.  In fact, for most of this year approximately 100 acres of land was covered by water.  It was like a miniature lake.  Some action should be taken to relieve that flooding. In general the maintenance programme is not satisfactory.  I appreciate that 1980 was a difficult year to carry out such work, but local people are not satisfied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> There is little point in throwing bouquets at the Office of Public Works for something they do not do, because work is not being carried out to the satisfaction of local people.</P>
    <P>Annually we hear talk of millions being allocated from Europe for arterial drainage. It is hard to know where to commence when discussing arterial drainage because, firstly, one must question the Government's policy in that regard.  I was under the impression that the Government laid down this policy and that civil servants operated it, but I suggest that the Government do not have a policy and the civil servants go along in their own carefree way doing exactly what they want to do.  There is no direction, not that one could direct them very much one way or the other; they would not be too inclined to take directions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to make a personal attack on them.  It is up to the Government to lay down policies to be implemented by the civil servants. There is a lack of policy as far as arterial drainage is concerned and there is also a lack of political commitment to have work carried out.  In the past arterial drainage was broken into three different <Col N="443" /> categories, major, minor and smaller than that.  There were a number of works done and I presume more of the necessary finance was available then.  Recently there was a £42 million package from the EEC and it was decided to spend £28 million on field drainage and the remainder on arterial drainage.  I do not know how the schemes were selected but they were not altogether to the satisfaction of interests in the county that I represent because we did not get one penny of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say a few words about the Dunkellin. If for every hour spent talking here about the drainage of the Dunkellin a mile or a half mile of the drainage scheme was carried out, it would have been completed a long time ago.  I have a lot of documentation on that river.  I put down a question recently asking the Minister what was the latest situation in this regard.  The Minister's predecessor told me that money was no problem.  Not alone did he tell me that but he told a deputation from Galway which was representative of all political parties that he could not get engineers.  That was a long time ago.  Perhaps the present Minister can tell me if those engineers have been obtained now to prepare a scheme and carry out the work on the Dunkellin.  Has there been any attempt to get them?  If not, why have they not been got?  At the time there were officials from the Department whose sole job was to listen to what was said and to take action.  But no action has been taken.  There is no political will in the Government to carry out this scheme or the general arterial drainage programme.  In 1978 I asked what was the number of people involved in a cost benefit analysis survey and the numbers ranged from one in 1970 to eight in 1978 and I am sure that in 1979 and 1980 there were no more personnel employed on this.  The highest numbers were in 1974 when there were ten and in 1977 when there were ten.  If money became available from the EEC next year we could not avail of it because our schemes are not prepared.  The amount of money being spent on this by the Office of Public Works on an actual basis has been <Col N="444" /> affected by inflation to such a degree that the amount of work being done is less and less.  What is happening?  That is the question we are all asking.  Is the Minister doing anything?  Perhaps there are people in Kerry and elsewhere who are satisfied with the performance of the Government in relation to this and all the other things.</P>

They are trying to get something out of them and this is as a result of some decisions made some time ago by the Department. The Minister is saying that the local authority are responsible but the Government have taken away the means they had of raising a few pounds.  The authority of local authorities is being eroded gradually, indeed almost totally.  As a result the Minister can direct them to do anything he likes but they will be mortgaged if they do a few more of these jobs.  I will be delighted to see the money being spent on Waterford Courthouse.  I wish similar efforts were made throughout the entire country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under heading J 1, National Monuments, an additional sum of £90,000 is required to meet the cost of maintenance and exploration programme. I wonder how that is to be spent.  I have already referred to the lack of support from the Government party for the legislation we tried to introduce in which we were supported by the Labour Party and particularly by Deputy Quinn.  If progress has been made in that direction the Minister might let us know. Is any part of the £90,000 referred to here being spent on the exploration of the Viking site at Wood Quay?  Rather than get into further complications with the Chair I will refer the Minister to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 3 December 1980.  It would be an education for both himself and the OPW not alone to read it but to try to digest it.  They should take it upon themselves to ensure that ten artefacts being excavated there, the wall referred to in the article in question, the Wood Quay site generally and many other such sites throughout the country, about 1,800 of them, that in reply to a parliamentary question we were told had been destroyed, will even at this late stage be preserved.  If they are lost they will not be found again.  Possibly the Minister will take some action in that direction in the long-promised legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he will indicate when this will be.  I presume that under wages I can refer to the regional offices of the OPW since a certain amount of this increase in wages will go to these offices.  I am not happy about the efficiency of these offices, particularly the limited number that I am familiar with personally.  I urge the Minister to have an investigation carried out into the OPW regional offices that deal with the school building programme with a view to trying to update them and particularly their efficiency.  The Board of Works are responsible for carrying out work on primary <Col N="450" /> schools.  I am not satisfied with the lack of progress made by this Office in that direction.  In many instances, the files that are referred to local offices lie idle for a long time.  No effort is made by anybody to ensure that the work is done effectively.  That is something that needs investigation.  The Minister should do something about it.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of this Office to carry out work on Garda stations.  The Minister may say that this is a matter for the Department of Justice but generally the contract comes to this Office.  I am sure the Minister is aware that gardaí at the Oughterard Garda Station walked out of the building they were in for the sole reason that the condition of the building was such that they had to take this drastic action.  The Minister should look into this and have something done about it.</P>
      <P>There are so many offices that deal with these problems that the problems are referred from one office to another. It might be a good thing to have a building unit set up in the Department of Justice to deal with Garda stations and as far as national schools are concerned to have works carried out by the Office of Public Works transferred to the building unit of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Under G.3 &mdash; arterial drainage and maintenance &mdash; an additional sum of £156,000 is required for increased costs and wages.  Are there any plans or have any efforts been made towards drainage of the River Shannon?  In the wages mentioned, can I assume that the Minister has people engaged in carrying out a survey of that river?  Many of its tributaries cause problems to many farmers and these could be alleviated.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply would give some indication of what progress, or as usual lack of it, was made since we last dealt with an estimate or supplementary estimate regarding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might take note of what I have said and give priority to the River Corandulla because of the promise made that it would be done last year.  It was not done last year but I am sure that if the silt was removed from the main Corrib River upstream from the salmon weir at <Col N="451" /> Galway for a few miles it would alleviate the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to your administration of rules, Sir, for which you are not responsible and did not draw up, in relation to an estimates speech and I wish to comply with them as far as possible.</P>
      <P>This is a Supplementary Estimate in addition to the primary Estimate brought in at the beginning of the year.  The Minister of State is asking the House to vote extra money without reference in any way to how it will be raised in order to meet additional costs that have arisen in the time since the original estimate was drawn up and this supplementary one was brought in.  The Minister has given no justification as to why the extra money should be paid for by the House in advance of us seeing in what way the money will be raised.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his speech, described the details of the £6 million that he requires but did not say how it was that they got it wrong at the beginning of the year or what occurred that necessitated this amount.  When the Government party published their manifesto in 1977 we argued that it was a political lie to promise so much for so little.  When this comprehensive budget was introduced last year, my colleague, Deputy O'Leary, Labour party spokesperson for Finance, said that an autumn budget would be necessary because the estimates were a financial lie relative to what it was proposed to raise and spend.  The truth of that charge, I make it quite seriously, is that the budget from the new, exiting Minister for Finance and his Minister of State was a financial lie last February and this is the proof of it.  To seriously suggest that expenditure for OPW could be met for the year 1980 by a net increase of 3 per cent would not have fooled the porter in the Minister's office let alone a junior executive officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original estimate proposed to increase the sum from £44 million to £45 million.  We now have the real estimate for which no tax has been levied.  It is, if my figures are right, approximately 13.9 <Col N="452" /> per cent of an increase less the rate of inflation.  No matter what way one juggles the figures there is a net reduction in terms of output of the services of the Department this year.  There is no way the Minister can explain to the House &mdash; although God knows this Government would defy Einstein with their ability to juggle figures &mdash; and say that inflation is less than 13.9 per cent.  The net effect of this Supplementary Estimate, the real budget, is to increase the overall budget by 13.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>It would be reasonable and acceptable to the House if the Minister of State could say that in the intervening period when this budget was first cast a number of extraordinary price increases took place which he, as Minister for State responsible for his Department in casting this budget could not possibly anticipate and it is because of that that he is now looking for supplementary moneys.  If one analyses the £6 million which the Minister is looking for, there are two items in it which amount to a 9.2 per cent increase on last year.  They are capital items.  The first is Subhead E. &mdash; New Works Alterations and Additions &mdash; and the second is Subhead G.2.  If one adds those two together and expresses them as a percentage of last year's budget, they represent an increase of 9.2 per cent.  Is the Minister seriously telling the House that some time between now and February the Office of Public Works, which are not renowned for the alacrity with which they move, will move so fast and so quickly that two major capital programmes are discovered which cost basically £4 million?</P>
    <P>We know from the workings of the Office of Public Works and their dependence on information from other Government Departments, local authorities and from the general difficulties &mdash; I recognise that there are difficulties attached to a large, traditional organisation trying to move through various Departments &mdash; that there is no way that any Department, particularly the Office of Public Works, could move that quickly.  It is not sufficient for a Minister of State, seeking to raise an additional £6 million without reference as to how it is going to be provided <Col N="453" /> or how it is going to be obtained in terms of taxation, to simply, in a two-page script describe in detail how the £6 million is made up.  A responsible Minister of State, who is in charge of his Department and who understands what is going on, would give reasons as to why the extra money was required.  We have got no such reasons.  If the Minister is to make any recognition of his democratic responsibilities to this institution, which was not brought about easily by our forefathers, he has a democratic obligation to justify why the £6 million is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am concentrating on the extra capital items which emerged between last January and now.  I am discounting all the other items in the other heads, which can be attributed to increased costs, wages and things which, by and large, the Minister could not reasonably anticipate and over which he has no control.  A more prudent and honest Minister would have admitted that inflation could not be only 3 per cent in 1980 and should have anticipated that costs in the Office of Public Works would go up by 10 to 13 per cent. Even taking a Deputy Martin O'Donoghue view, even if they had taken the manifesto view and assumed what the rate of inflation would be as prophesied it would have been higher than the 3 per cent that was estimated for the coming year.  It is for that reason I say the Minister is attempting to put to the House a financial lie, which is what this supplementary budget is.</P>
    <P>Democracy here is not all that healthy. The public attitude of many of our young people to activities in which we are involved is not so positive that we can encourage and tolerate this kind of duplicity.  How can one make a prophesy about the economy in 1977 that inflation is going to be down to 7 per cent in the current year and, at the same time, introduce an estimate at the beginning of the year which shows a net increase of a certain amount and suddenly discover, in the middle of it, that there are two major capital programmes which, if one were to finance and anticipate them, would amount to an increase in the region of 9.2 per cent.  That is a serious charge which I am making on the basis of the information <Col N="454" /> which has been provided to the House by the Minister.  I should like to be proved wrong.  One does not make such a serious charge lightly.</P>
    <P>It is for the Minister to detail why, in subhead G.2 and certainly why in subhead E, new works came about so quickly.  There is no evidence to suggest that the Board of Works in the past responded or moved quickly.  If it has responded and moved that quickly, and if that money has been spent, I would like to know if the normal procedures in relation to tendering, scrutiny and open competition that must govern the administration of public moneys, have been properly adhered to.  If the Office of Public Works have managed to spend that money so quickly, to such an extent that the Government are surprised, then they have moved much faster than normally. The House should know if it has been done properly and in full accordance with the procedures relating to public tendering.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make any political comment.  As far as I am concerned, the Minister of State has one political task to do, to hold on to two seats in North Kerry.  Regrettably, he has not responded to the kind of things that Deputy Donnellan was asking.  He is introducing a supplementary budget in the House which, I repeat, is a financial lie, because we forecast back in February that it would not meet the costs required, that the taxation proposed by the Minister for Finance to cover the cost would not be adequate and this is the living proof.  If this House were to take half a dozen Supplementary Estimates that we are having now and put them into a supplementary budget, there would be a howl of protest at the idea that the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the whole nonsense, is being promoted to Brussels in gratitude for activities last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first time that the present Minister of State has introduced a Supplementary Estimate.  I congratulate him.  We expect big things from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great shortage of money, <Col N="455" /> there is no use in codding ourselves otherwise. Deputy Donnellan and I come from an area in the west where we need the Board of Works in a big way.  We are hoping there will be a large inflow of money into this particular Department from the western drainage scheme.  Arterial drainage is the most important thing as far as we are concerned in the west. Deputy Donnellan referred to the Suck and the Shannon.  As a member of the Suck drainage board, it is terrible that an old Act can control these rivers.  If a river is blocked further on than one can go under the Act, maintenance cannot be carried out.  I would like to see that Act changed because if it would be more beneficial to go down a few more yards, it should be possible to do so.  We are handicapped in regard to the maintenance of the river Suck which is causing a lot of trouble all around my area.  I would not like to be too optimistic about anything being done to the Shannon.  If there is anything in the pipeline we will be told about it.  The maintenance of the river Suck should not be confined to point A or point B.  Roscommon County Council and Galway County Council pay for maintenance but they cannot do the work where it is most needed because they cannot pass point A or B.</P>
    <P>To go back to what Deputy Donnellan said about a river in my county, I suggest that it would be ridiculous for Deputy Donnellan to say that our party are not in favour of doing anything about the Dunkellin river or arterial drainage because no Government for the past 20 years cared two hoots about that river.  I have been active in this matter since I was a member of Macra na Feirme, when we did a survey of the river and sent up the figures to Dublin.  They were very nearly the same as the Department's figures.  At that time this river was supposed to be getting serious consideration.  Deputy Donnellan's Government were in power for four years and did absolutely nothing about this river.  Our own party did nothing either.  Nobody can make political capital out of the Dunkellin river, which rises almost beside my home.  I drive along <Col N="456" /> that road every week to Galway and it looks like a sea.  We cannot do a local improvement scheme because the levels are wrong and we cannot benefit from the Western Drainage Scheme because in order to do field drainage there must be an outlet and the major river must be done first.  That is the position of the people in the Dunkellin basin, the most disadvantaged area in the West.  It is not even in the disadvantaged areas, although it goes along right from my place into the sea at Clarenbridge, Galway.</P>
    <P>They have been talking about cost-benefit, but I would ask the Minister to do the costing and forget about the benefit, which is there for anybody to see. There is no need to do a benefit survey, because anybody with commonsense knowing anything about land and its use would realise that the benefits are there and that you cannot drain or manure land if you do not open the river.  I hope the present Minister in charge of the Board of Works will be able to say that in his time something was done to prepare this river and make it eligible for any money that would come from the EEC in future.  The five years' money for western areas has all been spent and spent well, I believe, although personally I have some reservations about how it was divided.  Some £28 million went for field drainage and £14 million for arterial drainage.  I understand all that money has been taken up, but I think we should spend more on arterial drainage, because you cannot do field drainage if the major drains are not cleared.  More money should go to the Board of Works to prepare the larger rivers so that field drainage could proceed.</P>
    <P>I do not speak just to mention the Dunkellin river, because I am sick of all that has been said about it with nothing being done.</P>

The subject has been a hot potato there for years and nothing was done about it by any Government.  Deputy Donnellan laid all the blame on the present Government, while I maintain that no Government did anything about it.  I am asking the present Minister if he would do something. I am sorry if the Chair accuses me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We want something done about it and we expect action from the present Minister and I am hopeful that he will be able to provide it.</P>
      <P>I shall not go as far as the Oughterard barracks, which is a bit outside my territory, but I hope that much more EEC money will be given to arterial drainage. With reference to Deputy Donnellan's comments in this regard, I work in a room here with five people and only one outside phone, but I would continue to work in it if the money saved in that way would drain the Dunkellin river or help to do so even though I do not like the conditions in which we work.</P>
      <P>As regards national monuments in my county, I should like to congratulate the Board of Works on a very good job done in Portumna.  I would like to see Portumna Abbey included, and I see no reference to it here.  I also understand that the old Franciscan Abbey at Kilconnell where I live is on the list &mdash; and I would like to know if this is true with a view to having an approach road made to it.  There is only a bad road there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were to go into everything the Board of Works do one could be here <Col N="458" /> all evening, but there is a good deal of duplication regarding the building of schools, barracks and so on between different Departments.  The Department of Education sanction the schools, then hand over to the Board of Works.  A number of schools have been built.  For instance, the one at Gurteen was badly needed and is being built at present.  Generally, the Board of Works are doing a reasonably good job particularly as regards schools, and a new barracks is being built at Menlough.  They are pretty active in our county but if they were as active as regards drainage we would be more than congratulatory.  They keep any monuments in their care in reasonably good condition.</P>
    <P>I do not want to continue because anything further I might say might involve me being pulled up by the Chair. I believe the Chair is right.  Subheads are mentioned here very definitely.  As regards Deputy Quinn's complaint against the Minister for Finance, inflation is now growing at such a rate that it is very hard for a Minister at the beginning of the year to say what money he needs for any Department.  Unless we can do something about inflation that situation will continue.  It is not fair to accuse the Minister of coming in with a false estimate at budget time.  Supplementary Estimates have been coming in here every year by agreement.  It is obvious that nobody in business can budget accurately, especially in times of inflation.  If that was the case we would never have problems.  The Board of Works have done a reasonably good job in maintaining the national monuments, schools and so on.  Some of their work programmes have to be sanctioned by other Departments, and that causes some delays.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look for a substantial amount of money particularly in relation to the western drainage package so that when we get more money from the EEC we will be in a position to go ahead with arterial drainage works on the high priority rivers, especially on the Dunkellin river in County Galway which is the worst river in the county.  If the Minister does that, both Deputy Donnellan <Col N="459" /> and I will agree that the Minister has done a reasonably good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister and his officials who have to come in here looking for over £6 million.  If the truth were known, when the Estimate was originally submitted the Department of Finance at this famous meeting in Barrettstown Castle last January did a certain amount of pruning.  That is probably the main reason for such a large shortfall.</P>
      <P>Subhead E refers to the large number of buildings and construction works on hands at all stages of progress.  Why is subhead E so bald?  It does not spell out what is actually going on.  Are the Cabinet squatting in Barrettstown Castle at the moment?  When I was in the Office of Public Works trustees were appointed <i>pro tem</i> until legislation was introduced for the State to legally acquire Barrettstown Castle.  Did the Cabinet squat there last January and will they squat there again next Friday?  Have they permission from the trustees to have this meeting in Barrettstown Castle?  When the late owner handed this over to the State it was intended to bring in legislation for the State to acquire it.  This legislation has not yet come in.  It is a disgrace that this situation has been allowed to exist. The Cabinet have no legal right to be there until this castle is legally acquired by the State.  The Cabinet are squatting and are encouraging squatting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is limited, but under subhead E do the works include a new decentralisation policy for the Department of Justice recently announced by the Minister for Labour, and if so is there provision in the Estimate to build new offices in Killarney?  Is there any truth in the rumour that the Minister of State is doing his best to ensure that various offices will be decentralised to Tralee instead of to Killarney?  It will be most illuminating if the Minister will tell us whether any money was allotted for office development in Killarney.  Under this subhead we can speculate as to where offices and so on are to be located and whether work is at planning stage or is in progress.  The <Col N="460" /> Minister should give a solemn undertaking to this House that he will not direct the Office of Public Works not to provide land in Killarney, because we have acres of land in Killarney for such decentralisation.</P>
    <P>In relation to actual works in progress the situation in Leinster House is ridiculous. It is ludicrous that the bar, having been burned two years, is now only being replaced by a temporary one.  We were given an undertaking by the Minister for Finance that he would provide dining facilities for people who work here whether they be the press, the civil servants, the Members of the House or anyone associated with it.  It does not impress anybody to see a flurry of workmen around the House today when this Estimate is being discussed, to show that something is happening.</P>

      <P>Regarding national monuments, I appeal for more goodwill on the part of the Department towards landowners in return for their preservation of these monuments.  There is no reason why the Office of Public Works or any agency under their aegis should object to development taking place on such land. I have in mind a particular case where a man who was good enough to provide a road to the national monuments on his land decided to seek planning permission for the erection of two houses for his sons a few hundred yards away.  Some agency directly under the OPW objected to the planning permission.  I warn the Minister that such actions will not enable the continuation of the co-operation and goodwill of the landowners.  Common sense must prevail and if the local authority see no objection to a development I do not see why any outside body should be able to prevent it.  If the Minister has any influence with these agencies he should give them a short, snappy lecture on this subject.</P>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for many offices throughout the country.  I would appeal to him to get a fire officer's report on every office used by the OPW.  Any shortcomings in premises rented or owned by OPW should be rectified.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any proposals for the dredging of Dingle harbour?  I am sure he is aware of the difficulties there because, although I might disagree with his policies, he is certainly in touch with the grassroots.  He must be aware of the grave damage being done to 60-foot trawlers when trying to land at Dingle pier.  These boats are constantly in need of repair. Possibly the Minister will be told by his officials that the necessary work is the statutory function of Kerry County Council.</P>

This is where the matter becames relevant. The situation cannot last much longer as far as these trawlers are concerned. I appeal to the Minister to use his power, limited as it is by lack of cash, to make sure that something is done to relieve the anguish and distress of Dingle fishermen.</P>
      <P>Subhead E deals with building and construction works in hands and at all stages of progress and almost £3 million is being sought.  Is there any provision in this sum for work to prevent coast erosion at Magharees?  The Minister pushed this matter very hard before taking up his present office.  In reply to a parliamentary question he told me he was waiting for an order to be made and laid the blame on Kerry County Council, although they had nothing to do with it.  The order had to be made by the Department of Transport and it was months before they decided to move.  I hope there is some allocation for the unfortunate people in Magharees.</P>

We never know when a south-west gale will blow and these people will be cut off from the mainland, unable to move either up or down unless they travel on the back of a donkey.

      <P>I will not delay the House much longer because I see Deputy Tully is rearing to go.  I appeal to the Minister to take the Cabinet out of the embarrassing position they are in, to stop them squatting for the second time in Barrettstown Castle.  A solemn undertaking was given that legislation would be introduced so that Barrettstown Castle could be taken over by the State.  This has not been done.  The trustees of the castle are not being asked if they use it; the Cabinet are just walking in.  I hope that when the Cabinet go to Barrettstown Castle tomorrow they will tell the Office of Public Works to legalise the present situation.  I cannot condone squatting, and for the Cabinet to squat in Barrettstown Castle is ridiculous in the extreme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed the large number of Supplementary Estimates which have been coming before this House.  The budget early in the year estimated a certain expenditure but that seems to have <Col N="464" /> gone completely screwy.  Since the House will give the money asked for in these Supplementary Estimates I would like to know how some of this money is being spent.  There is a reference here to a saving and the Minister's brief should have contained details of where that saving will occur.  Perhaps in his reply he might let us have that information.  Some time ago I raised a few points, and I would like some information about them. The Minister gave his solemn promise about one or two of them, but it does not appear as if this promise was carried out. I am not blaming him, but I am bringing this to his notice again because he or his senior officials may not be aware of the fact that there seems to be a peculiar arrangement that the Office of Public Works have certain people to carry out certain works, either on a contract basis or otherwise, or they are supposed to carry them out, and some of them are not doing the jobs they are paid for.  There will have to be a tightening up here.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Drogheda Garda station.  Has any progress been made to provide a new or alternative Garda station there?  Is the Minister aware that since he gave me a guarantee over six months ago that certain work would be carried out, not alone has nothing been done, but work which had been started has not been completed and the station is a disgrace?  It is not reasonable that the large number of gardaí in that station should be asked to stay there very much longer.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that the toilet accommodation there &mdash; for ban-ghardaí and gardaí &mdash; is very primitive.  One would expect to see similar facilities in countries where sewerage facilities have not been introduced.  The windows have not been cleaned for years, although I understand somebody is paid to do that. No painting has been done, floor covering has not been repaired, fireplaces have fallen out and faulty wiring has fallen from the walls.  Because of the importance of that station and the fact that it is on the route to the north and so many people go in and out of it, it is wrong that we should allow this situation to continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> I deplore the fact that despite the Minister's guarantee not one darn thing has been done.  Not a punt has been spent on it since I raised it in this House.  The Minister will agree that it is deplorable that his word, given in this House, has been broken.  Nobody seems to be bothered about getting the work done.  I ask the Minister not just to say that he will have it attended to and something will be done, but I want him to arrange with his officials that the situation will be looked into and find out who did not do what he was told, or if anybody was told.  Would one official from the Office of Public Works go to Drogheda and look at the station?  If he does, he will see old dirty mattresses and blankets, holes in the floors for toilets and pieces of old, useless and damaged mattresses and furniture thrown into the so-called offices, which are in the cellars.  The Minister or his officials may not be aware of the situation, but as of now I blame him and them if the situation is not attended to.  As I said, I got a guarantee this would be attended to but nothing has been done. Let somebody look at it now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in Drogheda because I live within two or three miles of it.  A number of Garda stations in County Meath require attention.  In particular, let me refer to a station in a village called Kilmessan where the living accommodation was to be attended to earlier this year.  As far as I know the necessary contracts were laid but nothing has been done.  It is not good enough that the Minister should be embarrassed when he comes into this House by Deputies telling him that these situations exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live near Laytown-Bettystown where we have a proposal to have a new Garda station erected.  The land has been acquired but no move has been made to have the station erected in this very fast-growing area.  It is not enough for somebody to say that land has been acquired and that the station will be built sometime. The Minister should not take that <Col N="466" /> from anybody, but he is the only person who can do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The same type of situation arises with regard to courthouses.  I do not know if the Minister has been in the courthouses of County Meath and County Louth, which I know fairly well.  Some of them are in a deplorable condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot continue in this manner.  The Office of Public Works is responsible for Garda stations, for the actual buildings; that is fair enough.  Courthouses are the responsibility of local authorities so the Deputy is in order dealing with Garda station buildings under this subhead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come back to the <Col N="467" /> Garda stations.  The cleaning of windows in Garda stations has been carried out by people who were paid by the Office of Public Works.  Perhaps that is wrong, it should not have been done, but that has been the score to date.  If the Minister tells me they are not entitled to do that, that that is not the way it should be done, then I will take the matter up with the Department of Justice.  I want to know also in cases where the windows are in a bad state of repair is that the responsibility of the Office of Public Works or of the Department of Justice?  Or, if the floor is rotten, if the general accommodation, stairs and everything else is in bad condition, if the electrical wiring is in bad condition or obsolete are all of these matters for the Office of Public Works or for the Department of Justice?  Perhaps the Minister will let me know when he is replying because, if necessary, I can then take my case elsewhere.  I am not trying to embarrass the Minister.  I am going only on the reply he gave me in this House over six months ago.</P>
      <P>Surely the repairs which were to have been carried out to the living acommodation in Kilmessan Garda station are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  Those repairs were to have been carried out early this year but still have not been done.  They cannot be passed on to the Department of Justice.  The erection of the Garda station in Laytown is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works also.  I shall expect the Minister to make some comment on these points in replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to deal with arterial drainage, particularly the Boyne drainage. As the Minister knows, the Boyne runs right through County Meath, some of its tributaries running into County Cavan.  Indeed a portion of the Boyne itself runs into County Kildare.  The catchment area is very large.  There are four questions I want to raise in this respect.  First of all, when any arterial drainage scheme is being planned the onus is on the Office of Public Works to ensure that when they peg or drain a river and say that is included in the catchment there should be no way in which they can <Col N="468" /> at a later stage say it is not included in the catchment, the job will not include that.  This happens with fairly monotonous regularity and gives rise to the suggestion that perhaps somebody with a little more pull wants something else done.  I have no proof that this is so, but this tends to be the general practice when someone has a drain pegged and finds that the work is not carried out but rather that some other area which he says has not been pegged has been done instead.</P>
    <P>My second question has to do with water supplies.  I am sick and tired of listening to complaints from people who, when the Office of Public Works undertake a job, have their water supplies cut off, supplies which cost those people very large sums of money.  The most recent was one I raised in this House, that at Kilmainham, Kells.  As a result of the Blackwater drainage a whole area was left without water, a water scheme which had been in operation for quite some time disappeared overnight.  We all agree that the Office of Public Works are doing a great job in regard to arterial drainage.  I remember as a small boy the area of Kilmainham being under water for three or four months every year.  I assume that will not be the case now, but that is no answer to people who have lost their valuable water supply.  The Minister said he would give full co-operation to the group water scheme in the area and indeed to individuals who had to instal their own water supply because they were not included in the scheme.  As a matter of fact I almost thought that the Minister himself was going to go straight down and commence working on the scheme so anxious was he to see it done.  I met the scheme representative a few days ago, when I was told that that was not so, that the Minister had not yet appeared with his shovel nor had anybody else appeared to give any assistance in the implementation of the scheme.  When somebody has been accustomed to having a water supply for a considerable period &mdash; particularly if they happen to have a solid fuel system of water heating &mdash; they cannot then light a fire, there being then no water in the boiler and they must endeavour to heat the house by some other <Col N="469" /> means.  The Minister cannot evade responsibility for ensuring that these people's water supply is maintained.  Perhaps he would request the Office of Public Works, when planning future arterial drainage schemes, to carry out a survey of the area, as they map it, to ensure the least possible disruption of water schemes in the area.  Indeed he might also arrange that, where possible, such schemes would be augmented in such a way that the people concerned will not be left without water for the best part of a year, as appears to be the case in the Kilmainham area, or even longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair takes it that this arises out of the Boyne Drainage Scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair takes it correctly. Otherwise I would not have raised the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has caused a great deal of annoyance is a practice which employees of the Office of Public Works have engaged in for some time, what is referred to by local people as despoliating areas, by cutting trees.  I cannot understand why mature trees should be cut in this manner when a drainage scheme is being carried out, because these trees formed part of many a beauty spot.  It would appear in many cases that they are needlessly cut down merely because leaving them would necessitate going 100 yards further up or down the river with the spoil being taken out of the river.  This is causing a lot of annoyance. Now, with so much talk about the environment, surely an arrangement could be made to prevent this happening.  What is even worse, the owners of these trees are ignored completely, they are not even told until they notice the trees suddenly being lopped.  This is gross discourtesy and should not take place.  I am not saying that the Office of Public Works are not doing a good job.  They have done a tremendous amount of very valuable work.  The best spent money in this country is that on arterial drainage because it reclaims so much land.  But, having said that, there is a right and wrong way of <Col N="470" /> doing a job.  I believe in many cases it is done the wrong way for want of thought.</P>
    <P>Another source of annoyance is the question of spoil on land.  I do not know whether there is a particular reason for this.  Again and again I get complaints from small farmers who maintain that, for some extraordinary reason, there is more spoil put on their land than on that of very much larger landowners.  I believe this is accidental.  But there is no way in which it is possible to convince a man who has had an acre of his 20 acres despoiled that his 200 acre farmer neighbour has not been able to work some kind of influence to prevent the spoil being put on his land.  When such damage is done the Office of Public Works should make arrangements for compensation, whatever can be agreed, as speedily as possible. I know that such compensation is paid, but the time lag between that damage being done and the payment of compensation is very much longer than it should be.  I am asking the Department to ensure that this period will be shortened.</P>
    <P>Another pressing concern is St. Mary's Bridge in Drogheda.  It is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  In my time in the Department of Local Government I was able to make arrangements for the building of a bridge, which was a very fine job&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It should have been done many years before.  St. Mary's Bridge should have been rebuilt many years ago but there were problems because it must fit in with new roads and schools and it must also be capable of taking the flood volume of Boyne water.  I will illustrate how important the job of rebuilding it is when I say that when demolition was begun the whole darn lot fell into the river and it was lucky several people were not injured or killed.  The estimated time for rebuilding is two years.  At the moment a Bailey bridge is serving to accommodate pedestrians but everybody else must use the bridge leading on to the Belfast road.  On average, people going to work in the mornings are delayed at <Col N="471" /> least half an hour for traffic clearance &mdash; and goodness knows jobs are so scarce at the moment that people are anxious to get to work on time.  There have been many complaints each day about minor accidents.  In the evenings, and at midday, the traffic congestion becomes worse.  I am asking the Minister to try to have the rebuilding schedule speeded up. At the moment it is thought the new bridge will not be completed before late 1982 or perhaps 1983.  That is far too long.</P>
      <P>There are two other matters I wish to refer to.  On the part of the east coast that I am concerned with we do not suffer too much from erosion.  We went to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Wyse, and a considerable sum of money was allocated to remedy coast erosion damage, including the saving of a number of houses from being washed away.  However, there are many minor works which need attention and which at this time would cost very little but which in a couple of years, when there is another Government in power, could become very expensive.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the accommodation position in Leinster House.  I do not argue that work is not being done &mdash; we see it being done from day to day. However, the accommodation here is terribly limited.  As far as my party are concerned we have less accommodation than we had in 1954.  I do not know why that should be because in the meantime there have been big additions, but individually we seem to have less room.  The Minister will have to do something to arrange more accommodation.  All parliament buildings throughout the world, to my knowledge, have been extending accommodation, particularly for elected members, and it is galling for elected Members of this House to find such lack of accommodation.</P>
      <P>Members of the Labour Party here find themselves six or seven to a relatively small room while officers in adjacent rooms have individual accommodation. I do not wish to be taken as saying that officers of the House are not efficient but I say that the Office of Public Works have lost their priorities completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> The Minister must look at the whole situation and arrange that those of us who want to work here will have accommodation that will enable us to deal with the matters that come before us.  At the moment that is not possible: how can it be possible to carry on a pressing telephone conversation while somebody is typing a few feet away?  The Minister must attend to this as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>At the same time I should like to comment on the accommodation for the junior staff in Leinster House.  The present position is not what one would expect in a House of Parliament and it does not bear comparison with the situation outside in the city.  Indeed I would go so far as to say that the accommodation here does not comply with legal requirements. The Minister in charge of the Office of Public Works is the man responsible and I ask him to rearrange the priorities in this respect and not to continue to have the matter left in the hands of civil servants.</P>
    <P>I am not complaining about the way the Office of Public Works are doing their job &mdash; it is easy enough to criticise a Department or a section of a Department &mdash; but if Governments come and go the business of a Department will continue and it is essential that proper accommodation be provided in the seat of Parliament. In other words, I am asking that the necessary money be provided, at the same time not advocating vast allocations of money.  When the Minister is replying I hope he will have some information for us in this respect and if he has not, that he will let us have written information in a reasonable time.  I have made the representations and it is now a matter of record, which can be checked.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate covers one of the most wide-ranging sections of any Department in the State.  It is not an office that gets enough of the headlines, although it affects the livelihoods of many people.  I want to refer particularly to arterial drainage, one of the most important matters to be discussed here.  In the context of this Supplementary Estimate and its <Col N="473" /> reference to arterial drainage we are only talking about buttons.</P>
      <P>Borrowing has gone out of bounds but money will have to be found quickly for arterial drainage.  In my area recently we had massive flooding of three of our towns.  The Minister has agreed to meet a deputation this evening but people from that area find that the River Blackwater is only No. 22 on the list to be drained.  I appeal to him to give priority to the Blackwater because of the damage caused to property by flooding.</P>

It should get priority because of what has happened quite recently.  It goes into the Minister's constituency. Great damage was caused to stock and property by the flooding.  I appeal to the Minister to give special consideration to this even if it means <Col N="474" /> bringing in a further Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>The money spent in the Youghal area on coast protection is money well spent. It has proved very satisfactory to use large quarry stones.  I would like to see an extension of this to protect all the beaches in the Red Barn-Youghal area. Work will have to be continued for several miles along that beach but it is money well spent.  The coast protection of Ballycotton has got widespread publicity in the media but so far nothing has been done.  The public roadway is now in danger. I hope that this will be covered in the extra money provided for coastal protection. People might say that this is not the time of the year to carry out this work but as the need is so great I believe the Minister should get to work quickly on coast protection.  I compliment the Minister on what has already been done in this area.  I believe that it was because of the ingenuity of local engineers that large stones were used on the beaches in this area.  It is providing very good protection.</P>
      <P>We should think again about our Garda stations, now that there is so much violence and the danger to people living in remote areas.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that when they are contemplating closing a station in a small area because of its condition it is more important to see that the station will be put in good order and made habitable for the people who occupy it 24 hours a day. Rural stations can do a lot in restoring law and order because the gardaí know the local people.  Very little crime occurs in such areas.  There is no point in trying to serve all of East-Cork from one station.</P>
      <P>A lot of work is going on in the Office of Public Works in relation to schools and extensions to them.  However, there seems to be unusual lethargy in the Department about Upper Aghada School where there are a lot of what I would descibe as hen houses and prefabs waiting for a decent extension.  I hope the Minister will get on with that job as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if national monuments were dealt with properly it would be one of the most important areas in the <Col N="475" /> Department.  All we have done in those places is to put up signs to say that there is a castle or some other building there. When one proceeds further in most of those cases one finds that there is a dangerous building there.  Children play around those dangerous buildings.  I believe that the Council of Europe are getting very interested in our archaeological treasures.  We have set up a committee to protect and look after our heritage in this respect, but this will mean spending money.  In the case of Barry's Castle near Carrigtwohill, the old cathedral in Cloyne and round towers, a lot of money must be spent.  In the case of Cloyne Cathedral we are talking about helping out the Church of Ireland who will not be able to maintain that massive cathedral without help from the Office of Public Works.  What would the Americans give for a round tower or a Cloyne Cathedral? They can only go back as far as the Alamo and Davy Crockett.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that in Dublin an effort is being made to retain our Georgian buildings and where possible to restore them.  It is not generally known that in Athens and other places in Greece the restoration work is as a result of a lot of money being spent.  Perhaps it is fortunate that they got other countries to come in to help them.  Unfortunately we will have to do the work ourselves.  It is an economic proposition in relation to the interest tourists have in those buildings. I am ashamed to admit that I did not even know of the existence of an old ruin which some tourists asked me to show to them.  They discovered this in some old document.  We had difficulty in locating it.  We had to wade through all sorts of things to get to it.  It was in very bad condition.  Money should be found for this work.  In estimates of millions nowadays, £1,000 would go a long way towards making those buildings safe.  We are not talking about removing them or anything of that nature.  We are asking only that they be made safe, that there be reasonable access to them and that any relevant literature be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the purchase of <Col N="476" /> equipment for arterial drainage.  This is a matter that I have raised here before. I am convinced that the most efficient way of dealing with arterial drainage is to use the contractors.  In the Munster area generally there are contractors who have massive equipment which is lying idle. These people would be only too willing to carry out the very essential work that is necessary if the Department would give the go-ahead.  Because of the availability of so much equipment, there is no need to spend money on buying new equipment. The reason for the existing equipment being idle is that agriculture is in the doldrums.  Contractors would be prepared to submit very keen quotations and they would do a first-class job.</P>
    <P>Regarding courthouses, town halls and such buildings, much good work has been done but the condition of some of the buildings leaves much to be desired.  All too often we hear of district justices adjourning courts because of lack of heating and bad conditions generally in the buildings.  Such a situation should not arise in this day and age.  The job of a district justice is tough enough without his having to sit through an all-day session in the chilling atmosphere of a courthouse. Perhaps the situation is reflected in some of the severe sentences that are imposed towards evening.  A district justice would have difficulty in maintaining his equilibrium in an atmosphere that is unpleasant and cold.</P>

We are not in the position of doing the job that we are commissioned to do, that is, to issue county council loans to deserving people. I had a very sad case this morning of a group of people to whom we were even unable to send letters.  In these circumstances there is no point in talking to us about building courthouses.

      <P>I make no apology for talking about the importance of arterial drainage.  Throughout the country farm modernisation schemes are being held up because of failure to drain the various rivers.  This situation has several effects. As well as the farmers being denied substantial grants, large areas of land remain incapable of being used.  These are lands that could be made fertile as a result of drainage.</P>
      <P>So far as the Blackwater is concerned, we are Number 22 on the list of priorities. Apart altogether from the recent serious flooding of that river, there is the best of Irish land being flooded constantly in the area.  As I have said, both the manpower and the equipment are available for such works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another positive factor of arterial drainage is that there is very valuable sand and gravel removed from the rivers. This is an aspect that we tend to overlook. With modern equipment these deposits can be extracted and used in the building industry.  At a time when there is so much unemployment and when we are running all over the place appealing to new industrialists to set up here, we have the means of creating employment while at the same time carrying out very valuable work in the form of arterial drainage.  From the Minister's constituency right down to Youghal there is a need for these works <Col N="478" /> in order to protect the people in the towns along the Blackwater from being flooded out as well as to provide valuable land.  It was a miracle that lives were not lost in the recent flooding of the river but I appeal to the Minister to give special consideration to the Blackwater in view of what has happened.</P>
    <P>It is all right talking in terms of millions of pounds but many of these millions only account for inflation.  Surely another £1 or £2 million could be found to carry out the very essential work that I am talking about.  We must start at the Youghal side and work our way gradually from there as funds become available.  This work is very important if we are to make the various towns safe.  We do not wish to see again whole shop fronts in towns such as Kanturk, Fermoy, Mallow or Midleton being washed away.  Neither do we wish to experience again the sight of people wading through the water in the dead of night or of old people being taken from their homes at night.  Neither do we wish to see again dead animals dangling from the tree tops as was the case during the recent flooding.  I came into the House especially today to appeal to the Minister to give priority to the draining of the Blackwater.</P>

      <P>I thank those Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  Deputy Quinn referred to the increase of 1.3 per cent in the original Estimate for 1980 compared with the Estimate for 1979.  The relevant increase in the Estimate in relation to the outlay is in gross figures; the increase in gross figures for 1980 as compared with 1979 is 10 per cent.  It is necessary because of the progress of the work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan mentioned the barriers at both gates of Leinster House.  A contract for the maintenance of the traffic control barriers has been placed with a firm for a number of years but the delay in repairing the barriers was not because of a delay in payment of an account but was due to a difference of opinion between the Office of Public Works and the contractor doing the work.</P>

    <P>Deputy Donnellan mentioned the Oughterard Garda station and this matter was highlighted in the press recently. My Department have been looking for a suitable site for a new Garda station for several years.  A number of sites regarded as suitable were examined but the Office of Public Works were not successful in bringing negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion.  Towards the end of last year my Department purchased a former Church of Ireland rectory.  However, extensive adaptation and development works were necessary to make the building suitable as a Garda divisional headquarters. A scheme was prepared by my Department and the first phase of the work is being carried out.  It is expected it will be finished early in 1981.  The second phase is a much larger scheme and will include the building of an extension which will be carried out when the gardaí <Col N="480" /> are in occupation.  The proposal for the main scheme is with the local authority for planning permission.  The Office of Public Works are looking for alternative premises as temporary accommodation for the gardaí.  We hope to get something in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned the Garda station at Drogheda.  It is accepted that this station is inadequate and the Office of Public Works have been looking for a suitable building or site to replace it. They have not yet got a suitable site or alternative.  Two prefabricated offices have been provided at the station and they are almost ready for occupation.  We are waiting for telephones to be installed; it is the job of the gardaí to ensure they are provided as soon as possible.  When the staff move into the prefabricated offices the additional toilets will be provided. I should like to inform Deputies that the Office of Public Works are not responsible for cleaning windows in Garda stations or for providing blankets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about a new bridge to be erected which would be known as St. Mary's Bridge, Drogheda.  I should like to inform the House that a contract has been placed for this bridge.</P>
    <P>There were many contributions from Deputies on the subject of arterial drainage. I agree that much work must be carried out in this area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at what the Minister has said.  Is he aware that there is widespread concern?  In his answer he says that he is not aware of widespread concern.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, I presume his question refers to companies fitting windows into new and existing houses.  For new houses, local authority or grant-aided, the requirements are set out in the Department's outline specification for grant-aided houses, which ensures that the work must comply with the relevant Irish standards &mdash; in this case IS 63, wood casement windows and IS 60, galvanised steel windows.  The Department have received no complaints in regard to these.</P>
      <P>For existing houses, there are no mandatory standards for the installation of replacement windows.  However, where a loan is granted by a local authority or where a grant has been approved by the Department of the Environment for work which included the replacement of the existing windows, the new windows would have to comply with the relevant Irish standards.  I have not received any complaints.  If the Deputy has any complaints in writing and submits them to me, I will be only too glad to have these investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to do that. Can the Minister recall a number of questions about specific companies to which he replied some months ago indicating that his present assertion that he has received no complaints is completely unfounded?  Further, is it not the case that his total reply refers only to cases where loans or grants are sought and does not relate to this question which is about private commercial deals in a field where the primary culprits are people well <Col N="483" /> known to the Garda and the primary victims, because of the nature of the buildings which are usually old or in need of some degree of maintenance or refurbishment, are old people who are open to exploitation?  Finally, if I submit to the Minister not one or two, but many complaints, will he undertake to have his Department investigate each one thoroughly?</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  The capital allocation for housing in 1980 at £202.53 million in fact represents an increase of 20 per cent in money terms on the expenditure of £169.04 million in 1979.  In real terms, the allocation represents a reduction of about 2 per cent on 1979 but shows an increase of 31 per cent on 1977.  In contrast, capital expenditure decreased by 57 per cent in real terms between 1975 and 1977.</P>
      <P>Housing completions declined by almost 3,000 to 24,000 between 1975 and 1976, but have been increasing steadily since then, from 24,500 in 1977, to 25,400 in 1978, and to 26,500 last year.  This year, total housing completions probably will exceed 27,000 which would be an alltime record.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are presently assessing the level of accumulated housing need and the prospective demand for housing in their areas in the period up to 1985. The results of these assessments will form the basis for the determination of housing policy over the next five years.  Pending the availability of the required details on the extent and nature of housing need, steps will continue to be taken by the Government to maintain the annual rate of house completions at a high level.</P>

The allocation of £202.53 million for 1980 includes increases totalling £20 million and a £3 million overdraft by local authority housing announced in recent weeks.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest information received from the three housing authorities <Col N="488" /> in the Dublin area indicates that of the total of 8,156 approved applicants on their housing lists, they hope to rehouse, in either new houses or through vacancies in existing houses, a total of 3,441 or 40 per cent of their approved applicants in the current year.  This compares with a total of 3,327 families rehoused in 1979 or about 36 per cent of the 9,214 approved applicants on their waiting lists in that year.  Following the Government's recent decision to increase the authorised expenditure on the local authority housing programme for 1980 by £12 million I notified Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dun Laoghaire Corporation of increases of £3 million, £.9 million and £.15 million respectively in their capital allocation.  This brought the allocations for the Dublin area to £49.35 million, or about 43 per cent of the total authorised capital expenditure of £113.75 million in 1980.  As regards 1981, applications for capital allocation for the Dublin area will be considered in conjunction with similar applications from other housing authorities in the context of the overall capital which will be made available by the Government for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that by giving 43 per cent the Minister is giving a slightly lower percentage than was given in the past few years to Dublin?  I quite agree that the correct thing to do is to give the major share to Dublin, because that is <Col N="489" /> where the big trouble is.  Would the Minister not agree that, even with the money he has allocated and the additional money, there is still a percentage reduction in the amount of money made available for housing this year?  Similar to the reply to the previous question the amount is more than the 2 per cent which applies to the whole country.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Quinn</b> asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that the allocation of capital for new local authority housing is £92.5 million for 1980, and that this represents an increase in money terms of 3.2 per cent over 1979, which is proportionately a larger reduction in real terms to local authority housing than the overall reduction in capital sums available for the housing sector from Government capital expenditure; the reasons local authority applicants carry a higher burden of Government cut-backs than the private sector; and if he will indicate the basis of this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised capital provision for new local authority housing in 1980 is £101.5 million which represents an increase of 23.8 per cent on the capital provision of £82 million for 1979; and while the actual expenditure by local authorities on new house construction in 1979 was £89.59 million the total authorised expenditure in 1980 is £113.75 million.  The total capital provision for housing in 1980 is £202.53 million, an increase of 22.5 per cent on the capital provision of £165.30 <Col N="491" /> million for 1979.  As can be seen from these figures there have been no cutbacks in public capital for housing.  The latest information available on overall housing needs shows that at the end of 1979 there were 32,519 applications for local authority houses and 25,909 of these had been approved for rehousing; that two-thirds of the approved applicants were families of three persons or less; and that with the provision each year of 6,000 new houses and about a further 3,000 becoming available for reletting through vacancies about one-third of approved applicants are rehoused each year.  To imply that three out of four approved applicants have no prospect of being housed is completely irresponsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Government, who took office more than three-and-a-half years ago, produced figures immediately afterwards showing that 78 per cent of those on the housing list were families of three persons or less?  Will the Minister admit that the situation now appears to be that it is a crime to have applicants with three persons or less in the family apply for rehousing from a local authority?  Does the Minister agree that the prospects of that type of family ever being rehoused for years is slight?  Does the Minister agree that because of the tremendous increase in the cost of local authority and other housing over the last three-and-a-half years the amount he has quoted as being an increase in local authority housing is a substantial reduction on the number of houses that could be built?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <P>The investigation of instances of pollution and any necessary remedial action is a matter for the local authority in whose area the incident occurs.  I understand that some problems have arisen in the past from the use by an industrial firm over many years of an old state quarry on the Kilkenny-Waterford border as a waste disposal site, that this quarry has recently been filled up and that the firm have applied to Tipperary South Riding County Council for planning permission to use another quarry <Col N="495" /> adjacent to the existing one.  I am informed that the local authority has decided to grant permission subject to stringent conditions designed to prevent environmental pollution and that this decision is the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will extend the system of postal voting at national and local elections to members of the Irish Diplomatic Service serving abroad and to members of the staff of the IDA, CTT and Aer Lingus in offices abroad as these people are effectively deprived of their voting rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to extend the system of postal voting to the categories referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider sympathetically a request for such an extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of postal voting facilities for diplomats and others normally resident outside the country would give rise to problems over and above those normally associated with postal voting. For example, residence within the country is a fundamental <Col N="496" /> requirement for registration as an elector. The categories mentioned would in general be ordinarily resident outside the country.  While postal voting would help persons living in, say, western Europe, it would be of little benefit to those living further afield because the time available would be too short for the issue and return of the ballot papers.  If special arrangements were to be provided for some of the categories there could be pressure to provide similar facilities for all Irish citizens resident abroad.  The number of such citizens would be very great.  If the principle of granting the vote to Irish citizens resident outside the State were to be considered, the potential number involved would be very high.  It is generally estimated that there are about one million Irish citizens resident in Britain. There would also be a large number in countries such as the USA and Canada. In addition most of the one-and-a-half million inhabitants of Northern Ireland are Irish citizens.  If issue were made to diplomats and representatives of State companies it would be very difficult to justify excluding other categories.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make the job of the Chair more difficult and I recognise that we are not going as fast as we should, but surely the Minister has contradicted himself when he refers to the difficulties that would occur.  This facility currently exists for the benefit of Irish Army personnel overseas.  I am simply asking the Minister to extend this principle &mdash; and to accept that it is simply an extension &mdash; to people normally resident in this country but who for purposes of employment by the State or semi-State companies are temporarily living abroad?</P>

In line with the Government's undertaking to give effect as far as lies in their power to the recommendations of the Whiddy Tribunal, I am considering what further measures may be necessary in relation to the maritime jurisdiction of local authorities.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were informed by circular letter on 24 November 1980 that my sanction might be assumed for payment of the first phase increase provided for under the second national understanding to local authority officers and employees for whom I am the appropriate Minister.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate a copy of the relevant circular letter with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the text of the circular letter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>24 November, 1980.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Revision of Remuneration.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Agreement on Pay Policy between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Employer Organisations.</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  I am directed by Mr. Raphael P. <Col N="500" /> Burke, T.D., Minister for the Environment to refer to the above Agreement (copy enclosed) and to state that he has been advised that, in accordance with the terms of clause 2.3, agreements in the form set out in the Appendix to the Agreement have been made between the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board representing local authorities and the appropriate trade unions.  Accordingly, his sanction may be assumed for payment, on the basis set out below, of the first phase increase provided for under the terms of clause 3.1 to local authority officers and employees for whom he is the appropriate Minister. Sanction may also be assumed on the same basis to pro-rata increases for part-time personnel and juveniles in accordance with past practice.  Where a person holds more than one post the increase should be calculated on the basis of his total remuneration.</P>
    <P>2.  It should be noted that the first phase increase shall be applied to the basic rate of pay of adult employees one month from the date of expiry of clause 2.1 of the 1979 Agreement on Pay Policy. This phase shall operate for a period of eight months and shall be for an amount of 8 per cent of basic pay plus £1.00 per week (£52.20 p.a.).</P>
    <P>3.  Insofar as national grades are concerned the appendix to this Circular Letter sets out revised scales applicable as from the 1 October, 1980.  The appendix also shows the revised hourly rate for Branch Librarians and the revised fee-per-cottage for non-salaried Rent Collectors. Revised salaries for non-national grades should be determined and details of the existing and the revised scales notified to the Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>4.  In the case of county council road workers (including gangers and foremen), weekly wage rates may be increased appropriately.  Particulars of the revised rates of pay of roadworkers should be furnished to the Department as early as possible.</P>
    <P>5.  Separate circulars will issue shortly about the application of the first phase increase in the case of Craftsmen and related grades, i.e. Chargehand, Assistant <Col N="501" /> Foreman, Foreman and Craftsman's mates, and part-time firemen.</P>
    <P>6.  The Agreement is devised to provide for a two phased pay increase over a total period of fifteen months.  A further circular will issue in due course in relation to the second phase.  It should be noted that the Agreement (clause 4) precludes strikes or any other form of industrial action by trade unions or employees in respect of any matter covered by this Agreement where the employer is acting in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>7.  The general sanction in this circular letter relates to the basic increases under the Agreement.  Local authorities are reminded that, in accordance with standing <Col N="502" /> practice, where claims are made for special increases and improvements, no offers or commitments should be made at any stage without prior consultation with the Department.</P>
    <P>8.  Orders revising the remuneration of Managers and Assistant Managers will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>9.  Any queries in regard to this circular letter should be referred to the Local Administration (Remuneration) Section of the Department.  Telephone enquiries may be made at 01-742961, Extension 457.</P>

      <P>I understand that Gulf Oil Company are exploring possible arrangements under which the terminal might be reactivated and, of course, in this connection the question of restoring the destroyed jetty or the building of another jetty would arise.  I can assure the Deputy that the possibility of the reactivation of the terminal is being kept under constant review by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will make a statement of the up-to-date position of oil reserves in this country dealing in particular with those held (a) at Whiddy Island and (b) abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Chomhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>This country's total oil reserves calculated by reference to the relevant formulae laid down by the EEC &mdash; Directives 68/414 and 72/425 respectively &mdash; amounted to about 1,445,000 tonnes at 31 October 1980.  Particulars of the reserves as at 30 November 1980 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>Included in the total of 1,445,000 tonnes were</P>
      <P>(a)  about 145,000 tonnes of oil, mainly crude, stored at Whiddy Island under a long-standing agreement with the company which owns the terminal there.</P>
      <P>(b)  About 337,000 tonnes of crude oil and product stored, by arrangement with the governments concerned, in other EEC countries on behalf of some Irish oil companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance is held in this country in crude and product form by the oil companies and large comsumers.  The proportions of our oil stocks held abroad will <Col N="508" /> vary from time to time but is normally of the order of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The total stocks which, following the recent disruption in the oil industry, are the lowest for some time &mdash; though the position in this regard is being rectified &mdash; represent approximately 93 days, consumption at 1979 levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the position of the availability of the stocks held abroad in the event of an emergency?  Is he satisfied as to the accessibility of those stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that all the arrangements that can be made in respect of them have been made and, as I have indicated, where they are held abroad they are held on foot of government-to-government arrangement.  Nevertheless, I have said publicly that I would be much happier if a higher proportion of our stocks was held at home under our own jurisdiction and I am endeavouring to make arrangements which will bring that about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the situation of the stocks held in Whiddy now &mdash; that would be approximately 10 per cent of our strategic oil reserves &mdash; in view of the present situation that obtains in Whiddy and the difficulty of access to that oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulty of access but it would not be insuperable in an emergency situation and I am happy that the stocks are being held there within our jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>17.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will outline the possible effects on our oil supplies of a continuation of the Iran/Iraq conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Oil exports from both Iran and Iraq ceased when hostilities between them commenced in September.  Due to damage to the production and transport installations in both countries it is unlikely that exports could return to their <Col N="509" /> traditional levels for several months after hostilities cease.  It is difficult to be precise about our exact dependence on oil from these two sources but it is estimated at less than 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>A number of other major oil-producing countries have promised to increase production as a contribution towards offsetting the losses arising from the war. This prospect, coupled with significant stocks in consuming countries and reduced world demand due to the economic recession, should mean that supplies will continue to be reasonably available. However, it is hardly necessary for me to emphasise how volatile the situation is and how difficult it is to be confident, at this time, that supply difficulties will not arise some time during the coming year.</P>

      <P>We are not buying on the spot market.  I have no reason to anticipate any shortfall in our supplies over this coming winter, but I cannot say for certain for the whole year ahead that there will not be a shortfall.  The indications are reasonably good and the Deputy will be aware that within recent days there is evidence of information of some exports from Iraq, which is helpful to the overall scene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the present arrangement in relation to the importation of coal supplies in the Dublin area exists solely as a result of developments in the trade over the past ten years or so. <Col N="510" /> This situation does not preclude the entry by other interests who may wish to engage in the importation of coal.  On the distribution side, two-thirds of the Dublin area's coal are handled by the bellmen. The statutory procedures for investigating the public interest aspects of the present importation and general trading arrangements are not within my sphere of responsibility but I should say, as indicated in replies to previous questions on this subject, that the position in the Dublin area has been the subject of a number of investigations over the past seven years or so, the most recent such investigation being early in 1979.  None of these investigations confirmed that difficulties in supplying the market could be attributed to abuse of a monopoly position.</P>
      <P>There are no regulations precluding competition in the coal importing business in Dublin but there are, of course, the practical constraints arising out of the need for availability of berthage, unloading and storage facilities and so on.  These are matters outside my control but I would welcome, from the energy supply point of view, any positive steps which interested parties may have in mind for provision of additional coal-importing facilities in Dublin.</P>

In the event that a decision is taken at any future time to produce oil offshore, the interests of Irish companies, capable of supplying any of the facilities required, will be strongly promoted by my Department.

      <P>A Government decision made as far back as 1960 to the effect that the public sector, health authorities and local authorities were to use native fuels, to the utmost practicable extent still applies. I understand from the Minister for Health that the native fuel policy of his Department is embodied in the guidelines which health boards must follow in the planning of hospitals and, over the years, the policy has been the subject of directives issued to health boards.  I understand that it is also the policy of the Minister for the Environment to encourage the use of native fuels by local authorities.

      <P>The ESB have outlined to me the circumstances surrounding this matter.  The matter did not arise by way of a proposal made to the board by an illegal organisation or by an intermediary acting for such an organisation.  In fact it arose in a much more indirect way in circumstances where an ESB official was engaged in duties related to the possible restoration of the inter-connector.  There were no documents involved.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the ESB acted correctly and, therefore, the question of further action by me does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that there were no documents involved but can he say what was the form of the proposal made?  In view of numerous press reports which made it quite clear than an undertaking to the Provisional IRA to hand over a large sum of money would bring about the safety of the cross-Border transmitter and the fact that these reports received a lot of publicity, would the Minister agree, though he has heard from the ESB their account of whatever transaction took place, that to end the speculation it would be in the best interest and clear the air if the ESB handed over any evidence in their possession to the proper authority to see if any action is necessary?  I accept he is satisfied that there is no criminal action involved but in view of the speculation that has occurred would the Minister agree that the proper course would be to hand over any evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda?</P>

I am sure the Deputy is sufficiently aware of the situation in the area concerned to realise that matters of this kind do not normally arise in a clear-cut fashion.  I am assured that there are no documents.  I am quite satisfied with the information that I have been given and that the ESB and their agencies acted correctly.  No question of referring this matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions could arise.

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1980. - Vote 9: Public Works and Buildings (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,390,000 be granted to defray the charge that will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for certain domestic expenses; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with national schools.  National school works are carried out to the requirements of the Department of Education who finalise all projects.  Time must be allotted to the Office of Public Works to prepare plans and specifications. There is no delay in my Department in preparing these plans and specifications. Expenditure from my Department on national schools in 1976 was £10 million; in 1979, £17 million and in 1980 it is £23.5 million.  This is an <Col N="532" /> increase of 130 per cent in expenditure on repair and improvement of national schools.</P>
      <P>Deputy Begley spoke of local authorities that had granted planning permissions which were being held up by my Department.  I should like to advise the Deputy that the National Monuments Advisory Council act entirely independent of the Board of Works in relation to the Planning Act.  My Department is not responsible for any delay.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the matter of bar accommodation in this House.  If the Deputy consults representatives from his party on the Restaurant Committee he will find out the plans we have for the restoration of the bar.</P>

      <P>We have plans drawn up for the restoration of the Public Bar, the Member's Bar and for the provision of a coffee-dock type of restaurant.  The Deputy said that the Board of Works brought some workers in here this morning because this Supplementary Estimate was being discussed.  Those workers have been here for the past four weeks and if the Deputy asks the bartenders he will be told that these men were working at the back of the bar for the past four weeks. He must accept that we have to act on the recommendations of the Restaurant Committee and we must also have to cause as little disruption as possible in the House especially when the two Houses are sitting.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Killarney on being selected as a site for a Civil Service Department, under our decentralisation programme.  I assure the Deputy that my Department and I will do everything possible to ensure that a site is procured as soon as possible in that area for this office.</P>

      <P>I could not answer that now but if the Deputy puts down a question I shall probably be able to <Col N="533" /> answer it.  The coast erosion problem in the Magharees was also raised.  Kerry County Council recommended that a prohibition order be made for a certain area of the Magharees and this was submitted to my Department.  It is the Department of Transport that makes the prohibition order.  My Department and the Department of Transport asked Kerry County Council to define the area which should be prohibited.  The county council took a long time to reply even though it is my own county council as well as the Deputy's.  The Deputy may check this with the officials of his own county council and they will give him the same information.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1980. - Malicious Injuries Bill, 1980: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to consolidate with amendments what is commonly called the malicious injuries code, that is the statutory basis for the payment out of the rates of compensation for malicious damage to property.  The provisions of the present code are contained in a number of statutes commencing with the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836.  These statutes are listed in the Schedule to the Bill.  I am not going to enter into a discussion of the origins of the code, to do so would be a pointless exercise&mdash;although I am aware of the criticisms that have been levelled at it as being an instrument of colonial subjugation imposed by an alien Government. On the other hand there is the view that the code was never intended as such but was primarily intended to deal with the problem of 19th century agrarian disturbances common to a number of countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever its origins it must be recognised &mdash; and I know that many people do so recognise it &mdash; as having become a non-profit-making and valuable system of communal insurance against malicious damage to property.  There is no doubt that it has been the financing of the code which has given rise to most of the criticism of it which has arisen in recent years. However, it must be said that the financing of the code has never imposed an excessive burden on ratepayers, and it should not be forgotten that ratepayers themselves whose property was maliciously damaged have benefited under the code.  Up to 1963 the average charge on the rates in respect of malicious injuries <Col N="538" /> did not exceed a ½ in the pound for the whole country.  In more recent years the cost of malicious injuries has increased more in line with increases generally in rates and by 1979 the annual average charge on the rates had risen to 8p in the pound.  Perhaps a better measure of the incidence of malicious injuries on the rates is the percentage of the total rate attributable to charges in respect of malicious injuries.  This has risen from 0.1 per cent in the fifties to 0.8 per cent in 1979.  This no doubt represents one more unfortunate index of the general increase in criminality in our society.</P>
    <P>In 1974, in order to put a ceiling on ratepayers' liability for malicious injuries compensation, a non-statutory arrangement was introduced whereby if, in any financial year, the cost of compensation to a local authority exceeds the produce of a rate of 20p in the pound the excess is recouped to the local authority from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 provided full relief in relation to payment of rates on domestic and certain other property.  This did not, however, result in increased amounts being payable by those who continued to be liable for rates, for example, occupiers of agricultural land above a certain valuation and occupiers of industrial or commercial premises, factories, offices and shops. This is because local authorities are compensated by a grant from the Exchequer equal to the loss in rates income resulting from the relief to ratepayers granted by the Act.</P>
    <P>Since the financial responsibility of local authorities for malicious injuries compensation has been reduced and limited in the ways that I have just mentioned it might be argued that local authorities should now be relieved of all responsibility for malicious injury compensation, I do not accept this argument. Local authority involvement is a key factor &mdash; and this approach is fundamental to the main provisions of the Bill.  The involvement of local authorities means that the services of their professional and other staff can be used at minimal cost in connection with the processing of malicious <Col N="539" /> injury claims and the contesting of such claims in appropriate cases at court hearings.  To transfer the responsibility to the State would necesitate the establishment of a new and expensive organisation with legal and other specialist staff &mdash; probably Dublin based &mdash; which would greatly increase the cost of compensating for malicious injuries, whilst the removal of responsibility from the local authorities would not result in any tangible saving to them by way of staff or accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Inter-departmental Committee on Malicious Injuries, in a report furnished some years ago expressed a similar view which the Government have accepted. Their basic recommendation was to the effect that a system of compensation for malicious injuries to property should be retained and the cost should continue to be payable by local authorities.  The Bill, accordingly, provides that local authorities will continue to be liable for malicious damage to property subject to certain exceptions and on the basis that local authorities will be recouped from the Exchequer for any compensation paid in excess of the produce of a rate of 20p in the pound &mdash; this being an existing non-statutory arrangement which I have already mentioned and which is being given a statutory basis in section 19 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill proposes to consolidate, with amendments, the law providing for compensation for malicious injuries to property.  The Explanatory Memorandum, which was circulated to Deputies with the text of the Bill, deals in some detail with its provisions and the side notes in the Bill indicate those provisions which are new to the law or new in part.  I shall now outline the main changes in the law for which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>At present all claims for compensation must be heard by the Circuit Court.  A number of these claims are for very small sums.  It is now proposed in section 13 of the Bill that any case where the claim is for a sum not exceeding £2,500 will be dealt with in the District Court.  Deputies will be aware that this is the new general <Col N="540" /> limit proposed for District Court contract and tort cases in the Courts Bill, 1980, which circulated at the same time as this Bill.  Claims for greater amounts will be heard by the Circuit Court, as at present. A right of appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court is provided in section 17 and in section 18 there is also provision to have a case stated by the District Court for the opinion of the Supreme Court. This is in line with the views of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in relation to cases stated in general and as set out in the recommendations of their Eleventh Report.</P>
    <P>At present compensation is payable where the malicious damage exceeds £5. This figure was fixed in 1898.  In 1963 the Inter-departmental Committee, having noted that the costs involved in the hearing of certain cases were greater than the amount of the claims themselves and that there was an undue number of trivial cases, recommended that compensation should be payable only where damage exceeds £20.  Section 5 (1) of the Bill proposes that the &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; should be raised to £100.  This is being done so as to take account of the fall in the value of money since 1963.  In Northern Ireland, the &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; figure was increased from £20 in 1971 to £100 in 1977.  Section 25 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Finance may by order vary the amount of the &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; figure.  There is no equivalent provision in the present law.</P>
    <P>Another innovation as far as our law is concerned is the provision in section 12 (2) prohibiting the award of compensation in respect of the first £100 of any claim, so however, that no applicant may suffer a reduction in respect of more than one claim for the same property as a result of actions occurring during any period of 12 months.  There is a similar provision in Northern Ireland and it is a common practice with insurance companies to provide for exclusions of this type in their policies.  In our present malicious injuries code, however, there is no such provision: if the damage exceeds £5, compensation for the full amount, including the <Col N="541" /> first £5 may be awarded.  I believe that the logic behind the proposed provision is clear.  In the absence of such a provision a person who suffered damage amounting to, say, £99 would not be entitled to any compensation whereas a person who suffered damage amounting to £101 would be entitled to the full amount.</P>
    <P>Compensation for malicious damage to property in coastal waters is another matter in relation to which the Bill makes provision for a change in the law.  Until 1979, compensation for damages to property in coastal waters was not payable under the malicious injuries code.  In that year, in an unreported case <i>Brown v. Donegal County Council,</i> the Supreme Court held that by reason of section 685 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, where a vessel is maliciously damaged while lying off the coast, compensation may be recovered from the country off which she lies.  Section 685 of the 1894 Act deals with jurisdiction over vessels &ldquo;being on, or lying or passing off&rdquo; a coast or &ldquo;being in or near&rdquo; a bay, channel and so on.  On the one hand, the present law as it stands following the 1979 Supreme Court decision is too restrictive as its coverage is limited to malicious damage to `vessels'.  As defined in the 1894 Act a `vessel' is any ship or boat or other description of vessel used in navigation and may not, for example, cover such things as fixed offshore navigation lights, drilling rigs or equipment used in fish farming operations.  On the other hand, the distance from the coast within which malicious damage to a vessel will qualify for compensation is too imprecisely described in the terms &ldquo;lying off or passing off the coast&rdquo;, and so on, used in section 685 of the 1894 Act.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that section 5(3) of the Bill, provides that damage to property which is within any harbour or within one mile beyond the coastal boundary of a local authority will qualify for compensation. I think that I should mention too, that the inter-departmental committee recommend that the area of liability of local authorities should be extended to include coastal waters.  The committee's recommendation was not restricted to any particular kind of property nor did <Col N="542" /> they define what they meant by coastal waters.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill provides that local authorities against whom claims are brought will be empowered to settle the claims out of court and to lodge money in court.  These are new provisions in so far as the malicious injuries code is concerned and they follow the procedure that obtains in ordinary civil actions. They are intended to encourage the settlement of claims for compensation before the case comes before the court thus saving the time of the courts and reducing the liability of local authorities for costs.  Another advantage will be that persons whose property has been maliciously damaged and who agree to a settlement will receive payment of compensation much sooner than they would under the present code.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the repeal without re-enactment of the local levy provision in the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836 whereby the court may direct that the cost of meeting compensation for malicious injuries will be levied on the rates of a particular small locality such as a parish or townland.  This is an undoubtedly punitive provision that was designed to bring their civic responsibility home to the people of a particular area in cases where the court was convinced that some, at least, of them had been involved in or privy to communal activity leading to the malicious damage giving rise to the claim for compensation.  With the abolition of rates on domestic property, circumstances in this regard have changed completely and the retention of a provision in the law enabling a local levy to be imposed on the rated occupiers of non-domestic property such as shops and factories in a small locality would be clearly inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Compensation for property stolen in the course of a riot is provided for in England and in Northern Ireland.  There is no similar provision in Irish law at present.  Section 6 of the Bill is designed to cover such cases.  It provides for payment of compensation in respect of loss of property which is unlawfully taken from a building during the course of a riot in which other property is also maliciously <Col N="543" /> damaged.  This provision is included in the Bill because a property owner in such circumstances is at the mercy of the wrongdoers and normally he cannot secure insurance cover to protect himself against loss or damage caused by persons riotously assembled. The provision extends to a riot on board a ship which is in a harbour or within one mile off shore.  It may be observed that section 5 provides for compensation for damage caused to property during a riot whereas this section &mdash; section 6 &mdash; provides for compensation for property that is stolen during a riot.</P>
    <P>Under the present law, an award of compensation cannot be paid until the local authority have included the amount in their estimates for the following year and the rate has been levied and collected. This means that, apart from any other delays, there can be a time-lag of almost two years between the occurrence of the damage and the actual payment of the award.  Section 11 of the Bill, which provides for the payment on foot of a court award of compensation &ldquo;out of the funds&rdquo; of the local authority, will have the effect of reducing the time-lag very considerably &mdash; by a year or more in many cases.</P>
    <P>There are a few other proposed changes in the law that should, I feel, be mentioned at this stage.  Three of these changes will have the effect of providing an entitlement to compensation for malicious damage in cases where such compensation is not payable under the present law.</P>
    <P>First is a new provision in section 5 which classifies damage caused in the course of the committing of a crime as malicious damage for the purpose of the legislation.  Damage caused for the purpose of committing a crime, which is covered in the present law, is also provided for in the section.</P>
    <P>The second change is provided for in section 2 where &ldquo;property&rdquo; is defined, for the purpose of this legislation, as including incorporeal hereditaments which are not covered by the present law on compensation for malicious damage. The effect of this new definition of property <Col N="544" /> is that malicious damage to <i>inter alia</i> rights of fishing, shooting or herbage will qualify for compensation, as was recommended by the Inter-departmental Committee on Malicious Injuries.  Destruction of a fishery, for example, may cause more damage to be done to those who hold the fishing rights and whose living is threatened by the damage than to the landlord who, under the present law, is entitled to recover compensation for damage to the river bed.</P>
    <P>The third change relates to compensation for damage that is caused by a person of unsound mind or by a child. Under the present code compensation is excluded where damage is caused by a person of unsound mind: the position in regard to children is doubtful.  In this regard, I should mention that personal injuries inflicted by such persons are covered by the non-statutory scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted that was introduced by my predecessor in 1974.  There is no justification for the exclusion from the scope of the Bill of damage caused by persons of unsound mind or by children.  Section 7 has, accordingly, been included so as to ensure that such damage will qualify.</P>
    <P>Other proposed changes in the law will have the effect of reducing or excluding compensation in certain cases.  Section 12 provides that compensation will not be payable in respect of damage to or loss of coins, currency notes, postal orders, money orders or stamps or in respect of damage to or loss of articles of personal ornament, including watches and jewellery, if these articles are kept otherwise than as part of stock-in-trade.  To prove or disprove the existence of such items can be difficult, if not impossible, and it can be difficult to prove or disprove exactly when and in what circumstances an item of personal ornament is damaged or lost.  There is, therefore, the danger of fraudulent claims in respect of these items.  Compensation in respect of the items in question is also excluded in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also provides for the reduction or exclusion of compensation where the applicant did not take reasonable precautions to avoid the damage or loss or <Col N="545" /> reasonable steps to minimise the extent of it or where he himself bears some responsibility for it.  The same section provides that compensation will not be payable in respect of damage to a structure which is erected in contravention of, or otherwise does not conform to, the requirements of the Planning Acts.  Apart from these instances there are, as I have mentioned earlier, other provisions which will have the effect of limiting the financial liability of local authorities, namely, their recoupment from the Exchequer for any compensation they pay in excess of the produce of a rate of 20p in the £; the raising of the threshold figure for payment of compensation to £100; and the exclusion of compensation for the first £100 of damage.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a number of other procedural changes of a minor nature, details of which are given in the explanatory memorandum.  The need for these changes has become apparent from experience over the years and Deputies will, I trust, agree that they can more appropriately be dealt with during Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Before, I conclude, however, there are a few points that, I think, should be brought to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>The provisions in sections 5 and 6 which exclude compensation for any loss consequential on the actual damage or loss will make no change in the present law.  In 1975 the Supreme Court disallowed a claim in respect of consequential loss.  In the case in question the actual damage amounted to £29,000 while the claim for consequential loss amounted to £220,000.  It can be seen that if the Bill were to provide for consequential loss the financial implications for public funds could be serious.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the Bill does not cover compensation for criminal injury to the person.  In 1974 a non-statutory scheme, financed from State funds, was introduced.  Under this scheme payment of compensation may be made on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis in respect of personal injuries, fatal and non-fatal, directly attributable to a crime of violence or to circumstances arising from the action of the victim in assisting, or <Col N="546" /> attempting to assist in the prevention of a crime or in the saving of human life. The scheme is administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal and I am glad to say that it has operated very satisfactorily.  I will however, be reviewing the scheme to see whether it is necessary to make any changes in it and also to see whether it should not be put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in section 10(2) of the Bill which entitles a ratepayer to appear and be heard at the court hearing of an application for compensation in which his local authority is involved. Related provisions concerning a ratepayer's right of intervention in such proceedings occur in sections 15, 17 and 18. I have considered whether these provisions, which provide substantially for the re-enactment of the present law, should not be dropped altogether because the incentive for these who still pay rates &mdash; that is the owners of commercial property and the occupiers of land holdings above a certain valuation limit &mdash; to intervene in proceedings for malicious damage compensation has diminished as a result of recent developments.  One such development to which I have already referred, is the non-statutory arrangement, which is being given a statutory basis in section 19 of the Bill, whereby grants from the Exchequer are made to local authorities so as to ensure that a ratepayer's liability for compensation for malicious damage cannot exceed a rate of 20p in the pound. The proposal to abolish the local levy by not providing for the re-enactment of the relevant provisions in the Bill must also make it even more unlikely that a ratepayer would decide to intervene in these proceedings.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, owners of domestic property and others who, since 1978, qualify for full relief from rates obviously no longer have any incentive to intervene &mdash; although they are still legally entitled to do so because they have not lost their status as ratepayers.  On balance, however, I believe that to provide for the continuance of these ratepayer's rights, as is proposed in the Bill, is the best course.  Since what is involved is a right which is provided for in the present law, <Col N="547" /> I think that, as a matter of principle, we should be slow to abolish it while there still remains the possibility &mdash; though a diminishing one &mdash; that it could be usefully invoked.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is helpful to a very limited extent.  The real issue it should hinge on, it only glances off.  The Minister pointed to the far more serious issue in relation to malicious injury when he spoke about there being no doubt but that the increase in the various indices in this context represented one more unfortunate index of the general increase of criminality in our society.</P>
      <P>This Bill affords us a slight opportunity in the context of the proposals put forward to deal administratively with the problem that confronts us, the whole question of malicious injuries, the increase in the number of crimes, and our inability, indeed our failure, to cope with that problem.  Is our response merely to be some kind of fiscal tidying up rather than a true attack on the real roots of the issue?  This would imply an honest recognition by the Government that they are failing in the area of dealing with crime and that the Minister has shirked the issue time and again.  Every available report or statistic, every commentator who speaks on this issue, whether from private commercial concerns, the individual in the street or concerned organisations, points to a heightening perception by the community of a crime problem increasingly out of control.</P>
      <P>Malicious injuries because they are relatively easy to monitor and assess afford us a convenient index by which to judge our ability or otherwise in this area.  If that is the case, then the figures available to us show that we have failed and are failing.  I would like to quote from the Official Report on 30 June 1976, column 2012, where a Deputy said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure the Minister that there is now wholesale and general acceptance of the fact that the Government have failed very badly to protect <Col N="548" /> people and their property.  The Minister for Justice, and the Government, stand accused, and rightly so, of gross negligence and total failure in the maintenance of law and order throughout the State.  It is now a fact that armed gangs of hooligans can at will successfully hold up or rob banks, post offices, shops or trains.  Instead of making crime more difficult for these people, unfortunately, the situation is the reverse.  The situation is ludicrous in the extreme in that the Government for penny-pinching economy reasons withdrew normal Garda protection, withdrew gardaí who would be on duty to protect property and act as a deterrent to those would-be robbers.</P>
    <P>Dealing with Dublin this spokesman said:</P>
    <P>Crime is rampant in Dublin city and the country at large.  This is also the view of the general public and of the Garda Síochána.  People are terrified, particularly the old, the infirm and those living alone.</P>
    <P>He went on to deal with specific issues in this context and related an editorial from the <i>Garda Review</i> and underlining the undoubted importance of that editorial added:</P>
    <P>If they were charges or utterances by people other than those who purport to speak for the Garda they would not have the same importance as they have when they appear in an editorial in the <i>Garda Review.</i></P>
    <P>That spokesman is the present Minister for Justice, Deputy G. Collins.  If his words were accurate then when the figures for crime were lower than they are now, and when our ability to deal with the problem was greater on the available statistical evidence and public perception than it now is, how much more must they be at present?  Reference to publications by the Garda representative body and the Association of Inspectors and Sergeants, and the degree of emphasis which should rightly attach to those sentiments, has apparently diminished because two weeks ago in this house I expressed the <Col N="549" /> view that the garda have, in many cases, been demoralised, but this idea was pooh-poohed.</P>

      <P>I want to make a brief comment in that respect.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister of State took leave to refer to this Bill and the statistical patterns underlying it as representing an unfortunate index of the general increase in criminality in our society.  If that comment of the Minister of State is valid I submit that I am entitled to make similar type comments.  I do not intend to overdwell on it, except to say this, that all the available evidence in the malicious injuries area &mdash; and I shall deal with it in detail and statistically in a moment &mdash; shows that this Bill is inadequate, is almost irrelevant, tidies up a certain area of law but that our time might be better occupied doing something much more fundamental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> As a concerned spokesman in this area I believe I should be pointing out omissions from the Bill and amendments which should be made.  This Bill should not merely be a financial or administrative exercise.  This Bill is an attempt to cope with a pattern of crime in this area which has gone totally out of control, a pattern which was a lot less serious when the present Minister for Justice deemed it to be deplorably out of hand.  I want to underline the gravity of the present situation by saying that if the position is now worse &mdash; if the Minister was speaking the truth in the extract I have just read &mdash; then we have a lot more to do than this Bill asks if we are to deal in any sensible way with the whole area of malicious injuries.  To give just one indication, in an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 19 November last John Walshe, a writer and journalist noted for conscientious and responsible journalism said:</P>
    <P>School vandalism has soared over the past 12 months and a record £750,000 will be paid out in insurance claims this year.</P>
    <P>This statistic, and others of a similar nature, were included in a speech by Mr. Gerard Ryan of the Church and General Insurance Company Limited, which insures the bulk of schools in the State. He outlined in his tragic litany of soaring statistics that in a normal year there are four or five serious acts of vandalism leading to insurance claims of £10,000 and over but this year there have already been 20 such claims and a further 1,000 incidents of broken glass, breaking and entering and general destruction.  This man, being the managing director of the Church and General Insurance Company Limited, in anybody's language, would be considered an expert.  He went on to say that there was a general increase in all types of vandalism, not just in schools, and that the problem seemed to be getting worse.  I think he is telling the truth and that is the way the public perceive it. Therefore, I am asking for a much more serious and comprehensive comment, in parliamentary time terms, on malicious injuries than is afforded on this Bill.</P>
    <P>If we ran our Parliament properly this <Col N="551" /> type of Bill would not be necessary at all. It is essentially an administrative, bureaucratic exercise which should not warrant legislation.  There is nothing of real weight in this Bill other than the updating of some indices, the eradication of one or two minor injustices and the tidying up of a number of other clauses, almost all of which should be handled by ministerial order.  On account of the way we do things, legislation is necessary and therefore we must debate this Bill.  In a few years time, when the new limits in this Bill, the Courts Bill and all the other Bills, are out of date and eaten up by inflation we will be back saying that we should have index-linked these statistics so that we would not have to waste our time on matters which are essentially not the function of Parliament but rather get on with the serious analysis of social trends, our response to those social trends and the economic issues arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner's report of 1978, the most recent one available, under the heading of &ldquo;Offences Against Property with Violence&rdquo; where it refers to malicious damage to property being included, gives us another indication of just how seriously out of control this Government have allowed the problem to go. This is shown in two ways &mdash; the number of offences have increased and the rate of detection is, to say the least of it, erratic and, at its very best, is a lot less than half what it should be.  In 1975 the number of offences recorded and detected in this group were 16,432 and 7,946 respectively, with a detection rate of 48.4 per cent.  In 1976 there were 20,903 offences in this category recorded and 9,152 detected, a very significant drop in detection to 43.8 per cent from 48.4 per cent.  In 1977, another increase to 23,154 offences was recorded in this category.  The detection rate remained almost the same in numerical terms, at 9,491, and the detection rate once again plunged to 41 per cent.  In 1978 the recorded figure of offences in this category was 21,119, a slight decrease but the detection rate, unfortunately, also showed a slight decrease in numerical <Col N="552" /> terms at 9,308 which represented 44.1 per cent.  What this means is that, by and large, anybody engaged in malicious damage to property has a better than average chance of getting away with it.</P>
    <P>That is a serious state of affairs and one about which no Minister for justice should be happy.  In a way I am sorry the Minister himself is not here, although I pay full respect to the Minister of State who is more than able to deal with this Bill.  I would have been happier had the Minister been here as well as because, to put it bluntly, when confronted with the facts and figures in this area, he has a rather irritating habit of piously washing his hands of the issue and squirming out of the truth of these statistics.  For two reasons I suggest that they are worse than these figures show: one &mdash; and I defy anybody to contradict me on this &mdash; there are fewer crimes being reported in this and indeed other areas now, but particularly in the area of malicious injury of a relatively minor nature, because people are fed up reporting them.  The Garda are hard-pressed doing something else and it is a waste of time reporting them in many cases.  I suspect that the reporting rate is reducing all the time.  Secondly, there is the detection rate.  That is interesting because detection does not necessarily mean what it seems; detection does not mean conviction.  Therefore, I am worried about that aspect also.  What it boils down to is that malicious injuries are now at their most serious in the history of this State.</P>
    <P>Our response in this Bill is to amend and consolidate the law relating to compensation for malicious damages to property almost as if the central issue did not exist.  I believe the Minister could have done better in this Bill, could have proposed a number of measures which I intend to point out on Committee Stage and which would have helped not just the symptoms of the problem &mdash; which is what this Bill is concerned with &mdash; but the cause, thereby reducing the symptoms which we might call, in simple language, a tangle of figures and administrative headaches which were the reason for this Bill being introduced.</P>
    <P>If one examines the statistical evidence <Col N="553" /> in this area further and the Returns of Local Taxation for 1977 under the County Council's Revenue Accounts, Programme Group 8, Miscellaneous Services, and looks at any one of the county councils, Galway for instance, one gets a frightening picture of the damage to property.  In the Galway County Council area last year £108,971 was spent to pay for property damaged.  In corporation and other council areas, with their larger conurbations, the figures are more frightening.  Even if it is in smaller county council areas, figures come across clearly and the indices point steeply upwards.</P>
    <P>In part, this Bill proposes that local authorities will be empowered to pay compensation without delay on foot of court awards.  Therefore, we are accepting the inevitability of a trend which is apart from the sad reference, uttered with a sigh at the end of page 2, when the Minister was reading his speech.  He said that this indicates one more unfortunate index of a general increase in crime in our society.  This is a reflection of the tired attitude of the Minister for Justice. It sums up that this is the way it will be forever.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have dealt realistically with the issues not of who pays the compensation or when it should be paid, not whether the minimum damage awarded should be increased from £5 to £100, but how to reduce malicious damage throughout the country, how to stop crime expeditiously, efficiently and with a real deterrent attitude.  Any malicious injuries Bill which omits significant reference to that area of parliamentary, social and public concern is faulty.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Accounts for 1979 show that the number of these crimes is increasing all the time.  I have endeavoured repeatedly to obtain satisfactory evidence that the Departments of Justice and of the Environment, and the Government as a whole, are concerned about these matters.  I asked how many incidents have occurred in recent years, how many claims have been made as distinct from the total compensation paid.  I wanted to learn the degree to which there are immoral and exaggerated claims in respect of damages to cars and other <Col N="554" /> property.  There is reasonable evidence that claims are exaggerated when the public purse is the target.  Insurance companies will testify to that.</P>
    <P>This has not been dealt with in the Bill. Therefore, we have not provided how malicious injury awards should be assessed.  Should there be a check on the figures?  Should there be some degree of monitoring or should we accept any figure somebody wishes to claim?  If we are to allow a psychology of inflation to develop in this area it will soon become extremely profitable for weak-minded characters to get into the malicious injuries area.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is sufficiently interested he should have given me accurate information on the number of claims.  That has not been made available to me and therefore I ask the Minister to monitor the size of claims, which in many areas are padded disgracefully, and to tidy up the system of dealing with the number of claims.  On 25 November I asked the Minister for the Environment the number and the amounts of claims paid.  The reply given was: &ldquo;The precise information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The number of the crimes committed is of great importance.  If the figure for compensation for a county is £250,000, has that amount been paid for ten claims or 100 claims?  What is the pattern?  Those figures are not available.  If one rings a local authority a vague figure is given. Dublin Corporation have stated that last year 5,000 cases were decreed.  The total amount was £4 million.</P>
    <P>Why are accurate statistics not kept? Why can we not be told the number of claims last year?  With the absence of such figures I am forced to conclude that we are completely uninterested in tackling the problem.  We are not even bothering to keep accounts of the number of claims, which is easy to do because each claim is handled by the law departments of county councils and corporations.  Therefore, the Bill does not deal with matters of fundamental concern to us all and therefore the Bill should be strengthened and made more comprehensive.  I do not <Col N="555" /> want to be told that that will require another Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given statistical evidence that malicious injuries and damages have been increasing and that the Government have not been doing anything about them.  In my view, what I have been saying is relevant because the implication of the figures I have quoted has relevance in the administration of this Bill.  I have studied the Bill and I have found 13 main proposals in it.  The Minister dealt with some of them in his speech.  The minimum damage subject to a claim is to be increased from £5 to £100. I appeal to the Minister, in view of the increasing inability of the House to cope with the challenges of our society, to rid this parliamentary forum, as much as possible, of needless bureaucratic exercises of updating limits, estimates and specific figures in Bills, when this is purely to take account of inflation.  The Minister, by specifying £100 as opposed to £5, automatically creates room for further injustice. Any such figure which is not related to current values at that time, means that any two people applying for malicious damages under the Bill at any given time are being dealt with, on account of inflation, differently from each other, depending on the degree of change in real prices and real values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not possible for the Minister to include in the Bill provision whereby the <Col N="556" /> financial limits in the Bill are subject to being automatically updated by him by a ministerial order, if necessary subsequent to consultation by him with interested parties like the banking groups, the insurance groups or any economic institution, who would keep the Minister right on economic values.  If that is not done we will have a Malicious Injuries Bill 1981, another for 1982 and so on because of rampant inflation or an increase in property values.  It will then be necessary to talk about the need to adjust those figures. Anybody who gets in immediately after the Bill becomes law has the best chance of making the most out of it.  The longer it goes on the more unjust it becomes.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider that kind of thinking, which would mean that we would not have Bills or portions of Bills demanding a large amount of time and energy, basically updating due to inflation.  That is not what parliaments are for.  I believe that a formula could easily be devised to take into account typical economic indices like the Consumer Price Index and current interest rates.  The good sense of the Minister at the time, after consultation with those institutions, could decide what the figure would be.  This could be done every two years or every three years, automatically, by the Minister.  If this is not done I believe we are doing injustice because of having a figure at a given point in time, which is allowed on real terms to decrease in value over the years, causing those at the end of the chain to get less per £ than those who acted earlier on.</P>
    <P>The District Court under the Bill will be empowered to deal with complaints for compensation not exceeding £2,500. That is as a result of the extension of the jurisdiction of the courts and is to be welcomed.  I have the same plea to put to the Minister in that respect.  A sum of £2,500 could be seen to be significant next year but it is not.  Any type of damage to a car nowadays can cost that much, particularly in the manner in which those damages are assessed, with, on occasions, a cavalier approach.  In ten years' time, when this is still the figure unless another Bill is introduced, that sum will <Col N="557" /> be ridiculous.  It will mean that any type of damage to any property will have to go to another court above the District Court.</P>
    <P>A section in the Bill says that local authorities will be empowered to settle claims for payments out of court.  There is good sense in this but I have some concern about it.  The Minister said that those provisions are intended to encourage the settlement of claims for compensation before the case comes to court thus saving the time of the courts and reducing the liability of local authorities for costs. If justice is to be done here to public finances it is important that there is an incentive for ensuring holding out where such is in the public interest.  There should be some type of waiting factor which would ensure that the settlement is not too rapid in order to save time or costs.  Has the Minister considered how this will work in practice?  The real problem is not that there is a difficulty over being able to pay on account or settling prior to the courts because that can be done at any time.  The real problem is the delay involved in paying damages.  The Minister tries to deal with it in this Bill but it is genuinely a matter for another Bill.</P>
    <P>It is unjust that it should take two years or more for those damages to be paid when it is borne in mind that in many cases, as the Garda Commissioner's Report for 1978 shows, the figures are small but because of their nature, because they relate to broken windows, damage to property, damage to a home, are costs which a family, an old person or an individual incurs and are, therefore, very important to that person.  In 1978 there were 180 cases of offences against property which had less than £1 involved, there were 249 cases with £1 to £2 involved, there were 1,010 cases of between £5 and £10 involved.  Some of the sums involved are quite small.  If the situation is allowed to continue, whereby the sum involved is so small and the chances of a decree being brought against the plaintiff and the costs are significant, many people will say that it is not worth it.  How many times have people said to <Col N="558" /> us after their property was damaged what is the point, we will never get the money?</P>
    <P>Section 16 appears to be an attempt to deal with this.  It provides that local authorities against whom claims are brought will be empowered to settle the claims out of court and to lodge money in court.  I do not believe that is the only way or the best way to deal with the matter.  This intention of encouraging the settlement of claims for compensation before the claims come up should be done in a very responsible way, ensuring that it is not simply a question of giving a person half or a quarter of his or her claim for the ease of administration or, as is sometimes said in Garda circles, for clearing the books.  Perhaps the Minister should consider the possibility of surcharging in such cases but in any case there should be some inducement to the authorities involved to ensure that the highest standards of responsibility apply. This is what happens in most cases in this area.  Otherwise, people will simply be handing out money on demand to settle claims with more claims being made simply because people know that they will get something anyway.  Not only would that situation be irresponsible but it would be extremely unhelpful to the public office.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the sections which deal with the increasing of the powers of the local authorities to pay compensation without delay on foot of court awards and of empowering them to settle claims out of court will have the effect of helping people who make claims.  However, I should like to know if the Minister considers this to be the best way of dealing with the matter.  Are we setting a precedent here? There is somehow an implied inducement to people not to proceed with claims.  The kernel of the issue is the question of what is just.  Settlements out of court will inevitably be lower than settlements within court.  Otherwise, presumably, defendants would not settle.  However, if a person has suffered damage to the extent of £1,000 and if he makes a claim for that amount but is offered £300 and is told, or if it is implied, that he should settle on this because it might take years for him to get the other money, or that indeed he <Col N="559" /> might not get it at all, is there not being created an easy way out whereby malicious injuries will not be dealt with justly but will be in some way bought off?</P>
    <P>These are legitimate concerns.  I am thinking of somebody such as a widow who needs to be recompensed for damage to her home or other property.  I am satisfied with the provisions so long as the assessment and the payment of the award in any case is made under two conditions. These are, first, that payment be made as soon as is humanly possible.  That is not happening at present.  Second, following in reverse the precedent adopted by the Revenue Commissioners of imposing a percentage charge on tax outstanding, that, if people have to wait up to two years for compensation, they will be given the extra amount that would have accrued on that money at the commercial interest rate.  This is the least we might ask for after a person had been through the trauma of a case.  In these inflationary times money devalues considerably in a two-year period.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that we are tackling the real problem, which is the expedition of the hearing of claims and ensuring that they are paid immediately.  We are still accepting that local authorities will pay on account but people may not get from these local authorities what they are entitled to in terms of a judicial matter. We are not talking about some sort of negotiation on the part of skilled local authority negotiators.  We are talking about independent judicial decisions from a law department whose daily stock-in-trade this business is.  We are talking about some old woman or some harassed husband who does not have the time, the money or the expertise to negotiate on his or her own behalf and who on seeing a £100 on the table in tempted, as the Americans would say, to take the money and run, whereas their best interests might be to refuse and to pursue the case for damages in full.  These measures do not meet that point adequately.</P>
    <P>Another section deals with the removal of the defence which exists where compensation is excluded in the event of the <Col N="560" /> damage being caused by a person of unsound mind.  In this regard the Minister said that:</P>
    <P>... personal injuries inflicted by such persons are covered by the non-statutory scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted that was introduced by my predecessor in 1974.  There is no justification for the exclusion from the scope of the Bill of damage caused by persons of unsound mind or by children.  Section 7 has, accordingly, been included so as to ensure that such damage will qualify.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is satisfied that this is a good suggestion but I have some doubts about it.  In malicious injuries cases there is the very notion of malicious injury which clearly implies evidential culpability.  In other words, there is the clear implication that the person concerned has acted maliciously.  Surely a person of unsound mind or, as he might be referred to in the Gaelic, duine le Dia, cannot be guilty in that respect.  Neither can a child be guilty in such respect though for so long as the age of criminal responsibility remains as it is some children could be argued to be culpable. What I am asking is whether there is a legal contradiction and whether there might very well be a test case subsequently on the basis that it is a contradiction in terms to talk about a malicious injury being inflicted by a person of unsound mind.  While there may be injury it can hardly be regarded as malicious other than in the limited terms of that person.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider the legal wisdom of this provision.  There may be some other way round it.  Presumably the point of the proposal is to ensure compensation for the victim.  I acknowledge and respect that motive but there is very little consolation for a person to know that the damage he has suffered was due to, say, a fire having been started by a child or by a person of unsound mind.  If we are to ensure that compensation will be payable I do not think we should run into the area of the risk of the type of case that could be brought in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is provision also in another section <Col N="561" /> whereby compensation will not be payable where the necessary planning permission for the property in question had not been obtained or where the development was not in conformity with planning permission.</P>

    <P>Incentive bonus on an arterial drainage scheme is calculated on percentage bases related to the performance of individual employees, of the work gangs and of the scheme as a whole, as well as to the type of work on which employees are engaged and to the effective bonus earning hours of each individual employee.  Bonus thus varies from employee to employee and from week to week and it would, therefore, not be feasible to quote a fixed bonus rate per hour (or per week).</P>

      <P>At its meeting on 2 October 1980, the Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers agreed to submit to the Labour Court proposals which would amend the current Employment Regulation Order so as to apply the terms provided for in the National Understanding, 1980, to agricultural workers.  The proposals were published on 4 November <Col N="527" /> 1980, and the statutory 21 days were allowed for receipt of objections.  On 27 November 1980, the Committee considered the objections to the proposals and decided to submit the unamended proposals to the Labour Court for approval. It is expected that the court will consider the proposals in the near future.</P>
