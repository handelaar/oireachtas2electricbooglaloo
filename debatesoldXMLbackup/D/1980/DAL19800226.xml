      <P>asked the Taoiseach if an official of the Government Information Services contacted RTE to inquire why the news of the shelving of the proposed Taoiseach's residence in the Phoenix Park had featured on only one of the two early evening news broadcasts on the day in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case would the Taoiseach explain to the House why he would prefer to be interviewed by some members of RTE rather than by others?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the answer was in the affirmative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that this communication was carried out at the Taoiseach's request in order to bring pressure to bear on RTE?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard such an approach by the GIS as part of their normal duties.  I would regard it as surprising if a reasonably important statement by the Government was not carried in a major news bulletin.  I would regard it as a simple matter of everyday duty by the GIS or any officer in it to inquire as to why it was not.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it might be desirable for the conditions of ministerial broadcasts to be more clearly defined than they are at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to discuss that but at the moment they are included in legislation.  If there is any wish by the Opposition parties to discuss the circumstances in which ministerial broadcasts might be made I am prepared to talk with them about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I did not criticise the Taoiseach's broadcast.  It seems to me to fall within the intention of the Act but it is obviously something which is potentially open to abuse so it might be worth while looking at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is something that should not be abused by Government Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the Government's policy towards the media including RTE and Radio na Gaeltachta with specific reference to the availability of Ministers for interviews and if any pre-conditions regarding questions or interviewers are laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of ministerial availability for press, radio or television interviews is a matter for the Minister concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach confirm that he himself did not make himself available to RTE for interview on the grounds that he did not get the interviewer he wanted and because he could not vet the questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The choice of words is unfortunate.  But the public are entitled to hear the Taoiseach interviewed on television and not just in ministerial broadcasts.  Newspaper reports indicate that the Taoiseach refuses to be interviewed on television because he cannot get the interviewer he wants and because he cannot vet the questions.  The Taoiseach did not deny these reports.  Will he emphatically deny them now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make this point: when the Taoiseach or any Minister in Government, or any politician, goes on radio or television and gives an interview, or gives an interview to the press, it is entirely a matter for that person.  Indeed, the head of the Coalition Government never gave one single television or radio interview during his entire period in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is no precedent for a head of Government to state conditions as to interviewers or questions in radio or television interviews?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reasons why the inter-departmental study group on unemployment statistics decided to change the frequency of the publication of the live register statistics from a weekly to a monthly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore) Séan Moore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>In their report, published in May 1979, the inter-departmental study group on unemployment statistics gave their recommendations concerning the frequency of the publication of the basic live register statistics in the following terms:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> A number of submissions, representing a broad cross-section of interests, which were forwarded to the Study Group expressed the view that it was not necessary to have a basic Live Register publication every week; that a monthly statement would suffice and that the resources currently employed in compiling the weekly figures would be better utilised in producing other relevant information.  The Group gave detailed consideration to this question.  It is true, as far as can be determined, that no other country publishes an official weekly unemployment total.  An examination of the actual weekly totals over a long period of time shows that, in the vast majority of cases, the weekly changes are of a relatively minute order of magnitude and in many instances involve only differences of a few hundred, very often much less.  The Study Group concluded that, on balance, it is not necessary to publish a basic Live Register total every week and that, like all other countries, the compilation of a monthly aggregate is sufficient for general economic and social purposes.</P>
    <P>The recommendation in question was implemented from January of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard generally to the compiling of unemployment statistics, will the Minister of State tell the House whether the Statistics Office has ever considered analysing the figures in a given district or in a selection of districts in order to track every individual to see who has lost a job and why, who has got a job and where and the reasons why a person has not been successful in getting employment?  Until that is done we will never be sure about these figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State tell us if that has ever been considered?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State not agree that when the National Coalition were in office it was always alleged that the register understated unemployment but now we are getting the suggestion from the Fianna Fáil benches that the figures overstate unemployment?  If we are to believe some Ministers, we have full employment now. Until a study is done, district by district, we will never know the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government consider that the Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan is unacceptable.  It is a breach of the generally recognised principles of respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all states and a massive use of military power by a super power against a neighbouring country, a member of the non-aligned movement.</P>
      <P>The concern of the Government at this military intervention by the Soviet Union was expressed to the Chargé d'Affairs of the Soviet Union in Dublin at the Department of Foreign Affairs on 4 January last on my instructions.</P>
      <P>Since that date Ireland has joined with the other member states of the Nine in a series of statements and other measures which give expression to our common concern at the Soviet military intervention and the dangers which we feel it poses to international peace and security and to the policies of detente and relaxation of tensions to which the remain committed.</P>
      <P>On 14 January 1980 Ireland voted for a resolution on Afghanistan adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its sixth emergency session.  This resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority&mdash;104 in favour to 18 against with 18 abstentions.</P>
      <P>The resolution appealed to all States: to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and non-aligned character of Afghanistan and to refrain from any interference in the internal affairs of that country.</P>
      <P>Ireland strongly supports the provisions of this resolution.  In particular we support its call for:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the immediate unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan in order to enable its people to determine their own form of government and choose their economic, political and social <Col N="417" /> systems, free from outside intervention, subversion or coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Brussels on 15 January last the Foreign Ministers of the Nine, including Ireland, issued a statement expressing their grave concern at the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan as a serious violation of the principles of international relations enshrined in the Charter.  On the same occasion the Council of Ministers decided that action should be taken to ensure that Community products do not substitute for grain sales cut off by the United States.</P>
    <P>At our meeting in Rome on 19 February, which I attended, the Foreign Ministers of the Nine again discussed the Afghanistan crisis.  On that occasion we were agreed in proposing what I believe would be a very constructive outcome of the crisis&mdash;an arrangement which would accord Afghanistan a neutral status.</P>
    <P>A proposal in these terms was launched by the Italian Foreign Minister as President in Office on behalf of the Nine at his press conference following that meeting and we are hopeful that it will be taken up as a helpful initiative on our part.  Our hope would be in the coming weeks to have this idea studied further and to concert our position with other countries with a view to seeing whether it can be implemented and if so how that aim might best be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In event of failure on the part of the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops in accordance with the United Nations resolution and also in the event of a rebuff being received from the Soviet Union in regard to the neutralisation proposal from the EEC&mdash;which appears likely taking into account their initial response&mdash;has the Minister, from the point of view of this country on its own or from the point of view of any proposal he might make to the EEC, any further suggestions regarding the application of pressure on the Soviet Union to get out of Afghanistan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As it stands, the matter has been put up to the Soviet Union.  The issue lies with them to show their bona fides in the matter and approach and that of our partners in the Community and also of the world at large waits on the demonstration of bona fides on the part of the Soviet Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Soviet Union did not show much bona fides when it marched into Afghanistan.  Is this policy of waiting for total rejection not a very negative one?  The question I asked the Minister was whether he had any further proposals in regard to any action that might be taken by this country on its own, bearing in mind that we are a small country, or if there were any proposals to our EEC partners to bring further pressure to bear on the Soviet Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At our January meeting it was decided unanimously by the nine countries that in our dealings with the Soviet Union we would not substitute for any embargo imposed by the United States on supplies from that country to the Soviet Union.  That principle came into immediate effect particularly with regard to grain supplies which were suspended by the United States and which the Community are not filling. That is the principle on which we are working in concert with the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>But not there.  Does the Minister not agree that, having made our protest in company with other countries, the important thing from our point of view since we have a vested interest in the continuation of <i>détente</i> is that we should do all in our power to prevent any lapse into a cold war atmosphere between countries and that we should use our influence to see that this does not <Col N="419" /> happen?  By all means let us make our protest in an attempt to get the Soviet Union to see reason in the matter but, at the same time, we should avoid the kind of cold war hysteria engulfing the countries making the protests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what the Deputy has said has been uppermost in the minds of the countries of the Community with regard to the preservation of <i>détente</i> as a matter of fundamental importance.  That governs our approach to this whole matter, both as a country and as a Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking this supplementary question arising out of an earlier question I put to the Minister and to which he did not give me a reply.  I shall summarise it again.  Apart from the steps that were taken in the past, the condemnation, the calling in of the Chargé d'Affaires, the United Nation resolution and the agreement not to fill the shortfall created by the American grain embargo, has the Minister, either on his own initiative on behalf of this country or through the EEC, any further proposal to make for further pressure to be brought to bear on the Soviet Union in the event of their failure to withdraw from Afghanistan or to accept the neutralisation proposals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only last week in Rome we took a positive initiative to fill a political vacuum as a community by proposing the neutralisation of Afghanistan.

      <P>Is the implication that countries such as the UK who are critical of the proposal to continue supplying butter to the Soviet Union from the Community's stocks any indication that any of these countries are thinking of cutting back on credits for equipment which would be of value to the Soviet Union in modernising their economy? Are they proposing to continue to provide these credits and to continue to get the benefits of trade without taking any action in that area while criticising the supply of butter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The communique issued after my discussions with the Foreign Minister of Bahrein on 10 February states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two sides stressed that all parties, including the PLO, should play a <Col N="425" /> full role in the negotiations for a comprehensive peace settlement.  In this regard, Ireland recognises the role of the PLO in representing the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>Copies of the communique have been placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>Government policy towards the Middle East is based on our conviction that it is necessary that there should be a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement to the problems of the region.  We believe that such a settlement must be based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, applied in all their parts and on all fronts and also on the principles set out by the nine EEC countries on several occasions in recent years.</P>
    <P>These principles are as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force</P>
    <P>(ii)  the need for Israel to end the territorial occupation which it has maintained since the conflict of 1967</P>
    <P>(iii)  respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries</P>
    <P>(iv)  recognition that in the establishment of a just and lasting peace account must be taken of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that our policy remains firmly based on these principles, which must be taken as a whole.  We believe that they should be accepted by all parties as the basis for a negotiated settlement.  What was stated in the Bahrein communique was simply a logical development of this position, expanding but not supplanting it.</P>
    <P>In particular, we expressed the view that the legitimate rights of the Palestinians include their right to self-determination of their right, should they wish to exercise it, to an independent state.  This would, of course, be within the framework of a negotiated <Col N="426" /> settlement in which all parties, naturally including Israel, would participate fully. These rights of the Palestinians are therefore not unqualified; there is a conflict of rights in the present situation which must be reconciled in the context of a negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>If a comprehensive settlement is to be worked out, it is clear that all concerned must participate in the negotiation.  This includes the Palestinians.  It is our view that the Palestinians should have the right to decide for themselves those who will represent them in such negotiations. In this regard the Palestine Liberation Organisation appears to enjoy the support of a very substantial proportion of Palestinians, both among the refugees and in the occupied territories.  It is also accepted by the Arab states as the legitimate spokesman of the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>We recognise therefore that the PLO is indeed an important element and should have a role to play.  That is why we stated in the Bahrein communique that we recognise the role of the PLO in representing the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the Irish Government totally condemn all acts of violence from whatever source they may emanate and consider that such acts are an obstacle to the effort to negotiate a peace settlement which would meet the legitimate rights of all parties.  In the contacts we have had with the PLO, we have used every opportunity to express this point of view and to impress upon them also the necessity of accepting the existence of the State of Israel.  In this regard, we have received assurances from the PLO that they maintain no links with the IRA.  Likewise we have made use of our regular meetings with representatives of the Israeli Government to impress upon them to need to negotiate with the representatives of the Palestinian people and to recognise their legitimate rights.</P>
    <P>What is now required in our view is that the willingness to abandon violence in favour of political means which has characterised many groupings and leaders within the PLO should be encouraged; and we would hope that it <Col N="427" /> might be possible through a process of gradual acceptance on both sides for Isreal and the PLO each to acknowledge a role for the other in the negotiation of a settlement.  We believe that this would contribute immeasurably towards the achievement of a peaceful and comprehensive solution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of Jerusalem, the Government recognise the central importance of this issue and the importance of the city itself as a Holy City to three great religions&mdash;&mdash; Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  We are aware of the various claims made to Jerusalem and we certainly have no wish to see a city which is an important centre of religious faith for many peoples divided between them in a way which promotes confrontation.</P>
    <P>We believe, therefore, that a special effort will have to be made as part of any negotiation&mdash;whether at the outset, during the negotiation or at the end&mdash;to negotiate an acceptable status for Jerusalem.  In our view this should at a minimum allow all parties access to the places which they consider holy.</P>
    <P>We cannot accept, however, pending this settlement, that unilateral efforts should be made to change the status of Jerusalem or to annex it following occupation.  This was made clear in Minister O'Kennedy's speech on behalf of the Nine to the United Nations on 25 September last.  We look instead to a settlement of the Jerusalem issue which might perhaps be on the basis of an open city and which could make it a symbol of peace in a region which is now one of conflict and confrontation.</P>

      <P>I am not here to comment on what the PLO say or do not say, nor was it in any of the questions.  I am concerned with the realities of the situation and I was very heartened to see in a recent statement by the British Chief Rabbi which was reported in the <i>Jerusalem Post</i> of 13 February last, that he did not rule out the possibility of a Palestinian State on the West Bank in the Gaza Strip and that he would even allow such a state to have its capital in Jerusalem.  That view has also been expressed by all of our EEC partners in the last number of years and it is a consistent attitude adopted by the great majority of states represented at the UN.  It is also the view of the Fine Gael Party as expressed here by Deputies Mitchell and O'Keeffe and by Senator Staunton, and followed by Deputy FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I do not understand why Deputy Cluskey insists on being out on a limb in this matter.</P>

      <P>I am very glad Deputy O'Keeffe raised this point because the whole position has already been stated by other member countries of the EEC. My statement in regard to self-determination is an amplification of what my predecessor said as President of the EEC.  The Foreign Minister of Belgium, Mr. Simonet, has stated that it is up to the Palestinians themselves to decide upon the actual manner in which they wish to express their national identity. With the parties concerned they will decide whether they prefer a status of autonomy or an independent state, a <Col N="432" /> federal framework or a confederate one; it is open to negotiation.</P>
      <P>Mr. Forlani, the Italian Foreign Minister, has called for concrete recognition of the legitimate right of the people, who cannot be denied a fatherland, to express their own national identity through the constitution of a state entity. He has also stated the wish to afford recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people, aiming at the establishment of their own state, national rights which must be translated into facts.  The Foreign Minister of France, M. de Guiringand, has stated that the right of the Palestinian people to express their national identity cannot be exercised without a territorial base which, at the proper time, could be given the structures of statehood.  Mr. Genscher, Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, has said that a peace settlement should make allowance for the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, including the right to establish a state authority.</P>

Is the Minister aware&mdash;it would not appear from the words he used that he is so aware&mdash;that my only contacts with the PLO as Minister were informally at two receptions and that I used these contacts to seek formal repudiation of alleged statements by PLO spokesmen in support of the Provisional IRA, for example at the Habitat conference in Vancouver, and the public recognition by them of the existence of this State and public rejection of any aid to terrorists in this island? Before proceeding to what has been loosely described as recognition of the PLO, off which hook he is now trying to get, did the Minister secure such public statements as I was seeking to secure?</P>

      <P>In a very detailed discussion with a prominent person in the PLO in 1974, the record of which he himself signed, Deputy FitzGerald committed himself to the Palestinian case, subject to the matters he is now speaking about.  There is no evidence of any association whatever between the PLO <Col N="436" /> as at present constituted and the IRA. That is absolutely clear.  I agree that Deputy FitzGerald was at pains to seek these assurances in 1974.  The assurances have been given since to Deputy O'Keeffe and to officials of my Department and our ambassadors in that region have investigated the matter. We are absolutely satisfied that there is no connection whatever between the PLO as at present constituted and the IRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of Council of Europe cultural identity cards issued by my Department in 1979 was 311. This figure does not include the number of cards renewed, which was 66.  I am reasonably satisfied with the number issued and renewed bearing in mind the limited categories of persons eligible to receive the cards.</P>
      <P>My Department have from time to time brought the benefits of the card to the attention of the various educational and cultural bodies likely to be interested.  In order to make the card more easily available we are currently examining the practicability of having it issued by other organisations.</P>
      <P>I am arranging to have specimen cards and copies of the regulations governing the issue of cards and of the facilities granted to holders laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the figure he has quoted is ridiculously low in view of the fact that for the first six months of 1979 a total of 6,900 such cards were issued by the Council of Europe and that generally in the United Kingdom 2,000 cards were issued per year?</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for the constructive spirit of his question and I should like to tell him that I shall pursue the matter along the lines suggested by him.  I agree that the figure is too low and that it makes sense to allow other cultural and educational organisations, as well as my Department, to issue such cards.  We will examine that matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Subsection (6), to which the Minister resisted an amendment of mine to spell out whether the premises should be insured for their market value or for their re-instatement value, reads:</P>
      <P>If the Court fixes the convenants of the lease, the lessee shall be made liable to pay all rates and taxes in respect of the land and to insure against fire and keep premises in repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Thursday last I have been checking up on this matter and I am told by practitioners that the question of whether a premises should be insured for their market value or for their re-instatement value gives rise to considerable argument between landlord and tenant and that it is one of these convenants that is found very difficult to <Col N="477" /> agree on.  The Minister, even at this late stage, should think again about this question so that the matter, if possible, can be put beyond doubt.  Naturally, it is not my intention to endeavour to reargue the amendment but what I proposed was that premises should be insured against loss or damage as a result of fire either at their market value or at their re-instatement value, at the option of the landlord.  Such provision would remove much of the uncertainty and of the argument.  That is why I am asking the Minister to think again about my proposal between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is the section which provides the machinery for fixing the rent reserved by a reversionary lease.  In blunt language, it is the section which fixes the new ground rents.  It contains the machinery for fixing a new ground rent where the old lease has expired. Consequently, it would seem to perpetuate ground rents and to render it possible to increase ground rents very substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the basis for determination of the rent is unsatisfactory and that the provisions of subsection (2) may be difficult to interpret.  The fraction of the one-eighth of the gross rent has remained constant since 1967 and could result in a very substantial rent where the letting value of buildings is taken into consideration.  Perhaps we could spend a short time spelling out the sort of lease with which we are dealing.  If a lease is granted for 50 years or for 99 years on a <Col N="478" /> plot of land and is subject to a convenant that the lessee will build a premises on it in accordance with plans and specifications and of a certain value, that is what we know as a building lease.  The rent reserved in that lease is what is commonly called a ground rent.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here is creating the machinery for fixing the rent of that plot of land when the lease expires.  We are saying that although the plot of land was leased as virgin land, with an obligation on the tenant to build a dwelling on it, when we come to fix the rent we will say that the ground rent may be increased from, say, £10 to £100.  In the city of Dublin this figure could very easily be increased from £10 to £200 because £1,600 a year would be little enough for the letting value of many premises and I am sure these figures could be increased even further; it could even be doubled. What we are doing here is conferring on the court the right to fix new ground rents very much higher than those which exist at present.</P>
    <P>This has not been a political debate so far because we are dealing with technical matters, but I am bound to draw the attention of the House and the people to the fact that the Minister solemnly undertook in the 1977 election manifesto introduced by Fianna Fáil to provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents. In this section he is putting through the Oireachtas a section which will have the direct opposite effect, that will perpetuate and very substantially increase ground rents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leydon is on record in the early days of the life of this Dáil as referring to the Fianna Fáil manifesto as an historic document.  He was much more accurate than he realised at the time, and it is becoming more historic every day.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): No, it was a 14-point plan. Section 35 will determine the rent to be charged for a new reversionary lease which in effect is a ground rent lease. The formula set out in this section is that the rent to be reserved by the reversionary lease, the terms of which are settled by the court, shall be one-eighth of the gross rent, that is, the gross rent of the plot of land, plus the building erected by the lessee at his own expense and without any expense to the landlord, 99 years earlier.  In order to find the rent to be reserved valuers will go into a residential house in this city or in any place in Ireland, value the premises, including the plot of land and the dwelling house which has been built by the tenant or his predecessors at his own expense, but the important thing is that it is without any expense to the landlord, and which has been maintained throughout the term of the lease by the lessee at his own expense.  If the valuer decides that the rent would be £800 a year, then the new rent will be £100, notwithstanding the fact that the original ground rent was probably £5 or £10.</P>
      <P>It would be a very modest house in this city the rent of which would be put at £800.  It would not be a very exciting house if the rent was put at £1,600 a year.  Modest one-bedroomed flats are being valued at almost £200 a month at present.  Therefore, a three or four bedroomed house on a nice plot of land could be valued at £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 a year.  We are fixing the ground rent at one-eight.  I fear that in drafting this legislation the Minister overlooked the undertaking he gave in the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the last general election to introduce a scheme that would lead to the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have a long complicated <Col N="480" /> argument on how far he has gone with the machinery he introduced&mdash;and I do not believe that it has been availed of to any great extent&mdash;but that is another day's work.  Even if the Minister argues that that machinery has been availed of and has wound its way through the Land Registry and other Government agencies, he is going in the opposite direction here.  Instead of increasing this divider of eight which has been in operation since 1967, he should be raising it to 12 or 20, or any figure that would keep the ground rents low, and only having regard to the land which is included in the lease and which would disregard the buildings.  It is unfair to include the letting value of the buildings with the land in fixing a gross rent.  It is a complete right-about turn on the manifesto promises.  It is an indication that the promise in regard to ground rents was never taken seriously as a promise that the Government felt obliged to implement.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on my remarks to date.  How can he justify including the letting value of buildings, which were put there by the tenant at no expense to the landlord in the rent to be charged to the leasee on the renewal of the lease?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the political obligations of Deputy Fitzpatrick about the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  The Deputy was sufficiently gracious to say that we have had a lot of debate on the contents of the manifesto, particularly in regard to ground rents, during discussions on a number of Bills on this subject.  I believe sincerely that my efforts in this area have been outstandingly successful.  Indeed I know they have been successful, and those not involved in either promoting or decrying the manifesto should know that the solemn promise which I gave to provide a scheme for the buying out of ground rents is working successfully.  There have been tens of thousands of inquiries to date, thousands of vesting certificates have been issued and a number of applications are in hand at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> I will give the figures: the number of inquiries received to date has been 19,582; applications for vesting certificates, 5,662; and the number of vesting certificates issued, 3,912.  That is positive proof that those who were meant to benefit from ground rent legislation are benefiting.  I ask the House to take every opportunity to encourage the use of the scheme.  Efforts have been made by others outside the House to decry the scheme.</P>
    <P>On the section before us, it represents the re-enactment, with drafting changes and one change of substance in subsection (1) and (2), of the provisions of section 18 (4) of the 1958 Act and section 26 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act, which amended and extended the provisions of section 18 (4) of the 1958 Act.  Subsection (1) of this section represents in part the re-enactment, with drafting changes, of section 18 (4) of the 1958 Act as amended by the 1967 Act.  The subsection also includes a new provision concerning the rent to be reserved in a reversionary lease.  Under the new provision conthat rent will be not one-eight of the gross rent but one-eight of the gross rent reduced by the special allowance for the tenant's improvements defined in subsection (2).</P>
    <P>This new provision taken in conjunction with subsection (2) is designed to bring the law concerning the amount of the rent and the renewal of the ground rent lease into line with the law concerning the rent on the renewal of an occupational tenancy in that improvements carried out by the tenant will be taken into account, which means that any increased letting value is attributable to the tenant's improvements and that increased value will not be reckoned in the rent fixed on renewal of the lease.  Subsection (2) defines the special allowance for the purpose of the new provisions in the previous subsection.  The allowance covers increased letting value attributable to works of construction, reconstruction and alteration carried out by the lessee or his predecessors.  It does not include repairs and maintenance. <Col N="482" /> Any work carried out in consideration or part consideration for the grant of the lease is also excluded.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's comments on the residential ground rent, although residential ground rent tenants can now buy out very easily, this is hardly a reason for taking away an existing right, that is, the right in the alternative to a reversionary lease.  The renewal right could remain important to nonresidential ground rent tenants who for any reason do not want to buy out.  New ground rents under reversionary leases are a minor consideration because a tenant can already buy out under his existing lease.  If he does not buy out before hand, the renewal rent will be one-eighth of the gross rent, a fraction which has stood since 1967.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is about ground rents and reversionary leases.  ACRA find themselves in a difficult position.  Believing the manifesto was a bona fide document, they advised thousands of their members to vote for Fianna Fáil on the understanding that ground rents would be abolished.  Now they find that ground rents are not only not being abolished but are being perpetuated.  They are in an awkward position and they must campaign for the protection of their members and the implementation of the promises. The Minister has told us that the new rent is to be one-eighth of the gross rent reduced.  He then read subsection (2) and I think he felt like stopping half way through it because it states:</P>
      <P>The special allowance for the purpose of subsection (1) shall be such proportion of the gross rent as, in the opinion of the Court, is attributable to works of construction, reconstruction or alteration carried out by the lessee or any of his predecessors in title which add to the letting value of the land as compared with its letting value when it was last in the possession of the lessor or any of his predecessors in title, other than works carried out wholly or partly in consideration of the grant of a lease or repairs and maintenance during the currency of the lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the house he built and repairs carried out to it in accordance with the lease will be valued and all that will be excluded will be something like a greenhouse put up with the consent of the landlord or extra rooms added with his consent.  That will not be charged against him but the original house he built under the building convenant in the lease will be charged.  If under the building convenant he built a three-bedroomed house with two reception, kitchen and loft the rent will be based on the grounds plus his three-bedroomed <Col N="484" /> house and the better the repair he kept it in during the term of the lease the more he will have to pay.  That is unfair.</P>
    <P>The Minister points to subsection (3) (a) which states that another fraction may be included instead of one-eighth, but in putting one-eighth into the section the Minister is showing his own thinking. As of now he is saying that he thinks that the fair rent for a plot of ground is one-eighth of the letting value of the ground plus the letting value of the house which did not cost the landlord a brass farthing.  That is the strangest way of introducing a scheme to lead to the abolition of existing ground rents that I have ever heard of.  It is nothing more than perpetuating them.  It shows the Minister is in bad faith if he has studied the measure and understands it as I presume he does.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us by way of argument in favour of this formula for fixing the new rent that the fraction of one-eighth has existed since 1967.  With all respect that is an excellent argument against it.  Since then we have had considerable inflation and, above all, the 1977 manifesto which pledge the Government and the Minister to introduce a scheme to lead to the abolition of ground rents.  Taking that promise at its very weakest it meant the Government were going to discourage ground rents but if one had said before the last election that a promise to abolish ground rents meant a promise only to discourage them one would have been accused of completely misrepresenting that goody in the manifesto.  One would expect the Minister to lean heavily against ground rents but we find him supporting them because there is the same formula for fixing ground rents in 1980 as was written in by his predecessor in 1967. That is going back on the promise given by the Minister and by the Government. A fraction of one-twentieth would be more realistic.  The premises should be completely disregarded.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister saying that section 35 (2) in some way introduces a more favourable formula than was there before.  It includes the letting <Col N="485" /> value of the house which was built by the tenant under the convenant in the lease and the repairs which were carried out to it in accordance with the lease.  All it does not include are some extras over and above the original house which are carried out subsequently.  Why does the Minister plant back in a fraction of one-eighth which was fixed as far back as 1967 and perhaps earlier?  There has been a similar fraction since 1931.  Did the Minister realise the implications of the section when he introduced the legislation?  Did he realise that it was in strange conflict with the philosophy enunciated in the manifesto which was to introduce a scheme to lead to abolition of ground rents?  The man in the street believed that meant that all ground rents would be abolished free of charge.  I know the Minister protests loudly that that was not what he meant but he did not say anything else.  He said he would abolish ground rents and a person learned or unlearned in law, could be excused for thinking that was what he meant.</P>
    <P>There is this very strange contrast which is a departure from the policy the Minister professes, which was written into the manifesto and shouted from the rooftops, and from ACRA's understanding of it they in good faith urged their members to support Fianna Fáil and see the end of ground rents once and for all.  Less than three years later the Minister brings in a Bill which contains this section.  I suppose he will tell me that it was in the Bill before he got it but he is peddling it through the House after he undertook to introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents.  This is intolerable and inexcusable.  I shall deal further with it on the next stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Fitzpatrick began on this section he prefaced his remarks by saying that up to now he kept the political side of this problem out of the debate.  I thank him for that.  As I said a few minutes ago I do not deny him the right to score what <Col N="486" /> political points he can, whenever he can. That is his responsibility and it is obligatory for him to do so.</P>
      <P>I also have an obligation to endeavour to defend myself.  Sometimes it is not easy, particularly when Deputy Fitzpatrick takes it upon himself to tell me what is meant by what was in our election manifesto, when he endeavours to take away from me arguments I would use to rebut the charges made.  I want to say quite categorically, for the umpteenth time, in answer to the same charge that has been made for the umpteenth time, that there never was a promise given by anybody in this party to the effect that ground rents were going to be wiped out, full stop.  That promise was never given; never given by anybody in this party.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to say that the letter which I sent to the ACRA people prior to the election contains what I am denying, then Deputy Fitzpatrick is very wrong.  Honestly I believe that he knows that also.  But, fair enough, he is at present in the point-scoring business.</P>
      <P>I want to say also that there was no question of anybody misleading ACRA. What was in the letter was fully discussed with ACRA at that time and was fully understood by them.  Indeed not alone at that time but also during the course of discussions in this House of the legislation I introduced within six months of our coming into office statements were made by people with whom I had had discussions during the preparation of the letter leading up to what was contained in the manifesto concerning ground rents, statements by people involved in ACRA that even a request was never made by them that existing ground rents should be wiped out.  There never was.  That is there in black and white.  All I can do is confirm that for the umpteenth time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, for political purposes, I know that it does not suit Deputy Fitzpatrick to believe that that is so.  I can say quite honestly that there was a clear, firm and definite understanding between myself and those people from ACRA with whom I had discussions on <Col N="487" /> this subject.  Even members of the Deputy's party, and probably himself also will remember that during the course of the discussion on the first and second Ground Rents Bills I introduced in this House there were statements made by ACRA representatives to the effect that I had implemented or had done what I said I would do.  I have heard about the other ACRA campaign brewing.  Indeed I understand that certain members prefer to do their business outside certain political parties very much behind the scenes, whipping it up, and good luck to them; I do not mind that.</P>
    <P>I can quite honestly say that the scheme I introduced is proving to be tremendously successful.  At present there are on hand applications to the tune of 560 for vesting certificates; out of 4,000, 3,912 have been issued and there are on hand something of the order of 19,500 inquiries.  That constitutes a success in itself, and that was within only 18 months despite the fact that certain elements, some political, some in the ACRA organisation, have been urging their members not to avail of this scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion by Deputy Fitzpatrick that the fraction should be extended to one-twentieth, at present it is one-eighth and has been since 1967.  Up to 1958 the fraction was a quarter, which was extended to one-sixth in 1958 and stood at one-sixth from 1958 to 1967.  It stands at present at one-eighth and I do not propose to do anything about it at the moment.  If somebody is afraid that a renewal rent will be too high under a reversionary lease, there is nothing to prevent that person from buying out.</P>
    <P>I am doing my utmost to resist the temptation to get into a sort of Second Stage debate on what was or was not said, who said what, when, where and why.  That danger exists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Exactly, even 1977 and 1978.  The undertaking the Minister gave was to abolish ground rents.  Anybody would understand that as action coming from somebody other than the tenant. Abolition is something that takes places from outside.  If the Minister had meant to tell tenants that he would introduce a scheme&mdash;such as he did in fact introduce &mdash;he would have told them, &ldquo;I will make it easier, or cheaper for you to purchase your ground rents.&rdquo;  That would have been the honest thing to do, just as it might have been more honest only to derate modest houses instead of mansions, but then that would have been more complicated.  What the Minister should have told tenants was, &ldquo;I will make it simpler and cheaper for you to buy out your ground rents.&rdquo;  There would have been no votes whatever in that.  That would have been fired back in the Minister's face and he would have <Col N="489" /> been told to get lost.  But, of course, the Minister is a good politician and he said, &ldquo;We will introduce a scheme that will lead to the abolition of ground rents.&rdquo; Even had he said that he would introduce a scheme leading to an end to ground rents it might not have been confusing.  But to say that the scheme would lead to the abolition of ground rents was very misleading, to use the most polite words I can think about it.</P>
      <P>ACRA are in a rage at present.  They are on the warpath again.  They feel they have been let down, misled and conned.  I can well understand their mood.  But the further this debate continues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The further this debate progresses the more difficult it becomes to understand the Minister's approach to this matter.  We know now&mdash;out of the Minister's own mouth&mdash;that each time this formula was considered before, with the exception of this time, the fraction was increased.  It was increased from a quarter to a sixth in 1958 and then to an eighth.  This is the first occasion on which a Bill of this type has been introduced in which a fraction of 13 years standing is allowed remain at one-eighth&mdash;from 1967 to 1980, 13 years.  It was originally, we know now from the Minister, one-fourth, and on the first revision became one-sixth.  Then it was one-eighth and now the Minister&mdash; notwithstanding the manifesto and notwithstanding his undertaking to encourage the abolition of ground rents&mdash;says that the fraction settled in 1967 of one-eighth is good enough for now and that he is going to leave it so. Did he think about this?  Did the <Col N="490" /> Government think about it?  I honestly do not think they did.

      <P>Obviously, as the years went on, thinking was against ground rents.  If it was not, why was the fraction raised from one-fourth&mdash;the probable figure in 1931?

There times since 1931, the fraction has been raised and the Minister will not raise it now&mdash;the same Minister who peddled the policy of getting rid of ground rents&mdash;the policy, even according to him, of introducing a scheme to lead to the abolition of ground rents but who sold the promise that he would abolish ground rents.  These are the facts.  It is no use endlessly repeating the matter.  We have dealt sufficiently with it at this stage to get an amendment in on Report Stage, and in an amendment will go.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Now I can say that this worsens the position considerably.  As I pointed out on section 23 (5), we are taking away the safeguard written into section 23 which provided that the court must assume that there is a sufficient number of similar houses to meet the demand&mdash;in other words, that there is no scarcity.  That safeguard has now been removed from section 23 and the rent there can now be fixed on what I call a scarce commodity basis.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I know that the Minister has said that he will look into that situation.  We are now fixing the rent on <Col N="492" /> residential houses, not building leases. We are now fixing reversionary leases, which are essentially leases on ground rent, but they are becoming residential leases now because we are taking into consideration the letting value of the house as well as the land.  As this legislation stood down the years, the court was obliged to assume that the supply of similar land was sufficient to meet the demand and that the competition for it was normal.  Even if there was not enough land to meet the demand and even if there was abnormal competition for it, the court was bound to assume the contrary.  By accepting the Minister's amendment, we are reversing that and saying that the court may fix&mdash;in fact, must fix&mdash;the value of the land on a scarce commodity basis.  We hear a lot of talk about the Kenny Report.  We blame Fianna Fáil for not acting on it; Fianna Fáil blame us for not acting on it. It has not been acted upon.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is the position.  This, again, is going against the theme in the Kenny Report.  It is directing the court to fix the letting value of land on a scarce commodity basis.  The Minister's eyebrows went up when I referred to it as a black market basis.  That is the worst of having practised throughout the last war, when we were familiar with the black market.  A scarce commodity basis is a nicer phrase.  We are here directing the court to fix the letting value of this land on a scarce commodity basis and on a basis that there is abnormal competition for it.  It is a wrong move and a retrograde step that we should encourage scarce commodity prices for things as precious as building land.  It would be open, at present, for an auctioneer to tell the court that he sold, in Cavan town, a building site the other day for £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000 and the court, with this phrase deleted, would be obliged to have regard to that.  There is no letting to be made now.  The Minister did prevent that from happening. <Col N="493" /> It would not be done at present, but they are being sold and the auctioneer will not be very long capitalising on that, working out a rent on the basis of a capital of £10,000 for a site.  That is what we are telling him to do if we do not change that amendment, notwithstanding the views of the learned Mr. Justice Kenny.  I used to think this phraseology was difficult to follow but, as I said the last day, whatever else it means or does not mean, it means that the court could not take into account a scarce commodity basis or abnormal competition.  This is now being reversed.</P>
      <P>I want to do the Minister the credit of thinking that if he had understood the implications of these amendments he would not have moved them.  Sometimes it is only in discussion on Committee Stage, and very often, on one's feet, that one sees what is involved and that it becomes clear.  If the Minister is to have any credibility at all with ACRA or anybody else on the manifesto promise, he had better change the fraction and put in words which would say that in no way must the court be obliged to fix the ground rent&mdash;because that is what we are doing&mdash;on the basis of a scarce commodity and abnormal competition.</P>

      <P>In page 23, to delete lines 1 to 12 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  in every case&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a statement of the works proposed for making the improvement, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  an estimate, verified by an architect, surveyor or building contractor, of the cost of making the improvement, and</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> Under the corresponding 1931 Act provision in section 12 (1) of that Act, plans and a specification must accompany every improvement notice.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission recommended that this requirement should be continued in cases where planning permission is not required for the improvement.  In their recommendation concerning cases where planning approval has been obtained the commission do not mention the requirement concerning plans and a specification. Their recommendation concerning planning approval cases is that the tenant should serve, together with his improvement notice, a copy of the relevant planning approval together with, of course, the estimate of cost that must in every case be furnished.  Section 48 (1) in the Bill as it stands proposes therefore that, where planning permission is required for the improvement, the tenant should serve simply a copy of the planning permission and an estimate of cost together with his improvement notice.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 108 (2) of their first report the Commission make it clear that in their view, the copy of the planning approval that is served on the landlord should be accompanied by a copy of the estimates and plans that were submitted in order to obtain that planning approval.</P>
    <P>The need to make this kind of provision has since been confirmed, inasmuch as that it has been ascertained that a copy of a planning permission would not normally include details such as plans or a complete statement of the works.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in section 48 (2) of the Bill a landlord has only one month in which to respond to an improvement notice, for example, be serving on the tenant within that month an improvement undertaking in which the landlord would himself undertake to do the work in return for an increase in rent.  Accordingly, it is only reasonable that the improvement notice should show the landlord exactly what works are proposed&mdash;which is what the Landlord and Tenant Commission have actually recommended.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This section deals with work that is required by a sanitary authority to be done under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts 1878-1964, or by a housing authority under the Housing Act, 1966.  I notice&mdash;this appears to be new&mdash;that where a notice is served on the tenant he has only three days in which to serve on the landlord a notice in writing as required in section 44 (1).  Section 49 (2) says that where a work notice is served on the landlord he may within three days serve on the tenant a notice in the prescribed form undertaking to execute the work.  What strikes me about those time limits is that they are very short.  I fully appreciate that notices under the Sanitary Acts could be urgent and the work required to be done in a hurry but apparently if the tenant serves a notice on the landlord he must serve it, if he is going to do so at all, within three days of getting the notice.  The landlord then has three days to serve another notice and if he does not do so within three days the tenant can go ahead and do the work himself and presumably charge it to the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either the landlord or the tenant could be elderly people as very often happens. Many landlords are elderly and living on rents from houses, for instance, a widow who has got the house under the husband's will and so on.  Also, very often not very good relations exist between landlord and tenant.  Differences about repairs and one thing or another can lead to a breakdown in communication and result in bad will.  In such a case the tenant could serve the notice and if there was no response from the landlord within three days the tenant could go ahead and get the most expensive contractor to do the work and present the <Col N="497" /> landlord with a huge bill.  That needs consideration.</P>

I appreciate what the Deputy says regarding what appears to be a very short time of three days but those three days have been there since the 1931 Act. Probably both parties know very well what is involved, what the dispute may be about, before any of them would involve the public authority and they would know the consequences of such actions, so that there might not be the apparent urgency or great need to extend that three-day period.  I believe, and the parties might agree with me, that when it comes to that stage both of them are very much on guard, probably knowing well what is involved and what the consequences are.  It could be a very serious matter if we extend the period to five, seven or nine days; you might make things much more difficult.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment that is designed to remove a possible doubt as to the effect of subsection (3).  It is possible that an improvement that is initiated by one person as tenant may be completed by another person as tenant.  The second person will then be the person applying for an improvement certificate.  In <Col N="498" /> such a case a doubt may arise as to whether the improvement certificate is obtainable since the improvement could have been executed in part by a previous tenant.  The deletion that is proposed in the amendment removes this doubt.</P>
    <P>The improvement certificate will cover any improvement that has been fully executed and completed by the tenant. Since &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;the person for the time being entitled to the occupation of a tenement...&rdquo; the amendment means that an improvement certificate will be obtainable wherever improvements have been carried out in compliance with the procedure as to notice that is provided in Part IV of the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This section is related to <Col N="499" /> section 4 because this is the section that provides that where a landlord in ordinary circumstances is obliged to grant a new lease, he is excused from granting a new lease because he wants to redevelop his property, because he wants to pull down his property and rebuild it or because he wants the property to operate a scheme of development.  He is excused from granting the lessee a new lease but he is obliged to compensate the lessee for disturbance and for the loss or damage he may sustain by being refused a new lease.  I argued fairly strongly that, if this State were to claim for itself the right to refuse to grant a new lease because it required the property for State purposes, then the State should be obliged to pay compensation.  If the State were ordered to pay compensation this section would need to be amended to provide for payment of compensation.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that this is the section in which the machinery should be provided for payment of compensation to a tenant of the State who is refused a new lease just because the State happens to be the landlord and because the State wants the property.  I cannot argue too strongly in favour of that.  The more I think about it the more merit I see in putting the State, as a landlord, in the same position as any other landlord and giving the tenant of the State or the lessee of the State the same rights to a new tenancy or to compensation in lieu of a new tenancy against the State, as a landlord, as that particular tenant or lessee would have against any other landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel there is great merit in the proposition I have put forward.  We should be moving away from the position where the State is to be treated in a preferential manner.  I believe the State should not be hindered or obstructed in the discharge of its duties to the community in general.  On the other hand, I do not believe that one member of the community should be penalised or should have to become a public benefactor because the State wants vacant possession of the property for the rest of <Col N="500" /> the community.  There is no reason why the tenant, as a citizen, should have to shoulder a heavy burden and be at a big loss just for the benefit of all his neighbours.  That is not reasonable.  It would be far more reasonable if the State in general and the citizens of the country in general compensated the one tenant suffering a loss on behalf of the rest. That is a more logical and reasonable approach than the old approach which just says that when one is dealing with the State one is in trouble.  A very logical and very convincing argument can be made in favour of not asking an individual citizen to carry a big burden or suffer a big loss for the convenience of the community in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new provision.  It is designed to give effect, with some precautions, to recommendations made by the commission in their first report.  The section provides that a landlord of a tenement should, in certain circumstances and before the lease or contract of tenancy expires, be enabled to obtain from the court an order terminating the tenancy of that tenement in a building which in itself is obsolete or is <Col N="501" /> situated in an obsolete area provided that he pays compensation to the tenant at a specially high level as prescribed in subsection (5).  The section does not apply when a person holds either an obsolete building or a building which is situated in an obsolete area as a ground renting tenant.  In this connection it may be noted that, under section 33 (1) of the Bill, if a ground landlord satisfies the court that he has development plans for which he has obtained planning permission, he may not be required to grant a reversionary lease although he will have to pay compensation to the ground rent tenant under section 59 of the Bill.  Compensation, however, will be at a lower level than that prescribed in subsection (5) of this section.</P>
      <P>The commission, in their first report, described representations that were made to them to the effect that sitting tenants who either will not give up possession except for exorbitant compensation or who cannot be induced to move at all are able to hold up development or reconstruction projects and in fact hold up the redevelopment and modernisation of cities and towns.  The commission accepted that there was a problem which required attention but they concluded that the giving of a general power to terminate tenancies prematurely in order to carry out a scheme of development or reconstruction could be open to abuse. Speculators could acquire a building with a reasonable period of use or life and oust tenants who might not be adequately compensated for leaving by a money payment.  The commission were satisfied that a general power of this nature should not be given but considered that a limited right to terminate a tenancy prematurely, subject to the most stringent conditions, should be given and these conditions are set out in paragraphs 216 to 222 of their report and with certain modifications such a limited right, subject to stringent conditions, as recommended by the commission is provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I understand the object of <Col N="502" /> this section and as long as it is not abused it is a reasonable section.  But it could be abused.  I am only hoping that subsections (5) (a) and (5) (b) are strong enough to discourage a landlord from abusing it.  A speculator could buy a block of property&mdash;and this is going on&mdash;consisting of five or six houses of which one or two are kept in a reasonable state by the tenants over the years; they may be residing there or carrying on a business.  The landlord can deliberately let the remainder of the property become run down by not minding it himself, by letting vandals take over control and by making it a thoroughly undesirable place.  In that way he can bring himself within this section and get possession of the remaining couple of bits of property, which he had his eye on when he bought the whole property, and make a very handsome profit on it.  There were abuses in regard to this and for that reason we have to look at the compensation that a tenant who is going to be ejected under this section will get.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) says:</P>
      <P>Where the Court awards compensation for the termination of a tenancy under this section, the measure of the compensation shall primarily be the pecuniary loss, damage or expense which the tenant sustains or incurs or will sustain or incur by reason of his quitting the tenement and which is the direct consequence of such quitting, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I must concede that that is fairly wide.  It covers any loss that the tenant will incur as a result of quitting the premises then or in the future.  But it goes on to say:</P>
      <P>(a)  such an amount as the Court considers reasonable shall be added for the pecuniary benefit accruing to the landlord which is referable to his getting possession of the tenement earlier than he was entitled to under the lease or other contract of tenancy,</P>
      <P>or at all.  He might not be entitled, except for this section, to get possession at any time because he might be obliged to give a new tenancy.  That is fairly wide too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> (b)  such amount as the Court considers reasonable shall be added for any further hardship which the tenant sustains through the making of the order terminating the tenancy.</P>
    <P>The compensation provisions there are fairly wide.  I take it that the Minister has been fully advised on the adequacy of those because otherwise it could lead to major scandals which none of us would want to be associated with either as legislators or otherwise.  I would ask the Minister for an assurance that he is satisfied that the compensation provisions of this all-embracing section are adequate to protect the tenant.</P>

      <P>With regard to possible abuses under this section, I am satisfied that the various safeguards which are incorporated in the section are considered adequate to ensure that it can be availed of only in very rare cases where it would be in the interests of the community generally that it should be availed of and where the tenants concerned are adequately compensated.  An overriding requirement which is contained in subsection (2) is that, even though all the other requirements are satisfied, the court is not to make an order terminating a tenancy unless it considers it reasonable to do so.  I am satisfied that the commission are satisfied that the various safeguards which are definitely required are there.</P>

But on the other hand, I would be very anxious to see that a speculator or builder or whatever who buys a block of property and who is going to oust somebody who is making a good living there would compensate that person handsomely.  I accept the Minister's assurance and I believe that the section is wide enough to do that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 14, to delete &ldquo;which reserves a yearly rent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 64 makes it clear that the reliefs against covenants which are given to lessees of tenements by sections 65 to 69 of the Bill extend to covenants carried over into a yearly tenancy arising on the expiration of the lease and this includes a statutory tenancy implied by holding over the premises on the expiration of the lease.</P>
      <P>The extension of the reliefs in Part V of the Bill to statutory tenancies is, in the Bill as it stands, linked with their extension to yearly tenancies.  This means a statutory tenancy on a yearly basis.  A yearly tenancy can arise &ldquo;by operation of law or by inference&rdquo; on the expiration of a lease and the scope of the section is correctly restricted to such yearly tenancies.  However, a lessee of premises that are controlled by the Rent Restrictions Acts may hold over on the expiration of his lease whether or not that lease was on a yearly basis.  It is to be noted that &ldquo;lease&rdquo; as defined in section 3 (1) of the Bill simply indicates a contract of tenancy in writing and is not restricted to cases where that tenancy is for a term of years.  Accordingly, a statutory tenancy on less than a yearly basis may follow on the expiration of a lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, a statutory tenant may <Col N="505" /> be bound by the covenants in the expired lease&mdash;section 32 (1) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960&mdash;whether or not that lease was on a yearly basis and, therefore, it is reasonable to provide that it should have the same reliefs against covenants as are being given to nonstatutory yearly tenants who are also bound by the covenants in an expired lease.  Accordingly, the amendment proposes to extend the benefit of Part V of the Bill to statutory tenants who hold over on the expiration of the lease whether or not that lease was on a yearly basis.</P>

      <P>This is a new provision that is designed to modify the application of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, for ground rent tenants of dwelling-houses <Col N="506" /> whose landlord is a State authority defined in section 3 (1) of the Bill.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights or a harbour authority shall have the right to acquire the fee simple except where the State authority concerned&mdash;or in the case of the Commissioners of Irish Lights or a harbour authority the Minister for Tourism and Transport&mdash;is satisfied that acquisition of the fee simple would not be in the public interest and so certifies.  It limits the application of sections 4 and 16 (2) (d) and (e) of the 1978 (No. 2) Act in so far as the acquisition of the fee simple of a dwelling-house is concerned.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the No. 2 Act exempts the State authority as landlord from the provisions of that Act.  Section 16 (2) (d) and (e) of the same Act excludes the right to acquire the fee simple in the case of leases made by the Commissioners of Irish Lights or by harbour authorities. The exclusion in section 16 (2) (d) and (e) of the No. 2 Act applies only where the Commissioner or a harbour authority are the immediate ground landlord. However, the exemption of the State under section 4 of that Act applies wherever the State would be a party to any conveyance of the fee simple, whether as ground landlord or as superior landlord.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 34, before section 71, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Condition 5 in section 10 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, is hereby amended by the deletion of `expired or was surrendered before the 31st day of March, 1931 and that it', and the said condition 5 as so amended is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
      <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
      <P>5.  that the lease was granted, either at the time of the expiration or surrender of a previous lease or subsequent to such expiration or surrender&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i> at a rent less than the rateable valuation of the property at the date of the grant of the lease, or</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i> to the person entitled to the lessee's interest under the previous lease,</P>
      <P>provided that the previous lease would have been a lease to which this Part would have applied had this Act then been in force and provided that it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the person to whom the lease was granted was so entitled;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenants (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, extends the right to acquire the fee simple to new classes of ground rent lessees and yearly tenants.  The purpose of this amendment is to extend that right to a further new category of such lessees which has only recently come to notice.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission have been consulted in relation to this matter and they recommended amendment of condition 5 of section 10 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, so as to extend recognition to this new class of ground rent lessee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the amendment is <Col N="508" /> as follows.  The restriction of the scope of condition 5, of section 10 to cases where the previous lease expired or was surrendered before 31 March 1931 originated in section 50 (1) of the 1931 Act.  That section which was repealed by the 1958 Reversionary Leases Act provided that where a lease reversionary to a building lease had been granted before 1931 there should be no further entitlement to a further reversionary lease.  The reason for this provision appears to have been that such reversionary leases granted before 1931 had in cases been assigned on the basis that they were merely occupational leases and that such assignees had no claim to be treated as building lessees.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the requirement stands that the original lease should have ended before 1931.  In the new category of lease with which the amendment is concerned, what is in question is the renewal of a lease that expired after 1931.  In the category in question the expired lease would have been a ground rent lease, that is, it would have come within Part II of the 1978 No. 2 Ground Rents Act. The renewal of that lease may not taken by itself similarly come within Part II of the 1978 Act.  However, if the requirements of condition 5 of section 10 of that Act were met other than the requirement concerning the date of expiration of the previous lease, that renewal is clearly a continuation of a ground rent lease and the lessee should as clearly have rights of purchase and of renewal as a ground rent lessee.  That is the view taken by the Landlord and Tenant Commission and that is what is proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 34, before section 71, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Condition 7 in section 10 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, and section 12 of that Act shall extend to a lease made for a term of less than fifty years if</P>
      <P>(a)  the lease is a sublease (whether mediate or immediate) under a lease (in this section referred to as the superior lease) to which Part II of that Act applies,</P>
      <P>(b)  the land demised by the lease is the whole or part of the land comprised in the superior lease, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the lease is made for a term which equals or exceeds the lesser of the following periods, namely twenty years or two-thirds of the term of the superior lease, and in any case expires at the same time as or not more than fifteen years before the expiration of the superior lease,</P>
      <P>and the other requirements of the condition are fulfilled.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give a right of purchase under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 to an additional category of ground rent lessees, that is, the holders of other classes of ground rent leases with terms of from 20 to 50 years.  The need for the amendment arises from the circumstance that not all leases that would be proprietory leases under the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958 attract the right to acquire the fee simple under the 1978 Act.  In particular a proprietory lessee would not have the right to acquire the fee simple under the 1978 No. 2 Act unless the lease under which he holds was for a term of not less than 50 years.  The reason for this is that the No. 2 Act, in abandoning the extremely complicated concept of building and proprietory leases, adopted instead a list <Col N="511" /> of the types of leases known to establish a ground rents relationship.  The essential requirement of such leases is that the tenant should own the bricks and mortar interest while the list comprises other elements which could go on to establish this.</P>
    <P>One element affecting the particular category of lease in question, which is covered by condition 7 of section 10 of the 1978 No. 2 Act, is that the lease should be for a minimum term of 50 years, this being taken to be the minimum period that anybody acquiring a bricks and mortar interest would be likely to accept in the category of lease in question.  Nevertheless, the existence of proprietory leases for terms of less than 50 years has now been established. The Landlord and Tenant Commission, who were consulted in the matter, have recommended that the lessees in question should be given rights under the 1978 No. 2 Act.  The amendment accordingly proposes that a lease should not be excluded from the scope of condition 7 of section 10 of the 1978 No. 2 Act by reason only of the terms of the lease being less than 50 years provided it complies with the other requirements of the category of lease in question.  These requirements, which are set out in section 7 of the 1958 Reversionary Leases Act, are included in the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 34, before section 71, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>A person entitled to an interest in land the title to which interest originated under a lease for lives renewable forever which was created prior to the 1st day of August, 1849, and was not converted into a fee farm grant under the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act, 1849, shall from the commencement of this Act hold the land for an estate in fee simple.  The said estate shall be deemed to be a graft upon the previous interest and shall be subject to any rights or equities arising from its being such graft.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to regularise the position concerning certain interests in land which originated prior to the passing of the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act, 1849.  A common method of leasing property in Ireland up to the middle of the 19th century was the creation of a lease for the term of the duration of the life or lives of usually three named persons subject to a rent and convenants including a covenant by the lessor for the perpetual renewal of the lease for further lives.  The Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act of 1849 declared that any further such leases should operate as a fee farm grant of the fee simple.  It also gave to persons then holding under such a lease the right <Col N="514" /> to obtain a fee farm grant <i>in lieu</i> of the lease.</P>
    <P>While many such leases were converted in accordance with the Act it appears that a number were not converted.  The lessees under such leases have continued in possession and in many cases have continued to pay rent on the expiry of the terms of their leases.  Their interest may have become that of yearly tenants with a right to obtain a renewal or conversion grant.  A yearly tenancy is not registerable in any of the registers of the Land Registry and although the persons in question have complete security of possession their titles may not be readily marketable as they may not be acceptable to lending institutions or to purchasers who may be depending on such institutions to finance the purchase because of the prospect of the costs involved in renewal proceedings.  The only course of action open to such a person at present would be to require the owners of the lessors' interest to execute a deed of grant or petition the court.  Either course could be expensive and prolonged.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to regularise this position by putting the parties to the lease on the same footing as if the lease had been converted under the Act of 1849.  It concerns only a lessee who has continued in possession without either conversion or renewal of his lease.  Such a person has an interest in the land and not an estate.  The new fee simple is deemed to be a graft on the previous interest and to be subject to any rights or equities arising from its being such a graft.  This means that the fee simple is subject to the rents and the covenants in the previous lease in the same manner as if the conversion had been effected under the Act of 1849.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 34, before section 71, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  This section applies to a house which was erected by a public utility <Col N="516" /> society within the meaning of section 2 (1) of the Housing Act, 1966, and in relation to which erection a grant was made under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1962, and there is a subsisting undertaking, given by the public utility society in consideration of the grant, that the house would not be sold.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister for the Environment (in this section referred to as the Minister) may grant his consent to the sale of a house to which this section applies.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the Minister grants his consent to the sale of a house to which this section applies, then, notwithstanding any undertaking of the kind described in subsection (1) or any limitation which may apply by virtue of section 121 of the Housing Act, 1966, the house may be sold and the sale shall operate to vest the premises in the purchaser freed and discharged from any such undertaking.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may, in relation to the sale of a house to which this section applies which was effected prior to the commencement of this section, grant his consent to such sale and where the Minister so grants his consent the fact that the sale was effected prior to the commencement of this section shall not affect and shall be deemed never to have affected the validity of the sale and such sale shall be deemed for all purposes to have been effected in accordance with subsection (3).</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section, `grant', in relation to a house, means a grant of land as a site for such house or a grant of money in respect of such house or a grant made partly in one such way and partly in the other such way.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Grants were paid under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1962, to a small number of public utility societies in respect of the erection of houses for letting.  The grants, generally known as <Col N="517" />&ldquo;public utility society letting grants&rdquo;, were paid subject to a statutory condition that an undertaking would be given by the recipient society that the houses would not be sold but would be let on a monthly or lesser tenancy to persons of the working classes or agricultural labourers.  The tenants of the houses in question are, therefore, precluded from purchasing the landlord's rights in their houses even where the landlord is willing to sell.  The general purpose of the amendment is to remove this disability and to bring the rights of the tenants in question more into line with the rights enjoyed by occupational tenants generally.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) defines the houses to which the section applies.  The houses in question are houses which were erected by public utility societies and in relation to which erection a grant was paid under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1962, and there is a subsisting undertaking, given by the society in consideration of the grant, that the houses would not be sold.</P>
    <P>Public utility society letting grants were paid under section 5 (1) (i) of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932 and section 20 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948. The purpose of the grants was to promote the provision of houses for letting to members of the working classes and agricultural labourers as a supplement to the then limited provision of houses for letting by local authorities. The grants were on foot of an undertaking given by societies that the houses would not be sold but would be let.</P>
    <P>Similar grants were paid to individual landlords but the law enabled undertakings given by individual landlords to expire after 15 years.  There was no similar provision in relation to public utility societies.  High Court proceedings are pending in certain cases as to whether or not undertakings given by a public utility society in Cork in conjunction with the making of grants under section 20 of the 1948 Act are still operative.  For this <Col N="518" /> reason, the subsection is deliberately expressed to apply only to those houses in relation to which an undertaking still subsists, so as to avoid conflict with or in any way prejudging the court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that the Minister for the Environment may grant his consent to the sale of a house to which the section applies.  The reason for requiring the consent of the Minister for the Environment as opposed to giving the landlords a free hand as to the disposal of the houses is to provide some safeguards for tenants.  The conferral of complete freedom to sell on the landlords might be too sudden and too adverse a change in the situation of the tenants.  It is envisaged that the consent of the Minister would not be unreasonably withheld and that consent would certainly be granted in all cases of agreement to a sale between the landlord and all the tenants in a particular development.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that where the Minister for the Environment grants his consent under subsection (2) to the sale of a house, the undertaking given by the society that the house would not be sold will be discharged and the house may be sold.  The purpose of the subsection is to enable clear title to be transferred to the purchaser.  The Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932 was repealed by the Housing Act, 1966. Section 121 of the 1966 Act continued in operation any undertakings given under the repealed Act.  Section 20 of the 1948 Act was repealed by the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962, but the 1962 Act did not contain a provision similar to section 121 of the 1966 Act.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is included to validate, where necessary, sales which may have been effected in breach of an undertaking given to the Minister.  A doubt exists as to whether or not undertakings given in relation to certain houses are still operative.  Some of the houses in relation to which letting grants were paid have been sold by the landlords to the tenants in recent years.  The purpose of the subsection is to validate any such sales <Col N="519" /> where such validation is necessary so as to remove doubts as to purchasers' title to the property.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) defines the term &ldquo;grant&rdquo; to mean a grant of money or land or both.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> Regarding tenancy of a tenement as defined in section 5(1) of the Bill, the proposals replace the provisions in section 34 of the 1931 Act which are concerned with the same kind of situation as this section.  Sections 20 and 21 of the 1958 Act provide for the continuation of the building and proprietary leases in cases where the immediate lessor's interest is terminated for some reason before its normal expiration and where in consequence but for these provisions in the 1958 Act such leases would themselves be terminated.  These provisions ensure that building and proprietary leases remain undisturbed even where the lessor's interest is terminated and that rights of renewal and so on are preserved.</P>
    <P>Section 73 of the Bill makes the same kind of provision for leases and tenancies to which any of the provisions of the Bill may apply, that is, to any tenancy of a tenement and to any lease that attracts the right to a reversionary lease under Part III of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;THE LANDLORD AND TENANT ACTS, 1931 TO 1978&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;THE LAW OF LANDLORD AND TENANT AND TO PROVIDE FOR OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE MATTERS AFORESAID&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this official amendment arose from official amendments Nos. 46 and 47, assuming those amendments were accepted.  Acceptance of official amendments Nos. 46 and 47 involved the insertion of <Col N="524" /> new sections into the Bill dealing respectively with the position of persons who hold under leases for lives that may have lapsed and with the sale of houses for which letting grants were paid to public utility societies.  While both of these new sections are within the ambit of landlord and tenant law, they do not relate to provisions that are at present contained in the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1931 to 1978.  Accordingly, the Title of the Bill as it stands is not quite wide enough in scope to cover the provisions of the Bill as thus amended.  The substitution of a reference to &ldquo;the Law of Landlord and Tenant&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1931 to 1978&rdquo; overcomes the difficulty.  The substituted portion of the Title is on the general lines of the corresponding portions of the titles of certain other Landlord and Tenant Acts&mdash;the 1967 Ground Rents Act, the 1971 Amendment Act and the 1978 No. 2 Act.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This is a long Bill and during the course of the debate the Minister conceded that we put forward a number of points of substance in relation to a number of sections.  As the Minister undertook to look into those points before Report Stage I suggest that a reasonable period of time should elapse between now and Report Stage and that the Minister, through his Secretary, notify me as to whether he proposes to take any action in relation to the points I raised.  Otherwise, I will be tabling amendments.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that we will need some time to give the matters of substance referred to by the Deputy the consideration they deserve.  It could be a number of weeks but I should like to assure the Deputy that Report Stage will not take him by surprise.  That would be unfair and wrong.  We will have to consider the matters raised by the Deputy.  If we can meet these points, we shall let the Deputy know; but we shall let him know, too, if it is not possible to meet them in order to give him the opportunity of putting down amendments.</P>

    <Title>Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) Bill, 1979: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I would make in relation to this Bill is that we are not obliged by EEC law to adopt this legislation.  In other words, we are free to decide for ourselves as to whether we should have a Bill of this sort.  One other member state, Luxembourg, has not yet enacted this type of legislation.  In these circumstances, we should assess the Bill on its merits.  The advantages of the Bill are twofold.  First, it would enable Irish breeders of plants to be paid royalties on the sales of these plants abroad.  The fact that there is not any such protection in existence is causing serious problems, especially for potato breeders who have <Col N="526" /> developed some new and excellent varieties.  Secondly, it would encourage foreign companies to come here and undertake plant breeding work in Irish conditions, thereby developing plants that would be suited specifically to Irish needs.  This situation should attract resources from abroad in the area of plants.</P>
      <P>Recognising these advantages, it is our intention to seek answers during the debate to some questions that we shall be putting in regard to other but less advantageous aspects of the Bill and to table amendments where necessary. However, it is not our intention to oppose the Bill at this stage but, in the light of the reaction we shall get to the amendments we shall put forward, we shall decide on what is to be our attitude to the Bill in its final form.</P>
      <P>Basically, the Bill is giving a monopoly on the profits from the breeding of a new variety of plant to the person who devised that variety in order to encourage him to invest money and time in investigation and research in relation to the plant in anticipation of the profits he would receive afterwards.  In that respect the Bill is similar to patent law, to copyright law and to trade mark law.  But, internationally and especially in Canada, there are many who question the overall economic justification for this type of patent protection and who say that perhaps there are ways of rewarding an inventor without giving him an absolute exclusive right to use the results of his investigations.  One example put forward is the example of inventors certificates whereby people are entitled, not to exclusive monopolies in respect of a new plant or invention, but to a right to charge reasonable royalties while allowing other people to use the invention.  We should consider whether that might be a more appropriate way of providing an incentive to inventors in the plant-breeding area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we decide to give a monopoly, we are running three basic risks.  First, a monopolist could charge in respect of a particular variety, a high rate of royalty to other people who might wish to use the fruits of the invention.  Secondly, the <Col N="527" /> person with the monopoly might use that situation to encourage or perhaps to force people who seek to use the variety of plant concerned to use other commodities which he produced&mdash;for instance, fertilisers and pesticides.  Lastly, by virtue of his having a monopoly he might discriminate unfairly against certain categories of producers.  People in the Third World in particular fear that a system of monopoly rights in the area of breeds of plants could be used to discriminate unfairly against them, to charge them higher prices than they might be charged otherwise or even to give them plants of a lesser quality than they might be given otherwise simply because of their being poor and, consequently, not having the information or the market power to enable them to demand better than they are being offered by the multi-nationals who might have the monopolies.</P>
    <P>In order to meet these three basic objections to the Bill we shall be seeking to introduce amendments.  The main area of protection that would be conferred by the Bill in regard to the abuse of monopoly power would relate to the provision in section 8 whereby a compulsory licence would be granted in an instance in which someone is either using his monopoly power unreasonably or is using it contrary to the public interest. He could be forced by reason of the terms of that provision to shed his monopoly and to allow other people to use the variety of plant in respect of which the monopoly had been enjoyed. To say the least, the grounds on which a compulsory licence can be sought are vague.  They should be spelled out specifically in order to make clear the conditions in which a compulsory licence could be granted to someone to use a plant in respect of which somebody else had the monopoly already.  There must be much stronger powers to ensure that compulsory licences are granted in certain circumstances and the onus of proof in respect of the non-abuse of monopoly power should rest with the monopolist and not with the person seeking a licence to use the commodity in <Col N="528" /> question.  It is not right that all the cards should be stacked on the side of the person who, after all, is being given a monopoly by the State.</P>
    <P>In other countries there have been proposals put forward on the lines that I shall be following during the Committee Stage.  If we can effect improvements in the compulsory licensing provisions we shall be going a long way towards remedying whatever defects there are in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another area in respect of which some concern has been expressed relates to the cost of the administration of the Bill.  The Schedule sets out the various matters in respect of each individual application for a patent for a variety of plant which must be established in order to show that the plant is distinct from other types of plants and has not been commercialised previously in the country.  It would have to be a uniform type of seed which would continue to produce the same type of seed each time it is used.  These are all very difficult and technical questions in respect of any variety of plant.  Consequently, the establishing of such criteria would absorb a good deal of highly-skilled staff time in examining each application.  In this respect there are two questions.  Will this mean that a very substantial number of staff will have to be employed in order to do the work necessary to satisfy the requirements of the legislation and will those staff be diverted from other more productive tasks such as helping farmers to develop new varieties of seed on their farms? Will such staff be removed from that sort of work in order that they might be engaged in legalistic sort of work to give certain people the monopoly in respect of plants?  One can foresee the dangers both in regard to cost and in regard to the diversion of resources in this respect.</P>
    <P>In my view the extent of the monopoly being granted is too great.  Section 4 says that the person granted a monopoly in respect of a particular variety of plant shall have it for a minimum of 15 years, but there is no maximum period set.  It seems unusual that a person should be <Col N="529" /> given a monopoly for a minimum period and that no requirement should be inserted that at the end of, say, 20, 25 or 30 years the monopoly will cease.  I should have thought it would be the other way round.  This probably arises from the terms of the convention itself but, although we may be bound to the minimum of 15 years within the terms of the convention, there is nothing to stop us putting a maximum period in the Bill. I urge the Minister to set a period, say 20 years, after which the monopoly would have to be officially renewed, rather than leaving it there indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Some numbers of the farming community expressed concern that the granting of this plant breeders rights legislation could lead to a higher price being charged for seeds sold to farmers. At the moment farmers are able to get seed without having to pay substantial royalties to the foreign companies which may have developed them.  If we adopt this legislation we will be obliged by law, if we use seeds from any country which is an adherent to the convention, to pay royalties&mdash;sometimes very substantial royalties&mdash;to international companies.  If higher royalties are paid to the sellers this will lead to higher prices being paid by the farmers.  There must be a mechanism to ensure that these prices are not unreasonably increased.  If there is evidence the person who has a monopoly power under this Bill is charging an unreasonably high price he should lose his monopoly.</P>
    <P>Although we will be gaining some revenue from the sale of varieties, for instance potatoes, which we have developed here, on balance the net effect of the Bill may be that more royalties will be flowing out of the country than are coming in.  The Minister should tell us how he sees this balance working out and he should insert a provision to ensure that the long-term effects of this legislation on the balance of payments should be assessed and the House should get a report telling exactly where the money is going and whether, as a country, we are net gainers or net losers.</P>
    <P>I believe there is need to strengthen the powers whereby the office can require <Col N="530" /> information from the person granted the plant breeders right about the prices he is charging for the seeds in respect of which he has a monopoly.  It would be very wrong if a person patented a variety of seed here and was thereby entitled to charge Irish farmers substantially higher prices than those charged to farmers in England, France or any other country covered by the convention.  There should be a clear understanding that he cannot discriminate against one country in favour of another.</P>
    <P>If we are granting a patent for a particular seed we should be able to require that information about the prices being charged be given to the controller on a regular basis, every year, in respect of all countries where that seed is sold.  We should also have information about the level of profits being made by the company which has the monopoly.  Unless we have such information we will have no way of knowing whether the royalties received are reasonable, as is required in the provisions of the Act in regard to the granting the compulsory licences.</P>
    <P>At the moment the provision for a compulsory licence, in the patents legislation where it already exists, has never been used in this country.  That means it is not providing any protection. If this is not to happen in respect of the compulsory licence provision in this legislation, there must be a requirement that certain information be given to the controller and, through him, be made publicly available, so that people who believe, or have a hunch, that a particular seed with the protection of monopoly rights is being sold at an unreasonable price will be able to get the information necessary to prove the case and that the monopolist will be required to prove that he is not abusing the monopoly.</P>
    <P>At the moment the burden of proof is on the person seeking the compulsory licence and very little, if any, on the person trying to defend his monopoly.  The person seeking to get the monopoly overturned does not have the information necessary to prove his case because the person who has the monopoly is not obliged to disclose it.  I believe there <Col N="531" /> should be disclosure provisions in the Bill to ensure that anyone who has this type of monopoly must give this information so that not only can he not charge an unreasonable price for the monopoly product, but he must be seen not to charge an unreasonable price.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that this type of legislation may lead to concentration on the development of certain varieties of seeds by a small number of multinational companies and that they will allow other varieties, which may not be as productive in the short-term, to run down and perhaps to disappear completely.  It has been suggested that in recent years, because of a concentration on uniform types of seed, a variety of cauliflower has become extinct.  This might not seem to be a matter about which we should be very concerned but if it were happening that a variety of seed were disappearing off the map completely and we were relying on a smaller range of seed, we could run the risk of putting ourselves in a very vulnerable position.  If diseases or other unforseen developments affected the varieties of seed we had, we would not be able to fall back on the traditional varieties which might have had resistance to that disease.</P>
    <P>The development of what is known as a gene bank is very important.  In other words, a reserve of all varieties, even those not now in commercial use, should be preserved in each country and, if it is found that varieties which are in common use have developed characteristics which make them no longer suitable or if diseases have developed to which they are prone, one can go back to the earlier varieties and redevelop new varieties from them which would be resistant to the diseases.  That can only happen if banks of pre-existing varieties have been preserved.  Hand in hand with this legislation the Government should be prepared to put money into the banks of seeds which are not in wide commercial use but which can be preserved for posterity in case they might be necessary in conditions which we cannot at the <Col N="532" /> moment foresee.  In the Third World there is great concern that this should be done: they are afraid that some of the new seeds being marketed progressively may not stand the test of time but that if they are adopted too widely and other existing varieties allowed to die out we will find ourselves in a worse position than we were before the new varieties were introduced.</P>
    <P>It appears that under section 5 if one discovers a plant variety growing in the wild one may patent it and once it is patented one can become the owner of that plant.  A plant discovered in the wild would appear to be public property and it does not seem right that somebody should be allowed to make a profit out of public property even if the plant had not been discovered previously.  I think that would be going too far in the type of protection we are giving.</P>
    <P>I suggest that as soon as this Bill becomes law an inquiry should be set up by the Restrictive Practices Commission to investigate how the Act has been operating and report at the end of the decade to the Minister on the way legislation has been operated by the controller.  It is important that the legislation should not operate to give high profits to some people and we therefore need to have long-term investigation by an independent body.</P>
    <P>We should also consider carefully the impact of the legislation on farmers in the Third World.  I do not believe that the passage of the Bill will do much damage to the Third World, but the entire corpus of this type of legislation might give certain licence to multinational producers of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides and enable them to charge prices to people outside UPOV&mdash;most Third World countries are&mdash;which might not be fair and reasonable.  We should be careful that anybody granted a monopoly under the Bill will not charge unreasonable prices to farmers in the Third World for their products.</P>
    <P>We must try to ensure that they will develop varieties of plants which will not require massive amounts of fertilisers to <Col N="533" /> achieve good returns.  There is a fear that companies involved in fertiliser and pesticide production and who also produce plants may develop varieties of plants which will require enormous amounts of fertilisers.  In a world in which energy costs are going up and fertiliser costs are increasing as a result, we must not allow agriculture to be dependent unnecessarily on large inputs of fertilisers.  Therefore, we should try to ensure that plant breeding policy will not be dictated by people whose interests also lie in the production of fertilisers and pesticides.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to meet the suggestions I have made so that when we have put the Bill through Committee, and amended it where necessary, we will have a measure that will command universal approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the Bill appears to be necessary but there is some doubt about its effects in many areas.  I have received conflicting comments from various interests in regard to it.  I agree it is necessary to protect the rights of people who have gone to the trouble, at some cost, of producing new varieties of plants.  The Minister has told us that the concept of plant breeders' rights has been established in Europe for many years and I do not think anybody would object to fair compensation for people who have provided the expertise and the finances in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, since I read the Bill I have been wondering whether it is necessary to give exclusive rights to people for such a long period in respect of plants produced.  I do not think there is any doubt that this Bill gives great advantages to multinational companies.  It will be generally appreciated&mdash;and I think the Minister would agree&mdash;that we are setting up monopolies under this Bill.  In those circumstances one must be sure of what one is doing.  Generally I am opposed to monopolies but I do not know if there is some other means by which the same could be achieved.  It is only fair that there be some recognition of the efforts and expense of the producers of a new variety of plant.  As the Minister has <Col N="534" /> said, the production of a new variety of plant is the result of substantial investment, human skill and resources, probably over a period of some 15 years. I do not think anybody would challenge that assertion.</P>
    <P>However, it is necessary that we examine the effects of the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister seems to imply that the varieties of plants we need in this country may not continue to be available to us if we do not comply with the provisions of this Bill.  He was not any more definite, just maintaining that those types of plants and seeds may not continue to be available to us.  I do not think we have encountered any difficulty to date in obtaining varieties of plants controlled already by UPOV.  The Minister has not intimated that we have experienced any difficulty in this respect and the evidence that we shall encounter such difficulty in the near future is not very conclusive.  Indeed I am not at all convinced that such will be the case.</P>
    <P>I would warn the Minister to be very careful lest we set up a monopoly having rights far beyond what is intended.  Most varieties of plants introduced here will be of foreign productions, by the multi-nationals or large corporations who can afford to do so.  Most people who produce these varieties, who have the time and money necessary for their production, will be people with a larger budget than that to which they admit.  I would be fearful of affording such people exclusive rights to the sale of such plants to our farmers, or indeed the farmers of the world.  I am concerned that the benefits accruing to this country from the effects of the provisions of this Bill would be reversed, because there is no evidence to show that we have experienced any difficulty to date in attaining those plants or seeds that have become available to us.</P>
    <P>We have no evidence to show that this Bill is vital at present.  There may be a time in the future when our position will become less secure in regard to the procurement of such plants by our people dependent on them for a better yield or better general production.  It appears to me that the Minister and his Department <Col N="535" /> have suddenly become overconcerned about this Bill.  I feel we should make haste slowly as far as its introduction is concerned.  It may be that it is necessary to protect the interests of our people.</P>
    <P>The people who produce a new variety of plant in this country are entitled to a patent and to remuneration for the energy and time spent on such production.  Not many Irish firms have produced new varieties of plants.  I think there have been some in regard to potatoes and cereals but most of the work entailed in their production here has been undertaken by our Agricultural Institute.  I acknowledge that the people engaged in that service have put a lot of work into the production of these limited varieties but they have been limited in scope and resources in comparison with their richer multinationals and monopolies who will now be afforded rights here of registering such varieties and, in turn, charging our people.  That is one side of the coin about which we should be careful.</P>
    <P>Before Committee Stage the Minister would do well to study the provisions of this Bill.  By then he should have ascertained what will be the net effect on people utilising the various kinds of plants and seeds that will be controlled under the terms of the Bill, whether the overall effect will be good on Irish production or resources.  I do not think there is any doubt in anybody's mind but that the monopolies that have been producing plants in areas covered already by UPOV are well able to look after their own interests and protection because they are sufficiently powerful.  Neither do I think there should be any fear that we will not procure the kinds of seeds we will need because of pressure from these huge monopolies.</P>
    <P>I am sure there is more urgent legislation than this.  From what we have been told this may have serious effects on the Third World.  New varieties of plants can be brought in from UPOV and patented in these countries.  If it is necessary to sell them back they would have to pay royalties.  We have paid a lot of lip service <Col N="536" /> vice to the Third World.  We give assistance and we believe we are doing our share.  I am not disputing that.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs set up an advisory committee to investigate how we can help to provide food and so on for them.  The Minister should ask that committee to investigate the effects of this legislation on the Third World.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had consultations with various interests in this area but he did not have consultations with anyone in this House.  If he has had such consultations I am sure he got the kind of representations which I got.  He should be very careful before he decides that this is the best way to proceed.  If we were a seed and plant producing nation I could understand the urgency for this legislation.  However, our contribution in this area is minimal compared to that of other great monopolies which have been set up throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I am not totally opposed to the Bill because if some of our people produce a new variety of seed or plant they are entitled to have it recognised.  There may be other ways of doing that instead of setting up and allowing great monopolies to develop throughout the member states of the convention.  I have serious reservations concerning the extension of exclusive rights to people to sell plants anywhere in those nations.  They can impose their own conditions in countries which are not members.  Before we proceed to Committee Stage we should clear up any doubts that exist concerning the need for giving a monopoly to a few people.  That is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion at EEC level to have all member states come into this.  Luxembourg have not decided to come into it yet.  We should delay our final decision until we are sure that we are not giving too much exclusive power and control to these people over the selling of varieties of seed within this country and throughout the world.  There are a number of seed merchants in this country.  Under this Bill the controller will have powers to say to the monopoly that they must make a certain variety available to more people and give more people a licence to sell the product.  I <Col N="537" /> have an objection to people coming in here, setting up their own organisation and giving themselves exclusive rights to sell plants.</P>
    <P>Perhaps pressure is being brought to bear on the Minister by the EEC to adopt this legislation and for us to become part of a great monopoly.  The problem is that any new variety produced or registered within that area will be only available by exclusive right to the monopoly for sale.  This is a dangerous procedure.  We should proceed slowly.  I understand the Government's position on this and the pressures being brought to bear on them. We need to be careful about the rights we give to people outside the State.  Most of the new varieties that will be produced will, more than likely, be produced outside the State.  We will give exclusive rights to people under this Bill to sell them anywhere.  They have machinery set up that will force these people under certain circumstances to grant new licences for the sale of these products.</P>
    <P>It is well known that such enforcement by the controller may be very difficult to obtain.  Some unfortunate seedsman who wants to sell this variety will be forced to produce proof that these monopolies and multi-national companies are refusing to make it available to him and that they are not justified in so doing.  It has been mentioned that these people may produce plants, the rights to which will be given only to people who at the same time produce and sell certain expensive fertilisers.  I do not know whether that is correct or not, but the Minister and the Department of Agriculture should investigate these claims before we finally pass this Bill in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister feels that this Bill is necessary.  I do not know whether it is necessary or whether it is to keep us in line as good Europeans.  We should be over-careful.  Seed which is being produced should be available to people who need it, whether it is Irish or African farmers or whoever it might be. Whatever it costs to produce, this new variety of plant should not be exclusive to people who can say whether it is made <Col N="538" /> available or not.  That is what I would be very worried about.  We have not proved the need to give a special right to these people&mdash;an expanding rights system, the Minister called it.  Protection is enshrined in the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, signed in Paris in 1961, which convention has lasted up to the present.  There has apparently been no urgency since 1961.  Is the urgency in introducing this Bill caused by Irish people who are now ready to produce the new varieties of plants?  If that is the reason, fair enough. Is it the major reason?  In order to get into this seemingly exclusive plant producing club, must we give these rights?</P>
    <P>I would emphasise one other point. Can somebody who picks up a rare wild plant, which has not been registered anywhere else, come to the controller and register it here?  We have exclusive areas with rare wild life and wild plants, in Pollardstown in Kildare and in The Burren in Clare, where rare species of plants are growing wild, and plants which are not available anywhere else in the world.  Is it possible for somebody to pick up a plant from such an area and register it as his or her own?  This is something that we will have to be very careful about.  These species should be protected and developed but no one should have the power to pluck and register a variety simply because it is not registered and not well known.  I do not know if these plants have a commercial use, but it would not be proper that someone could register these under a patent to be available to him or her alone.</P>
    <P>We must make haste slowly in this regard.  We need to be assured that this legislation being discussed here will not have the effects claimed by some people. In fairness, I got documentation from one side of the lobby and documentation from two very eminent sources&mdash;one side saying that this legislation would have a serious effect on the Third World in creating a monopoly which would also be injurious to Irish farmers and the other saying that that was rubbish and could be disproved.  I have no means <Col N="539" /> of researching to find out which side is correct, but the Department of Agriculture and the Minister have a responsibility to make available the necessary exclusive information before we reach a further stage of this Bill.  The Minister has this responsibility to the people here involved in seed production and sale.  He should allay any doubts in these areas before he proceeds with the Bill, perhaps by amending it to ensure that there is protection.</P>
    <P>We are told that the controller can give full protection if there are any complaints.  It is, however, very hard for people with limited resources who may feel that they are being victimised under this Bill by not having available the varieties of plants and seed which are available to this international monopoly to provide the kind of proof necessary to the controller and to prove beyond doubt that this is a case in which the controller should act.  The necessary slow and tedious procedure is a deterrent for people who may not be as well heeled or as well armed as the monopoly which would be controlling the provision of seed.</P>
    <P>This office of controller will be appointed by the Minister.  He has certain powers laid down in the Bill but we do not know his exact powers, or the documentation necessary.</P>
    <P>The controller may or may not be an officer of the Department.  The Minister may make available to the controller the use of land, facilities, services and persons under his control and may authorise the controller to engage the services of other persons and to acquire the findings of examinations and so on carried out in other countries.  It seems that this office will be pretty costly.  People who register new varieties of plants will pay fees.  Will there be a serious cost which will have to be passed on to farmers and others who need these new varieties to maintain production?  Has the Minister any idea of the cost of properly administering the office of controller and of the amount of work necessary to approve an application from perhaps a foreign source?  What <Col N="540" /> would we get by way of royalties?  How would the office be financed?  Would it be financed exclusively by this State which would be providing a service perhaps for monopolies throughout a large section of the European Community and elsewhere?  I am worried about these matters.</P>
    <P>On the information available to me&mdash;and some contradictory evidence has been produced to me by various interests&mdash;I do not know if the Bill should be opposed totally or whether we should ask the Minister to ensure that the points we have made here will be taken into account and that he will come back on Committee Stage, when we will probably have amendments down, and give us categoric assurances on matters raised. This Bill is above party politics.  It is something not fully appreciated by the public who are not aware of its importance.  It is very important.  The Minister may be able to prove that he can refute suggestions I have been throwing out.  If so, I shall be prepared to accept the bill. The Minister should ensure that he knows exactly what he is talking about and try to have explanations ready on Committee Stage.  If he is unable to do this he should put a statutory limit on the Bill, as suggested by other speakers, so that it could be examined by an independent authority to see the effect it has. The Minister should satisfy himself as to what effect it will have on the price of seed, on the availability of seed and plant varieties generally to farmers and others who need them.  He should also examine or have examined the effect of this legislation on the Third World.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can satisfy me on those points I will accept the Bill.  If he cannot do that, I shall put down amendments that I think are necessary to ensure that the points I have made are covered.  The Minister has a duty to the country, to the people involved in the sale of seeds and plants, to the Third World and to many other people involved to ensure that if the Bill should have undesirable effects he will be in a position to have the legislation reviewed within a reasonable time of its enactment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> It is vitally necessary to have these various points cleared up.  I cannot clear them up.  I have not the necessary facilities.  If the Minister has the necessary facilities, I say in all sincerity that it is necessary for him to investigate the various areas mentioned.  He told us he had consultations with different interests before the Bill was brought here. If so, he should tell us what these consultations consisted of and what effect they had on the Bill.  Is he satisfied the Bill will not have the effect that we fear, increasing the cost of a variery of plants or seeds, and if so how much will the increase be?  How much will be the cost of the controller's office?  What services will be required to investigate applications for proprietary brands for plants and what sort of research will be involved? Will he have exclusive rights to the investigation results and expertise of State organisations already doing this type of work?</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann notes the continued failure of the Government to take decisive action in the area of the control of prices after almost three years in office; aware of the promises of the Government contained in pages 10 and 11 of the Fianna Fáil Manifesto relating in particular to its undertaking to discourage increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control and influence; and to examine the accounting procedures of the ESB with a view to reducing the price of electricity; also notes that since the beginning of 1980 further price increases have been sanctioned by the Government including increases of 10.5 per cent in coal, 20.5 per cent in ESB rates, 4 per cent in milk, 10 per cent in bread, 20 per cent <Col N="542" /> in CIE fares, 29 pence in bottled gas &mdash;all of which have hit the weaker sections of the community hardest&mdash; and condemns this further abject failure of the Government to cushion the most disadvantaged sections of the community from the effects of price increases by their deliberate escalation of these price trends due to their own policies such as the abolition of food subsidies.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wish to point out that inflation in the past year showed a 100 per cent increase, being 7.9 per cent in 1977-78 as against just 16 per cent in 1978-79.  The situation is extremely serious for those in the lower and middle income groups where the husband only is working in the family.  Such workers, their wives and families are finding it almost impossible to live.  Basic necessities such as bread, butter, milk, meat, heating, lighting and transport have had increases in prices of such a nature and magnitude that many families are finding it daily more difficult to retain their standard of living.  Parents with large families spend a greater amount of their income on food, heating and lighting, especially on food.  Many such families have suffered a drop in their standard of living.  Many families are forced to do without the essentials of life because of the increase in the cost of living.  It is imperative that the Minister takes more serious action than he has taken up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech last Wednesday night was the poorest speech I have ever heard a Minister giving in relation to price control.  He tried to make a case for the Government in regard to prices.  He said that on 34 occasions during the past two-and-a-half years in respect of 49 commodities he either refused or reduced the recommendation.  The Minister took action on 34 occasions only.  Many thousand of applications were made to the Minister in regard to price increases but <Col N="543" /> he did something only in relation to this small number.  He stated later in his speech:</P>
    <P>The question of price control is being monitored vigorously and being followed up by me.  Unlike my predecessor, I have taken a constant personal interest in this area.  In accordance with our undertaking in the manifesto, I have not acted as a rubber stamp at any time.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted there that he is responsible but he has failed to do anything concrete to control prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been one of the most obvious failures in the Government in relation to the particular matter which is his responsibility.  No matter where I visit, whether it is houses, shops or meetings that I attend, everybody wants to know from me why the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism fails to act.  I believe the House is right in asking the Minister why he has failed to act in relation to price control.  The situation is slowly but surely getting out of hand and if the Minister does not act immediately the situation will be beyond redemption in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Bread, butter, milk, lighting and heating are the basic necessities of life.  If the Minister does not take some action and do something for the people concerned he and his Government will be condemned for their failure to take action. We cannot stand idly by and see young families deprived of the basic necessities of life.  Every day in the national newspapers we see announcements of price increases.  There was a time when a budget meant something, but tomorrow's budget is something different because since the beginning of the year we have had a budget almost every weekend because of the inactivity of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in relation to controlling prices. The Minister must do something about this matter immediately.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday evening we discussed the situation in relation to price control. As well as price control it is essential to have quality control and also control of <Col N="544" /> standards.  I have seen items on the shelves in supermarkets, such as tinned fruits, meat and fish which are of very poor quality, without any proper labelling.  People are paying out their hardearned money for those items in supermarkets who have imported those goods. Many of those items are inedible.  It is time the Minister controlled the standard and quality of goods sold in our supermarkets.  The only place the Minister's inspectors seem to call are at the small grocers.  They should go into a lot of the supermarkets and investigate the quality of the goods sold and the prices charged. In some of the large supermarkets people are not allowed to question the quality or the standard of the goods sold.  People have even been asked to leave those supermarkets when they raise such matters.</P>
    <P>After the last increase in the price of petrol was announced there was a misunderstanding on the part of some of the oil companies.  The price of petrol was not due to be increased until the Tuesday after it had been announced.  Some of the major oil companies charged the full increase in the price of petrol they delivered to the retailers before that date. Did the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism take any action against those oil companies?  Those major oil companies should not have been allowed to charge the increase for petrol supplies they delivered to retailers before the increase was due to take place.  They simply said afterwards that it was a misunderstanding.  If the petrol retailers had charged the increased price on the Monday the Minister should have brought them before the District Court.  If they said it was due to a misunderstanding they would have been convicted in the District Court.</P>
    <P>It is not right that there should be one law for the poor retailers, the shopkeepers and the publicans and another law for the multi-nationals.  All people are equal before the courts and before this House.  The Minister will want to tell me tonight whether or not he took any action and whether he intends taking any action against the multinationals. <Col N="545" /> The same law must be applied for everybody throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  It is a poor excuse to say it was a misunderstanding.  It is time the Minister flexed his muscles and showed a bit of guts in regard to his approaches against them.</P>
    <P>I wish to support this motion in full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point, the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, through his officials, immediately contacted the oil companies and in any case where there had been an overcharge there was an immediate refund.</P>
      <P>In speaking to the motion before the House the main point to be made is that the Government's commitment in regard to prices was, is, and will continue to be for effective price control.  Effective price control means ensuring that the minimum unavoidable price increase is passed on to the consumer.  The work of my Department and its inspectorate and the operations of the National Prices Commission are geared towards this end.  The scrutiny and the recommendations in the Department ensure that this end is met.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out last Wednesday when speaking to this motion, effective price control does not mean rejecting all applications for price increases while cost increases continue to occur.  Opposition speakers&mdash;and we have just heard an example from Deputy Enright&mdash;may indulge themselves in trying to capture newspaper headlines with raucous cries of despair at every price increase that is approved.  They cannot, however, get away from the economic facts.  If we need oil to fuel the economy we must pay the higher prices being charged by OPEC and other oil suppliers.  If we continue to award ourselves higher wages and salaries we must pay the resultant high prices for our goods and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give an example&mdash;and I do not wish to convey the impression that wages and salaries are the only factors <Col N="546" /> which cause price increases.  Let us compare the actual increases in average weekly earnings since June of 1976 with the increases provided for under the various national wage agreements in the same period.  In both cases a base wage of £51.19 per week is used; this was the actual average weekly wage in the second quarter of 1976.  Let us look, first of all, at actual earnings.  In the second quarter of 1976, taking £51.19 as the base, this has increased to the first quarter of 1979 to £76.64, an increase of 49.7 per cent.  The national wage agreements in that period provided for an increase from £51.19 to £65.58, that is, 28 per cent.  So the national wage agreements allowed for an increase of 28 per cent while wages and salaries increased by 49.7 per cent.  This gives some idea of the wage scales involved in some of the price allocations.  This compares with an increase of 31.8 per cent in the CPI in the same period.  If one compares 49.7 per cent and 31.8 per cent it will illustrate the point I am making.</P>
    <P>The consequences would be predictable if all applications for price increases were to be rejected out of hand while cost increases continued to occur. We would have bankruptcies and redundancies would follow within a short period.  In many cases supplies of goods to the Irish market would cease altogether.  Given the increased cost of imported materials and the size of the increases in money incomes which have occurred in recent years, increased costs can nowadays only very rarely be met from profits or fully offset by improvements in productivity and efficiency.  If price control were to be applied in this way it would soon become irrelevant.  No products would be available at the controlled prices and the social cost to the community would soon become intolerable.  Deputy Desmond, in proposing the motion on Wednesday evening last in his prepared script which he was kind enough to provide us with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, would the Minister say if he considers that he is entitled to use a script in view of the fact <Col N="547" /> that he objected so strongly to Deputy Desmond reading from one?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have copious notes here.  Deputy Desmond missed the section in his script.  In the unrevised report of the Dáil he said:</P>
      <P>I would strongly point out that price control and surveillance can be so operated as to limit price increases to the minimum and to prevent prices increases or charges being increased without full justification.</P>
      <P>The fact behind the recent price increases specified in the motion clearly proved that because of the efforts of the Minister and the Government price control is being operated in this way.  The Minister has already detailed for the House the cost increases which led to these price increases.  He has also made it clear to the House that, as a result of the stringent examination of the price increases proposed in the first instance by the National Prices Commission and the Minister, significant reductions were made in the price increases approved as compared with the amounts sought by the applicants.  This is the fulfilment of the Government's commitment on prices and shows the way in which the Minister has exercised his personal responsibility to ensure that price increases are thoroughly justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House speaks of the failure of the Government to live up to their commitments on price control.  The Minister has already pointed out that the main target of the Government's policy on price control is to reduce the rate of inflation.  It is interesting to look at the movement in the inflation rate in recent years and to use it as a guage to measure the success or failure of the Government's policies.  In <Col N="548" /> the three years prior to the Government's assumption of office, 1974, 1975 and 1976, we experienced annual inflation rates of 17 per cent, 20.9 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.  The movement in oil prices over the corresponding period was from $10.55 for a barrel of light Arabian crude in 1974 to $12.95 a barrel in 1976, an increase of $2.4 or 23 per cent a barrel over the period.  The annual inflation rate for 1977, 1978 and 1979, the first three years of this Government, were 13.7 per cent, 7.6 per cent and 13.2 per cent respectively. These rates are all the more impressive when one notes that oil prices over the corresponding period were a staggering 26 US dollars in 1980 from $12.70 in 1977.  That is an increase of $13.3 US or 105 per cent a barrel over the period.  It is no harm to look at those figures again. Under the Coalition Government from 1974 to 1976, inflation was 17 per cent, 20.9 per cent and 18 per cent and there was an increase in the cost of a barrel of light Arabian crude of approximately $2.4.  The Fianna Fáil Government were faced with an increase of $13.3 but we maintained inflation rates at 13.7 per cent, 7.6 per cent and 13.2 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures show that with regard to inflation the Government's targets were achieved.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, an appreciable decrease is expected in the inflation rate for the period mid-November to mid-February.  I am sure that Deputy Enright and Members on the other side of the House will be pleased about this from a national point of view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the Price Line system of notification of complaints by consumers and he urged the Government to extend the system and to make it more effective.  The Government did not have to await his urgings in this regard. When Fianna Fáil took office in 1977 there were 45 inspectors in the Department engaged in the enforcement of price control legislation and the investigation of complaints.  On 15 February 1980 the number of inspectors in the Department involved in price investigation had increased to 83.  During the year ended 28 December 1979, the inspectorate investigated 6,342 complaints received at the Price Line centres and they found that 3,798, or 60 per cent, of the complaints were well founded.  Evidence of contravention of price control orders for legal proceedings was obtained in 4,509 instances.  There were 549 breaches of price charge display orders.  As a result of the work of the inspectorate, refunds were made in 18,094 cases.  During 1979 cases against 866 traders were heard and fines and expenses totalling £5,994 were imposed in respect of breaches of orders made under the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Price Line offices have been well utilised since their establishment particularly in the larger population centres. Up to the beginning of 1980 they had dealt with approximately 66,000 complaints and enquiries.  I should like to take this opportunity to encourage all consumers to bring complaints of overcharging to the notice of my Department in order that they can be investigated.  Complaints may be brought to the attention of the Minister or of the Department or to the attention of Price Line offices throughout the country.  The <Col N="550" /> offices are located in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Athlone, Galway, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond, in proposing the motion, referred at some length to the fact that he and his colleagues in the Labour Party had been arguing for some years in favour of greater involvement of consumers in price matters.  It is the belief of the Government that the provision of the fullest possible information and advisory service to the consumer is the best way in which to get him or her involved in a beneficial way.  I am sure the figures I have provided, which show the large increase in recent years in the number of inspectors involved in this work, indicate that instead of talking about the matter for a number of years the Government have been taking decisive action.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned to ensure that the general public have as much information as is possible with regard to prices including the reasons prices are increased.  We think that the people who have to bear the brunt of the increases should know the reason.  The various consumer and price programmes presented on radio by RTE are a great help in this regard.  In addition, since the beginning of last year a member of the National Prices Commission, Mrs. Mairead Allen, has been presenting an excellent weekly prices programme each Friday on television.  I should like to take this opportunity to assure RTE that both the NPC and the Prices Division of my Department are always available and willing to provide any information or expertise that may be required in relation to prices.</P>
    <P>My Department also provide a continuous flow of information on prices matters to the national newspapers, but unfortunately it is not always published. I would be less than honest if I did not say that some newspapers seem more interested in providing scare headlines predicting huge price increases.  In my view this practice is irresponsible and it can be extremely harmful.  It is not beneficial to our efforts to improve the economy and it simply serves to <Col N="551" /> strengthen the psychology of inflation.  It can be particularly dangerous at times when wage negotiations are in the formative stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright suggested that the NPC should consider the increasing price of drugs.  He knows as well as I do that 95 per cent of drugs are imported and, as such, there is no way we can control the import price.  He spent the rest of the time speaking about matters that were more relevant to the Restrictive Practices Commission than to the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>This motion asks the House &ldquo;to note the continued failure of the Government to take decisive action in the area of the control of prices after almost three years in office&rdquo;.  The fact is that the Government have lived up to their commitment on price control.  The House and the country know this.  The changes in price control introduced since the Government took office have resulted in a far more rigorous examination of price proposals than before and have had the effect of increasing the Government's influence and control in the prices area.  Many of the procedures have been tightened up and attention has been directed to those areas where useful work can be done to maximise the effect of our price control arrangements.</P>
    <P>However, I should not like to give the impression that review of the operations of the NPC is a once-off affair.  The review is ongoing and the methods of the commission are subject to constant changes, both on their own initiative and on the direction of the Minister.  This was one of the points we put forward in our manifesto.  When Deputy Desmond was speaking here the other evening he gave the impression that the manifesto had been torn up or that copies were no longer available.  He was talking about his much-treasured copy.  There is nothing whatsoever to be hidden and to hide away from in the Government's commitment, enforcement and working of their prices proposals.</P>
    <P>In part 1 of the manifesto we promised a review of the operations of the commission.  The Minister had this as <Col N="552" /> one of his primary concerns in taking up office and he initiated a review of existing methods of price control.  He met the prices commission on a number of occasions in 1977 and discussed with them the possible restructuring of the commission together with detailed proposals for more rigorous examination of price increase applications.  Again in 1978 on a number of occasions he met them and the commission submitted to the Minister detailed reports of suggestions.  On these reports decisions were taken the details of which were released in a press statement in October 1978. These referred to such items as price contracts, notification of price increases, export exemption and transfer pricing items, the whole question of currency fluctuations and new rules and guidelines.  As well as that involvement in the re-structuring of the prices commission the Government also appointed an economist to the commission to assist them in the work as a member of the commission.</P>
    <P>In item 2 of our manifesto promise we referred to discouraging increased costs and prices in all areas where we have control or influence.  Once again I would refer to the action taken by Minister O'Malley in this field where&mdash;unlike his predecessor about whom there is no record of one single occasion in the Department where he either cut back or refused a price application&mdash;he, as part of a follow-on to our manifesto commitments to the people, on 34 different occasions has cut-back or refused price applications.</P>
    <P>In the third item of our manifesto we also committed ourselves to an investigation of such items as the cost to the housewife of fish, vegetables and so on. This investigation was carried out as we promised.  In 1977-78 we looked at the vegetable market and at meat and we had consultants appointed by the commission to look into the pricing of fish generally.</P>
    <P>In item 4 of our commitment to the people we talked of full dissemination of information with regard to prices.  I have already dealt with the operation of RTE <Col N="553" /> 2 and the radio programmes involved. As well as that, on Thursday of each week we issue to the four daily papers the results of a survey in Dublin, Cork and Limerick of fruit and vegetable prices and at least once a month we send to all of the papers the result of the survey on meat prices.  If the papers do not publish this information surely the Government cannot be held responsible for that.</P>
    <P>Item 5 of our commitment to the people in our manifesto with regard to prices referred to control by legislation, in the interests of consumers, of monopolies and mergers.  Of course the House is familiar with the fact that we introduced the monopolies legislation which has been passed and has been enforced rigorously.</P>
    <P>Item 6 of the manifesto says that we will abolish the seven-day rule arising out of the outer UK zone in respect of fuel price increases as there is no price control at all under the present system. We did it.  We abolished the seven-day rule and now all applications for price increases in fuel are examined closely on their merit, taking account of the OPEC price increases.  With item 6, as with the other five, we have met our commitments in the manifesto fully.</P>
    <P>We referred in item 7 to an investigation of Northern Ireland prices and this was carried out.  We went on to talk about cars, parts, tyres and so on.  We carried out a survey and a comparison which we extended not only to Dublin and Belfast but we looked at Liverpool as well.  The latest comparison of grocery prices in Dublin, Belfast and Liverpool was undertaken in the last week of June 1979 and produced 239 common items where a price comparison was made which showed that the total cost of the items in Dublin and Belfast was practically the same while Liverpool was 2 or 3 per cent cheaper.  We have been meeting our commitments under the manifesto.</P>
    <P>Item 8 states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will regard price control as an important matter and will <Col N="554" /> therefore revert to the position where a member of the Government is responsible for it and for dealing with the underlying causes of inflation.</P>
    <P>Of course we were all familiar with the situation under the Coalition where a Parliamentary Secretary was involved in price matters.  The previous Minister did not like to become involved in such tiresome work as examining and reading the detailed files of price applications. Minister O'Malley has undertaken that responsibility and, as can be seen from the figure of those cutbacks and refusals, has been doing it well.</P>
    <P>The last item of the commitment on prices made by the Government in the manifesto was that the accounting procedures of the ESB were being examined and brought up to date with a view to reducing the price of electricity. A high level inter-departmental committee were set up and a report from that committee is expected very shortly and action will be taken in the light of that. However, we must recognise that we are dependent for 80 per cent of electricity generation in this country on imported oil.  We cannot overlook the fact that we have seen those increases in the two year period that I spoke about earlier of 105 per cent in the cost of a barrel of light Arabian crude and this has had its effect on ESB prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department also provide a continuous flow of information on price matters through national newspapers, as I said earlier.  It is important that we get across to the people who have to pay the prices why they have to pay the prices.  I regret that the continuous flow of information is not always published.  I would like to see greater publication of some of the information that we send to explain to the public exactly what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I must admit to being somewhat perplexed at the Opposition regularly tabling motions of this nature. Their contribution to the debate on this <Col N="555" /> and on previous occasions was overwhelmingly simplistic and totally divorced from the reality of the situation. The Government have lived up to their commitment on price control, as I have outlined.  None of us would suggest that difficulties will not occur, but we will deal effectively with those difficulties as they arise.  We are not sitting back.  Price control will be kept under review to ensure that it takes a form best suited to the prevailing economic climate.  When the House consider the facts, I am confident that the motion will be defeated.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Tully starts, in view of the matter raised by him earlier, I checked on the rulings on the House down the years.

Having experienced it myself, I am amused by Ministers who when they were on this side of the House introduced all kinds of irrelevant matters into debates such as this but who have suddenly become very sedate and lecture the underlings in this House on the way in which they make their speeches.  It is also interesting to note that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, who felt so strongly about a previous Minister putting a mere Minister of State in charge of prices could not find the time to be here tonight for an important debate.</P>

      <P>The Minister has the right to listen to what has been said, especially having thrown abuse across the House last week at the people who had put down the motion.  When the last Fianna Fáil Government took office after the election the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch made a statement to the effect that he was putting a lady as Minister of State in charge of prices.  I have a great regard for Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, who is well able to deal with matters which are put under her control. When that Deputy was allocated to that job, a representative of one of the women's organisations was interviewed on television and she nearly danced a jig with delight that at last a Taoiseach was putting a woman in charge of prices. Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn slipped into the background and never came forward to take charge of prices and then Deputy O'Malley took up the cudgel and decided to deal with prices.  It is now amusing to note a suggestion that on no occasion was anybody except Deputy O'Malley in charge of prices. Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn apparently did not do so well in that job because, despite what Fianna Fáil would have us believe, prices did not go back to square one and then start rising again, prices continued to rise from the level at which they were when Fianna Fáil took office in 1977 and have been going up since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister of State talks about controlling inflation, does he remember his late colleague, the man who would arrange everything, the man who would wave a wand and put the country back into a state of prosperity? Does the Deputy remember when this man convinced everybody, including his own colleagues, that the rate of inflation in 1979 would be not 12, 13, or 20 per cent but 5 per cent?  That man possibly got the sack for making a wrong guess. It is amusing to hear people saying that Fianna Fáil are doing very well, that they are keeping inflation under 20 per <Col N="557" /> cent, when they were predicting that the inflation rate would be 5 per cent.  We are at four times that and it is still going up, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond has been taken to task about what he said in reference to the manifesto.  I do not have the respect he has for the manifesto, which contained the seed from which the Fianna Fáil victory sprung.  If it was not so tragic it would be funny to hear the Fianna Fáil representatives claiming that what was promised in the manifesto has been implemented.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the Minister of State because, like myself and like his father was, he is in touch with the people and must know that we have again reached the stage where old people can tell us that they have not tasted meat in over two years, that they are not able to buy the necessities of life and that the only place they are warm is in bed.  Indeed, some of them have died in bed.  There are people with plenty of money to buy whatever they want.  We do not begrudge them that, but we feel that they should pay their share in order to help the less well off.  This Government deliberately increased prices by removing the food subsidies which were put on to keep prices down to aid the poor people. Before that, Fianna Fáil removed the wealth tax from a small number of immensely wealthy people who, if they lived to be as old as Methuselah and never got another shilling, would not be able to spend what they have.  That situation makes us cynical about what Fianna Fáil really believe.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the increase in the average industrial wage but I wonder if he has ever stopped to think what &ldquo;average&rdquo; means.  It means taking the wage at the bottom of the scale, adding it to the wage at the top and then dividing them.  There are hundreds of thousands of people working all week for a wage of £40 or £50, or perhaps as much as £60, on which they are trying to exist and rear a family while also paying tax under the PAYE system. Hundreds of these workers are employed <Col N="558" /> in small industries throughout the country.  Farm workers have received a fairly substantial increase in wages and a reduction in hours but they are still amongst the lowest paid.  The same applies to non-professional people working in hospitals.  I was a trade union official for 30 years and I tried to drag those people off their knees.  It is sad in 1980 to see that they are still unable to buy shoes for their children if they are to feed them every day.  A child may come home from school with a bill for books amounting to £10 and in many cases there are six or seven children in the family.  What are the parents to do?  If they spend the money on school books they cannot buy food and clothing.  The Government seem to think such people are doing well enough and if that is their idea they are living in ivory towers from which they will soon be flung.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the way in which price increases are notified to the public and the great care taken to ensure that the report on prices is passed to the Government.  It is not correct to say that there was no case where prices recommended to the Minister's predecessor were altered.  I was a member of that Cabinet and I know the facts.  It is unethical that the matter should be raised here and I consider that it is a misstatement.  When we were in office prices which were sanctioned at the Cabinet table were published in the newspapers but the present Minister said he would stop that practice because it was not necessary.  There is no means by which the general public can become aware of price increases unless they can read them in print.  Fianna Fáil were too clever for that; they would not be caught in that way.  Some people may hear a radio broadcast or read something in a paper but if increases are published in the national newspapers on a monthly basis everybody should be aware of them.  At present most people are not aware of price increases until they go shopping.</P>
    <P>How are people to know what items have been increased when the report of the prices commission is not published <Col N="559" /> until months afterwards?  The last report published related to November and the December and January reports have yet to be published.  The reason why newspapers will not go to the trouble of publishing these reports is that the news is already stale.  The Official Report of debates in this House is printed within 24 hours or, at most, 72 hours and we have no trouble in getting it from one week to the next.  The delay in publishing the prices reports would seem to be an attempt to cover up price increases.  The newspapers publish some information which is given by the Minister's Department.  The number of price increases published each week is about three or four, but the average per month is 40. In the month of November there were 53 price increases.</P>
    <P>While this debate is concerned with consumer goods, we tend to concentrate on food but everything else is increasing as well.  Increases take place not over a period of months but from week to week on items which some might consider luxuries but which are necessities for ordinary living.  Fianna Fáil sit back and say they are doing very well and carrying out their promises.  They said they would introduce stricter controls on prices and I was very amused at the Minister's comment about having the strictest price controls in the EEC.  He talked of worrying about not allowing large enough increases and the difficulties experienced by some manufacturers.  I know some increases are requested which are very much in excess of what is required and some of these are allowed.  Even the granting of a small proportion of such requests is deplorable.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State talked about oil prices.  I have great respect for the Minister of State and I would hate to say that he had said anything dishonest.  However, it is dishonest to say that the percentage increase in oil prices now is greater than it was in 1973-74.  As Deputy Enright pointed out earlier, there was one six-month period when oil prices quadrupled and despite that prices were kept down, <Col N="560" /> though Fianna Fáil kept yapping about prices from the Opposition benches as if all they had to do was get back into power and wave a magic wand which would cause prices to go down.</P>
    <P>Let us consider food prices.  A crack was made about the fact that Deputy Barry Desmond spoke of hotel prices. One could have a meal in a hotel at night and pay two or three times the amount which one would pay for the same meal at lunchtime.  If one goes to Washington one can buy much cheaper meals than are available here and it is not correct to say that wages are lower.  Steak can be bought in a shop in Washington for about half the price charged in Ireland. We have been told that the Government are regularly monitoring meat prices. Like everything else, fruit, fish and vegetables, they keep an eye on the prices of those commodities and inspect them but they do not do anything else. They consider that the fact that the eye of the Government has fallen on those items should be sufficient for our people. They feel they should not be expected to do anything more and the fact that the great white chiefs have looked at those commodities should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not we are reaching a stage where an enormous number of our people are finding it very difficult to exist.  I would hate to guess at what will be in tomorrow's budget but I can recall the Minister for Finance's predecessor telling us about taxing short-term social welfare benefits.  If that is done more people will be put on the breadline and bread is not something that can be purchased too cheaply now. In my constituency recently I met an old age pensioner who told me he had to buy two bags of coal weekly to keep his house warm.  That pensioner had been down to the local shop and with £1 left out of his pension wanted to get half-a-dozen eggs, a loaf&mdash;one of the ones which Deputy O'Malley says is not bought too often and now costs an extra 5p&mdash;and a half pound of rashers, but he did not have sufficient money in that £1 for those messages.  This is an <Col N="561" /> agricultural country but people cannot buy things because they cannot afford them.</P>
    <P>The one thing which, above all else, will damn Fianna Fáil when they next go to the polls is the question of prices. Shoes have also increased in price.  I am aware that the smallest of shoes for my grandchildren cost between £7 and £11 and they are not fancy shoes.  A working man when he goes to purchase an ordinary pair of shoes or boots will be presented with pairs costing £25 to £30 but will have to be satisfied with a very poor pair costing £17 or £18.  In the last ten years I admired the fact that people in country districts were dressing better but because those people can no longer pay for clothing they have to resort to using patches again.  I will not go into the increase in the price of oil and petrol because those who use cars and burn oil for central heating are a little better off than the average person.  However, I know of working people who used drive from my constituency to work in Dublin and have had to give up work because of the cost of petrol and repairs.  The price charged for spares and repairs have gone through the roof.  It is not safe to pass a garage slowly because one is likely to be given an estimate for £100 for repairing a dinge one had not noticed.  Damage to cars is also increasing because local authorities are unable to repaid roads.  I am told that one of the reasons for this is that materials have got very expensive.</P>
    <P>All prices have gone through the roof without the realisation of the situation having seeped through Fianna Fáil.  The extraordinary thing is that Fianna Fáil are satisfied that once they are in power such things do not happen or if they do, it is too bad, it is the people who are responsible for such increases and not the great white chiefs.  We have been told many times about what the new Fianna Fáil Government propose to do.  I do not know why it has been described as a new Government because it consists of ten of the scrap 15 they had running the country up to December.  We have not been told how they intend improving the situation of the ordinary people.  The <Col N="562" /> only way they can improve their position is to do something definite about prices.</P>
    <P>The Government did not have any hesitation in taking off all the subsidy on some food and half the subsidy on other items and they have threatened to remove the balance of the subsidy tomorrow.  I suggest that before they do that they should take the money they need from the rich.  There are enough rich people to pay for the subsidy required.  Deputy O'Malley bragged about the two slight reductions in ESB charges which were given shortly after he took office.  Had the accountancy been a little better and had the ESB looked at what they were doing they would not have had to look for three times the amount he took off within a short period afterwards.  It is obvious that Deputy O'Malley bullied the ESB into giving the reductions because he felt that cosmetically such a move would look well.  However, the money had to be found somewhere and it was found by taking it out of the pockets of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasted about the difference between the price of bottled gas here and in Great Britain.  He told us that bottled gas here had only increased to £3.60 while the same size cyclinder cost more than £4 in Great Britain.  Just a few years ago the price of bottled gas, including the cylinder, was 75p but now the cylinder alone costs £10.  Fianna Fáil seem to think that this is a grand way to treat our people.  After all, they feel that when Fianna Fáil are in office everybody should be warm and should not need such things as bottled gas.  In relation to coal prices I should like to remind the Minister that the National Prices Commission reported on the price of coal, a report which was not published for several months after it had been presented to the Minister.  Coal merchants then increased the price of coal by less than half the recommendation in that report. After a short time the merchants had another look at the report and felt they had been foolish and the Government felt it was all right for them to increase <Col N="563" /> the price of coal again.  After all, why should they take 25p when they could get 50p.  Knowing the Minister's family background I am sure he has never had the experience of waiting for the coalman to deliver one bag of coal per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised to hear that.  When the coalman arrives the woman of the house meets him with the money for the previous week's supply but more often than not she is informed that the price has increased by 25p or so. Very often housewives do not have that extra money.  In country districts coal merchants, who are not in the business in a big way, must wait for their money with the result that somebody else must go short.  The situation is similar in regard to milk.  Families must now cut back by at least one bottle of milk per day because of the increase in price.  The Government should come down from cloud nine and realise that the fact that they are in Government does not matter that much.  Prices have been increasing and I am not sure if they are aware of that.  Those who must buy a lot of food weekly are finding it almost impossible to pay for it.</P>
      <P>Ministers and in particular the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, are talking through their hats if they think that workers will be satisfied without an increase or with a very small increase in wages this year when the Government have not made any effort to keep prices at a reasonable level.  Unless there is some attempt to rectify the situation wages must continue to increase because the workers are not prepared to accept the sort of codology in which the Government have been engaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly on the continuous flow of comment in regard to our election manifesto.  I would suggest to the Opposition that there was a good deal of significance in the extent to which they lost the last election and in the extent to which we won it.  More than any other <Col N="564" /> issue, the question of prices was the greatest factor in the downfall of the Coalition.</P>
      <P>The National Prices Commission exercise the strictest control possible on prices.  Senator Keating, as Minister, set up under the NPC a study group to investigate price levels and they found that prices were reasonable and fair.  A similar exercise has been repeated since. The Opposition, if they wish to be critical in regard to the dedicated and positive work of the commission, should put forward some tangible alternative recommendations: they have a duty to spell out an alternative mechanism.</P>
      <P>It is particularly interesting that Deputy Desmond should have moved this motion.  As colleagues on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Semi-State Bodies, he and I have been present in recent months when both CIE and Board na Móna were being investigated by the committee.  In every instance the senior executives representing these companies were able to more than justify the price increases that were granted by the NPC. Therefore, Deputy Desmond is not being constructive in coming in here and criticising semi-State bodies who are doing very worthwhile jobs and who, despite having to seek increases in costs, make every effort to hold prices at reasonable levels.  In the case of Bord na Móna we were told that peat briquettes which are a basic commodity produced by the company, are one of the cheapest forms of fuel available but that they were held at artificially low prices. The result has been that demand cannot be met in terms of output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, there is the question of oil prices and without going into detail in respect of the rapid increases that have taken place in this regard, we must realise that oil prices will increase further.  During the past ten years oil prices have increased by 2,000 per cent. The Coalition failed miserably to make any impact on price control.  Today at the meeting of the EEC Consumer Group in Dublin, everybody concerned was given an opportunity to state his case on prices.  We can never be happy <Col N="565" /> with a situation of continuing price increases but we must face facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of how best one might deal with the question of price increases, excessive claims can be made by one side to the effect that prices can be contained.  This charge can be laid fairly at the door of the present administration because I recall a time, not so very long ago either, when Deputies who are now in Government claimed from the Opposition benches, that the element in price increases which related to external events could be ignored or minimised and that sole responsibility for the high inflation of the period between 1975 and 1977 could be laid squarely at the door of those who were presumptuous enough to usurp the position of Government.</P>
      <P>The claim was made by those Deputies at the time that by their being created a different psychological climate as a result of the return to office of Fianna Fáil, the whole matter of increases and of inflation could be contained.  These are the same Deputies who, now transformed into Ministers and Ministers of State, must admit that the external element in price increases must be accepted.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism makes the point that this motion represents merely a ritual exercise on the part of the Labour Party, an exercise which he says he expects will be repeated at six-monthly intervals.  He is right in so far as his reference to six-monthly intervals is concerned.  In fairness to that Minister he was not ashamed to acknowledge the debt of the Government to the manifesto programme.  We know that very high reputations have hit the dust because of their connections with that programme, that while some people have lost their positions in the Cabinet because of it, others are trying to gain admission to some positions near the Cabinet by disavowing any connection with the manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that we thought Fianna Fáil were joking when they said <Col N="566" /> they would reduce inflation to 7 per cent. We know now that they were joking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Inflation was reduced to that level in 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in 1980 the figure is expected to be between 16 and 18 per cent.  It is always possible in a particularly favourable period to select figures to suggest what was done, but the reality is that the Government have not been able to exorcise that element in price increases that is caused by external events.  The last speaker, another potential Minister of State, referred to that aspect when he talked about oil price increases.  In the autumn of 1973 there occurred an event which was not regarded by the then Opposition as being of any significance.  I refer to an increase in oil prices to the extent of 400 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That opened up a whole new era and we can never return to the period of cheap energy.  Therefore, all future Irish Governments must cope in the best way possible with the question of price control.  This Government are presiding over an economy in which inflation, depending on what steps are to be taken tomorrow in the area of indirect taxation, may increase to 16 per cent. There is nobody in Opposition who takes satisfaction from that prospect.  It is a situation which erodes any public confidence there may be in the democratic system and puts a question mark over this Parilament because members of the public will query the effectiveness of having a parliament which appears to be impotent on the question of how people may live in a situation in which prices increase from week to week.  To the ordinary person going to his supermarket, there seems to be no end to price increases.  Protests about the Government's inability to contain price increases come ill from the members of an administration who deliberately dismantled the food subsidies programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> There were many mistakes made by the previous administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the electorate did not forget when it came to election day.  Those who are flushed with office, with new titles, who survived the recent spring cleaning and who now consider that their futures are secure, might dwell on the message of 1977 because that message was not confined solely to the Coalition.  It can be applied just as impartially in a future election to another administration.</P>
      <P>Chief among the reasons for the despatch of the 1977 administration was the electorate's perception that we had not tackled the employment question nor had we coped successfully with price increases.  If things do not change for the better, an adverse conclusion on the performance of the Government will be applied to the present administration.  The Minister of State sitting opposite will figure in the rogues' gallery if there is not a change for the better in 1980.  He may say, and his Minister may also say, with all the eloquence at their command and with all the figures supplied by the Department that what happened was not their fault, but there is rough justice in the democratic system.  If you happen to be in the hot seat on the day the figures are not good, you know where you will go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much that Fianna Fáil are democrats as that they cannot avoid facts.  The facts in 1980 point to an inflation rate of up to 18 per cent.  If the Minister of State is speaking in North County Dublin, or in any other part of this city, blaming the Arabs for the present situation, he will not convince anybody.  Fianna Fáil claimed they could contain price increases and said the previous administration were unable to deal with them.  They now have a mandate but are not dealing with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> Fianna Fáil said they are coping with this situation as best they can and that prices are getting through the grid not by carelessness on their part but simply because they cannot be avoided.  One of the flaws in that argument is that at a certain point they deliberately dismantled portion of the food subsidies and it is open to question what they intend to do about the remaining food subsidies.</P>
    <P>If we might mention in this House a Deputy's name without doing him further damage or without embarrassing Fianna Fáil Deputies who may have dined off his political decease, the last Minister for Economic Planning and Development, at one stage, boasted that it was perfectly appropriate to get rid of food subsidies because they were only necessary at a time of high inflation which was a thing of the wicked National Coalition past.</P>
    <P>I hope tomorrow we may see some reversal in the phasing out of food subsidies.  I say that knowing we should cut public expenditure but believing that where such cuts hurt the lowest income groups in our society that is bad politics and should not be supported.  That Minister explained the rationale in which he decided to dismantle the food subsidies but that rationale cannot hold at a time when the inflation rate is swinging between 16 and 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that many of our difficulties in the price increase area come from outside the country.  I agree that a period of expensive energy costs cannot be shrugged off and that we cannot pretend&mdash;as was pretended for political gain by Fianna Fáil Deputies when in Opposition&mdash;that what the Arabs did was of no account to us and that somehow Mighty Mouse Ireland could ignore what the Arabs did.  We now have Ministers wandering all over the gulf. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is declaring that he is <i>ad idem</i> with the PLO in an effort to get oil a little cheaper than the going market rate.  It is no longer possible to ignore the fact that what happens in the outside world affects us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> In this city we have a monoply in the supply of coal.  I respect the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  I regard him as one of the few people in the Cabinet who is serious about his work.  He admits that he does not care for the coal monopoly situation in Dublin.  I have a letter from him in which he says he would like to encourage alternative sources of supply. As we all know, there are people willing to take on the burden by attempting to introduce competition into the supply of coal in Dublin.  Up to a few years ago we could have ignored this situation but it is now a very important matter because I do not believe the consumer is paying a competitive price for his bag of coal.  We are talking about bags of coal bought by the old age pensioner of a family.</P>
    <P>This is relevant to this motion.  If we could do anything which would guarantee the consumer a more competitive price, we should do it.  I hope the Minister who may think that this motion is purely a ritual will at least take a lesson from it and do everything in his power to ensure that prices are as competitive as possible.  He should encourage the emergence in Dublin of competition in the supply of coal.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask why the Labour Party put down such a motion at six-monthly intervals.  There would not be any point to this Parliament if we did not <Col N="570" /> reflect the concern of ordinary people, if we were seen to be unheeding, to show no evidence of concern about the predicament of the people when it comes to daily price rises, which occur for very frivolous reasons in their eyes.  If this motion reminds those in office that this is a serious issue, it will have served its purpose.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission may be doing everything possible but I would like the position to be re-examined to allow a more public scrutiny of price applications.  The public are under the impression that too much of the investigative work and that too many price applications are accepted in circles of confidentiality.  We should let the public know why price increases are granted.  It may be argued that for commercial reasons this may not be possible, but I do not believe that argument can be advanced in every case.  Perhaps the Minister would re-examine whether it would be possible to have the proceedings of the National Prices Commission conducted in public.  If a PAYE worker wants a wage increase he or she must go to the Labour Court and the proceedings are argued in public. Similarly it should be necessary for the firm seeking a price increase, for good or bad reasons, to argue a case in public and let the public be the jury.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the Russian invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, the Government intend to revoke the deal for refuelling facilities for the Russian airline at Shannon Airport and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is not the intention of the Government to revoke the agreement. Negotiations on this inter-governmental agreement which facilitates technical landings at Shannon Airport by the USSR Airline, Aeroflot, on transit flights between the USSR and countries in the western hemisphere were concluded at talks between officials of the two countries in October of last year.  This agreement was a follow-up to a commercial agreement negotiated between Aer Rianta and Aeroflot in July of last year.</P>
      <P>Normally a further agreement is not necessary before such a commercial agreement comes into force.  However, as the Soviet Union is not a party to the International Air Services Transit Agreement 1944 (under which states mutually exchange the rights to overfly and to land for non-traffic purposes), whereas Ireland is, a further agreement relating to technical landings was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement relates exclusively to technical landings for non-traffic purposes and is not a bilateral air services agreement.  Agreements of the latter type which are more comprehensive than air transit agreements and confer the right to take on or put down passengers, <Col N="446" /> cargo and mail are in force between the Soviet Union and most western European countries.</P>

His statement, which was related to commissioned <Col N="447" /> ranks, was to the effect that in nearly all ranks our Defence Forces equate to the ranks as they exist in most of the other western nations except in the case of commandant which is the equivalent of major in most other armies.  This statement was based on information available in relation to various western, including European, countries, for instance, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Norway and the Netherlands.</P>

      <P>Development co-operation offices have been opened in Maseru (Lesotho) and, more recently, in Dar-esSalaam (Tanzania).  It is hoped to open a similar office in Lusaka (Zambia) shortly.  The objective of these offices is to promote, supervise and monitor progress of the Irish development co-operation programmes in the countries in which they are located, all of which are priority countries in our bilateral aid programme administered by my Department.  Each <Col N="449" /> office is staffed by an officer of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Garda strength of Coolock Garda district is 108.  The Garda authorities state that the strength of the district is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  However, the question of increasing Garda strength in the district will be further considered according as additional gardaí, at present being trained, become available for assignment in the coming months.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to established practice and to the public interest to give details of the numbers of gardaí allocated to particular areas or to particular duties at any particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of providing new Garda stations at places such as Donaghmede or Portmarnock, it is necessary to examine critically whether a local station is the best way of providing effective policing.  The opening of a new station in any area involves not only capital expenditure but the assignment to indoor station duty of gardai who might possibly be better engaged on outdoor Garda work, especially when supported by modern communications systems. The greater use of mobile patrols may, in many cases, provide a more effective service.  As essentially the same issues arise ina a number of areas at present, and as certain pilot schemes may have to be introduced <Col N="451" /> for test purposes, it is likely to be some time before any firm decision can be taken in relation to Portmarnock or Donaghmede.</P>

      <P>Several efforts have been made over the past two years to have a suitably experienced solicitor appointed to the position of General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court to replace a solicitor from the staff of the Land Registry who filled the position on a whole-time basis for some years since May 1971.  These efforts included the holding of two competitions, one confined to solicitors in the civil service and one public competition.</P>
      <P>I should explain for the record that the appointment of a general solicitor is, by law, a matter for the President of the High Court.  I want to make it quite clear, however, that the delay in filling the position can in no way be attributed to him.  The delay has been due to difficulties altogether outside his control.</P>
      <P>Because of the difficulties in filling the position, the solicitor from the Land Registry staff who filled it on a whole-time basis for some years since May 1971 continues, out of a sense of public duty, to do so for a considerable period in addition to performing his duties in the Land Registry after he had returned there on promotion.  I want to take this opportunity of recording my appreciation of his public-spiritedness in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the officer from the Land Registry returned to his duties there, the efforts to fill the position of general solicitor have been intensified but, so far, without success.  However, it is hoped that the new salary scale now applicable to the position&mdash;£11,617 to £13,415 <Col N="452" /> with effect from 1 March 1980 as compared with £8,437 to £9,575 when it was advertised last year&mdash;will attract suitably experienced solicitor candidates under a proposed new competition, for the holding of which urgent arrangements are being made.</P>
    <P>Efforts are also continuing to provide a replacement for an assistant solicitor in the office who resigned his position some time ago: difficulties in filling this position have also been experienced.</P>

      <P>The corresponding figures for 31 December 1979 indicate that on that date tax had not been formally assessed in some 2,100 cases.  In 2,030 of these cases returns were still outstanding, while the remaining 70 cases were under scrutiny.</P>
      <P>A case refers to the tax payable by a taxpayer on any one valuation date. Hence a particular taxpayer will be counted three times in the figure 2,100 above if his returns for all three valuation dates are unassessed.  Similar considerations apply to the figures quoted in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Examination and assessment of cases in which returns are submitted is proceeding.  Cases in which returns are outstanding are being followed up and the requirements of the Revenue Commissioners are being insisted on in full. Interest on tax in arrear is accruing at the rate of 1.25 per cent per month or part of a month.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that substantial payments on account of tax have been made in cases in which returns are outstanding.  These payments amounted to £3,260,000 on 30 April 1979 and the corresponding figure on 31 December 1979 was £2,878,000, the decrease of £382,000 being due to the formal assessment of returns between those two dates.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Government have abandoned their commitment to medium-term economic planning, given the widespread speculation on capital spending cuts and the preface to the recent White Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Such speculation that there may have been about cuts in capital spending was not justified.  The allocation for the <Col N="456" /> 1980 Public Capital Programme comes to £1,154 million and represents an increase of over 15 per cent on the 1979 outturn.</P>
      <P>The preface to the recent White Paper &ldquo;Investment and National Development, 1979-1983&rdquo; noted that since the paper was finalised, there had been a deterioration in both the international outlook and the domestic situation, particularly in relation to the price and availability of energy.  It went on to point out that consequently the prospects for the Irish economy would be adversely affected and the various assumptions and expectations outlined in the paper would need to be reassessed in the light of these developments.  This, the preface concluded, would be one of the main tasks of the Government in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The recognition in the preface of the changed economic situation suggests neither any dilution of the Government's commitment to planning nor a departure from their underlying approach to developmental needs.  Thus, the White Paper stated&mdash;paragraph 6.5&mdash;that, in the allocation of capital emphasis would be given to meeting the investment needs of manufacturing industry, and the Public Capital Programme has provided for an increase of 21½ per cent in the provision for capital expenditure by the three bodies engaged in industrial promotion&mdash;the Industrial Development Authority (IDA), Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (SFADCo) and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The White Paper also indicated that there would be a shift in the allocation of resources towards infrastructure.  The infrastructural provision in the Public Capital Programme includes increases of over 44 per cent for expenditure on energy and over 27 per cent for improving telecommunications.</P>

      <P>The 1980 Public Capital Programme at £1,154.09 million represents an increase of £152.96 million or more than 15 per cent on the 1979 outturn.  Therefore, there has been no overall cut in public investment for 1980. The increase in the size of the programme is not as great as in recent years but it has been set at the maximum level consistent with the need to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement. Unless borrowing is reduced to a sustainable level the maintenance of a satisfactory growth-rate in the mediumterm could be put at serious risk.</P>
      <P>The composition of the programme has been devised with particular reference to the requirements for medium-term economic growth.  For example, the capital allocations for industrial promotion and infrastructural development have been increased by over 21 per cent and 33 per cent respectively.</P>

Consultation with any other contracting party determined to have a &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; in the concession is also required.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the situation whereby former employees of health boards do not qualify for free electricity or other such benefits on retirement, and if he will make an order including them with other recipients of social welfare retirement pensions in view of the fact that they have made equal contributions.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the position and it is not quite as indicated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Those retired health board employees who satisfy the conditions for a social welfare retirement pension already qualify for free electricity and other allowances provided they satisfy the remaining qualifying conditions.  They would be employees who pay full social welfare contributions which give cover for all benefits and pensions.</P>
      <P>Those retired health board employees who have paid only modified rates of social welfare contributions, which give cover for a limited range of benefits only, do not qualify for social welfare retirement pension, title to which would in turn give them title to free electricity and other allowances.</P>

      <P>The connection of new subscribers has had to be restricted in parts of the Cork North-East constituency until additional exchange equipment becomes available at a number of exchanges in the area.  It is expected that connections will begin to be made on a general basis before the end of this year when extra equipment is installed at a number of exchanges in the area.</P>

Six of these have been provided on a trial basis in Dublin, four at Aston's Quay and one each at Cathal Brugha Street and Lower Abbey Street.  While not vandal proof, these structures should be less prone to mis-use.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 422 and 423 together.</P>
      <P>It is the normal practice of my Department to grant a rebate of rental where telephone service has been interrupted over a period.  Rebates of telephone rental were therefore allowed to all subscribers connected to manual telephone exchanges in respect of the period their service was interrupted during the postal strike and to subscribers in automatic areas whose telephones were out of order.  Subscribers with coin-box lines in automatic areas were in a position to make local calls and to receive incoming calls from their own exchange area and from other automatic exchange areas.  Since these subscribers received much of their normal service, a general reduction in rental for them was not considered warranted.  My Department are, of course, prepared to consider claims for rebates from these subscribers where it can be shown that service was seriously disrupted.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the reason for the poor quality of the telephone service in the Blanchardstown-Castleknock area of County Dublin where cable joints seem susceptible to damage by flooding, the reason for the delay in servicing new estates in the area, and when it is proposed to improve matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has, I regret, been a number of interruptions to telephone service in the area recently, mainly due to damage to the underground cables by flooding which has been quite severe in the area over the last month.  This is a developing area and with road widening and other construction work taking place, cables have been affected in a way that left them susceptible to damage by flooding.  Some cables have also been affected by chemical action from the soil but these cables are replaced according as this becomes necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the high incidence of flood <Col N="475" /> damage in the Dublin area, it is not possible to restore service in some cases as quickly as I would like but every effort is being made to have the repairs attended to as soon as possible.</P>
