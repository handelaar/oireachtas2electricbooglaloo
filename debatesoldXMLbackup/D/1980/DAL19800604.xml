      <P>On the Order of Business, yesterday when we were discussing the Finance Bill I asked the Minister for Finance on three occasions to comment on an article that appeared in one of the newspapers yesterday about the tax rebate for couples as a result of the Supreme Court case.  Each time the Minister said it would come up later.  In one newspaper this morning it is reported that a letter was issued to Deputies and another newspaper said that a Bill has been produced relating to this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises because of the low rate of interest&mdash;9 per cent&mdash;which is charged on outstanding death duties.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is as interested as I am in seeing a proper balance between those who pay on time and those who do not.  It would seem reasonable to ensure that the interest rates applicable on outstanding debts should be commensurate with the interest rates applicable at the moment. They are not.  At 15 per cent they would be less than the going rate.  It seems reasonable to increase it from 9 per cent to 15 per cent in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We must oppose this because this would mean that, unless it was revoked by the House in the future, no matter what the interest rates were in commercial banks or any institution the <Col N="1505" /> interest rate for people who are overdue on their payment of death duties would be 15 per cent, even if they came down to 7 per cent or 8 per cent outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must know that the figure of 15 per cent is a good bit below the actual going commercial rates of this state.  I hope that we will see a reduction in the historically high interest rates which apply here and elsewhere at the moment.  Although I am hopeful about this I cannot see a reduction to a level which would mean that this would be a penalty rate, having regard to what the rates might be in the course of the coming year.  So far as we are dealing with the outstanding tax I am sure it is acceptable by all that those who pay on time, who meet their obligations to each other, should not be at a disadvantage. Those who have been delaying their payments should not be encouraged to do that by abnormally low interest rates.  There is disturbing evidence of people being advised to withhold because of the low rate of interest at the moment.  Nobody would want to see that continuing.  I presume that applies to both sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, if there are delayed payments at the present time, in many cases it is farmers with large families and business people with large families who are unable through no fault of their own to meet this when it is due?  Would he not agree that due to the high inflation and the recession we have at the moment, which is due to a large extent to the non-governing of the Government, many of those people are unable to meet their commitments?  Would he not agree that it will place an undue hardship on those people and that the majority of people meet their commitments when they are due if they are able?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This has nothing to do with the majority of people who pay their tax or with those who face hardship <Col N="1506" /> one way or the other.  This is in relation to a significant number of outstanding cases where people have not paid.  Let me remind the Deputies opposite, in case they think what is being done here is unprecedented, that it is bringing the interest rates back to something even below the going rate at the moment, at 15 per cent.  The Deputies opposite should remember that there was a similar provision during the time they were in office, except that it was 18 per cent rather than 15 per cent.  There is no use in implying that what is being done here is something new and tyrannical when in fact the evidence is there that it was even higher before.  Having regard to the historically high rates at the moment it would seem reasonable at least to adjust this, if not in line with these rates, at least somewhere close to them.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, what type of taxes and duties are covered by the expression &ldquo;death duties&rdquo;?  Are we talking about capital acquisitions tax?  What area is covered by the expression &ldquo;death duties&rdquo;?  As the Minister knows, most of those were abolished by the Coalition Government some years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about estate, legacy and succession duties.  It is appropriate to mention that in respect of all other taxes the interest rate is 15 per cent at the moment.  We are lining up the estate, legacy and succession duties with that rate in respect of outstanding liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take all of the time available to me.  I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence in this matter.  We are dealing here with an unprecedented situation because the development of interest rates here in the past year arises in a new context, the European Monetary System, with tight exchange controls and an independent currency.  The determination of the level of interest rates is therefore an entirely domestic matter.  It was not the case prior to March of last year when our currency was linked in parity with sterling, there was no exchange control and when in the nature of things Irish interest rates could not deviate by more than a relatively small fraction from interest rates elsewhere.  In those circumstances the level of interest rates was not primarily a matter of Government responsibility.  While no doubt from time to time Oppositions have criticised Governments about interest rates, there was not much Governments could do about it.  That is as true during the period when the National Coalition were in power as when Fianna Fáil were in power.  References to the 18 per cent, which the Minister allegedly implied applied previously, are irrelevant.</P>
      <P>We are now in a position where interest rates are determined by our policy. The reason why interest rates are at their present level is quite simple and should be clearly understood by everyone in the country.  It is because the Government pre-empted the greater part of the available credit because of their failure to control their own finances, which they have allowed over three years to get totally out of control in a manner which is excoriated by the Central Bank in a report recently published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not debating the economy.  I am discussing one issue only, interest rates and the reason why interest rates are at their present level. The reason why the Minister's ruling was 15 per cent is because the general level of interest rates is now very high. He has correctly said that they are higher than 15 per cent.  Why are they higher, why is it necessary for the Minister to move this resolution?  It is necessary because the Government by pre-empting the greater volume of credit have so reduced the volume of credit available for the private sector that the supply and demand factors operating, the demand for credit exceeding supply, have pushed up interest rates domestically to a level twice that in some other nearby countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still some delusion on the part of people in the country that our interest rates are at their present level because they are like that in Britain and as long as the British have high interest rates we have to have them.  This, of course, is nonsense.  We have tight exchange controls and an independent currency.  It is we who should determine the interest rates.  Just as Germany with rather looser exchange control arrangements <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain and ourselves have interest rates at half our level, so could we have, if this Government pursued a policy of financial prudence.  The Government have forced interest rates to the present level.  The Government have pre-empted the greater volume of credit and have thereby narrowed the market for credit to the private sector to a point where interest rates have been forced up to a level where many forms of borrowing exceed 20 per cent in terms of the free market that relates to institutions <Col N="1509" /> other than the associated banks, thereby forcing the associated banks to increase interest rates in order to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>We are, for the first time, facing a situation where the Government by their incompetence and mismanagement have forced interest rates to this level and are now penalising the people who owe money to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to death duties, which they are in many cases unable to pay because of the credit squeeze enforced by the Government's incompetence which has pushed interest rates to this level.  If ever there was a vicious circle this is one.  The Government over-borrow creating a credit squeeze so that people cannot borrow the money necessary to pay and will be forced to sell out their firms in order to pay.  They will find themselves doubly penalised because they cannot pay.  The Government's policies have made credit unavailable for the purpose of tiding them over to enable them to maintain their firm until they can pay the money.  They are now forced to pay a level of interest which has been forced up artificially by the Government.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there is a clause which deals with the question of payment by instalment and that there is an element of alleviation in that.  Obviously that alleviation is not available to everyone.  If it were, there would be no mention of 15 per cent.  That 15 per cent will be applied to people who are unable to pay death duties because of the Government's policy and who are forced to pay this interest rate because of the Government's policy.  In those circumstances and in the conditions now prevailing since last March this measure is unacceptable and indefensible.  That is the least that could be said by anyone with any knowledge of the present economic situation or any concern for justice between the Government and people especially people in the position of having to pay death duties where in fact the integrity of the enterprise may be threatened because the vast bulk of enterprise here is privately owned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> We enormously alleviated the burden of estate duty which is limited now to inheritance and acquisition tax.  The original death duties are gone but for some people there still remains a burden which they cannot discharge in these circumstances where Government policy has left them with no available credit and is penalising them by charging a penal rate of interest which derives from the Government's incompetence in managing the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to sums owing to the State by way of taxation whether capital or current it is evident that interest of some kind has to be paid. But in relation to death duties in particular certain problems arise some of which have been adverted to by Deputy FitzGerald and others which should also engage the Minister's attention.  One of the problems that may arise is in relation to the length of time it takes to complete certain legal formalities which may be necessary before the person who has been assessed for death duties is in a position to pay them.  There may be no hardship in the paying of these death duties but the legal formalities that must be completed before he can acquire control of the resources with which to discharge his debt may be totally out of his control.  Anybody here who has had the experience of administering or helping to administer the estate of a relative or friend will know that the delays can be considerable even though they may relate only to small amounts of money and to what appear to the lay person to be small legal points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the rate of interest to be attached to outstanding death duties, death duties are a wasting asset.  The previous Government decided to abolish death duties and introduce a different system of capital taxation.  In these circumstances and given this Government's attitude to capital taxation in general, it is inescapable that the Government's newly discovered need to put this rate of interest on death duties outstanding is related not to any concepts of equity or encouraging rapidity of payment but simply to the fact that they are extremely <Col N="1511" /> short of money owing to the financial policies adopted in other areas.  If the Government had not abolished wealth tax they would not be in here with this resolution hounding the relatively few people who are still liable for the payment of death duties in respect of estates that they may be administering for an additional 10 per cent interest.  This resolution can only be seen in the general context of the Government's frenetic attempt to pick up a few quid anywhere they can to help pay the massive bills they have amassed for the Irish people over the last three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about interest rates charged on debts owed to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of death duties.  I presume that all of the deaths in question took place prior to 1 April 1974.  I understand that there are quite a number of people whose estates have not been sorted out even after that period because of legal delays.  The people now find themselves in the position that they have to pay death duties at this stage, when farmers for instance, have very little money available and if they sell their land as some of them will be forced to do, it will be sold at a very low price.  I understand that the price for good agricultural land has fallen in some cases below £1,000 an acre whereas the price was £3,000 an acre last year.  This means that in order to meet the estate duty due, people will have to sell almost their entire farm.  To force them into that position by suddenly jerking up the interest rates is unfair.</P>
      <P>No one can deny that there is just cause for having an interest rate on outstanding debts but the fundamental objection to this provision is that the tax itself is unjust.  The estate duty tax was done away with in 1974 and it was common case that it was an unjust tax.  To come along now and try to squeeze a little more out of the people who were caught in the net of this very unjust tax before it was abolished is to pile injustice on injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House cannot accept that.  The issue of the justice or <Col N="1512" /> otherwise of estate duty was decided by the people in the 1973 general election.  They decided in 1973 when they elected the National Coalition that they wanted to be rid of estate duty and they got rid of it, but Fianna Fáil are back now after the 1977 election and obviously they have not forgotten the people from whom they were happily levying estate duty in the period up to 1973. Now they want to increase the interest rate on those people who, because of the excessive delays which often occur in the processing of estates, have not been in a position yet to pay off the amounts liable to them.  This is not a fair measure.  We should not have this matter brought before us, not so much because of the interest rate arguments as because of the fundamental injustice of the tax in question namely estate duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point that I would like to make here is that the death duties which are at issue here on this interest question are due on deaths which occured before 1 April 1975, that is five years ago.  We are talking in respect of duties that have been outstanding since that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to a lecture on economics from the Leader of Fine Gael.  I hope that at least he will allow me to state the facts on this issue and I might be able to give some comment by way of my view on his economic lecture theme as well.  The second point is &mdash;Deputy FitzGerald touched on this&mdash; that it is clear on the face of this resolution that, even though we are talking about duties outstanding since that date, these duties, as is stated clearly in this resolution, may be paid also by instalments over a period of years.  Where that is the case, where they are being paid by instalments over a period of years, the rate of interest that is applied is 9 per cent which Deputies will recognise at this time is, to say the least of it, unusually low.  What we are talking about <Col N="1513" /> is not where payments are being made by instalments over that five-year period and into the future, whatever arrangements there may be, but about defaulting cases.  The sole purpose of this amendment&mdash;if you can call this a penalty in these circumstances&mdash;is to impose an appropriate addition by way of penalty at the rate of 15 per cent on defaulters but in line with the normal rate of interest charged on all outstanding tax which is 15 per cent.  This has been the one out of line since 1978 at 9 per cent and now only in respect of defaulters is it being increased to 15 per cent which is the interest rate generally.</P>
      <P>Let me now give a little of the background on which Deputies opposite should inform themselves before they come in to criticise what is being done here to introduce a balance to say the least of it, and, I suggest also, equity as between all outstanding tax and in this case between those who pay by instalments and those who are not doing so and are defaulting.  It is rather important to be put on the record of this House that the rate of interest on unpaid taxes was raised to 18 per cent in 1975.  Note the year, note the figure.  The circumstances speak for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is irrelevant, I had to listen to the Leader of Fine Gael make some reference to it this morning when it did not seem to be irrelevant at all, and I intend to come to that in a moment. The argument made particularly by the Leader of Fine Gael does not hold up and, while he can express the concern that he wishes and try to imply that this <Col N="1514" /> is a penal tax or penal approach to a tax debt, he can say that and get it off his chest, but it does not square with the facts, the record or what I am proposing to do here now.  Whatever it is that Fine Gael would like to misrepresent they are free to do it, but I am entitled to state the facts and then have the facts judged for themselves.  I presume there would be unanimity in this House on the basis that defaulters should not be encouraged to remain defaulters as between those who pay their tax or duties and so on promptly and those who do not.  If what Fine Gael are suggesting here is that defaulters should be encouraged by reference to the fact that, even after five years, the rate of interest chargeable on their default should be at 9 per cent, let the public be aware of it.  Let them say that they are in favour of giving very special provision to defaulters at a rate of 9 per cent.  If that is the case&mdash;and that is what they are suggesting&mdash;they might as well have it known outside. What is proposed here does not in any way even bring it into line with the current interest rates in the normal course of commerce or advances for any purpose.  It is being raised to 15 per cent in this area in line with outstanding interest on all other tax.  Anyone who wants to argue that as being unduly vindictive a penalty or whatever else can argue that, but I am not convinced of the sincerity of someone so arguing or by his argument or reasoning in presenting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what happens.  Someone comes in here this morning and finds that there is something on about raising an interest rate on a resolution and then says that here is another chance to have a go.  Without giving it very much thought he is up and having a go and then I get the lecture on economics from the Leader of Fine Gael.  Now I want to make some reference to that.  He said in very strong and coercive tones, and I quote and I challenge him to justify this on any economic criteria: &ldquo;The Government and the Government alone have forced the interest rates up to their present level&rdquo;.  That is a wonderfully absolute statement from a person who presents himself from time to time in this <Col N="1515" /> House and makes passing reference to himself as an economist to imply that that means that the rest should take a little more notice of what he says than of what we say.</P>
    <P>As one who has qualifications also, perhaps not as an economist but at least in the business of looking at all of the arguments and analysing them, I state that it is not the Government and the Government alone who have forced interest rates to where they are.  That record does not stand up and the Deputy knows that.  As I said to him in this House, the increase in interest rates amongst our partners in the EEC&mdash;to leave it at that and never mind America where they are coming down at the moment and we hope to see this reflected in the Bundesbank rate, the Lombard rate, the Westminster Bank and so forth although there is no sign of that yet&mdash;in absolute terms was higher since June 1978 anywhere than here.  I am not talking proportionately, and I said that in the presence of the Leader of Fine Gael not long ago in this House because he had implied that I was sheltering behind the special argument when I talked of proportionate increases.  I am not one to say that that is great, that is marvellous, and because of the fact that others have suffered we should say we are lucky.  I am not saying that.  I am simply saying as a fact that that is the case.  Obviously the inter-bank market reflects the going rates in this area.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Deputy FitzGerald when he says it is different now that we are not tied to sterling.  If it is different, it is because, as we are within the EMS and not just following in line with sterling, as was the case before the link was broken, we are in an international money market where capital inflows and outflows will affect us as is the case with every other country.  If as a small open economy we were to attempt to have interest rates way below those which apply in the other countries with which we trade, and who draw on the same sources of income&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Despite the attempts by Fine Gael this morning to imply that what is being done here is unreasonable and out of line, I want to say they have picked the wrong issue.  If they want to say people who have defaulted should be allowed to pay at interest rates of 9 per cent as against every other outstanding tax due&mdash;even when we are not talking of default at 15 per cent&mdash;let them put it on the record that they are promoting or encouraging defaulters even in respect of those areas where after five years people have not yet paid the outstanding duties.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 13, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As respects the year 1980-81 and subsequent years of assessment, section 344 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the substitution for subsections (1) and (2) of the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1)  Where the total income of an individual for the year of assessment includes, or would but for this section include, any sums (in this section referred to as &ldquo;&lsquo;the said sums&rsquo;&rdquo;) paid or credited in respect of interest on&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  deposits with a trustee savings bank or with the Post Office Savings Bank, or</P>
      <P>(b)  deposits with any of the commercial banks,</P>
      <P>the said sums shall be disregarded for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts if or in so far as the said sums do not exceed&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  in the case of sums representing interest on deposits <Col N="1522" /> mentioned in paragraph (a), £150, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the case of sums representing interest on deposits mentioned in paragraph (b), £70:</P>
    <P>Provided that the total sums to be so disregarded shall not exceed £150:</P>
    <P>Provided also that the provisions of this Act as regards the making by the individual of a return of his total income shall apply as if this section had not been enacted.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of subsection (1) the question whether or how far the said sums exceed £150 or £70, as the case may be, shall, where by virtue of section 194, a woman's income is deemed to be her husband's, be determined separately as regards the part of his income which is his by virtue of that section and the part which is his apart from that section.' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that this amendment and amendment No. 52 be discussed together.  The purpose here is to give statutory effect to the announcement which I made on 5 May that I propose to increase the tax exemption limits from £70 to £150 in the case of interest arising from deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and from ordinary deposits with a trustee savings bank.  The limit of £70 which applies in relation to interest arising from deposits with the commercial banks, which is in section 344 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1967&mdash;is not being altered.  It should also be noted that interest which arises from deposits in investment accounts with trustee savings banks is taxable in full.  This amendment makes a consequential alteration in Part III of the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment to the amendment:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In subsection (1) (i) to delete &lsquo;paragraph (a)&rsquo; and substitute &lsquo;paragraphs (a) and (b)&rsquo; and to delete subparagraph (ii)&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Minister's amendment is to increase the amount of tax-free allowances for depositors with trustee savings banks and the Post Office, from £70 to £150, but this increase in allowance does not apply to depositors with commercial banks who are excluded under subsection (1) (b).  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that small depositors, no matter where they deposit money, whether in the commercial banks, trustee savings banks, the Post Office or any other such institution will get the same benefit, one as against the other, and have this increased allowance available to people of relatively modest means who save a small amount of money and have it on deposit in the commercial banks.  There may be an explanation but it is not obvious to me why the Minister should differentiate between one group and another and it is for that reason, to ensure that everybody should benefit no matter where he puts his money that I have put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is of some importance in rural areas particularly.  Trustee savings banks are normally concentrated in the cities and in rural areas you find that it is the commercial banks that very largely handle small savings.  I have had correspondence from some of my constituents who possibly live 70 or 80 miles from a trustee savings bank the nearest of which would be in Cork city.  These are people with small savings and it seems inappropriate that they should not get the same benefit from the income tax point of view as if they had invested in <Col N="1524" /> the trustee savings banks.</P>
      <P>Looking at the whole picture, I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation not so much from the differentiation point of view between the trustee savings banks and the commercial banks but the overall picture of the amount because £70 tax-free interest in this day indicates savings of a very small amount.  In my practice as a lawyer I know that everybody tries to put some money aside but things are becoming so expensive now that people have to put aside more and more.  It seems highly inappropriate that they should be in a taxable situation as a result of such small savings.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept the proposed amendment of Deputy Barry and to increase all tax-free interest to a minimum of £150.  It should not cost very much to the Exchequer and surely we should be promoting small savings in a better manner than we have been doing.  This would be one way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important perhaps to inform the House of the actual position as it is at present and also state the reasons why the present position applies and the reason why I am proposing this increase limited to the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks.  It is important to recognise that even in respect of the £70&mdash;this touches on what Deputy O'Keeffe particularly said&mdash;this concession does not apply to all commercial banks.  It applies only to those banks that were at that time covered, about eight of them, the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, the Northern Bank, The Ulster Bank, Ansbacher and Co., the Commercial Banking Company, Guinness and Mahon and the National City Bank.  All the other commercial banks are not included in that provision.  That was possibly one of the reasons why Deputy Richie Ryan indicated in his 1975 budget statement that he proposed to abolish this provision altogether.  In the event he did not do so in the Finance Bill.  He proposed then to confine the interest relief to the Post Office and the trustee savings banks.  That was not <Col N="1525" /> done and perhaps it is for that reason there is in a sense an anomaly.  There is not even-handedness even between the commercial banks in that it applies only to some.</P>
      <P>There are two ways of approaching the situation, either to get rid of it altogether in respect of those to whom it applies or to extend it to all others which would mean a very considerable cost and would also have very considerable consequences on the trustee savings banks and the Post Office Savings Bank. That is not being suggested by the Opposition. Nevertheles, I should mention it is one of the alternatives that one would abolish it altogether.</P>
      <P>Now let me come to what the situation is and why it is so.  First of all, in Britain for instance the position applies only to the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks.  It does not apply at all to the commercial banks. Historically and currently there is good reason why that should be the case.  But let me say categorically that I do not propose to abolish the provision in respect of the commercial banks.  There are arguments at least for considering it but I am not proposing to do that.  But it is important to recognise the special position of the trustee savings banks and the Post Office Savings Bank.  They were set up to cater for the small saver and they rely almost exclusively on the small saver.  I am not saying that there are not small savers who have their deposits in the commercial banks as well but it is fairly clear that the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks rely on small savers to a great extent more than do the commercial banks. Their rates of interest are directly controlled by the Government as distinct from the commercial banks and the bulk of their funds are lodged with the Exchequer so that, considering their nature, their purpose and the limitations and restrictions under which they operate, it is at least appropriate that the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks should have some advantage in respect of tax on deposits, as has been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> As I said already, not all other institutions have the £70 exemption so that any general increase in respect of the existing banks would obviously give rise to the forceful argument that the exemption now in addition should be extended to those financial institutions not having the benefit at the moment and who have not had the benefit for some time.  That in turn would put the Postal Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks in an even more difficult position and would also be costly to the Exchequer.  So, even as it is Deputy Barry's proposal, which does not go that far, would cost about £2 million in a full year.  But cost is not the only element here.  I have given a range of reasons and I hope the Deputies opposite will accept that this exemption which I am proposing in respect of the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks is appropriate to them and that perhaps the effectiveness of it should not be diminished by any other extensions in other areas which could have repercussions both on them and on the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that Deputy Ryan, as Minister for Finance, had indicated in his budget speech in 1975 that he was going to introduce a measure such as this to separate the two but that he did not go ahead with it in the Finance Bill.  That is the point.  The Minister indicated that he was going to do it and he went ahead.  It is the job of civil servants in the Departments of Finance and any other Department to put up suggestions to the Minister as to how he can raise taxation or cut down on expenditure and matters of that nature and it is the Minister's job to weigh each one of these separately and decide on the merits, both political and social, of going ahead with the suggestions put forward by the civil servants of the day.  Obviously, what has happened in this case is that the civil servants put forward to Minister Ryan the suggestion along the lines now included in the Finance Act and he resisted that, probably on social grounds.  In addition, the fact that trustee savings banks are <Col N="1527" /> not very widely dispersed throughout the country and serve only a limited number of people mainly in the larger centres of population probably weighed heavily with him.</P>
      <P>Without saying anything about people who run post offices around the country the Minister will understand the reasons why people in rural areas prefer to put their money into commercial banks rather than into the Post Office.  The difference between 1975 and 1980 is that the Minister did not appreciate this point and has included in the Finance Bill for 1980 a measure which gives the advantage to the Post Office Savings Bank and trustee savings banks.  I do not hold, and I am not suggesting in my amendment, that it be extended to all the other financial institutions.  I do not hold that the result of this would be that the trustee savings banks and the Post Office Savings Bank would be at a disadvantage if it was extended to the commercial banks.  The position at the moment is that both have the advantage of a £70 exemption from tax and if they both had an exemption of £150 from tax they would not be any worse off, one against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister understands the embarrassment of a lot of people who are still unfortunately very fearful of bank managers.  They do not go in to bank managers as they would go into a public house or a shop and talk back to them.  Even though the banks have their money they are still shy about talking to a bank manager.  The Minister may look surprised, but it is a fact that many people are nervous about going into banks and discussing things with bank managers even though they have their deposits in the bank.  The idea of going in and asking for their money back so that they can put it in the Post Office, where it would be more advantageous to them, is difficult for many people and some of these people will be under psychological pressure to leave their money in the bank where it is of less advantage to them than if they transferred it to the Post Office.  Small depositors of that nature who use commercial banks as institutions <Col N="1528" /> in which to save should not be disadvantaged as opposed to the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might help if I indicated that they would be at a disadvantage. First, the going deposit rate in the associated commercial banks at the moment is 11½ per cent in respect of what one might call the four main banks. In respect of some of the others I have mentioned interest rates go as high as 17½ per cent, in respect of one which I do not propose to name, and it is generally at 16½ per cent to 15½ per cent for the other four.  That compares with the rate of 8½ per cent which applies in the Post Office Savings Bank and in the trustee savings banks. The Deputy will appreciate that certainly in terms of interest rates both of these latter would, if no other balance were applied, be at a severe disadvantage.  That point should be noted.  It has been a major factor, particularly in respect of small savers who have restored traditionally to this area.</P>
      <P>I accept the other point about banks being a normal and readily available avenue for deposits as distinct from trustee savings banks, which are not to be found in every town.  But we are not talking only about trustee savings banks. We are talking also of the Post Office Savings Bank, which is available in every town and village.  This is a source that is available to the small saver in every community.  Therefore the Deputy's argument in that regard does not hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In referring to what Deputy Ryan was proposing when he was Minister, it should be made clear that what he was proposing then was not similar to what I am proposing now.  He was proposing to abolish the interest provision in respect of the commercial banks.  In the event he did not go through with that.  I am not proposing to abolish what Deputy Ryan was proposing to abolish.  Therefore, there is not any point in Deputy Barry approaching the question on the basis that, since Deputy Ryan was prepared to listen, I should do the same.  The position is very different.  I am proposing to maintain <Col N="1529" /> the current provision in respect of the associated banks and of the other ones that are listed.  They are a group that do not extend over the whole range of commercial banks.  I would hope that Deputy Barry would not propose to extend the provision to commercial banks though I accept the reasoning behind this argument.  However, one could argue the other way also, but I shall not go into that now.</P>

      <P>They would argue strongly that, if the provision is to apply to certain commercial banks, there is not any reason for it not applying to others. Then, there would be a real problem in respect of the Post Office Savings Bank and trustee savings banks which are in a disadvantageous position in respect of deposit rates.  The special position of such banks has been recognised in the UK.  They are the only ones who get such benefit.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that somebody paying tax under Schedule D will now be paying one-and-a-half years' tax in 12 months.  In other words, anyone who is self employed or who is not a PAYE taxpayer will be affected by this provision.  The old argument was that such people had a year's <Col N="1531" /> advantage in terms of tax over PAYE people.  In this year the Minister is proposing to eliminate that advantage to the extent of one-half.  This is unfortunate having regard to the exceedingly high interest rates and the very different commercial conditions now prevailing. In effect someone who would have to pay, say, £100 this year in the normal way will now be paying £150, and this is at a time when these people are being hit very hard, perhaps harder than any other section of the community. Generally they are people who owe money to the bank and people who are doing a lot of work for the State by way of the collection of tax under the PAYE system from their employees and who are also collecting VAT, if they are proprietors of businesses, for the State. This means that they must spend an enormous amount of their time filling up forms on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances the Minister should consider postponing this provision until such time as business is better and the people concerned may be in a better position to bear this imposition. To implement the provision now would cause serious cash flow problems for many businesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would endorse what Deputy Barry has said on this matter.  It is worth recalling that, when civil servants were brought into the PAYE net some years ago and changed from a situation of paying on a previous year's basis to paying on an up-to-date basis, they were given special concessions over a number of years to help them in the change over.  However, when the same type of situation is being brought about in respect of the self-employed, there are not any concessions to facilitate them. This would seem to be an invidious method of dealing with a problem of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse fully what Deputy Barry has said about this being the worst possible year in which to bring about a change of this kind because the self-employed are now suffering far more from high interest rates than has been <Col N="1532" /> the case in recent memory.  We must realise that, to a great extent, the self-employed are the motor of the Irish economy.  Without their contribution, dynamism and enterprise and the risks they take, we would not be able to afford either our social services or our substantial public sector.  These are the people on the margins, taking risks, moving forward with new ideas, making investments. At a time when they are at their lowest ebb as a result of external and internal economic circumstances, to introduce this system whereby they must pay one-and-a-half year's tax in one year, on top of very substantial interest payments and so forth is, to my mind, to be not only unjust but foolish.  The Minister must realise the quite serious political implications for him and for the country of the collapse of certain self-employed businesses as a result of the combination of interest payments and one-and-a-half year's tax payments coming up in one year.</P>
    <P>Is this system operable in any other country?  How are the self-employed taxed elsewhere?  To the best of my researches, in Britain the self-employed pay one half of their tax on 1 January in the tax year in question and the remaining one half on 1 July following the end of the tax year.  That would seem to be a fair system.  Britain is an economy where, obviously, the self-employed have considerable complaints and difficulties but that system has been satisfactory there.  It is hard to see why it would not be satisfactory here as well.  Has the Minister made any assessment of methods of taxing the self-employed in other countries before coming to this decision?  Has he any information as regards the dates of payment of tax?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the seriousness of this change? The only defence of this proposal is that it is supposed to bring some measure of comparable equity as between the PAYE people and the self-employed.  On all sides of the House, it is agreed that there has been considerable injustice in the PAYE system but it does not seem to be a move in the right direction to produce <Col N="1533" /> equity by adding an injustice to the position of the self-employed.  If the Minister is serious about taxing the injustices in the PAYE system, he should do so by improving the lot of the PAYE taxpayer and not by disimproving the position of the self-employed.  There are two ways of looking at every argument.  That has to be said in the context of the defence which has been offered on behalf of this proposal.</P>
      <P>Even more so, the Minister should think twice, and indeed three times, about the seriousness of the change which he is now making and the effect that it will have on our self-employed. They have their own problems in regard to tax, from the point of view of huge amounts of tax collected through VAT and PAYE.  They are in many cases, unpaid tax collectors for the Government. In a time of worsening economic conditions, these people are expected, on 1 October, to pay a tax bill in one sum, having already started the year by paying another tax bill, clearing up the half year tax bill which was then due.  They are now expected to pay, on 1 October, a bill for a full year, and this in the circumstances of daily reports of worsening conditions in firms, businesses and among employers.  By pressing on with this proposal, the Minister is piling on the agony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reminded of earlier discussions about interest rates payable on outstanding tax.  It may have the effect of being the final straw which broke the camel's back, putting many of these small businesses into liquidation and many of the self-employed into bankruptcy.  That is a major possibility following on this change.  It needs to be justified in terms other than trying to establish comparability between the PAYE sector and the self-employed.  If that is to be done, improve the position of the PAYE sector.  It needs to be justified other than by the Government's even more voracious demands for more and more money to pay for their spendthrift policies.  If, by so doing, they irreparably damage the fabric of the small industry <Col N="1534" /> of our self-employed sector, they will be doing this nation a grave disservice.  If there are changes to be made, let them be on a more sensible basis.  A change such as this may be very dangerous for the self-employed sector and I strongly urge the Minister not to press on with this proposal at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help thinking of the prayer of St. Augustine, &ldquo;Lord, make me pure, but not yet&rdquo;.  One can always counter every change by saying this is not the time to do it, irrespective of when it will be done and ignoring the fact hat it is not the final step, in any event.  That argument can always be made, and, in a sense, never countered. The Deputies have adopted the theme of &ldquo;Yes, perhaps, but not now&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I shall first answer some queries and then give some background which may enable us to see this proposal in its total and proper context.  One Deputy, Deputy Barry or Deputy Bruton, made the point that when ordinary workers were transfereed from a previous year tax basis in 1960-61 to a current year basis under the PAYE system, a remission of tax was granted of a half a year's tax.  Similary, he talked of the public sector on transfer to a current year basis in 1976-77 having a similar remission granted. That is correct.  However, there is a difference between what was done then and what is proposed to be done now. As is evident, the schedule D taxpayer is still not on a current year but on a preceding year basis and the question of a remission of the kind which arose when people were being brought on to a current year basis, which is not being proposed here, does not arise.  That is the first point which has to be made quite clear.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of procedure in the United Kingdom The information available to me is they are now seriously examining the possibility of the transfer of the self-employed to a current year basis.  I cannot speak for them in respect of what they propose to do at this stage, but they are considering this as a matter of desirable principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having clarified exactly the sharp difference <Col N="1535" /> between what is proposed here and what was proposed in respect of the PAYE taxpayers in 1960-61 and 1976-77, let me say that what we are talking about here started back in 1975-76. It proceeded with important principles of even-handedness throughout the system trying to align the payment dates as much as possible for each of the groups within the system.  Everybody will recognise that as being desirable.  In fact, the first move in this direction came from Deputy Richie Ryan, when Minister for Finance.  He recognised the desirability of an even spread having regard to equity and, what he called, the equalising of the tax burden.  I should like to quote from his Financial Statement of January 1976 in which he said:</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly enunciated that those within the income tax net should be treated as equally as possible.  My ultimate aim is that people with the equivalent incomes should pay equivalent tax.  A major step in this direction was taken last June, when I announced that remuneration at present outside the scope of PAYE would be brought within the system.  Those affected are public servants and some other groups.</P>
    <P>The corollary of that is that every effort should be made to bring all other taxpayers on to the same basis of contemporary assessment.  There are obvious obstacles to doing so as far as traders and the self-employed are concerned, but as a first step towards this aim the Government have decided to advance by three months, the due dates for payment of tax by individuals under Schedule D in the next two assessment years....</P>
    <P>I trust that there will be general acceptance of the equity of this move. Even after this advancement, individuals liable to Schedule D tax will still be paying their tax later than many companies and, of course, very much later than employees whose tax is deducted from their pay as they earn it.</P>
    <P>What was said by the Minister for <Col N="1536" /> Finance then still holds good in principle. It is the principle of trying to introduce equity through all aspects of the system, in terms of the date of payment and in terms of the incidence of payments.  That is what is proposed here.</P>
    <P>If ever there was an occasion where the public generally were conscious of the need for equity in taxation, as to incidence and date of payment, that occasion is now.  If ever there was an occasion when one could argue that the PAYE sector would seem to have cause for the grievance they have expressed that occasion would have been up to the present.  I am doing what I believe is right and proper.  I am not bringing it up to a current year basis but as much as possible along that road.  I am trying to line it up with those who pay on a current year basis.</P>

Otherwise, it is never the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a situation which will be serious for certain businesses, in particular farming businesses.  There will be a tremendous bunching of tax liabilities in October this year for such people.  They will have the second moiety of rates to pay&mdash;in many cases that has been substantially increased&mdash;and they will also have to pay their resources tax together with income tax on the 1979-80 tax year.  The Minister is aware that incomes in agriculture are falling which means that out of a diminished income farmers will have to pay those three taxes on a notional amount they received the previous year.  I can see serious liquidity problems for those people arising in October-November this year.  I realise they will have two months grace, to 1 December, within which they can pay the tax that falls due on 1 October without any additional interest being charged.  However, there will still be a big liquidity problem in that period. Apart from the justice of the case, which the Minister has not fully met, I should like to know if the Minister feels satisfied that the problems I have mentioned of liquidity will not be very serious at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers are being treated differently from other Schedule D taxpayers.  They are being treated more favourably for obvious reasons.  I was contemplating that some Members might ask why farmers should be treated differently from the other self-employed. Deputy Bruton takes the view that even though they are being treated so they should be treated more differently still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That question could be asked in relation to any issue.  I cannot give general guarantees in relation to liquidity in respect of any person or group of persons.  If we applied a single date to full-time farmers as we do to others for 1980-81 it would mean that they would pay two years' tax in 1980. <Col N="1538" /> They would have to pay their full 1979-80 tax under the existing single payment date on 1 January 1980 and then would have to pay their full 1980-81 tax on the single payment date of 1 October 1980. It was for that reason that I decided to make special provision for farmers to have the two instalments provision for 1980 and 1981.  This will apply to the profits of full-time farmers only.  The fact that I am making special provision for farmers in this case is evidence of my recognition of their importance and the problems they might have in adjusting in line with others.  I hope it will be seen as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should accept that there will be very serious liquidity problems for some of those people who have a combination of three taxes to pay not only in one year but in one month.  That is something the Minister cannot ignore particularly in a situation of tight credit.  Inevitably if people have to pay-one-and-a-half years' income tax in the space of one month they will have to borrow to pay it.  If credit situations continue as at present they may not be able to borrow.  What will they do?  The only way they will manage is by destocking.  In other words, farmers in this situation in October-November will have to sell more cattle than they would normally.  That will aggravate the situation, which, I am sure Deputy Keegan will agree, occurs at that time of the year when there is a tendancy to unload cattle anyway.  This tax provision could create a situation where there will be a collapse in cattle prices at the end of the year.  The Minister cannot brush off liquidities as if they were someone else's problem.</P>

I am exaggerating what the Minister said for the sake of effect but there is an element of it in his approach to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> What about the situation of a man who has a small business, perhaps a pub and a farm, not earning a significant amount of money?  Some shops and pubs in rural Ireland can be more of a liability that an asset at times.  According to the Minister that person will not avail of the concession he has mentioned for farmers.  That man, on his farm income, if he has one, will have to pay two year's tax on his farm income plus one-and-a-half years' tax on his business income all in one month.  That will create a lot of problems for small publicans and businessmen.  I am sure the Minister is as familiar as I am with this type of case.</P>

If the Minister had drawn up this Finance Bill in consultation with his colleagues in North Tipperary instead of in consultation with the officials in the Department of Finance he might have come up with rather different provisions. It is not cognisant of the reality that exists in rural Ireland.</P>

We are not living in isolation from them but they would recognise that they are not in the business of advising on the provisions in a Bill in detail.  They deal with general principals.</P>

      <P>Of course they will like anyone else.  I am very anxious to ensure that special recognition of such problems as there are would appear quite clearly in what I am proposing in this Bill.  I am also anxious to ensure that, as far as one is lining up or getting rid of the anomalies between the self-employed and those on PAYE, one does not leave any glaring anomaly.  I have indicated the exception I have made for farmers already.  If one were to go further one would be open to the charge that because of the consultation I have had in my constituency and the close concern I have for them I was making a special case for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton in expressing his case objectively, nonetheless made a special case which would not be reflected in reality.  On the date in October they will pay half their income tax.  The Deputy conveyed the impression of people paying all these crushing burdens, and that was the only term one should use, at one time and would be struggling for breadth.  He asked what we would do about it.  I am exaggerating for the purpose of effect as the Deputy did.  They pay half in income tax as well as rates but one should not forget that what they pay in income tax is after credit for their rates.  It is wrong to convey the impression that one lumps the whole lot together as if there was an accumulation involved.  There is not.  They are not paying the rates separately and the income tax separately.  They get credit, as the Deputy knows, which is a special provision for farmers that does not apply <Col N="1541" /> elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One comes to the other leg of the tripod, the resource tax.  This is a new one at £3.50 per acre.  It means in respect of a man with £100 valuation, which could be more than 100 acres in most cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since 1974, when the tax change on farming profits was introduced, the businessman farmer, if we may call him such for general purposes, has always been treated in the same way as other businessmen.  Therefore these trader farmers have always paid their taxes, whether on business profits or farming profits, in two instalments.  That has always been the way.

      <P>The reason for my asking the question arises from something the Minister said earlier, that in the case of full-time farmers he was making a special concession, that they would not have to pay all on 1 October because that would have meant&mdash;if he did it in the case of full-time farmers&mdash;that they would have been paying two years' tax on that date.  That is, I think, what the Minister said.  What I am endeavouring to ascertain is, if the Minister has made a <Col N="1544" /> concession in relation to full-time farmers, then there must be some other category of farmer who will in fact be paying two years' farm income tax on one day.  I am trying to find out exactly who they are because that is the way I interpreted the Minister's statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will be paying two years' income tax on one day. What I said at the time was that the special two instalments provision for farmers will apply (a) to farming profits only and (b) to farming profits of full-time farmers.  We are talking in terms only of the farming profits of full-time farmers.  That is what I said, so that the question of somebody paying two years' tax in one day will not arise.</P>

      <P>This is the section which continues in the current year the relief given in respect of expenditure on residential premises last year by householders on the improvement and maintenance of their homes.  It is fair to say that the scheme seemed to get off to a slow start in 1979 but interest in it quickened towards the end of the year. From March this year a number of contractors had registered under the scheme.  In the circumstances I thought it would be appropriate to continue this provision in operation this year.  This section provides, also in line with the general treatment of married couples, that in the case where couples opt for assessment on their combined income the limit of relief in this area will be £900 instead of £450.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The original section in the 1979 Act contains a provision that people who had work done in their houses could claim against tax the labour element of that work provided it did not exceed £450.  It is a good idea to extend that provision for a further year. How many contractors actually registered?  My understanding is that for the first number of months very few contractors registered.</P>
      <P>Because of the depressed state of the construction industry the Minister should consider raising the figure of £400 to encourage contractors to do decorating, painting and reconstruction jobs which are necessary in their houses, and the figure, due to inflation, is out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to that principle.  Because of income splitting, which has been extended here, we are talking about the majority of married couples.  Where a couple opt for assessment on their combined income the limit under this provision will be doubled from £450 to £900, which is an added inducement.  That may be part of the reason why the scheme is now beginning to pick up.  While the scheme got off to a <Col N="1547" /> very slow start at the beginning of last year, there was an improvement later. There was a slow down in the winter months, but by the end of March 1980 1,239 contractors had registered under the scheme.  Nine hundred and ten claims were received from householders. Of that 661 have already been settled and the other 249 cases have been dealt with.</P>
      <P>Because of the interest being taken in this scheme and the desirability of continuing it for another year, this provision should be seen as an encouragement. The enhanced interest is underlined by the fact that in the Dublin area almost 4,600 inquiries were received up to the end of March.  If there is an equivalent number of claims from the rest of the country, we would be thinking in terms of up to 9,000 interested persons.  If that were so, the average tax relief would amount to £100 in each case.  The rough cost this year of this extension would be of the order of £1 million.  The doubling of the relief in respect of married people will be seen as an encouragement and that will have consequential effects on the area Deputy Barry mentioned.</P>

      <P>I heard the scheme had not been a great success last year, but if only 1,000 people registered it has been a total failure.  It must be remembered that the eligible people would include painters, carpenters, plumbers, small house builders, gardeners and so on.  We are told only 1,000 people have registered, say 300 in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People should be told about this scheme because it is possible they do not know about it.  It is also possible that householders are not pushing the people who normally do this work to register so that they can make a claim under the tax system.

      <P>What is the administrative cost of operating this concession? If the Revenue Commissioners have to examine every account furnished to make sure it corresponds with the work actually done, it strikes me that the cost of administering this scheme could be quite high.  Second, there seems to be a case for doing something about energy conservation in the home.  Because of the energy crisis people should be encouraged to better insulate their houses. Would the Minister consider granting a special concession in this area?  Third, can one go on claiming for house improvements or, if £900 is claimed in one year, can another £900 be claimed the following year?  Fourth, how long does the Minister intend to continue this scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The pilot scheme was introduced last year and has been extended this year because of its desirability and the fact that it has not really got off the ground.  The Deputy asked if it can be repeated.  As of now, that has not arisen and I cannot give a precise answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not.  The general purpose of this scheme, would be best achieved by individuals doing their jobs and claiming their relief once and for all.  Otherwise, we could have people coming back year after year while others are not availing of the scheme at all.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give a precise answer on the administrative costs because this work is carried out by Revenue staff in the normal working day.  There is no separate area one can identify which is devoted entirely to this scheme.  If there had been they would have been under-employed for the last year.  Therefore I cannot put a figure on the administrative cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there would be a great burden of work involved with people actually registering.  Much more time is spent trying to ascertain the number who should be registering and are not.  The burden of work involved with people <Col N="1549" /> registering under the scheme would be limited because when people make their returns they are dealt with in the normal working day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The area where I thought there would be administrative expense was not in the case of registration but in regard to vouching for jobs done by individual householders.  If a job involved three or four different contractors it could be very costly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives effect to the decision announced in the budget that the proposal to tax certain short-term social welfare benefits from 1980-81 onwards would not be implemented. The main reason for adopting the proposal in the first instance was that the exemption from tax of these benefits would seem to provide a disincentive to work, the remuneration for which would be chargeable for tax. Because of the introduction of the new scheme of tax this year and the widening of the bands to a very considerable extent, I sincerely hope that the disincentive has been removed.  For that reason the Government do not propose to provide for the taxation of these benefits. This is an expression of confidence in the good faith of the working population which I hope will prove well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union movement expressed great concern and opposition when this proposal was first announced last year, but one must recognise that there have been problems in relation to absenteeism. I would feel I had done the nation a disservice if I felt that the change now proposed would be in any way an inducement to absenteeism at a time when the opposite is needed.  Absenteeism was a major problem for industry, particularly towards the end of the year and it could not be mere coincidence <Col N="1550" /> that everybody becomes ill at that time.  The new scheme will mean that the vast majority will move down into lower tax bands and this should remove the disincentive.  Hopefully that will be the consequence.  If the experience turns out to be otherwise I would feel totally unjustified in making the proposal contained in this section.  We need maximum attendance at work and maximum productivity.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about trying to equalise the burden on taxpayers generally and had the taxation of these benefits been proceeded with it would have yielded £13 million in a full year and £8.5 million for the rest of the current year.  This revenue is now being made up from other taxpayers. Absenteeism has been as high as 20 per cent per day in some vulnerable areas and I hope we will not see a continuation of that pattern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would say he was removing this provision because he had found out that it would not work and because of the opposition to it.  He should not make veiled threats about what will be done if the removal of this section does not work. Absenteeism and taxation, although related, are separate problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  The Minister said that in some instances absenteeism is as high as 20 per cent per day.  If this were because of taxation, would this not be the case in all industries? Absenteeism is a separate problem which needs special study in the social and industrial relations fields.  Neither the Minister nor I am qualified to say exactly what bearing taxation has on this problem, but the prime cause of absenteeism is not the fact that people have to pay tax on their earnings.  The Minister should not have made the veiled threat that unless absenteeism stops he will introduce the taxation of short-term social welfare benefits next year.  The elimination of absenteeism would require many studies and involve much legislation <Col N="1551" /> which has a bearing on unions and employers.  It would include all sorts of other factors including labour relations, social welfare and health which have a bearing on absenteeism.  At this stage we cannot say how important the taxation factor is in relation to absenteeism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A married man with five children deriving from his job an income of £60 per week must pay tax.  If he has precisely the same income derived from social welfare benefits he does not pay tax on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that absenteeism is caused purely by the taxation factor and we could not as yet ascertain to what extent it is a factor. Deputy Barry may be correct in saying that many studies would be needed and a change of attitude in relation to the problem, but action is much better.  I have taken an action which will be a contributory factor in encouraging people to work constantly.  I mentioned in particular the problems which arise towards the end of a year and people can make their own judgment as to why the incidence is higher then.  It is at least arguable that because people moved into higher tax bands they found it more profitable to claim rebates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not one answer to this problem but I have made two major contributions.  This latter one is an act of faith and I should not be attacked as making a veiled threat that I will take alternative action if my faith is misplaced. It is very difficult to answer that kind of argument because the other course would be to do nothing if this action is unsuccessful.  It is important to note that a married man with an earned income of up to £3,400 will be exempt from tax.  Whatever he might have in addition to this by way of social welfare benefits will not put him through the exemption threshold.  Some might say that means that a man who works throughout the year and who earns a sum just exceeding £3,400 will be at a disadvantage in comparison with a man who works for nine months and who <Col N="1552" /> may be sick for the remainder of the year.  I have to admit that is the case here but I should like to impress on the House that this is an act of faith all round and I hope that my faith will not be misplaced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When working out an ideal tax system one must start with what is just and then one decides what tax would be wise at any given time.  Do I take it from what the Minister has said that he believes it is inherently just that a man who earns £60 per week and who works full time should pay tax while a man with the same income who is not working should not pay tax?  Putting aside all factors such as any pressure being put on the Minister and whether he wants a national wage agreement&mdash;all factors that must weigh on the mind of any Minister&mdash;does he believe it just that the situation I have described should exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for now and ever more on this.  There are factors in relation to disability benefit where the wage earner is sick and where there are all the consequent problems that arise in such a case and these factors would argue for discriminating in favour of such a person, as I am doing here.  Similarly, in relation to unemployment, where a person is genuinely un-employed&mdash;and this has a serious effect on the family and the person concerned&mdash;there are factors that should be taken into account.  I do not want to say what should be done forever more; I am simply saying what is being done in recognition of several factors and in recognition of the case made by the ICTU who are representative of the working population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is some time since I read their submissions and I shall summarise what they said.  Their case was that where people have the burden of unemployment and sickness they should <Col N="1553" /> not have to pay tax on what is in any event only a contribution towards their income as distinct from what would normally be their total income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the best way would be to improve unemployment and disability benefits?  If there is a need for more compensation it should be given in the form of higher disability and unemployment benefits, not by intermixing the tax code and the benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases in the benefits this year were higher than at any time previously and, in a sense, that meets what Deputy Bruton has said.  I endeavoured in the budget and in the Finance Bill to point out that we were recognising the special problems of the unemployed and the sick and, equally, that we were recognising the problems of people who found themselves in the higher tax bands.  I hope that my general line of approach will be seen as consistent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is convinced that there are problems for the recipients of social welfare benefits, which I conceded, I should have thought the better way to deal with them would be to give a 30 per cent increase in unemployment and disability benefit rather than exempt them from income tax which creates a situation where a person with a similar income who is working will pay tax.  That is my personal view.</P>

      <P>This section which extends the time limit for the claiming of certain reliefs, largely in the business area, has been brought in following representations by the consultative committee of accountancy bodies.  The time limits have been extended from one year after the end of the relevant year of assessment <Col N="1554" /> or the chargeable period to two years after that date.  I think this is a reasonable extension.</P>
      <P>The purpose will be to ensure that the assessment over a period of two or three years from the commencement date will not exceed the actual amount of profit. In relation to personal relief, the current limit is ten years and I thought it appropriate to extend it to two years for the business area.  The provision is rather technical and has a limited effect only for business but it is one that I considered I should introduce in response to the cases made to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section applies to the taxation of married persons and I should like to give the House some further background to a very important innovation being introduced here. Chapter I, Part IX, of the Income Tax Act, 1967 deals with the taxation of married persons but following the recent decision of the Supreme Court to the effect that the provisions in Part IX were repugnant to the Constitution it became necessary to re-write the provisions.  The new provisions embodied in Chapter I give a married couple three options for assessment.  First, assessment of each spouse as a single person; secondly, assessment of the husband in respect of the combined incomes of husband and wife; and, thirdly, separate assessment, where the second option is taken but where the spouses wish to have the taxes apportioned between them and each spouse made responsible for the tax attributable to his or her income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With income splitting now available to married couples, there would be no tax advantages in opting for assessment as single persons.  It is considered that most married couples will wish to have <Col N="1555" /> the tax in respect of their combined incomes assessed on the husband so that the full benefit of the personal allowances and the double rate bands will accrue to the couple.  In any event it is a matter for the spouses in each case to decide how they want to be assessed.  If any one of them wishes to be assessed as a single person the assessment will be made on that basis on the receipt of a notification to that effect from either of them.  These new arrangements secure that where the income of both spouses is assessed on the husband they will not pay more tax than they would pay if they were assessed as single persons.  At the same time, it can be said that this scheme achieves equity between couples because one couple will pay the same tax as another couple with the same combined income regardless of whether or not both spouses have income and also of how the income is divided between them.  This would not be the case under the assessment of the couple as single persons.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify something which Deputy Fitzpatrick is not clear on.  He seems to have the impression that the decision of the Supreme Court is different only from what I am proposing in that it applies to earned income and that I am just extending that to unearned income. He said yesterday that inevitably, if a case was brought in relation to unearned income, I would find the Supreme Court would take the same position.  It is not just because of that that it is being done, because what the Supreme Court held was in relation to the right of married couples' earned income to be taxed as single people.  That is not income splitting; it is a long way from that.  Income splitting means in addition&mdash;this is what we are doing here&mdash;that you are not just taxing them as single people, which would mean that they could only have their own allowances against their own income and could not transfer what they do not need to anybody else, the husband and wife as the case may be.  They are just single and separate.  That is what the Supreme Court said in respect of earned income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> I am doing something here in relation to income splitting, which is a very different thing.  I hope somebody will bring this to the attention of Deputy Fitzpatrick, because he apparently has not grasped it, so that I will not have to answer it again sometime.  We are actually saying that, in addition to the assessment, as single people, of unearned income, which is already an advance on the Supreme Court, we are introducing the principle of income splitting, which will apply to all couples so that what the wife may not use up in her allowances she may transfer over to her husband so that he can use it fully.  That is a very considerable advance and it is the reason why the differences I mentioned in terms of cost are so significant.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a figure of £30 million in respect of what the Supreme Court want.  £24 million of that is in respect of income tax for the 1979-80 period.  The other £6 million is really only an estimate on our part of what might have been done and was suggested would be done by certain couples who were making arrangements to transfer part of the husband's income to the wife under a covenant.  If that were to be the pattern, we estimated that that might mean a loss of about £6 million to Revenue.  When we add the £24 million in relation to actual cost and that £6 million we get the figure of £30 million.  The second matter will not be necessary now.  The proposal I have just outlined costs considerably more.  It is important that there is no doubt with regard to the significance of what is being done here, the extent of it and how much further it goes than anything that was required in any court decision.  It is more costly because it goes so much further.  I hope Deputies opposite recognise that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 25, before section 19, but in Chapter II, to insert the following sections:</P>
      <P>.&mdash;(1) In this section &lsquo;relevant year&rsquo; means the year 1979-80 or any earlier year of assessment.</P>
      <P>(2)  notwithstanding anything contained in the Income Tax Acts, the regulations made thereunder or any assessment made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in accordance with the said Acts or said regulations, no repayment of tax shall be made nor shall any credit be allowed to any person in respect of any over-payment of tax (whether paid by deduction or otherwise) suffered by him in respect of any relevant year, being an overpayment arising by virtue of the aggregation of the income of that person with the income of his spouse, unless, before the commencement of that relevant year, he had instituted legal proceedings to assert the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the Income Tax Acts purporting to authorise such aggregation.</P>
      <P>.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;assessment&rsquo; includes an additional assessment;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;an assessment to which this section <Col N="1558" /> applies&rsquo; means an assessment to tax made, on or after the passing of this Act, on an individual for a relevant year;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;relevant year&rsquo; means the year 1979-80 or any earlier year of assessment;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the relevant rate&rsquo; means, as respects any of the years 1974-75 to 1979-80, the highest of the higher rates which applied for that year of assesment and, as respects any other relevant year, the rate equal to the aggregate of the standard rate of income tax for that year and the highest rate at which sur-tax was chargeable for that year;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the relevant tax&rsquo;, in relation to an individual, means the amount of tax for a relevant year which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  would have been payable by the individual for that year, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in a case where the individual is a wife who was treated as living with her husband for that year, would have been payable for that year by the husband of the individual,</P>
    <P>if an assessment in respect of the total income of the individual and of his spouse for that year had been made on the 6th day of October in that year on the individual or on the husband of the individual, as the case may be, being an assessment made on the basis and in accordance with the practice prevailing at that time;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;tax&rsquo; means income tax or sur-tax or income tax and sur-tax as the context requires.</P>
    <P>(2) Where, for a relevant year, an assessment to which this section applies is to be made on an individual (being a husband whose wife was treated as living with him for the relevant year or being a wife who was treated as living with her husband for that year) and, in consequence thereof, the aggregate of the tax, which would be payable for that relevant year by the individual and the <Col N="1559" /> spouse of the individual, is less than the amount of the relevant tax in relation to the individual for that relevant year, the provisions of subsection (3) shall apply in relation to the said assessment.</P>
    <P>(3) Where the provisions of this subsection apply in relation to an assessment for a relevant year, then, notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Acts but subject to the provisions of subsection (4)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the amount of income on which the individual is to be charged to tax shall be ascertained on the basis that section 138 of the Income tax Act, 1967, had not been in force and had no effect for that year.</P>
    <P>(b) the assessment shall be made on the basis that the individual is to be charged to tax on his taxable income for the year at the relevant rate, and</P>
    <P>(c) where the individual on whom the assessment is to be made is a married person, the assessment shall be made on the basis that he is not married and such assessments or adjustments of assessments shall be made as are necessary to secure that the individual and his spouse shall be charged to tax for the relevant year in all respects as if they were not married:</P>
    <P>Provided that any income contained in an assessment made on a husband which, before the 12th day of October, 1979, in accordance with the practice prevailing at the time the assessment was made, was deemed to be his income shall not be regarded as income of any other person.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the provisions of subsection (3) apply in relation to any assessment on an individual for a relevant year, such relief, if any, from tax shall be given as is necessary to secure that the aggregate amount of tax <Col N="1560" /> payable by the individual and his spouse for that year shall not exceed the relevant tax for that year, and, in a case where assessments to which this section applies are made on the husband and on his spouse, the relief to be given under this subsection shall be apportioned between them in such manner as is just and reasonable.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the one to which reference was made this morning on the Order of Business.  Perhaps I should repeat again that I am not aware of any letter having been sent out to anybody.  I contemplated sending a letter to the spokesman for each of the Opposition parties&mdash;this amendment only went out over the weekend&mdash;however, I did not manage to do that.  I wanted to make sure that the spokesmen of both parties would be fully aware of what is involved in the amendments. Beyond that I cannot comment on newspaper reports about the matter.  I hope I have clarified the matter fully now.  As I indicated yesterday, I was at all times ready to do that when we came to this part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In view of the interest which has been expressed in this amendment and also of the importance of it, it is important that I give the background in relation to it.  The amendment inserts two new sections in Chapter II of the Bill, which deals with the taxation of married persons.  The existing sections in that chapter deal with the tax position of married couples for 1980-81 onwards.  The new sections now being inserted in the chapter relate to the position for 1979-80 and earlier years.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in their ruling given on 25 April last the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in that case were entitled to recover the additional tax paid by them by virtue of the aggregation of their incomes for the years 1978-79 and 1979-80 which the court in its earlier decision in January had held to be unconstitutional.  The court also ruled that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover any additional tax arising from aggregation of their incomes for any period prior to the tax year 1978-79 and, secondly, no taxpayers other than the plaintiffs or those who had instituted <Col N="1561" /> legal proceedings challenging the constitutionality of the proceedings had the standing necessary to maintain the claim that the State should reimburse them for any taxes collected under the sections which had been condemned.  Some taxpayers have sought to get around the court ruling by lodging claims requiring inspectors to make assessments on them for the six years back to 1974.  Where the tax has already been collected under PAYE it is not usual to make an assessment but it is provided nonetheless in section 133 of the 1967 Act that a taxpayer may require an assessment to be made against which is to be credited the tax deducted under PAYE.</P>
    <P>If assessments are now made for these back years they must be made on the basis of non-aggregation and this of course will show a lower tax liability than the tax actually collected under PAYE in accordance with the practice prevailing at the time.  The taxpayers concerned will obviously press their claims for a refund of the additional amounts collected during those earlier years but the Supreme Court has held that these amounts are not recoverable.</P>
    <P>The new section 19 now being introduced provides that notwithstanding the making of any such assessment repayment is not to be made in any of the cases covered by the Supreme Court judgment.  While the court ruling covered the position where tax had already been paid, it did not deal with the situation where the tax or some of it had not been paid in those earlier years. This situation will arise in PAYE cases where the tax deducted from the earnings of married couples was insufficient to meet their full liabilities for those years, or in PAYE cases where additional income or additional sources of income came to light subsequently, or in self-employed cases where assessments had not been made or where they were inadequate, or in back duty cases where the persons concerned due to fraud or neglect had not been fully assessed in respect of their incomes.  Obviously in the normal course the correct liability <Col N="1562" /> for these persons for the relevant years would be determined by new or additional assessments and the tax due would be collected on foot of those assessments. In equity, it is clear that these persons who have not paid their tax in due time should not be in a more favourable position than the conscientious taxpayer who has paid tax at the proper time.  Any assessment now made in respect of back years cannot be made on the basis of aggregated income.  To make the assessment on a non-aggregated basis would mean that these taxpayers would pay less for the previous years than would have been the case had they been assessed and paid their tax in the normal way.  Equity suggests that this position should not be allowed to arise and for that reason the new section 20 provides that where an assessment now falls to be made in respect of past years the tax due on foot of it would equal the tax which would have been due if the taxpayer had been assessed in the relevant year.</P>
    <P>This is achieved by providing a new basis for this assessment.  The tax will be charged, whether it is the income of the wife or the husband, without any deduction for personal allowances and will be charged at the highest tax rate appropriate for the relevant year.  Accordingly provision is being included to ensure that where an assessment on this basis produced a higher tax bill than would have been the case if the taxpayer had been assessed at the proper time and in accordance with practice then prevailing that tax bill will be reduced to the lower amount.  The introduction of these new sections means that all taxpayers whether PAYE taxpayers, self-employed or back duty cases will be treated in the same way as those already covered by the Supreme Court ruling. Justice alone requires that this should be done.</P>

      <P>These amendments which the Minister has admitted were circulated over the weekend are extremely complicated, difficult to understand and technical and they relate to something that is almost of fundamental <Col N="1563" /> importance to every married taxpayer. The Minister said that he contemplated writing to both Deputy O'Leary and myself presumably with an explanation which I at least would have welcomed but that did not happen.  Yesterday afternoon at least three times I read a portion of a report in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> relating to these amendments which said that:</P>
      <P>The position in relation to married couples who have paid tax for any preceding tax year and whose returns and assessments have been completed, accepted and finalised, <i>prima facie</i>, appears to be that they cannot now seek a refund of the &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; portion of tax paid by them.  There is, however, still an ambiguity about the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he had not seen yesterday morning's paper and that he would be coming to this in a later section of the Bill.  I am remiss in that I did not go through the list of amendments circulated, which I received in my post yesterday afternoon as I presumed that they would be ordinary ones circulated in another form last week.  At no stage during the course of the three references I made to this did the Minister say that he had an amendment in dealing with this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not understand how it could be stated that the school transport system discriminates against children living in rural areas.  Accordingly, the question of eliminating discrimination does not, in my view, arise. Prescribed age and distance conditions of eligibility for free school transport and for the provision of services as required are fundamental to any scheme of transport and do not constitute discrimination.</P>

The information contained in it was that there was one seat left on the bus and would the mother of the two children concerned indicate which child she would prefer to have collected.  Does the Minister not consider that that is discrimination? Does the Minister not consider that, in the case of a child over ten years old and under three miles from the <Col N="1566" /> school who cannot travel on the bus where other members of the family and neighbours' children can do so that is discrimination?

Obviously the Deputy had some other information when he tabled the question some time ago.  What I am indicating to the House and to the Deputy is that there is no discrimination against rural children as the question alleges but rather it is discrimination in favour of children in rural Ireland, may be against children in urban Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

I am concerned about the children who are living just inside the distance for qualifying and, in some cases, are just over the age limit, who are not getting school transport and are therefore being discriminated against. There is no other word in the English dictionary to cover such a situation.</P>

I want further to ask the Minister is he prepared at this late stage to change the entire regulations relating to school transport to allow school boards to overcome their own difficulties about which they know far more than the Minister or his Department?  If 30 Fianna Fáil TDs were to present a <i>mandamus</i> to the Minister as they did on the general subject of school transport, and publicly defy the Minister, perhaps they would get somewhere.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister indicate if Cospóir advise sports bodies such as, say, the rugby body in Ireland, about the dangers and accidents which have arisen in each sport?  Do they recommend changes in rules to ensure that players will be less open to serious injury and death?

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will clarify the effect of the European Communities (Introduction of Organisms Harmful to Plants or Plant Products) (Prohibition) Regulations, 1980 on the import and export of potatoes and wood; and if he will list fully the plants and plant products to which these regulations refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of potatoes the effect of these regulations is that potatoes originating in a member state of the EEC may be imported from and exported to other member states subject to phytosanitary certification that they conform with the EEC plant health requirements as laid down in Council Directive 77/93/EEC as amended by Directives 80/392/EEC and 80/393/EEC.  Imports of potatoes originating in certain third countries and which are in free circulation in the Community are also allowed under licence and subject to the same plant health requirements.</P>
      <P>As regards wood, the regulations give effect to phytosanitary conditions prescribed in the directives relating to imports from all sources and exports to other member states of wood of conifers, Spanish chestnut, oak, elm and poplar. In general, these provisions apply to wood only in so far as it retains all or part of its natural round surface, with or without bark.  In the specific cases of Spanish chestnut and oak some of the provisions extend to the removal of the rounded surface of the wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directives and the regulations apply to the whole range of plants and plant products and it would not be practicable to list these fully.  The plants and <Col N="1574" /> plant products covered are, however, listed according to species in the annexes to the directives, copies of which are available in the Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister completely satisfied that none of these imports represents a danger, as far as disease is concerned, to Irish producers? Secondly, is the Minister aware that the existing and threatened further imports of potatoes are causing grave concern to our potato producers who are already operating in an unstable market situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the latter question, there are a number of special provisions in the directive to protect our present good plant health situation. What was the Deputy's original question, please?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  The Minister has answered my second question. I shall put the questions again. First of all, is the Minister aware that the existing and threatened future imports of potatoes are causing grave concern to potato producers here?  They fear the loss of their livelihood and devaluation of the crops already sown. Secondly, is the Minister completely satisfied that all of these regulations allowing imports in will not pose a disease danger to Irish plants and has the Minister sufficient safeguards in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding potatoes, which is the Deputy's main concern, formerly we strictly used our plant health licences to limit imports of potatoes.  Under the new regime, potatoes from EEC countries and from Cyprus, the Canary Islands, Malta, Australia and Switzerland which have a special arrangement within the directive, have entry here provided they conform to the plant <Col N="1575" /> health conditions laid down.  We have a number of special provisions in the directive to protect our good plant health situation.  The matter is being kept under strict review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister not only to review the situation from the point of view of not only disease prevention but the danger it may pose to Irish producers?  Further, what number of staff has the Minister involved in examining each consignment of these vegetables coming in, to ensure that they do not break the disease regulations, in view of the fact that the highly dangerous Colorado beetle was imported into Britain and may well be imported here without adequate checks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of quite a number of agricultural products, quality standards are already prescribed by EEC or national regulations.  These standards are enforced by my Department and I am satisfied that home-produced products comply with them.  It is, of course, to the advantage of producers, processors and marketing interests to up-grade the quality and improve the marketing of their products sold on the Irish market, and my Department will give them every encouragement in their <Col N="1578" /> efforts to do so.  Indeed, in view of the competition from imports, there has already been a growing awareness among the interests concerned of the importance of quality, packaging and marketing and increased attention is being given to these aspects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if it is proposed that a scheme of aid be introduced by the <Col N="1580" /> European Commission for the improvement of pig slaughtering facilities in the Europeon Community which will be confined to Britain and France only, and if so, the reason this scheme is not also being made available to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal for aid to improve the facilities for the slaughtering of pigs and the processing of pigmeat in the United Kingdom and France, is one of a number of measures proposed by the Commission for structural improvement in various parts of the Community. Among these measures is the comprehensive structural package for the West of Ireland which will directly benefit pigmeat processing projects in that area and indirectly make funds available for such projects in other parts of the country.  The West of Ireland package was adopted by the Council at its meeting from 28 to 30 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that pig slaughtering facilities, outside the west of Ireland, are so good in this country that we can afford not to receive aid which far wealthier countries such as Britain and France are receiving to improve their pig slaughtering facilities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to get an answer.  Is the Minister not aware that there is serious concern about the standards being followed in certain pigmeat slaughtering premises in this country and that this is creating problems both for our exports and our home markets of Irish pigmeat?  In view of that, would he not consider it appropriate that if wealthy countries like France and Britain are getting EEC aid to update their pig slaughtering facilities we at least, as the poorest member of the existing Nine members of the EEC, should get the same aid?</P>

      <P>As I already informed the Deputy, in a package which has been negotiated moneys are being made available so far as the west is concerned. Moneys are being made available in so far as the western package is concerned. Some £4.2 million has already been approved and paid for 24 pigmeat projects in Ireland since 1973.  I am sure the Deputy is well aware that any improvements are always welcome in so far as any of these industries is concerned.  It is a question of having priorities.</P>

      <P>Inspections of these premises are carried out by local authority veterinary inspectors.  One hundred and seventy-one veterinary inspectors, of which 148 are part-time officers, are employed by 33 local authorities for this work and for other public health duties at a total annual cost of about £500,000.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement giving the names of the local authorities and the number of veterinary inspectors employed by each of them.</P>
      <P>The whole-time local authority veterinary inspectors are recruited through the Local Appointments Commission and they are paid on an incremental scale salary basis.</P>
      <P>The part-time veterinary inspectors who are appointed by the local authorities, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Agriculture, are remunerated at flat rates calculated on the basis of a formula related to the size and population of their districts and the number of slaughterhouses and dairies to be supervised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the reason the effective agreed agricultural price increase in France, taking into account the devaluation of the green franc, will be 10 per cent as against only a 5 per cent increase in Ireland; and if he will outline the extent to which monetary conditions in Ireland differ from those in France, so as to justify the differential treatment of its farmers as against French farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>An average increase of 5 per cent in agricultural prices for 1980-81 to apply throughout the whole Community has been agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  France has already received devaluations of its green rate this year bringing that rate into line with the central rate of the French franc and increasing support prices in France by about 5 per cent. Similar scope for devaluation of the Irish green £ does not exist since the last such <Col N="1587" /> devaluation which took effect on 1 October 1979 brought the Irish green rate close to the central rate of the Irish £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the net effect of the recent negotiations has been to give French farmers a 10 per cent increase while Irish farmers will receive only, at most, 5 per cent and, in some cases, far less?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of France the recent adjustment to their green rate not only eliminated the remaining French MCAs but also eliminated the gap represented by the franchise.  The last devaluation of the Irish green £ in October 1979, on the other hand, only eliminated Irish MCAs and one green rate now is still about 1.3 per cent above the central rate of the Irish pound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meeting of the Council of Ministers which ended on 30 May there was agreement on the prices package for 1980-81.  This agreement included acceptance of the principle that the cost of disposal of additional milk be borne by producers.  In the context of an overall satisfactory package, which does not include the Commission's super levy proposal, this general principle is acceptable. The press release to which the Deputy refers also pointed out that there are still differences of view over the form and the arrangements for applying any additional levy.  This refers to my opposition to the principle of a super levy as proposed by the Commission to which the Government remains firmly opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>EEC Regulation No. 1717/72 provides for the sale of intervention butter at a reduced price to non profit making organisations and institutions. As there was no butter in intervention storage in Ireland up to October last year such a scheme has not hitherto been operated here.  A detailed scheme to provide for such reduced priced sales in Ireland has now been drawn up and I would hope to have it introduced shortly. The quantity of butter available for sale under the scheme is, however, quite limited.</P>
      <P>The scheme will extend to hospitals, residential homes and other such organisations, as well as welfare groups, both in the private and public sectors, which can show that they are not run for a profit and that the supply of meals or the provision for meals is an integral part of their service.  Pending experience of the operation of the scheme I am not in a position to list the organisations likely to benefit from it.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 26:</P>
    <P>In page 25, before section 19, but in Chapter II, to insert the following sections:</P>
    <P>.&mdash;(1)  In this section &lsquo;relevant year&rsquo; means the year 1979-80 or any earlier year of assessment.</P>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Income Tax Acts, the regulations made thereunder or any assessment made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in accordance with the said Acts or said regulations, no repayment of tax shall be made nor shall any credit be allowed to any person in respect of any overpayment of tax (whether paid by deduction or otherwise) suffered by him in respect of any relevant year being an overpayment arising by virtue of the aggregation of the income of that person with the income of his spouse, unless, before the commencement <Col N="1659" /> of that relevant year, he had instituted legal proceedings to assert the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the Income Tax Acts purporting to authorise such aggregation.</P>
    <P>.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;assessment&rsquo; includes an additional assessment;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;an assessment to which this section applies&rsquo; means an assessment to tax made, on or after the passing of this Act, on an individual for a relevant year;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;relevant year&rsquo; means the year 1979-80 or any earlier year of assessment;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the relevant rate&rsquo; means, as respects any of the years 1974-75 to 1979-80, the highest of the higher rates which applied for that year of assessment and, as respects any other relevant year, the rate equal to the aggregate of the standard rate of income tax for that year and the highest rate at which sur-tax was chargeable for that year;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the relevant tax&rsquo;, in relation to an individual, means the amount of tax for a relevant year which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  would have been payable by the individual for that year, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in a case where the individual is a wife who was treated as living with her husband for that year, would have been payable for that year by the husband of the individual,</P>
    <P>if an assessment in respect of the total income of the individual and of his spouse for that year had been made on the 6th day of October in that year on the individual or on the husband of the individual, as the case may be, being an assessment made on the basis and in accordance with the practice prevailing at that time;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;tax&rsquo; means income tax or sur-tax or income tax and sur-tax as the context requires.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, for a relevant year, an assessment to which this section applies is to be made on an individual <Col N="1660" /> (being a husband whose wife was treated as living with him for the relevant year or being a wife who was treated as living with her husband for that year) and, in consequence thereof, the aggregate of the tax, which would be payable for that relevant year by the individual and the spouse of the individual, is less than the amount of the relevant tax in relation to the individual for that relevant year, the provisions of subsection (3) shall apply in relation to the said assessment.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the provisions of this subsection apply in relation to an assessment for a relevant year, then, notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Acts but subject to the provisions of subsection (4)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount of income on which the individual is to be charged to tax shall be ascertained on the basis that section 138 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, had not been in force and had no effect for that year,</P>
    <P>(b)  the assessment shall be made on the basis that the individual is to be charged to tax on his taxable income for the year at the relevant rate, and</P>
    <P>(c)  where the individual on whom the assessment is to be made is a married person, the assessment shall be made on the basis that he is not married and such assessments or adjustments of assessments shall be made as are necessary to secure that the individual and his spouse shall be charged to tax for the relevant year in all respects as if they were not married:</P>
    <P>Provided that any income contained in an assessment made on a husband which, before the 12th day of October, 1979, in accordance with the practice prevailing at the time the assessment was made, was deemed to be his income shall not be regarded as income of any other person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> (4)  Where the provisions of subsection (3) apply in relation to any assessment on an individual for a relevant year, such relief, if any, from tax shall be given as is necessary to secure that the aggregate amount of tax payable by the individual and his spouse for that year shall not exceed the relevant tax for that year, and, in a case where assessments to which this section applies are made on the husband and on his spouse, the relief to be given under this subsection shall be apportioned between them in such manner as is just and reasonable.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the rebate of tax to people who have already paid it or, in some cases, have not paid it prior to the current financial year.  I referred three times yesterday to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> and asked the Minister to comment.  It appears that taxpayers in general will not be treated in the same way as the couple who took the court case.  This is an involved and very complex technical matter which it is exceedingly difficult for any lay person to understand.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to this amendment yesterday when I spoke about this newspaper article but, as a result of a discussion this morning on the Order of Business and references in two newspapers today, the Minister said we would be coming to the matter later on and that we would be unhappy with what we heard.  Just before lunch the Minister dealt with the two amendments and offered to brief by way of letter myself and Deputy O'Leary.  I am grateful for this but I am sorry to say that it is still unclear to me.  The Minister's letter states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw your attention to the attached amendments which I have tabled to the Finance Bill.  These arise as a consequence of the Supreme Court judgment on 25 April regarding the operation of the decision on taxation of married couples.  The court ruled that sections 192 and 198 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, have been invalid <Col N="1662" /> since their enactment in so far as they are unconstitutional but that married couples are not entitled to repayment of tax for previous years unless they had previously initiated these proceedings.  The present amendments are designed to give effect to the Supreme Court judgment and to provide for the full payment of taxes by those who have not yet done so.  The first amendment provides that no repayment of tax shall be made in response to claims for over-payment as a consequence of aggregation of incomes. The second amendment provides that where assessments are made for 1979-80 or any previous year the amounts of tax payable on foot of these will correspond to the amount that would be payable in the normal course if the old rules were still in application.  This will ensure equitable treatment as between those who have already paid their taxes and those who have yet to pay.</P>
    <P>I gather that those who have not yet paid will be treated on a par with those affected by the judgment but those who have made normal weekly payments up to 5 April 1980 will not be refunded any money unless they have actually been involved in a court case to obtain a rebate. Even though the Murphy couple took their case on behalf of all married couples the judgment of the court has been determined by the Minister to apply only to that couple and not to every other couple who found themselves in a similar position.  He quotes in support of that the judgment of the Supreme Court.  The Minister has probably taken advice on this matter and has been told that legally he is not bound to do any more than abide by the narrow interpretation of the judgment.  I have no doubt that legally and in the narrow sense that is correct, but surely it goes against the spirit of the action taken by the couple involved. They said they were taking this action not just on their own behalf but on behalf of all couples who found themselves in a similar position.  In that regard the Minister is not abiding by the spirit of the action taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> These amendments may, as the Minister stated in his letter, introduce equity, but most people would consider that the equity which should be introduced should involve couples who found themselves in the same position as the Murphys and who should receive rebates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are further questions which arise in considering the implications of these amendments.  The Supreme Court decision relates to the Murphy case but nothing prevents the State giving the same dispensation to every other couple as has been given to the Murphys.  What happens in the case of a couple other than the Murphys who were involved in discussions with the Revenue authorities and who have disagreements with them on tax paid or yet to be paid?  A rather interesting situation would arise if the State sought to gain money by way of back tax from couples other than the Murphys.  Might the State be accused of acting unconstitutionally?</P>
      <P>Does this amendment mean that couples engaged in discussion about their tax liability will be forced to bring their case before the courts?  It seems to me a very confused situation.  The Minister must have taken advice on the measure before the House but it seems the State could be constitutionally offside if they are engaged in seeking from couples who are in the same situation as the Murphy couple taxation which the State would claim was payable up to the time of the court decision.</P>
      <P>Collection of tax from the self-employed is a year later.  Presumably a couple in that category can avail of the decision in the Murphy case and get the full benefit of it.  Superficially it would appear to be unfair that a couple whose tax collection is a year later should be able to avail of this where the majority of couples in the PAYE sector are not able to do so.  It appears to me there is a sense of haste about this amendment and I am not sure the Minister can be happy in his mind that he has covered all the implications that arise from the decision in the Murphy case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> There is an anomalous situation with regard to a couple who may be engaged in discussions with the Revenue Commissioners, who may be denying their tax liability or who may be claiming back money.  From what I can understand of the amendments before us, in that situation the State will pursue what the revenue authorities consider is due. Could a couple in that situation go to court and have the action by the State cited as unconstitutional?  The self-employed couple are extremely fortunate in that they can gain the full benefit of the decision in the Murphy case.</P>
    <P>Any measures we take here that appear to be partial as between the self-employed and the PAYE sector are not the wisest to take at the present time. The whole tax structure reeks with anomalies.  It seems to be unjust in the way the burden falls disproportionately on different sections of the taxpaying population.  Abstracting all the individual cases of injustice that can be cited, there appears to be the general case that the people in the PAYE sector are unable to escape the full vigour of the law when it comes to taxation, whereas up to recently the agricultural community could opt for accounts or the notional system and the self-employed could pay a year later. If any measure here increases the sense of privilege of one group and the sense of injustice felt by another group it will be a bad day's work.</P>
    <P>The fairest thing to have done in the wake of the Murphy decision was for the State to begin on a completely clean sheet.  The implications of that decision should have applied to all married couples. The Murphy couple took an admirable initiative in this matter and the intent of the court decision should have been applied to all couples.  The Minister may say that the costs involved should be kept in mind by the Oireachtas. However, if the Oireachtas fail to reform, in time the Supreme Court will take over its functions.  It is happening now.  We spend our time debating measures; for one reason or another of party strategy we do not make a decision in a particular area and the court make <Col N="1665" /> the decision for us.  It happened in this case.  The headlines set by the Supreme Court should have meant that the Minister would see to it that all couples benefited as a result of that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some aspects of this series of amendments that give cause for grave concern.  On reading the Minister's letter and the amendments which have just been circulated, it appears to me he is trying to negative the decision of the court.  The court held that the manner in which married couples were taxed was unconstitutional.  There have been many references to the decision of the Supreme Court on 25 April last but it is proper to point out that this decision followed an appeal by the State against a much earlier decision of the High Court.  In fact, initially it was the High Court which found the sections to be unconstitutional.  The matter does not just date back to confirmation of the decision of the Supreme Court but goes back much earlier to the decision of the High Court.</P>
      <P>The Minister first deals with the question of claims for repayment.  Effectively he has shut the door on any such claims because people had not initiated legal proceedings before they made payment. That is a rather strange situation and it gives rise to all kinds of possibilities.  The second amendment gives rise to even greater possibilities.  It is shutting a door that is now open.  For people whose assessment is under discussion or under appeal, the door is wide open but in his amendment the Minister is saying he is going to negative the decision of the High Court and the Supreme Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The second amendment provides that where assessments were made for 1978-1979 or any previous year the amount of tax payable will correspond to the amount that would be payable if the old rules were still in application.  These documents have been circulated in the past 30 <Col N="1666" /> minutes and I have not had an opportunity to go into them in detail but from a cursory reading of the amendment and what the Minister said in his letter what in effect he is trying to do is to reestablish the old rules despite the decision of the High Court as upheld by the Supreme Court, so that somebody who is in the situation that, say, their assessment may be under appeal, will be unable to take advantage of the Murphy decision.  Referring to the fact that they had not previously initiated legal proceedings is a very specious response because obviously they would not have initiated proceedings if their assessments were under appeal.  That is not the real point.  The real point here is that the Minister is trying to obviate the decision of the Supreme Court and restore the situation where a married couple whose assessments are under appeal, from whom ultimately claims for outstanding tax may be made, will be put in the situation where they cannot avail of the Murphy decision.</P>
      <P>As a politician and as a lawyer such a course of action would seem to me to be fraught with very grave dangers and I am very concerned that these amendments should be obviously drafted in such a hurry.  I do not blame the parliamentary draftsmen because they obviously had to do this at very short notice.  But to rush them through here without the full examination of the type of consequences I mention here is a very dangerous practice indeed.  Essentially the proper course would be for the Minister to accept that all married couples are entitled to avail of the benefit of the decision of the Supreme Court despite the fact that they were not personally involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes any other view surely the suggestion can only be that the Minister is trying to encourage litigation, trying to encourage people to institute legal proceedings at the drop of a hat on every issue that arises in case they will be cut out of the benefit of any such decision. That is not the basis on which law should be administered.  If there is a court decision, a decision of the High <Col N="1667" /> Court and then a decision of the highest court in this land which finds certain enactments to be unconstitutional, it is altogether improper that the Government should attempt to introduce legislation by way of amendment to the Finance Bill or otherwise to ensure that the people of this State are not able to take advantage of such a decision, and, in effect, to negative the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from trying to act against and contrary to the spirit of the decision of the Supreme Court I am doing precisely the opposite.  I am acting very much in line with that decision and in line with the statements of the various judges, particularly Mr. Justice Henchy, who delivered the majority judgment.  I intend to quote extracts which I believe and which I trust Deputies opposite will believe will clearly demonstrate that far from acting contrary either to the decision or the <i>obiter dicta</i> of the Supreme Court, I am acting very much in line both with their decision and their <i>obiter dicta.</i></P>
      <P>Deputy Barry has said that the plaintiffs in question brought this action not just on their own behalf but on behalf of the rest of the community.  That may well have been on their minds; it may well have been their intention.  But whatever was on their minds or whatever was their intention it is obviously not the guide or criterion by which I must act but rather what the court determines as a consequence of the action that they bring before the court.  The court certainly did not hold that in this instance the Murphy couple were acting on behalf of others; they did not hold that what was determined in respect of them should apply to others.  They made no such determination. They did rather the opposite and I will come to it in a moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the points one at a time as they were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis what I am doing is acting very strictly in line with what the <Col N="1668" /> court did hold on this issue.  Let me mention at this point, because the question has been touched upon, that I have taken advice in these areas&mdash;obviously any prudent Minister would take advice on any such issue.  From the advice available to me in relation to interpretating the Supreme Court decision and as to what my obligations are in this area as Minister for Finance, I am satisfied that I am acting within the Constitution; otherwise I would not be introducing this amendment.  I am satisfied also that I am acting within the spirit and letter of what the Supreme Court decided.</P>
    <P>It is as well then that perhaps I should mention some basic principles first in relation to the law and then quote from the judgments themselves.  The court ruled out other repayments on the grounds, amongst others, that it is not a universal rule that what has been done in pursuance of a law which has been held to have been invalid will necessarily give a good cause of action.  They held that very clearly and this is not the first time that such decision has been taken.  They also held very clearly and indicated that the State was entitled, in the absence of any claim of unconstitutionality, to act on the assumption that everything was presumed to have been done according to the law.  This is not a new principle formulated by this Supreme Court because there is the principle that: <i>Omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta.</i>  That is a fundamental principle of all constitutional law and the court held here that the State was entitled, in the absence of any claim of unconstitutionality, to act on the assumption that the taxes in question were validly imposed, that they were properly transmissible to the Central Fund and that from there they were liable to be expended, according to the will of Parliament, for the multiplicity of purposes for which drawings are made on the Central Fund of the State.  That is very consistent with all statements of principle in this area that have been made by any court reviewing constitutional issues. They also held that in the absence of special circumstances payments of <Col N="1669" /> PAYE taxes during the whole of the tax year without instituting proceedings to have the taxes invalidated on the grounds of unconstitutionality should be held to defeat a claim made later to recover the taxes paid during the year. For all of those reasons it is fairly clear that whatever Deputies opposite might want to imply to the court it would be as well to leave it to the court to speak for themselves.  I have been as close to the courts as most Members of this House and it is a hazardous operation to start attributing things such as what the court might have intended or perhaps would intend if they were asked to do certain things, instead of relying on what they do say in discharging their functions.</P>
    <P>Before I come to the quotations let me refer to what Deputy O'Leary has said. He said that if we do not do our job here the court will do it for us.  That of course is not the case.  In any event, where the court finds as is the established principle under our Constitution under the separation of powers, that they interpret the constitutionality of laws that are referred to in it and they, in discharge of their function, adjudicate on what is or what is not constitutional, the fact that from time to time they determine that certain actions which were done by the legislature may not have been in accordance with the Constitution is not a condemnation, as has been implied, of the legislature.  If that was the case we would have immediate and open confrontation in any state that enshrined that very desirable principle of the separation of powers.  There would be a simple way out of that which would operate probably in the dictatorships or authoritarian states.  We would have no Supreme Court; it is as simple as that. We would not have this principle that is so important in our legislation and something that all sides of the House would want to cherish and support.  But in so doing let us not interpret their decisions as being more than they are, more than they themselves could or would present them as being.  Let us not interpret them as saying that they are doing the <Col N="1670" /> job which we should be doing.  That is not the case.  There are people in the media and people generally who do not really understand the principles that apply here.  Of course one will find some general comment that might seem to suggest that Parliament did not do its work, that the courts had to do the work of Parliament.  That is not the position that applies here.  I shall quote here some of the statements made by Mr. Justice Henchy in the Supreme Court.  He said:</P>
    <P>In every tax year from the enactment of the Income Tax Act, 1967, until the institution of these proceedings in March 1978, the State justifiably altered its position by spending the taxes thus collected and by arranging its fiscal and taxational policies and programmes accordingly.</P>
    <P>I might pause here to mention that it is not any accident that, apart from the Taoiseach, the only Minister of Government who happens to be mentioned in the Constitution is the Minister for Finance.  This is because he too has a constitutional responsibility both in relation to the collection of revenue and to its disposal.  Therefore, whoever holds this office for the time being must also discharge his constitutional responsibility. That is what Mr. Justice Henchy was referring to when he said that the State altered its position by spending the taxes thus collected and by arranging its fiscal and taxation policies and programmes accordingly.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>At the end of each tax year up to and including the tax year 1977-78, those charged by the State with auditing, controlling or planning the finances of the State, were, in the absence of any formulated proceedings or any other sound reason for doubting the validity of the taxes in question, entitled to close their books for that year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Note the words, &ldquo;entitled to close their books for that year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the justified assurance that, if any of the taxes that had been collected, allocated, spent or been made the basis of projections for future taxation <Col N="1671" /> or fiscal policy, were to become at some future date judicially faulted, and having been unconstitutionally exacted, restitution of those taxes would not be ordered.  For a variety of reasons it would be inequitable, if not impracticable, to expect restitution.</P>
    <P>I note that Mr. Justice Henchy uses the word &ldquo;inequitable&rdquo; whereas Deputies opposite seem to use equity in a rather different sense.  I can only say that, in so far as is concerned the principle that equity follows the law, I would prefer to be guided by the legal dictum of what is equitable than by the political interpretations that one would hear in this House. Mr. Justice Henchy continued:</P>
    <P>Each tax year involves a different group of taxpayers, if only because of the deaths of some taxpayers and the accession of new persons to the lists of taxpayers.  Restitution could be effected only by means of a special statutory provision, which would involve the imposition of fresh taxation to meet what would become an unquantifiable number of claims with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>These are not my words, nor are they my interpretation of what might have been the Supreme Court decision.  They are the words of Mr. Justice Henchy, whom I consider to be the best authority on which to rely in this case.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>For my part, I consider that in the absence of special circumstances (which have not been shown to exist in this case), payment of PAYE taxes during the whole of a tax year, without instituting proceedings to have the taxes invalidated on the ground of unconstitutionality, should be held to defeat a claim made later to recover the taxes paid during that year.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that no other taxpayer instituted proceedings, Mr. Justice Henchy went on to say:</P>
    <P>No taxpayers other than the plaintiffs would have the standing necessary to maintain a claim that the <Col N="1672" /> State should reimburse them for any taxes collected under the condemned sections.</P>
    <P>That, again, is straight to the point. Indeed, Mr. Justice Griffin held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the excessive amounts of income collected from them by the revenue authorities by reason of the aggregation of their income only in respect of the tax years, 1978-79 and 1979-80.  He held also that unless proceedings had been instituted on behalf of any other taxpayers claiming the condemnation of the sections in question or seeking the recovery of any excess taxes collected from them, only the plaintiffs could maintain a claim in pursuit of the decision.</P>
    <P>I have quoted enough from the judgments of the Supreme Court to indicate that the law and that equity as interpreted in the law, and which follows the law, has been clearly stated by the best authority in this regard, namely, the judges of the Supreme Court.  What I am doing here in discharging my responsibilities as Minister for Finance is giving effect to those judgments.  Of course, I have responsibility to the Exchequer as well as to the taxpayers, as I have a responsibility in relation to the disbursement of tax.  Taking into account the advice that I have received, I am confident that what I am doing is entirely in accordance with the Constitution and with the law.  Deputy O'Leary is right in saying that any Minister for Finance could go further.  I do not expect that the Supreme Court would knock something that was done on the basis of extending benefits further.  Of course a Minister for Finance could go back further than any issue raised here.  He could go back as far as he considered appropriate in relating to applying the principles&mdash;to misquote myself but to quote the Opposition&mdash;of the Murphy decision.  But legally I am not required to do that.  In addition, as Deputies opposite know, for me to act in this way would involve major political decisions which would mean major expenditure of public funds, funds which would have to be provided by other taxpayers. We all recognise that the <Col N="1673" /> Minister for Finance of the day does not have money stacked away somewhere in little coffers or that all he has to do is to wave some kind of major wand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to have plenty of money to spread around.  We have all got to the stage of recognising that we ourselves pay for what we provide for ourselves.  It is the taxpayers who provide.  Now that I can take the political decision, I see no justification politically&mdash;the very opposite&mdash;in view of what is being done, particularly in implementing income splitting this year, in imposing such a huge extra burden, a burden which is actually unquantifiable. It is always easier from Opposition benches to ask, whether from the county council or the Dáil, for more and more on behalf of more and more.  If the Opposition Deputies did a little analysis on it, when they were asked to advise on how the funds were to be collected to meet their requests, they would very soon, and wisely, withdraw their requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to extract from the Minister, that it is his decision that the result of the Supreme Court case will be confined to the couple concerned.  I wanted to unwrap the robes of rectitude which the Minister has wound around himself, to find out his position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Supreme Court decision.  There is no legal decision which prevents him from making what would obviously be a difficult decision to make as regards the implications and extent of it.  No court decision would prevent him from making a settlement or a decision in that area.  He would not be seen in that capacity as acting perhaps in a strictly legal sense. To that extent he need not worry about the strict implications of restitution.  He would simply be acting as a Minister for Finance.  When I spoke earlier about the role of the courts and the role of Parliament I was not arguing against the idea <Col N="1674" /> of separation of powers but simply making the point that in this Supreme Court decision and decisions in other cases which would be irrelevant&mdash;for example, on the question on contraception&mdash;the courts had to some extent increasingly, because of the failure of this Parliament to grasp what are referred to as nettles, within the separation of powers to make up the leeway of indecision which has been a feature of parliamentary life for a number of years for various reasons &mdash;strategic reasons, popularity reasons or otherwise.  The majority party in Government in this House have failed to make certain decisions, leaving a greater role, and property, to be discharged by the courts, as happened in this case.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the Supreme Court decision, it is another argument on whether the resources at the Minister's disposal would merit a more generous approach to this problem.  &ldquo;What's Another Year&rdquo;, as the pop song goes. What was 1977?  The point has been made repeatedly in the life of this Parliament that we have not been so discriminatory or scrupulous in our regard to the use of resources up to now.  If they are inheriting, as they are increasingly inheriting, and dealing with a community which is split into millions of sections, with a cash tag in relation to each section's demands, they have only themselves to thank that they are authors of this national psychology which is now the dominant psychology of more on all fronts But that is a separate argument.</P>
      <P>The Minister has correctly read out a Supreme Court judgment in relation to one couple.  I accept that it gives plenty of protection for abiding closely to the court decision.  However, as Minister for Finance elected by popular franchise, nothing in that decision prevents him from broadening and extending the effect of the judgment as related to the Murphy couple, difficult though the decision may be when one comes to the detail of its implications in relating to other couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what the Minister has said here, there are still many loose ends.  It is still open to other couples, as yet unnamed, to possibly cite cases in relation <Col N="1675" /> to claims under appeal.  There is the rather anomalous situation that those married couples who belong to the self-employed can quite legitimately claim back moneys under appeal.  It seems unfair that the effect of the Murphy decision in their case will not rule anything out for them, whereas it will, or appears to, in relation to couples under PAYE.</P>

If I did, I would come across a quotation from the present Taoiseach looking for another £100 million to be borrowed and spent, no bother at all&mdash;it is easy to say where it should be spent when in Opposition&mdash;or the present Tánaiste, four or five years ago, again from this side of the House, saying that indexation should be introduced immediately&mdash;no question of where the money was to come from.  As he said himself, to give him his due, &ldquo;It is no concern of mine. That is a matter for the Government.  I am saying the principle which should be applied&rdquo;.

      <P>The Minister is being a little bit schoolboyish here over the last few days in going back over Dáil debates.  I am not going to follow him down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is quite simply that a couple have taken an action the result of which has been that they will be given a rebate of tax&mdash;I am not sure of the date and perhaps the Minister will tell me whether it is from March 1978 when they took the action or from the date of the High Court judgment or the Supreme Court judgment.  This couple took this action and are going to be given a rebate of tax paid under an Act which was found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional. I accept the corrections of the quotation that the Minister has given here today and that his interpretation of it is legally right.  I never from the time I stood up an hour ago to speak on this Finance Bill assumed otherwise. However, I differ from the Minister when he says that he would prefer the courts definition of equity to the political definition given in this House.  The court <Col N="1677" /> is the court and it rules on legal matters. This House is the House of politicians and we decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister understands the position, as Deputy O'Keeffe, Deputy Bruton and a few more Deputies who are lawyers do.  I am concerned about equity as the ordinary man in the street understands it, that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  That may be an unfortunate choice of phrase in the circumstances. The position is that a rebate of tax to be given to the Murphys in equity, as understood by the ordinary speakers of the English language, should be given to all couples in a similar position, and that is what I ask the Minister to do.  He has repeated and I can see from the letter he has sent me and from his amendment that this is the advice which he has got. He is interpreting the law precisely and correctly, and I accept that point.  He is also writing into this Finance Bill the interpretation of the Supreme Court decision in this regard, and I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying is that what Mr. and Mrs. Murphy have got as a result of a Supreme Court decision, Mr. and Mrs. O'Keeffe, Mr. and Mrs. Bruton, Mr. and Mrs. Fitzpatrick and Mr. and Mrs. O'Leary should all get as well.  That is equity as I understand it.  That is what most ordinary people would see as the fair thing to do.  Imagine what would have happened if this judgment had been handed down three weeks previously, in the last financial year.  Can you imagine the bottleneck in the courts as people lodged their claims for rebate on the tax paid by them in what would then be the current financial year?  It is only the fortuitous circumstance of the judgment being handed down during the month of April, after the close of the financial year, that all of these people are not going to be allowed claim through the courts for a rebate of the tax paid in the financial year from 5 April 1979 to 5 April 1980.  That is the point.  It is purely <Col N="1678" /> because that judgment was handed down at that time these people are being deprived; according to the judgment they are not now entitled to claim because they are not claiming within the financial year.  I think that is the correct interpretation, but to my mind every one of them is entitled to claim.  The Minister says that what is in a person's mind, in the Murphys' minds, whatever was their intention, or may even have been written down, is not a matter for a court judgment. That is correct.  But the public at large understood that the Murphys were taking this case on behalf of all married couples who felt that the law that aggregated their incomes for tax purposes was unconstitutional.  If that is so&mdash;as I believe, and I shall introduce an amendment on Report Stage to say so&mdash;then every married couple should be given the same rebate of tax retrospectively to whatever date the Murphys are being given it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must suggest very strongly here that there is neither justice nor equality in what the Minister is proposing to do.  Basically he is arguing backwards.  The Supreme Court said that those who had paid could not recover.  The Minister extends this by saying, and by introducing amendments here to provide, that those who have not yet paid will be put in the same situation as those who have already paid.  In fact it should be other way round.  The Supreme Court has not laid down any decision, specifically or otherwise, as to those who have not yet paid.  I believe those people should be entitled to take advantage of the Murphy decision and, despite anything the Minister does here today, may still be entitled constitutionally so to do.  As I see it, putting the argument the proper way round, we have now a situation in which there are people who, for one reason or another, because assessments may be under appeal and so on, have not made their payments. The law, as enunciated by the Supreme Court, makes it clear that they do not have to make those payments. That is the picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is talking about introducing equity into the situation what <Col N="1679" /> he should be doing here is to provide for the repayment to those people who are in a different situation because they have previously made payments.  That is the way the argument should be presented here.  With respect to the Minister, he evaded the point entirely in the long excerpts he quoted from the decision of the Supreme Court.  Nobody has argued here on what the Supreme Court judges have said about the entitlement to repayments in law if an Act is held to be unconstitutional. It is accepted that what has happened previously is not to be undone. If, say, a Criminal Justice Act is held to be unconstitutional, somebody who has served a jail sentence is not entitled to claim for unlawful imprisonment against the State; similarly in civil matters. That is quite clear, but that has nothing to do with the fundamental issue here.  As I see it the issue is that the Supreme Court has held that these provisions were unconstitutional.  The Minister is trying to extend the words of Mr. Justice Henchy and others to protect the Government from the repayments they should be making.  He is doing this on the spurious grounds of providing equitable treatment.  He is taking the words of the Supreme Court in regard to claims for repayment and extending them to those who have not yet paid.  In effect that is what the second amendment the Minister is introducing here provides.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister, in regard to his first amendment, why is it necessary at all except as a spurious basis for the second one?  The first amendment provides that no repayment of tax shall be made in response to a claim for overpayment as a consequence of aggregation of incomes.  Is it not already&mdash;as read out by the Minister&mdash;the decision of the Supreme Court that that is the case?  Why then is it necessary to produce an amendment to that effect?  I suggest the only reason this amendment was produced was to permit of the second which, in effect, is saying that the old rules will apply in regard to those who have not yet made payments for those income tax years. Therefore I suggest the first amendment <Col N="1680" /> is entirely unnecessary and the second is probably unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I must suggest strongly that the Minister's approach to this whole problem is entirely wrong and unjust, that he is attempting to extract from people&mdash;those people in the category whose payments for those years have not yet been made&mdash;money which the Supreme Court has held they should not pay, and he is doing this under the guise of equity.</P>

    <P>What the Minister is now proposing to do, in regard to his second amendment, is to provide that the amount of tax payable for the year 1979-80 and previous years&mdash;where that amount has not already been paid&mdash;is to be paid on the basis of the old rules, the old rules which were declared to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, <Col N="1681" /> and he is attempting to do this under the guise of equity.  Does the Minister appreciate the consequence of what he is proposing to do?  Unless I am misreading his amendment entirely, in effect what he is saying is that those people whose assessments are under appeal, whose payments have not yet been made, must pay as if the Supreme Court never decided on this matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Supreme Court held that sections 192 to 198 of the 1967 Income Tax Act are unconstitutional, and the effect of that decision was to exempt Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, the plaintiffs in the case, from income tax as assessed on them in respect of the financial year 1979-80, but the court went on to hold that that decision applied only to Mr. and Mrs. Murphy and not to all other married couples who found themselves in exactly the same circumstance.  The court also held that the decision was not retrospective to the date on which the 1967 Act became law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my understanding of the Supreme Court decision.  I can understand the court holding that the decision could not be retrospective to 1967 because that would have all sorts of complications, but the decision is absolutely <Col N="1682" /> clear, that as far as Mr. and Mrs. Murphy are concerned they are to be exempt from the income tax assessed on them for 1979-80.  I say that irrespective of what the Minister argues; the law is that if one couple are exempt from income tax under certain rules in respect of a given year, then every couple in the country in the same circumstances should be exempt in respect of the same year under the same rules, and it is unjust and unfair for this House to attempt to pass legislation that would decree otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about equity following the law and the law following equity.  We here want to talk in plain language, plain common sense.  We have control of the situation here.  The Supreme Court spelled out the law as they saw it and they said that only the couple who had brought the case were entitled to a refund if they had paid, or to an exemption if they had not.  I presume the Murphys had in respect of 1979-80. Once one couple in the State are treated in that way the entire population should be treated in the same way if they bring themselves under the decision of Murphy v. Ireland.  To try to do anything else is unfair and unjust.  The Murphys brought the case and that is the only respect in which they are different from all the other Mr. and Mrs. Murphys in the country.</P>
    <P>All the other couples in the same circumstances are having their joint earned income aggregated and they are being taxed on it.  That is what the Supreme Court held to be wrong and that is what the law is for Mr. and Mrs. Murphy in respect of 1979-80, and as far as this House is concerned that should be the law in respect of every other similar couple for that year.</P>
    <P>The Minister may try to argue that that would be impossible because the consequences would be catastrophic for the other taxpayers, that it would upset the finances of the State to such an extent that it would create chaos.  That is not the case.  I do not know how much money is involved but it would be small&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Who is to pay?  If it is to be the married people, this means they will be given money with one hand and paying it back with the other. If they are not asked to pay, who is left? We would have to ask the single people to pay this extra £100 million.  We could tell them that we have done well by married people but we would need this extra money to meet the wishes of Opposition <Col N="1686" /> Deputies, even though the law does not require it nor does the Constitution suggest it and there is no known principle that requires it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is concerned with the extension of income tax liability to farmers having valuations between £40 and £50.  On average these are farmers who have between 40 and 50 acres and who would be earning between £4,000 and £5,000 per year.  On the basis of demographic data about the number of children per family and the average income for particular types of farming it can be clearly seen from a quick calculation that most of these people would not be earning a taxable income.  The net result of this section is that all these people, who in many if not all cases could be <Col N="1688" /> seen not to be earning a taxable income, will have to go to the considerable bother of preparing accounts which will be examined and stamped by accountants for presentation to the Revenue Commissioners. The whole operation will be completely abortive as far as collecting revenue for the State is concerned.  A substantial number of farmers who have not a taxable income will have to pay accountants to prove this fact, and this is not a desirable development.  There are many very talented accountants and their valuable time will be wasted in going over the books of people who are obviously not taxable.  I assert that there are a substantial number of people with valuations between £40 and £60 who will not be liable to tax because of the size of their family.</P>
      <P>My second argument is applicable to this particular year, though it may not be applicable in every year.  It is common cause among all sections of the community and among reputable economists within and without agriculture that in many cases farmers have not made money but have suffered substantial losses.  They are now to be brought into the tax net.  Of course, the Minister will say that if they have suffered losses they will certainly not have to pay income tax.  That point is conceded, although they will be paying substantially increased rates.  That is another argument on which we have yet to spend some time in this House.  Many farmers who have suffered losses will have to go to the expense of producing accounts to prove they are not taxable, which fact could be easily predicted on the basis of available information about the number of children they have to support and the prevailing agricultural conditions.  This will be an expensive waste of time which will not yield much revenue to the State and it is a matter of some concern to the entire farming community.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say he has made the concession, as yet not clearly explained, that in the case of farmers being brought into the tax net for the first time they will be allowed for the first year to present what are disingenuously described as &ldquo;simple&rdquo; accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1689" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;simple&rdquo;. I said a &ldquo;simplified form of accounts&rdquo;. The term did not start from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's description and I am not attempting to quote him verbatim.  I should like to know a little more about these simplified accounts.  If they can give the information needed in respect of this category of farmers, would not simplified accounts suffice in the case of other categories of farmers?  The Minister might address himself to that question in his contribution. The accounts required at present are quite complicated.  The significant point about this so-called concession is that it will apply only for one year.  It is like the sugar coating on the medicine for the first application, but in subsequent applications there will be pure unadulterated castor oil without any sugar coating or orange flavour.  Like the resource tax, which is supposed to last only for a year, it is a means of trying to keep everyone at bay for at least 12 months and then do the worst.  It is an easy payment plan under which one will finally have to pay more.</P>
      <P>Lest the Minister should say that I am making a song and dance about people having to prepare accounts when he is providing this simplified method, I would point out that it is only to last for a very brief period.  We do not know how simplified they will be.  I should like to know from the Minister if it will still be necessary to get accountants to vouch for the simplified accounts as it has been necessary to get accountants to vouch for what one might describe as the complicated accounts?  If accountants will have to vouch for them there is not much advantage in having the accounts simplified.  We should get specific details about what is meant by simplified accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned about is the cost incurred by farmers in hiring accountants to prove they do not have an income.  I accept that farmers should pay tax if they have an income, but I object to putting them to the bureaucratic cost of proving they do not have an income <Col N="1690" /> when that is obvious from simple observation.  I should like to point out to the Minister that in Northern Ireland farmers pay income tax.  There is a large number of small farmers there also and it has not been necessary for accountants to vouch for every set of accounts submitted by them.  In fact, a simple return of income is accepted from the bulk of farmers in Northern Ireland and there has been no suggestion that they have been getting away with murder so far as tax is concerned.  They may get away with it for one year, but if their returns are clearly out of line with the situation obtaining in other sections of the community events catch up with them and they have to pay their tax.  If it is possible to work that system in Northern Ireland without requiring accountants to be involved in every case, I do not know why it is not possible to operate it here.  I should like the Minister to say if he has investigated the situation and if he will give us the results of the investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad the Deputy referred to the fact that there is a simplified system for people whose valuations are between £40 and £50 but I do not like the case being made that such people have to engage the services of an accountant.  In his budget statement and subsequently the Minister stated that these people may submit simplified accounts. When the National Coalition Government introduced the tax originally there was a simplified form of accounts in operation and the Revenue Commissioners accepted them.  Quite a number of farmers submitted their accounts themselves in 1974-75 and they did not have any great problem.  I have told many farmers to avail of the simplified form of accounts.  It will not involve them in much work.  Nowadays they sell at the mart, in the factories, creameries and to the Dublin dairies and it is easy for them to indicate lodgments and payments on their bank statement. The form in operation when the National Coalition Government were in office was not difficult to complete and did not present any difficulty for farmers.  We should not scare farmers who have a valuation of £40 or £50 into hiring the <Col N="1691" /> services of accountants.  They are able to produce their accounts themselves and there are many people to advise them.  I am sure the agricultural instructors will advise them with regard to valuations and this is where the major problem arises.  I would advise all farmers with valuations of £40 to £50 to use the simplified accounts.  Speakers here are doing a disservice to such farmers when they tell them to engage accountants to do the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard much talk this morning about equity, about who should or should not be entitled to a rebate of tax.  This section reduces the threshold and can be seen as a further attack by Fianna Fáil on the poorer section.  In the main this represents farmers with holdings of 35 acres to 60 acres.  I think Deputy Bruton put their incomes far too high; their incomes range from £2,000 to £5,000.  Since 1977 there has been a consistent attack by the Government on this group and the valuation threshold has been reduced from £75 to £40.</P>
      <P>This morning the Minister imposed a further injustice when he increased the interest rates on death duties from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  The Minister has practical knowledge of rural Ireland.  In the past few years we have had Ministers of Finance who were based in the urban areas but people expected that a man from a rural area such as Tipperary would have some practical knowledge of the difficulties faced by farmers.  The Minister has not taken any measures to protect the people working the land.  I am prepared to accept that the measures before the House are the collective responsibility of the Government, but one expected more from a Minister who comes from a rural constituency.  Fianna Fáil completely misled the people with their manifesto of 1977 and they have consistently attacked the agricultural community since then.  Now they are attacking people with incomes as low as £2,000 to £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure may not cost a lot in actual tax but we know that people with a valuation of £40 are liable for full rates. <Col N="1692" /> The Minister spoke about simplified accounts for one year, but that will not suffice. In most cases it will cost £250 to engage an accountant and this amount, in addition to rates of £500 to £600, will mean a cost of from £15 to £20 per week for people with the lowest incomes in the country.  Even if they do not pay tax, after 1980 they will have to employ an accountant. The ordinary PAYE taxpayer merely fills up a form based on figures from his work place.  A farmer with a valuation of £40 to £50 has a simple income, one that is based on the sale of milk to a creamery and which can be quite easily assessed.  On the basis of cattle or pigs or poultry to a factory, surely at this stage it should not be necessary for these people to keep accounts.  You said &ldquo;simplified accounts&rdquo;.  The Minister has never told us exactly what simplified accounts mean but we are now handing over to the Revenue Commissioners people with the lowest possible income and at the same time we are asking these people to pay between £15 and £20 on actual income of £2,000 to £3,000 in some cases even if they have a low valuation.  I point out to the Minister that in County Wexford, as in every other county in Ireland, we have a great variation in the valuation system.  We have from as high as 125p poundage per acre in valuation.  These people would have a valuation of only £40 but they would have only 30 acres of land while in other places in Wexford they would have 100 acres of land and £40-£45 valuation.</P>
    <P>In view of these massive fluctuations some attempt should be made to have adjusted acreage put into operation.  This has been talked about down the years and sooner or later somebody will have to stand up in this House and state that when you are trying to extract money from people it must be done with some equity.  There is no equity in the valuation system.  The same must apply in your own county as it must apply also in every county in Ireland.  Further, you have given an undertaking that valuation will remain for three years at £40.  Any undertaking given by Fianna Fáil since they regained office in 1977 as far as the farmers are concerned is a sick joke.  The <Col N="1693" /> previous Minister gave an absolute undertaking that anybody who opted for the notional system under the 1978 budget would have to stay on that system for three years.  You are giving the same undertaking in your budget. You can take it, Minister, that nobody will take it seriously.</P>

      <P>As far as agricultural incomes are concerned he can take it that in the year 1980, depending upon the increase in prices and on the type of farming you are in and how developed that system is, your income can fall from 12 per cent to 25 per cent.  Where is the justification in asking people with smallest incomes in this land to pay, first of all rates&mdash;and for people with £40 valuation the rates will be about £450 up to £650&mdash;to pay an accountant £250 more and the Minister is asking them to pay tax?

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a simple question.  What is the meaning of simplified accounts?  For how long will they apply?  That is what the farmers are asking.  How does he justify asking people with an income as low as £2,000 to pay, first of all, up to £500 rates, £250 for an accountant, and on top of that to pay tax if they have a taxable income?</P>

You do not need to be an accountant or even to go beyond national school standard in your efforts to fill in the queries asked in the query form.  If Deputy D'Arcy consults any of his constituents who have already received them he will have no doubt in his mind that this is an acceptable, simplified system.</P>

      <P>Whenever new measures are introduced, it is natural that people will resent those measures especially at a time when agriculture has passed through a difficult period.  They had marketing problems during 1979 and those problems are not with us in 1980. The farm incomes are guaranteed through recent agreements in Brussels. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the farming community will have a better chance of a reasonable income during 1980 than they had in 1979.  That is completely in contrast with the situation in 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I see nothing wrong in <Col N="1697" /> asking farmers to make returns in the same way.  We hear a great deal of talk about the introduction of equity into the tax system.  This is an effort to achieve equity.  If there were a change of Government after the next general election, I wonder would we see the complete abolition of farmer taxation?

      <P>Deputy D'Arcy talked about the inequities of the land valuation system.  Every constituency is affected by the land valuation system.  In County Westmeath we have land valued at £150 per statute acre&mdash;among the highest in the country&mdash;and I am surprised nobody from the Opposition benches has talked about the revaluation of all the land of Ireland.  I do not know how anybody would set about that task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are working the system as we have it.  These measures are being introduced.  The vast majority of the farming community are coming around to the idea that they should make tax returns in the same way as every other section of the community.  Most of them have been keeping farm accounts under the EEC scheme where they qualify for a grant of £60 each year. They have become accustomed to that. They are paid for doing a specific job. The Opposition are labouring farming accounts in a big way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in answer to a Dáil question the Minister stated that the farming community were not obliged to submit farm accounts to an auditor.  If they are <Col N="1698" /> capable of doing them themselves in conjunction with their agricultural adviser, those accounts will be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners.  I was more than pleased when the Minister made that statement.  He took the pressure off many farmers who had misgivings because of the fact that they were coming into the tax net for the first time. There has been a great deal of scare-mongering. It will not be as difficult as people imagine.  If no profit is made no tax is paid.  I agree with the principle of introducing equity into the taxation system in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I subscribe to the principle that, where there is taxable income, income tax should be paid.  My concern was about the substantial payments which might have to be made to an accountant to prove that people did not have a taxable income.  Deputies speaking from the Minister's side of the House pointed out&mdash;as I acknowledged in my original contribution&mdash;that this simplified accounts system would operate for farmers between £40 and £50 valuation coming into the tax net for the first time.</P>
      <P>It bears repetition that the Minister has said only that this is a temporary measure, perhaps for the first year.  No assurance has been given that this simplified accounts system will continue for any length of time.  Once these people are in the tax net, presumably they will stay in it.  Deputy Keegan's reference to farmers being able to present their own accounts, assuming they are on the more complicated basis of accounts because they are over £50 valuation, may be fine on paper, but in practice farmers cannot do that.  I am sure Deputy Keegan would be hard put to find people in his constituency who have been able to present their own accounts.</P>

It is very important that I should make it quite clear once again that there is no <Col N="1700" /> question of forcing small farmers who come into the tax net for the first time to engage accountants.  If that were so, obviously much of the case made by the Opposition would be well made.  I have been charged, among other things, with ignoring the background from which I came.  Most of my farmer relations are in this category.  I may be a bit closer to this category than some of those who speak on their behalf from the other side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know them.  I was reared with them and lived with them.  If I were imposing the cost on them of going to an accountant, it would be an undue burden and would be unwarranted.  I am not doing that.  From the earliest stages of our consultations with the farm organisations they have been very fruitful in a wide variety of areas and in this area specifically.  We agreed to introduce a simple farm accounts form for small enterprise farmers.  The form has been under discussion and has been agreed subject to reference to the organisations involved.</P>
      <P>It will be a simple farm accounts form for small enterprise farmers.  I cannot give further details until we get confirmation that it has been accepted as agreed by the organisations at large.  The forms we are talking about are simple and simplified and meet the criteria about which Deputy Crinion and Deputy Keegan spoke.  Deputy D'Arcy referred to them also.  They are simply statements of receipts and expenses in the simplest form and they derive from the experience of the Revenue Commissioners and the farmers with whom they have been in consultation.  They are intended to be of assistance to farmers in presenting their accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that this is what the farm organisations themselves want.  We have often heard leaders of the farm organisations say that they would like to see a situation where everyone would be subject to accounts so that they would not have to continue to listen to claims <Col N="1701" /> that farmers are getting special treatment and that accounts would tell the full story.  Now that we are doing that it is a little bit unreasonable of the other side to imply that we are imposing burdens when we are not, to imply something which the representatives of the farm organisations have not implied.  Of course, one can represent here for one's own purpose something that the leaders of the farm organisations themselves would not represent.  We have engaged in very useful consultation with them and they have found these consultations, as we have found them, to be very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In addition, let me say that, while it applies to those who come in for the first time this year, it is not confined to them, because we are talking about small enterprise farmers, and where appropriate it can also be used by farmers who have valuations over £50.  That is not to say that it will be found to be appropriate in every case, but where there are small enterprise units&mdash;and this is one of the things that I would hope would be seen as a measure of my response in contact with my officials because of my experience in this area with small farmers&mdash;this form of accounts will be available not just to those with valuations between £40 and £50 but to the small enterprise farmers above £50 in appropriate cases.  That would obviously be for decision in particular cases.  I want to make it clear that I am ready and anxious to see this being applied as widely as possible in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>The third point that has been raised here is the question of duration.  Let Deputies not represent to me or to my Department on my behalf a view of something I have not said.  I have said that this will be reduced for those coming into the tax net this year, namely, those with valuations between £40 and £50.  I have already said&mdash;and Deputy D'Arcy says no one will believe me and I know he does not want to and that he does not want the farmers to believe me either&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I remained silent while the Deputies were speaking and I heard them represent views to me and views of farmers about me and I am at least entitled to represent the reality. This threshold will remain for three years.  I have never said that the simplified accounts system will only be for the first year in respect of those who are now coming into the tax net.  I have never said that and I do not know why anyone should represent it as being my opinion or my statement or my position. If it helps to dissipate any doubt I am now saying that it is not confined to this year because the situation in respect of this category will exist next year as it will this year.  I would hope that as a consequence of it the presentation of accounts for this group of farmers will be both reasonable and appropriate.</P>
      <P>Having said all of that, I want to make it clear that we are not asking farmers to waste their money on accountants and even if they decided to do so the money they spend in that context would be deductible from their profits for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be no use if they do not have a profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were paying tax it would be deductible.  I do not want to see them wasting their money because farming is vitally important to our economy.  I do not want to see farmers in this category in particular wasting their money in engaging accountants and certainly, as Deputy Bruton has said&mdash;and I made a statement on this topic recently although I did not get much publicity&mdash;I do not want to see accountants wasting their talents in an area that is not appropriate. I would prefer to see them advising people much more effectively on maintaining their accounts to keep the running of their business on a proper basis so that they would know exactly where they stand from year to year rather than advising people on how they can reduce their tax liability.  I would like to see accountants working so that farmers would have the benefit of their advice for that purpose and not just for the <Col N="1703" /> purpose of submitting accounts which will reduce the liability for tax to the lowest possible figure.</P>
      <P>In a relatively brief reply I should now have covered all of the points that have been made.  There was some suggestion that if farmers do not have a taxable income the fact of their being liable to tax does not mean they pay tax.  If they do not have a taxable income they do not pay tax but, having announced all of these concessions or recognitions of reality, let me say that one is not expecting to get any major revenue from that sector this year.  But there is no principle that suggests that, while one is not expecting to get that, one should not make them accountable, in fairness to them and other sectors of the community. That is what I understand the farmers want and what other sectors of the community want.  They want not only that things would be done fairly but that they be seen to be done fairly.  Some may say that reducing the threshold to £40 is evidence that I have turned my back on my own background as a first rural Minister for Finance and that this establishes beyond doubt that I do not care.  If people want to say that they can, but it is not the truth.</P>

      <P>If they are not going to pay tax I do not know what all the bleating is about.  We are not talking about rates on this Bill.  Some other time some other Minister will deal with that one.  I am talking about this Bill and the issues raised with me now.  I can refer to the rates in so far as they are appropriate to this Bill and say that they are allowable against tax.  That is the only relevance that they have here.  I am asked how they are going to get any relief if they are not paying tax.  If they are not paying tax then they have nothing to complain about in respect of what is being done here.  In respect of those with valuations between £40 and £50, they will have marginal relief, which has always been applied in respect of those who come into the tax category for the first time whether at £50, £60 or £70. In other words, a person coming in at £40 would pay one-tenth only of such tax as he would be liable to pay; at £41 he would pay two-tenths and at £43 he would pay three-tenths and so on.  That certainly would be a substantial easement in respect of such of this group as would be liable to pay tax finally.</P>
      <P>For all of those reasons I would hope that this discussion has clarified some doubts that seemed to exist before I started. I would also use this occasion to reassure the farmers in question and the organisations who are aware of this of the attitude that the Government are taking in respect of this issue and the question of accounts involved in it.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say definitely that the system of simplified accounts will continue indefinitely, that there is no intention of a cut-off point? Secondly, what sort of criteria would be <Col N="1705" /> used in deciding on cases of more than £50, and furthermore, can the Minister indicate what is the difference in the type of information that will be required of farmers who are not on a simplified accounts basis <i>vis-à-vis</i> farmers who are operating on that basis?  What additional information will be required?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the last question, perhaps it would be best for me to answer by indicating roughly what will be involved.  I can only indicate roughly at this stage what will be the position because although I have a copy of the form before me I do not wish to publish it prematurely since it has not been formulated and confirmed.  Accounts of the kind I am talking about will involve receipts such as those in respect of the sales of livestock, of crops, of milk or of other farm products.  This information will be set out simply in one column while expenses will be set out simply in another column.  We set out in some detail, though not in any complex form, the range of expenses that farmers will be entitled to include.  There is space for total expenses and for total receipts and when the amount of the total expenses is deducted there will remain the profit or loss situation, subject to adjustment for stock and personal expenditure. What is involved is a simple form of accounting.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can judge from this information how the new system will differ from the existing one but I cannot go beyond what I have said already at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the second query, I am conscious of the question of meeting a case consistently.  Before this discussion started, Deputies opposite were under the impression that the provision would apply only to farmers in the £40 to £50 valuation bracket.  That would be nice and tidy but as I have said, the provision is not limited to that category.  It will be applied also where appropriate to small enterprise farmers.  That invites the question from Deputy Bruton as to the kind of people who will be involved but I cannot <Col N="1706" /> answer that question other than to say that the provision will not be applied to people engaged in intensive activity of one form or another.  The criteria will be as simple as possible.  I have instructed the Revenue Commissioners to advise the inspectors of taxes in the appropriate areas to use their discretion in this area, with a view to having these simple form accounts adopted, even in respect of vluations of more than £50.</P>
    <P>Each case will have to be judged on its merits.  There is no guide that I can give at this stage when we are moving into this kind of territory.  It would be easier for me if I had a guide and to say that the level will be £50 but I do not propose in ease of my own situation to do that. Therefore, I trust that the Deputy will understand the reason for my not being able to answer the question.  However, in view of the discussions we have had and of the understanding that has been conveyed on my behalf to the farming organisations, I want to see the provision used in appropriate cases, in cases where it was indicated from the discussions that it would be applied.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there are some anomalies in the valuation system though I would not go along with the idea that a revision of that system would be in ease of the farmers, which is what Deputies opposite seem to suggest.  Such a revision would act in the opposite direction by and large but Deputy Bruton would not seem to hold that view.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael have their own position on this but I do not think that many farmers would agree with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's other question concerned the length of time that this provision will last.  As I have indicated already we have given a commitment not to lower the threshold for three years and, consequently, there is no reason for the provision in question not lasting also for at least three years.  Let us recognise <Col N="1707" /> honestly that the purpose of all of this is not to provide avenues of escape for people who should pay tax not to pay tax.  It is not meant to be a way out of paying tax.  If it were, I would be failing in my duty to taxpayers generally.  In the course of the next three years we shall have an opportunity of judging the system in operation but it is my intention to launch it on a fair and equitable basis and what I have just indicated should be a move in that direction.</P>

      <P>Regarding the application of this option in certain circumstances to farmers with valuations of more than £50, the people who will use this option will be those who will know that they will not be in the tax bracket. As the Minister has said, valuations are sometimes unfair.  Nine times out of ten it pays anyone in the tax bracket to hire an accountant.  The people that we are interested in are people with valuations over £40, and even over £50, who will not be in the tax bracket.  There should be a simple form of accounts.  Each case will have to be judged on its merits.  People with farms with valuations over £50 and with very large families, who are poor, should not have to pay any tax. This will be an effective system and I am delighted that we are not going to be tied down to £50 valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 26, between lines 36 and 37 to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that where an individual is to be charged to tax for a year of assessment in respect of profits or gains from farming and duly elects to be charged to tax in accordance with <Col N="1708" /> paragraph (b) of the said section 20 A, <i>section</i> 21 of this Act shall not apply for the year 1980-81.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 21 does away with the notional system of taxation for farmers from the year 1980-81.  I presume that at the moment the notional system is gone and that farmers this year who are liable to tax will pay on an accounts basis.</P>
    <P>The problem which I am trying here to correct is that many of those farmers who are now liable to pay tax in the year 1980-81 will be paying tax on the preceding account year and they may not have kept accounts.  My amendment tries to rectify that position and to ensure that those who are going off the notional system will be given due notice of having to keep accounts.  Otherwise things will be made extremely difficult for the Minister, the Revenue Commissioners and, indeed, the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion put forward by Deputy P. Barry.  There is no doubt about it that the Finance Act of 1978 misled people when it stated quite clearly that they would have to give a guarantee that they would stay on the notional system for a minimum of three years.  The present Minister did not give that guarantee, it was his predecessor who did, but the present Minister has corrective responsibility.  I have no doubt that a huge number of farmers believed that the notional system would be retained until the end of 1980.  They should be given due notice of at least a year, which would suffice.  The Minister is asking people to drop the notional system and start accounts for 1980-81.  I appeal to the Minister to allow these people the minimum notice of one year. Otherwise, he will be creating great problems from his Department in compiling these accounts which are just not available for the year 1979.</P>

      <P>It is worth noting that Fianna Fáil gave a guarantee in their 1977 election Manifesto that the notional taxation system would be retained.  That swayed a lot of farmers in their favour.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year my predecessor indicated in his budget statement that the notional system would cease to operate from this year.  What is being done here now is to give effect to that statement.  I should mention here that it is recognised now that the notional system is notional and what we are talking about is real liability, as distinct from notional liability to tax.  The notional system which operated on a system of a multiplier of £40 and then £50 and subsequently on last year's increased figure was notional in the real sense of the word.  However, we are not talking about notional liability, we are talking about real liability or real freedom from liability as the case may be, as between the farmers themselves and subsequently as between the farmers and other sectors of the community.</P>
      <P>When the whole question of farmers' taxation was introduced for the very first time some years back, not very long ago, as a means of introducing farmers to this whole area of taxation and to take account of the special situation that they had not been accustomed to keeping accounts and matters of that sort, the notional system was introduced.  That is no longer the case.  The notional system has been operating for some time but farmers have become accustomed to the effect of this system.  Those who are liable to tax have become accustomed to keeping accounts, which is as it should be, not only in their own interest but in the interest of equity between them and other sectors of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could not accept this amendment. I am very reluctant to give examples of the manner in which the notional system has operated&mdash;or, rather, one might say has not operated.  I was horrified, and I use the word &ldquo;horrified&rdquo; deliberately, to find that in many cases farmers with valuations up to £500 paid no tax.  I have <Col N="1710" /> samples before me of 50 cases from all the provinces of farmers with valuations up to £200, £300, £400, £500 who under the notional system paid no tax.  There was a certain amount of bruhaha in respect of a certain television programme a while back which I did not see.  I have seen the facts in respect of other areas where the notional system has operated, and frankly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Those who would bleed for the termination of the notional system should share a little drop of blood for others who have been paying tax, including clerk typists, at a level away above anything involved here.  Let us not weep for the passage of something which was not appropriate.  It was just an appropriate means of introducing people to the system of taxation. No-one else is weeping for it now.  It was, apparently, understandably used to effect by those who opted for it.  It is fair to say that most of those in the lower bracket of the tax net have ceased to operate the notional system, in any event.  Most have opted out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not hurt me. But, having said that&mdash;we are moving away from that period now and I think everyone would agree that it is appropriate that we should&mdash;I find it difficult to accept that people who were on the notional system would not have kept accounts. I say this for a variety of reasons.  There would have been charges they could claim against their liabilities. They would have kept records for their own good purposes, quite understandably, to reduce their tax liability.  For instance, they would have kept accounts in respect of wages, what they may have paid to contractors, records in respect of a whole range of things.  They would have done this, as indeed is evidenced in this case.  They would have kept records of such overhead expenses as would have been deductible for tax.  Such records would help them.  If they maintain they have not kept accounts, then that is not quite consistent with the fact that they could make claims against their liability under the notional system, claims which could be lodged only if they had evidence to prove the wages they had been paying, what they had been paying contractors and so on.  Therefore, that should be a help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the vast majority of such farmers would be able to produce accounts for last year.  After all, farmers this time last year were on notice that the notional system was being abolished&mdash;it was said very clearly&mdash;and I am simply implementing what was said then. Therefore one might at least expect that they should have kept accounts on that basis.  But, assuming that they did not, it should be possible to get some guide. Again, I would suggest that in respect of the current year's accounts, the accounts for last year be used as a guide by the inspector of taxes&mdash;no more than that. Ideally the accounts should be there. Despite the fact that notice was given last year, if they are not there then obviously <Col N="1712" /> we would have to use this as a guide in determining the assessments for this year.  It will not be a strict rule, but certainly it will be a guide to the inspector of taxes who, having regard to that guide, will be in a position to determine the appropriate assessment.  For the reasons I have mentioned I cannot agree to Deputy Barry's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says farmers were put on notice from last year that the notional system would be abolished this year.  That may be so.  I do not remember the Minister's predecessor saying so but I am sure he did if the Minister says so.</P>

      <P>The Minister has quoted examples here of people with valuations of £400, £500 and £600.  I am not talking about that category of farmer at all.  Probably they would employ teams of accountants. They are probably some of the wealthiest people in the country, and in this respect, Deputy O'Leary's point was very pertinent: were they payers of wealth tax, which was abolished also, so that perhaps they have been contributing nothing to the coffers in the last few years?  The people about whom I am talking are those who come into the tax net today, the person with a valuation of £40 or £50, the people who had no notion this time last year that they would be caught in the tax net this year.  Such people will have no accounts.  They were not paying a notional tax last year.  How can they be properly assessed?  How can they possibly produce anything that would be satisfactory to the inspector of taxes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My original understanding of the Deputy's amendment was that it related to those people but then I thought, as he introduced it here, it had a broader basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I dealt with it on the broader basis.  I did understand it originally in the sense in which the Deputy has now referred to it.  I can assure the Deputy that the farmers he is talking about will have, in addition to what I have already said in this respect, the option of presenting either this year's accounts or last year's.  That option is open to them.  That is the appropriate way in which to deal with them.  In regard to those farmers who come into the tax net for the first time&mdash;and incidentally notice was given last year about that also&mdash;if they decided in anticipation of that fact that they were going to keep accounts, fair enough.  But, if they did not, they have the option this year of presenting either this year's accounts or last year's accounts in respect of their liability.  I do not think I could go further than that.  That was my original understanding of Deputy Barry's proposal, but when he introduced it he seemed to extend it to the whole notional question anyway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the assessment <Col N="1714" /> will be made.  Then it will be up to the farmer himself to indicate what he feels is his liability to tax and to ensure that he can produce accounts to justify that.  If it turns out that he is within a certain range of what transpires to be his tax liability&mdash;I think it is 80 per cent&mdash;then he pays no interest.  If he is not, he pays interest on the amount over and above the figure he has submitted.  But, of course he himself has the obligation to submit the proper accounts on which his tax liability will be determined.  If it happens at the end of the year that he is within 80 per cent of the actual final liability, then he pays no interest, which is one of the reasons this was introduced: to encourage farmers to state their position and to present their accounts as accurately as they can.</P>

They were pro-farmer and the National Coalition were anti-farmer.  We were crushing them with taxation.  Indeed, even the Taoiseach at that time referred to the fact that we were taxing 9,000 farmers, that we were trying to get our toe in the door, and that the taxation of those people would continue.

However, in case people might think that the notional system is a diabolical way through which people can avoid paying tax, it was originally recommended in 1960 by the Commission on Income Taxation as part of any system of farmer <Col N="1717" /> taxation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 28 of the 1974 Finance Act was designed to meet the situation of a farmer whose profits were exempt from tax because his valuation was below the threshold but who had other income.  It was regarded then as inequitable to other taxpayers if in such a case the full personal allowances could be set against non-farming income, whether that income was his or that of his wife.  That section provided broadly that only half of his personal allowance could be set against his non-farming income. In that way the tax appropriate to <Col N="1718" /> the non-farming income would be collected.</P>
      <P>Now section 28 has to be amended to apply to cases where the other income is that of wives, in view of the Supreme Court decision prohibiting aggregation of husband and wife incomes.  Accordingly, it is now being provided that where the other income is that of the wife she will be assessed on that income as a single person.  This is a consequence of the Supreme Court decision.  She will now receive a single person's allowance. This is the appropriate way, as we see it at this time, to deal with the application of section 28 of the 1974 Act.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, where there are children the wife will be able to claim the allowances in respect of them if not claimed by a husband who is exempt on his farming profits.  Deputies will be aware that the position hitherto is that the restriction operated would also apply to children's allowances.  We are now treating the wife as a single person and at the same time providing for her the appropriate allowances, such as children's allowances, which would be applicable for tax liability.</P>

      <P>In page 27, before section 23, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>23.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;farming&rsquo; has the same meaning as in <Col N="1719" /> Chapter II of Part I of the Finance Act, 1974;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;specified machinery or plant&rsquo; means machinery or plant in use or intended for use for the purposes of a trade of farming but not including fixed machinery and fixed plant designed to be used exclusively in a farm building and which is in use or is intended to be used in such a building;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;specified provisions&rsquo; means section 251 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, section 11 of the Finance Act, 1967 and section 26 of the Finance Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(2)  In determining what capital allowances fall to be made to a person for any chargeable period commencing on or after the 6th day of April, 1980, in taxing a trade of farming&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in a case where the aggregate of the capital allowances which would fall to be so made to the person for the chargeable period if the specified provisions did not apply or have effect for that chargeable period in relation to specified machinery or plant, or the expenditure on the provision thereof, amounts to or exceeds 30 per cent of the amount of the profits or gains from farming on which the person is chargeable to tax for that chargeable period, the said specified provisions shall not apply or have effect in the case of that person for that chargeable period in relation to specified machinery or plant, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case the amount or the aggregate amount of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any capital allowance or allowances given under any of the specified provisions, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  any amount or amounts by which any capital allowance or allowances may be increased under any of the specified provisions, shall be limited to the maximum amount which will secure that the aggregate of the capital allowances falling to be made to the person for the chargeable <Col N="1720" /> period in taxing the trade of farming shall not exceed 30 per cent of the profits or gains from farming on which the person is chargeable to tax for the chargeable period.&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment provides for the re-writing of section 23 so as to give effect to the decision to exclude from the restriction on capital allowance any fixed plant or machinery used in a farm building.  This is a consequence of discussions which I and my officials had with farmer representatives since my budget statement.  This is to exclude from the restriction on capital allowances any fixed plant and machinery which is used in a farm building.</P>
      <P>There was a drafting flaw in the original section which was brought to our attention by the draftsman.  That is being corrected by bringing in a reference here to section 251 of the 1967 Act which provides for an initial allowance of 100 per cent on machinery and plant.  A reference to this provision is required in addition to the provisions relating to depreciation.</P>
      <P>As a result of this rewritten section capital expenditure by a farmer on fixed plant and machinery which is installed for use in a farm building will be removed from the scope of the proposed restriction on free depreciation.  This means that the restriction on the accelerated allowance relating to expenditure incurred by a farmer will be confined to expenditure on machinery and plant other than plant and machinery installed for use in the farm building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember that any restriction of accelerated allowances in respect of plant and machinery will apply after the full allowances have been given in respect of, for instance, the ordinary wear and tear allowance on all plant and machinery.  The restriction does not begin to apply until the full allowances have been given&mdash;increased <Col N="1721" /> allowances in respect of farm buildings, free depreciation on expenditure on land reclamation, drains, fences, holding yards and roadways&mdash;and if accelerated allowances are claimed in respect of ordinary plant and machinery, the amount of such extra allowance will be restricted to such an amount as will not bring the total capital allowance to more than 30 per cent of the chargeable profits.  This means any such restriction applies only to the extra allowances claimed on that plant and machinery.  In relation to all other allowances there will be no restriction even where they exceed 30 per cent. This amendment, which provides for the rewriting of section 23, is a consequence of discussions we had with the farm organisations with a view to limiting restrictions of the allowances already announced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how any responsible farm organisation could accept this because the thrust of Government policy for the past ten years, and the farming organisations as well, has been to treat farming as a business.  Why it should be treated separately in this instance I cannot understand. For that reason I intend to oppose the section.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a refinement on this section, outside the drafting amendment. He allowed a full depreciation on machinery installed in a farm building.  I presume that means a tractor will attract depreciation at 30 per cent while a milking machine will attract depreciation at 100 per cent.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand <Col N="1722" /> how the Minister differentiates.  The usefulness of this section, and similar sections in other legislation, is that it encourages investment and productivity. We are told that one of the sins of agriculture is a low level of productivity. We need to encourage higher productivity in farming yet the Minister says machinery installed inside a building is more of an aid to productivity than machinery used outside.  Evidently if it moves it must be taxed.  If it is installed and stationary it is put on the same level as industry.</P>
      <P>The consequences of this for an individual farmer may not be very great but it will have some effect.  The roll-on consequences to manufacturers and sellers of farm machinery will be considerable. I am not particularly close to the farming industry but everybody interested in agriculture knows there is a firm in Dublin which is on the point of going into receivership.  They have £4 million worth of farm machinery in their yards which they are unable to sell. When this section is passed their prospects of selling that equipment and saving jobs will be negligible.</P>
      <P>My main objection to this section is that it makes it harder to achieve what we have been trying to do for the past ten years, that is, to have farming treated as a business.  Even though this amendment improves the position, the Minister does not go far enough.  If we are serious about farming, it must be treated as a business.  It must be assessed as a business and be given and the same grants and inducements to productivity and investment that are given to ordinary businesses.</P>
      <P>It will be very difficult to get full value for the country as a whole, through taxation, productivity, exports or employment, while the farming sector feel they are being treated separately and are not getting all the advantages other businesses get.  They are being continually lectured by the Minister for Finance for not contributing their fair share.  They are willing to do that.  The more farmers who use the accounts system the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section puts farmers in a different <Col N="1723" /> position to ordinary businesses. The Minister's amendment makes it appear that he assesses differently the contribution made to productivity and farming by fixed machinery and movable machinery.  I am not very familiar with the various types of machinery bought by farmers to improve productivity or to assist them in running their farms.  Except by tossing a coin, I cannot decide which is more beneficial to a farmer, a milking machine or a tractor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity this amendment issued so late.  I understand it is based on discussions the Minister had with farming organisations.  If it is based on agreement, it would have been more appropriate if the people involved had had a chance to see the amendment in black and white before the debate took place.  This would have happened if the amendments had been circulated last week.  By circulating them today, nobody had an opportunity to see them, except Deputies who did not have very much chance of studying them.</P>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Barry said. Farming should be treated like any other business.  Investment in farm machinery is as desirable as machinery for any other enterprise.  It does not seem appropriate that we should have a system where allowances for machinery are restricted in the case of farmers but not in respect of other business people.  The Minister has a very heavy duty to discharge to prove that it is just to impose restrictions of this nature in the case of farmers but not equally just to impose them in respect of other businessmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He may claim there is evidence farmers bought more machinery than previously, but that will not stand up. Britain introduced income tax for farmers some time after the war.  Their experience was that in the initial period there was an amount of mechanisation. Farmers availed of the allowances and invested in machinery but very quickly they reached saturation point.  From then on, it became a normal business situation.  They did not invest any more in machinery than other business would have done.  Since our farmers came into <Col N="1724" /> the tax net there was an initial surge of purchasing machinery, to which the Minister is now responding by restricting these allowances, but that would not have continued.  By bringing in this restriction, which applies solely to farmers, the Minister will distort and damage the situation.  If he had left things as they were the initial over-mechanisation would have worked itself out very quickly.  Farmers should be treated the same as other businesses. They should not have their allowances restricted while other people are getting allowances.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to explain the distinction between fixed machinery and free moving machinery.  Why should one have access to free depreciation and the other should not?  This distinction requires explanation, as does the distinction which this section enshrines, namely restricting allowances for farm machinery and not in respect of other business machinery.  The burden is on the Minister's shoulders to prove that these two distinctions are justifiable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that farming should be treated as a business.  Farmers were buying machinery as a tax avoidance measure.  Free depreciation of machinery was introduced to encourage industry.  The installation of new machinery in an industry would provide extra jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>This was intended to encourage expansion in industry and create extra jobs.  When farming was considered a business, farmers were given these concessions.  In industry it is expected that a machine will last ten or 15 years but farm machinery has a very short life expectancy.  I am sure Deputies know of people who bought machines they did not need.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy knows that just as well as I do.</P>
      <P>The point the Minister made about the 30 per cent has not been sufficiently emphasised.  A farmer may write down his machinery on the normal rate of 25 per cent for a tractor and so on and it can amount to 50 per cent or even 100 per cent of his income, but it applies only when a person wants to write down something in depreciation over the normal limit granted by the inspector of taxes.  Too many farmers think that depreciation on all machinery is based on 30 per cent of their income and this should be categorically denied.  It applies only on free depreciation of mobile machinery and the extra provisions made by the Minister are welcome.  We are getting back to the original provisions for industry regarding fixed machines.  All fixed machines will now be included, such as milking machines and corn rollers which will last a long time.  It will encourage people to be more efficient in their use of this machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles which depreciate quickly are affected by this section and these are the items which have been used for tax avoidance.  One of the farming magazines published an article during the past few weeks about farm machinery.  In 1978 people were looking for a particular type of cab but this year any type of cab with a roll bar is sufficient and people are not looking for the most expensive kind.  At one time farmers were buying a very expensive foreign tractor of 90 horse power when they could buy a cheaper one with the same horse power which was practically as good.  They could buy two of the cheaper tractors and have £1,000 in <Col N="1726" /> their pockets for the price of one of the dearer tractors.</P>
    <P>There are many such tractors in the country.  Most of them were imported. Our balance of payments position is bad enough without farmers buying such expensive machinery.  The Minister was justified in imposing this rate of 30 per cent.  He had many discussions with farming organisations and he was prepared to accept logical arguments with regard to milking machines, coolers and so on. The Dublin District Milk Board now want fixed coolers, and these cost a considerable amount of money.  This amendment will be of considerable help, and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major defects of the present administration is the fact that we must have special conditions for agriculture.  I do not know why we cannot treat it like any other business.  There are special conditions for machinery and stock quite different from those applying to other businesses, and this is creating uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the agricultural industry.  Deputy Crinion and the Government seem to be setting themselves up as the judge of who should buy machinery.  The farmer is the best person to make this decision because he knows the state of his finances.  Making a case that he will avoid tax by buying extra machinery is codology.  I should imagine that 98 per cent of the farmers have not reached that stage of development yet.  I am prepared to accept that a wealthy farmer may buy a tractor to offset against a tax bill of £4,000 or £5,000 but this is an isolated case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Government are imposing measures special to agriculture is creating uncertainty in the industry.  No other section has to accept such conditions. The saving obtained will be small. The Minister has done enormous damage to the distributing trade so far as agricultural machinery is concerned. Many old firms have gone into bankruptcy.  All the distributors in Dublin have let go half of their employees. I accept that the economic conditions obtaining have contributed to <Col N="1727" /> some extent, but the Government have been largely responsible.  Farmers are the best judges about buying machinery.  If the Government set themselves up as the judge on all these issues people will not be encouraged to show initiative, and this will damage the industry.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies with regard to the stock allowance.  Special conditions are imposed for agriculture.  What Deputy Crinion said would apply to only 1 per cent of farmers.  Talking about a farmer buying a tractor and not giving it a second servicing does not make sense. Certainly we have not reached that stage in Wexford.  A combine harvester will cost about £20,000 and if this kind of money is around the Minister should get out his bag and start collecting.  I think this kind of money exists only in Meath, certainly not in Wexford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate seems to centre around farm machinery sales and purchases.  Deputy Barry said that dealers of farm machinery had equipment worth millions of pounds unsold on their premises because of the depressed state of the market.  That is something we should welcome, because during the years our adverse balance of payments situation was created entirely by purchases of farm machinery, although I accept that other factors may have been involved also.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that machinery dealers have a lot of machinery on their hands because of the depressed state of the market.  However, we must bear in mind that there was over-mechanisation in the past few years.  Farmers spent much more than they should on machinery.  Many farmers purchased a second tractor but they did not do any costings or calculate the number of hours it would be used during the year.  It was important to put some brake on purchases of farm machinery in order to assist our balance of payments problem and the provisions in this Bill will go some of the way towards correcting that imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crinion was right when he pointed out that many farmers purchase <Col N="1728" /> expensive combine harvesters that are used for one month out of 12 and which lie idle for the remainder of the year.  The depreciation costs in such a case are very high, and this should be remembered also.  The farming community would be well advised to do their sums in future before they invest in farm machinery.</P>
    <P>A farmer will not invest in non-mobile equipment unless he really needs it. Milking machines, coolers and such items of equipment are in use throughout the year.  Mobile farm equipment has a short life, and farmers tend to allow it to depreciate at a fast rate.  That is something that must be considered. Many farmers&mdash;but not all&mdash;have availed of grants for the purchase of tractors under the farm modernisation scheme.  To an extent it encouraged farmers to over-mechanise, and that should be discouraged.  What the Minister is proposing now will tend to correct the situation.  An industrialist will buy a machine only if he is going to use it for 50 weeks out of the year.  He buys a machine to make use of it, but unfortunately the same cannot be said with regard to many items of agricultural equipment.  A mower can be used for two out of 52 weeks and it lies idle most of the time.  Any effort that can be made to induce farmers to employ a pool of farm machinery should be encouraged. This provision in the Bill might encourage that type of approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are talking about here is that any restriction of accelerated allowances in respect of plant and machinery will only apply after the full allowances have been given.  Deputy Crinion was right to point out that the ordinary wear and tear allowance in respect of plant and machinery, free depreciation on fixed plant and machinery, increased allowances in respect of expenditure on farm buildings and also the free depreciation in respect of expenditure on land all apply, and that what we are talking about is restrictions, after these have been used, in respect of farm plant and machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a reasonable and objective <Col N="1729" /> approach generally to this discussion except by Deputy D'Arcy who every time he gets up seeks to convey the notion that we are deliberately strangling agriculture.  Deputy D'Arcy has misrepresented the reality.  The statement that we referred to earlier is the statement of 24 April 1979 which is a Government statement in relation to the notional abolition and the reduction to £40 valuation.  Included there was the restriction on capital allowances.  In reply to the implication that I as Minister for Finance am strangling agriculture, what was proposed over a year ago was a 30 per cent restriction in respect of all capital allowances, farm buildings, farm development and farm plant and machinery.  In my budget statement I indicated that I was not proceeding with the 30 per cent restriction in respect of farm buildings and farm development generally.  That was not evidence of a determination to strangle agriculture. The 30 per cent has remained in respect of farm plant and machinery, and this is only in addition to ordinary allowances. Deputy Barry asked why there is a distinction between farm plant installed in a house and farm plant outside the house. That distinction was made in response to a request from the farm organisations, who are well qualified to make their case.  They made the distinction about farm machinery in a house and farm machinery outside.  I was prepared to move away from the limitation in all the other areas, farm buildings, farm development and every other area with the exception of this.  In the farming interests I felt I should hold to this, and they made the case for the fixed plant.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy would succeed in getting a better response to his case if he took a more objective approach to reality rather than implying that all right is on one side and all wrong on the other. About 80 per cent of agricultural machinery is imported.  This was causing problems in relation to the balance of payments.  Also the purchase of agricultural machinery was being widely used to reduce the incidence of tax liability.</P>

      <P>This also had another effect in that it was eating into the limited amount of credit available for agricultural development at a time when the ACC and everyone else had a limited pool of money.  It was contrary to the agriculture interests and certainly contrary to the national interests that so much of that limited pool was being swallowed up in the purchase of plant and machinery.  Farmers who followed that course would have been better advised to pay their tax rather than use the purchase of what would be under utilised plant and machinery just to avoid tax.  It was suggested that we are treating agriculture differently.  It is easy to make a general statement not backed up by facts.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's neighbour introduced the comparison. We allow special recognition to agriculture.  We have a special credit for rates against income tax which is allowed to farmers and not to industry. The allowance for farm buildings does not apply to commercial buildings other than to industrial buildings.  Is that treating agriculture unfairly by comparison <Col N="1731" /> to industry?  If it is it is going the other way to what has been implied.  The new easements for stock relief covered in amendments that I will introduce will not apply to any other business.  That is certainly treating agriculture differently, but not in the sense that Deputy D'Arcy has implied.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I can summarise the objectives of this Bill, as stated by Deputy Quinn, as a Bill to solve the problem of exorbitant housing prices by controlling the price of building land.  It must be admitted that soaring house prices constitute a serious problem particularly for young married couples.  The price of houses is going out of the reach of more and more young married couples.</P>
      <P>The problem of soaring house prices must be solved.  The Government have made no effort to deal with it despite the fact that house prices have almost doubled between 1976 and today.  In 1976 the average price of a house was £12,000 and today the price of such a house on a national basis is over £23,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government to provide housing for every family who cannot reasonably out of their own resources house themselves.  The price of houses in the private sector is rocketing. This means that houses are passing out <Col N="1732" /> of the reach of more and more people, and the Government as a matter of policy are building fewer local authority houses.  That exacerbates the problem which must be tackled.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to make a contribution towards the problem of exorbitant house prices by controlling the price of building land.  I agree that land conveniently situated should be made available for house building and community purposes on reasonable terms. That is a proposition which no reasonable person could disagree with. By reasonable terms I mean terms that are reasonable to landowners, house purchasers and the community at large, because I believe that the community at large have an input to make to the problem of housing the nation.  I believe the terms on which land is made available to house builders should be reasonable.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that there are landowners and land speculators. Land speculators are gentlemen who want to make a quick buck or to become millionaires or very near that by buying land they hope will be needed for building purposes and then they will resell it.  I hold no brief for land speculators; I have no time for them. The practice of speculating in a commodity so scarce and so necessary for building houses should be stamped out and made unprofitable.  That is my approach and my party's approach to the question of land speculators.  People who have availed of knowledge they should not have and purchased land with a view to reselling it as a scarce commodity deserve the harshest treatment from the community and the State.</P>
    <P>Landowners in the ordinary accepted sense are an entirely different category. By landowners I mean people who have either inherited land in small, medium or large quantities from their forebears or people who have earned money by working very hard at home or abroad and purchased land for the purpose of using it for farming or using it legitimately for one purpose or another.  Land which will be made available for housebuilding and <Col N="1733" /> other community purposes should be made available on terms which are fair and equitable to the landowners, the house builders and to the community, who should make a contribution if necessary.</P>
    <P>I have studied this Bill carefully, read it a number of times and discussed it with other people.  I sincerely feel that it requires genuine landowners of all categories, big and small, throughout the country to become public benefactors. Fine Gael will not, therefore, support this Bill.  It might be said that the Bill could be amended on Committee Stage. Deputy Quinn spoke about developing points on Committee Stage, but we know that the realistic approach to this Bill is that there will not be a Committee Stage because the Government have stated that they will oppose it.  My party cannot lend their support to this Bill because it would in my considered opinion require landowners from Cork to Donegal and in all the urban authorities and county council areas throughout the country to become public benefactors. That is not a reasonable approach to a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, this Bill applies to every corporation, every county council and every urban authority in the country which is a housing authority.  I propose to list a few of the most serious objections that will strike anyone on reading the Bill.  As I see it, sections 4 and 5 of this Bill freeze all land in the country or can be used to freeze all land in the country for many years or, on one interpretation, freeze it indefinitely.  It can freeze land for up to 10 years by making a designating order and then towards the end of that order, amending it.  I am not going to argue whether you can have a third or fourth attempt at amending it; it does not matter.  The effect of that is to provide that once the order is made the owner of the land cannot sell it to any person or body other than the local authority and the local authority need not purchase it for up to 10 years.  That is unreasonable and unacceptable.  That is the first big objection that I see in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> The next and fundamental objection that any reasonable person must have to the Bill is the compensation provision of the Bill, the provisions in the Bill for compensating owners of land for land acquired from those owners against their will.  I am not going to base my objections and those of my party to this Bill on constitutional grounds.  I could make a constitutional speech here and say that the Bill is unconstitutional.  That may be and I think it is but, apart altogether from any constitutional objections that there are to the Bill, I want to object to it in fair play, equity, distributive justice or call it what you like.  The provisions in the Bill in regard to compensation are unfair and unjust to genuine land owners. Compensation, according to the relevant sections of the Bill shall be fixed on the basis of existing use and on the assumption that the lands could never be used for any purpose other than those for which they were being used on the date of referral to the tribunal for the assessment of compensation.  That is quite unfair.  I do not believe that land should be made available for house building for what I call, being old enough to remember it, black market prices.  I am against that.  It should be made available at reasonable prices and the owner of the land should share in the benefit that is going and in the value of the land.  I say as one knowing something about agriculture, in so far as I was reared on a farm and so on, that if we pay on agricultural use value, what is the position of a farmer who has a reasonable sized farm the value of which has been depressed or reduced by the very advance of the urban or city sprawl towards it?  Its value as agricultural land is being reduced by the very fact that it is in a place that is suitable for building or industrial use because everybody knows that an ideal place for practising agriculture is not a situation in the immediate vicinity of a huge built-up area or any built-up area.  Yet if we accept the Bill we are going to compensate the owner on the basis of that sort of use.  That is not reasonable.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is no provision in the Bill for compensation for disturbance. <Col N="1735" /> There is very limited provision on page 11 of the Bill, section 23, paragraph VIII, which says:</P>
    <P>If any person shall be residing either as owner or tenant on the land acquired by the local authority at the date when the question of compensation is referred to the Tribunal, the Tribunals may award to such persons such compensation for the expenses caused by the removal to other premises as it shall consider just.</P>
    <P>That is removal expenses, something like the cost of removing.  There is no compensation for disturbance and the loss that that may involve.  The limited compensation provided in that paragraph is merely if the person is residing on the land that is being acquired.  If, as could well be the case with the sort of land that we are dealing with in an urban area or an urban or city vicinity, he is not living on the land, the land can be taken from him at existing use value and he will not get compensation even for flit.  I object to that.</P>
    <P>Another objection that I see in this provision for the payment of compensation is that on referring to page 12 of the Bill in section 25 one will find that the local authority may re-sell the land at a profit.  I know there must be certain circumstances before they will sell.  They can sell the land for industrial purposes at a profit.  That is simply outrageous because, not alone are you taking the land from the land owner at existing use value but then you are giving power to the local authority to sell it at a profit. From such information as I can find there has been no bigger dealer of land in this country over the last number of years than Dublin Corporation.  I have not got the dates but I understand that Dublin Corporation sold land to the Green Property Company at Blanchardstown at £28,000 an acre having paid £2,000 an acre for it.  They sold land to various industries in the county area at £40,000 an acre, having acquired it in part for £1,400 an acre.  The corporation have sold tracks of land acquired <Col N="1736" /> at agricultural value, roughly, to the Industrial Development Authority for substantial windfall profits.  There is nothing in this Bill to indicate that such a policy will not be continued or stopped.</P>
    <P>Those provisions in the Bill regarding compensation are not reasonable.  If the sponsors of the Bill consider the matter they will agree.  I saw reports in a paper recently presenting the Bill to the country as providing compensation on the basis of existing use value plus 25 per cent.  There is not one word about a 25 per cent increase over existing use value in the Bill.  I do not know where the newspaper concerned got that information. The provision is that it is to be compensated for at existing use value and on the basis that the land could never be used for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>I could rhyme off other things which are lacking in the Bill.  No account is to be taken of the fact that the land owner is providing the most essential ingredient for the building of a house, which is land. No account is to be taken of the fact that the owner is an unwilling vendor.  No account is to be taken of the fact that the acquisition is compulsory.  If an unwilling vendor does not re-purchase within 12 months, he will be saddled with a bill for capital gains in certain circumstances. I have dealt with the position in which the local authorities may sell at profit.</P>
    <P>Those are the provisions of the Bill which are so fundamental as to compel me and my party to say we cannot support it notwithstanding the fact that we believe something should be done about speculation in land.  I am glad the Minister for the Environment is here.  If my memory serves me correctly, on a number of occasions since he became Minister, he gave the impression to this House, quite honestly I am sure, that he was about to deal with the Kenny Report and that he was very far advanced in his consideration of that report.  I got the impression&mdash;I am sure someone will correct me if I am wrong but I think the record of the House will bear me out &mdash;that within a matter of months he would bring in legislation to deal with the <Col N="1737" /> matter.  When he contributed to this Bill last night, he gave me the impression that he was as far away as ever if not further from having any solution for the problem.</P>
    <P>My party and I feel very strongly about the question of housing prices.  It was never so serious.  This Government came into power on a manifesto in which they promised to make it cheaper to get a house and easier to keep it but since then the cost of houses has rocketed. The Government of the day should find a solution for a number of factors in regard to housing.  A fundamental one is the site.  You cannot make omellettes without breaking eggs, and you cannot build a houe without having land.  In government, Fine Gael will bring in a policy which will tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I believe the cost of the site amounts to about 15 per cent of the cost of building a house.  At first sight I will be contradicted on that figure.  I know the figure the professionals give is 35 per cent but that includes the land, professional fees of one sort or another, the cost of developing the land and, I understand, the cost of holding the land from the time it was bought until the house is built.  Builders' costs should be looked at.  I wonder how well are the certificates of reasonable value working. We believe it is possible to bring down the price of a house to a reasonable sum. The nation as a whole has an input to this.  The Bill is asking a comparatively few selected people to become public benefactors.  It is not the obligation of individuals to provide houses.  It is a national obligation.  It is a national obligation to organise and have land available in a serviced condition at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities who service land are inclined to sell it at too big a profit.  I hear local authorities talking about providing sites at £9,000.  The price was not broken down for me, but it sounds extraordinary to me.  The action of the Government and the Minister in turning off the financial tap from the local authorities will drive them to do the <Col N="1738" /> type of thing I am complaining about if they are not prohibited from doing so.  It will drive them to speculate in land to get some money for the purposes for which they want it and for which the Minister will not provide it.  Those are the facts.</P>
    <P>As my party see it, the Government have a social obligation to organise matters in such a way that the purchase of a house is within the reach of those people for whom the Government do not propose to build houses.  The Government have a fundamental social obligation to provide houses for people who cannot afford to build houses for themselves out of their own resources.  They should make sites available.</P>
    <P>I doubt that this provision is constitutional. It will be noted that I made just a couple of passing references to the fact that it is unconstitutional because I think that is not a sound way to deal with matters in this House.  We should deal with them on their merits.  Even if this were constitutional, it would be unfair to take land from genuine bona fide land owners who derive their livelihood from the land, and some of whom have no other way of making a living, and most of whom do not want to be uprooted in middle age or later, on the terms stipulated in this Bill.  For that reason I am against it.</P>
    <P>The sites should be made available on terms that are fair, equitable and just to genuine landowners, house purchasers and the community in general and there should be no time for land speculators. Any measures that the Minister wants to introduce to discourage land speculation will get the full support of this party.</P>

It has shown positively, once and for all, why coalitions simply do not work&mdash;the ideological gap is so enormous. We heard yesterday a very capable speech by Deputy Quinn outlining the socialist ideology of the left advocating confiscation, the taking of the land from the farmers and the giving of minimum compensation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the former Minister, Deputy Tully, is going to speak on this debate.  Undoubtedly there is a need to do something about the spiralling cost of houses.  But is it only land that is a factor in the cost of the building of houses?  Certainly in south Dublin, where there is relatively little building land, when small parcels come on the market they are bought up for expensive houses.  A site can fetch up to £30,000. Obviously in the case of south Dublin and other parts of Dublin there is a scarcity of serviced sites and this has accelerated the cost of land in those areas. There is undoubtedly a need to have a look at the Kenny Report, to tease it out. I do not say that we should take the Kenny Report and implement it straight away.  I do not think it could be or <Col N="1740" /> should be implemented straight away.</P>
      <P>Let me speak briefly about houses and house prices.  The land is not the whole story.  Allowing for anything up to £20,000 an acre at today's prices and a density of 12 to 14 houses, the cost to a builder for a site would be about £1,500. There is a surcharge on that to the local authority for services and so on and the cheapest house that can be bought in Dublin today is about £21,000 or £22,000.  Where is the money going?  The cost is basically divided between the cost of land, building materials and building labour.  Architects' fees are going up; quantity surveyors' fees are going up and all the other incidental costs are going up.  I do not want to quibble about any particular section of this Bill, but I do want to say that Deputy Quinn is an able exponent of his theories, as we saw yesterday.  There was much merit in some of the things he said, although the cliches became a little obvious.  But theory and practice are two different things and it is noticeable that his colleagues in the Labour Party from rural Ireland are not rushing in here to make a contribution.  I would be very interested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While I do not want to cast aspersions on anybody's motives I question the wisdom of introducing a Bill of this kind.  It is a Bill that is clearly alien to the Irish people.  It advocates confiscation of lands.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  I would suggest that the Labour Party would be better having a look at the role of the speculator, the role of the town planners and the local authorities in enforcing the Planning Acts where we have seen speculators buying land banks in advance, making vast profits, building inadequate and inferior houses and selling them to the consumer at exhorbitant profits.  Deputy Quinn would be better looking at that aspect of the question of house prices, housing and general planning. The Labour Party might concentrate more realistically on that, because this whole Bill ignores the tide of history. Last night Deputy Quinn quoted from the writings of James Fintan Lalor with reference to the 19th century land struggle and the landowners of that day. He quoted what Lalor had to say and said that it should be applied line by line today.  I do not accept that.  Is it fair to compare the ordinary Irish farmer, market gardener or property owner to the robbers and brigands referred to in Lalor's writings?  Is it fair to compare today's landlords with the absentee landlord class Lalor had in mind?  The comparison is unjust and it does not do justice to Deputy Quinn.  He concluded his remarks by quoting the following from James Fintan Lalor:</P>
      <P>Against them I assert the true and indefensible right of property&mdash;the right of our people to live in this land and possess it, to live in it in security comfort and independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would Deputy Quinn's Bill guarantee this?  It certainly would not.  Instead of <Col N="1742" /> the security they now possess they would have the insecurity of tenure proposed in this Bill.  They could be dispossessed without adequate compensation.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not wish to question Deputy Quinn's motives but I do question his wisdom.  Many builders here make massive profits out of speculation, but this is a factor that was referred to in the Kenny Report in which there was reference to ways and means of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>We all know that land is a very sensitive subject in Ireland.  Obviously, Deputy Quinn is aware of this though he is not sufficiently temperate to consider the implications of what he is now suggesting.  Last evening the Deputy spoke of social justice, of building into bricks and mortar great social inequality and inequity but this Bill illustrates in a striking way the pitfalls for those who may opt for the easy solution to a very vexed problem.  Account must be taken of the constitutional, administrative and financial structures but that has not been done in the preparation of this Bill.  It would seem that Deputy Quinn and some, if not all members of his party, have chosen not only to ignore these difficulties but to propose solutions that run counter to the Kenny Report.</P>
    <P>There is a long history of attempts to find solutions to the problems of the inadequate supply of land.  In Britain, for instance, different proposals have been tried in this regard for 80 years or more. Various pieces of legislation aimed at solving the problem were introduced both under Tory and under Labour Governments there.  In the fifties there was enacted legislation in this regard which was very quickly rescinded.  Other pieces of legislation in this area met with the same fate.  Therefore, the history of efforts to bring equity into the area of land for housing is not good.  It has fallen in Britain and it will fall here unless we tease out the various items referred to in the Kenny Report.</P>

      <P>With respect, I do not think the Deputy's Bill is on and he must have been told this in his own party.  It might be well to refer briefly to what was done by the Coalition Government in regard to the Kenny Report. Almost a year after being returned to office, the Coalition issued a statement on that report, accepting in principle the concept as suggested in the report.  In that statement they indicated also that the problem of the high cost of building land was a difficult and complex one and one which would involve remedies that would be both far-reaching and comprehensive. They indicated that before taking final decisions on many of the more important matters of detail they would take into account the views of interested parties.  Among the matters left over for decision were the amount of compensation that would be payable in designated areas and the question of who would be the designating authority. There was no further decision from the Coalition so far as the Kenny Report was concerned.  Apparently they did not give any consideration to that report.  It is interesting to see the Deputy who at that time was Minister for Local Government sitting now beside the proposer of this, to say the least, unusual Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1976 the then Minister for Local Government decided to defer implementation of the Kenny Report proposals in view of the then prevailing economic and fiscal circumstances.  The general economic recession which set in in 1974 and which continued through 1975 and 1976 precluded a commitment of financial resources to implement the Kenny Report proposals.  It was considered necessary by the then Government to conserve scarce financial resources for priority capital works that would stimulate and maintain employment. There was no further consideration given to the Kenny Report by the Coalition during the period in which they remained in office.  It is interesting to note that in a summing up of the Coalition's activity in a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday last, it was stated that after accepting the Kenny Report and <Col N="1744" /> announcing publicly that its proposals would be implemented with haste the Coalition let it fade into oblivion.  That is the crux of the matter.  It is why coalitions have brought nothing but despair, gloom, disunity and a lack of harmony to our nation.  In this context I am glad to note that for the first time the Leader of Fine Gael has accepted publicly that coalitions cannot work because of the ideological differences involved.  These differences are immense.  The people of Ireland should realise that there could not be any unity with a government of that kind.  It is not possible that a government composed of people whose views are far to the left and of others who hold views that are far to the right would work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all concerned about the question of the rising cost of houses and the prime concern in any legislation that proposes to tackle the problem of the cost of land for building purposes should be to ensure that in so far as possible such land is available at reasonable prices for local authority houses.  It would be desirable also to ensure that in so far as possible the increase <Col N="1745" /> in the value of land resulting from the provision of local authority infrastructure will be to the benefit of the public.  At the same time care should be taken to avoid a position whereby the adoption of what appears to be a solution has the opposite result, in other words a solution that causes a scarcity of building land or results in a shift of the price element to the house purchaser despite the establishment of an expensive bureaucratic machine.</P>
      <P>Last evening, too, Deputy Quinn quoted selectively Article 43 of the Constitution but he failed to emphasise what should be emphasised in that context, that is, that Article 43 guarantees the right to private ownership.  Regardless of whether Deputy Quinn or anybody else would wish the situation to be otherwise, our society accepts the concept of free enterprise as a basic element of the democratic structure.  This being so, it is inevitable that the price of building land will be determined in general by the operation of the principle of supply and demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eradication of speculation in land has proved a very difficult proposition. Solutions which might succeed also bring about the withholding of land from the market.  It should be remembered that our private building industry produces an output in houses far in excess of the public sector.  In 1979 the output in the private sector was estimated to be £363 million, while local authority housing output was estimated at £82 million.  If a solution were introduced which would discourage private investment in housing, or adversely affect the house building industry, any loss on the private side would have to be made good by the public side, with the burden falling on the Exchequer and on the taxpayer.  I understand&mdash;but am open to correction on this&mdash;that one of the reasons why Fine Gael opposed the Bill was that it was utterly and completely unreasonable in the matter of compensation.  If farmers were to be compensated as is proposed in this Bill, <Col N="1746" /> in all probability they would find themselves in greatly reduced circumstances. If they wished to purchase land elsewhere and continue as farmers the uprooting would cause untold compensation problems.  They would not get adequate compensation.  Adequate compensation, as suggested in this Bill, has wide implications to anybody who has a bit of land.  It appears to be simply another effort by the Labour Party to drive a wedge between rural Ireland and urban Ireland.  It may, of course, be that the Labour Party have decided to write off their chances in rural Ireland and concentrate in the next General Election on the urban area and the cities where they have a selected trendy group who are apparently dissatisfied with the democratic free enterprise system and have banded around the Labour Party.  I would urge Deputy Quinn to consider&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our Constitution has served us well over the years.  It has had some difficulties which have been rectified when necessary.  It will protect us and serve its purpose over the years to come.  It will protect us from alien ideologies being imposed upon us.  If this Bill by some chance found acceptance in this House and became law, I do not believe that the President could sign it without reference to the Supreme Court. If it went to the Supreme Court, it would get very short shrift there and would be thrown out in a day or two.  It is a complete waste of time of this House to bring in a Bill of this kind here.  Deputy Quinn is not a simple man.  He is a clever exponent of his theories.

In 1979 Dublin Corporation acquired, by agreement, a total of 225 acres of land.  The price paid for this land was about £10,000 an acre. Would Dublin Corporation or any other local authority be able to acquire land by agreement under the provisions of this Bill?  In theory, yes; in practice, what would happen?  Does any Member of this House in full control of his or her senses think that the Irish people would accept this Bill or that the farmers in rural Ireland would accept this Bill?  This is an attack on the fundamental process of democracy.  It is an alien Bill and one of the worst which has come into this House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall conclude by quoting for the record from the Kenny report, page 27, paragraph 56:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been unable to find any workable system by which the price of all building land could be controlled. Price control can operate successfully only when applied to commodities which can be classified by reference to characteristics such as their composition, size or weight.  But land cannot be classified because each acre has unique features which may affect the <Col N="1749" /> price.  (How much is to be allowed for a view of the mountains?)  Therefore any system of price control of land involves ultimately the fixing by an independent tribunal of a fair price or a market price for each piece of land involved. This would mean that an elaborate structure of tribunals would have to be established and this would be costly, cumbersome and slow.  We therefore reject price control of land as such as a solution.</P>
    <P>That is the Kenny Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right to put on record that what Deputy N. Andrews was quoting a few moments ago was the minority report of the Kenny Report, the minority report to the Minister for Finance.  They held that opinion.  There was a majority report, with which obviously Deputy Andrews does not agree, whose members thought entirely differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully did not do anything about it anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate people who come into this House and start trying to bluff their way through, as did Deputy Andrews. He quoted from the Kenny Report, giving the impression that he was quoting from the majority report when in fact he was quoting from the minority report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to speakers here this evening I got the impression that they are very like, in one way at least, Saint Augustine: Oh, Lord, make me pure, but not just yet.  They all want land prices controlled. They want established a fair price for land.  They want house prices rendered cheaper by having lower prices for sites. But they do not want to do it now; some other time somebody else will do it.  Indeed, listening to the discussion here this evening one would get the impression that the Simon Pures of politics all sat on the Fianna Fáil benches.  It was extremely amusing to hear Deputy N. Andrews reverting to an old cliché I thought <Col N="1750" /> had died a long time ago.  It illustrates how short he was of comment on the Bill when he started back on the old theme, the alien philosophy, reds under the beds.  For goodness sake would he grow up?</P>
    <P>I should like to place on record a few things which have been misrepresented here this evening so that we will know where we stand.  First of all, the Kenny Report was commissioned in 1971 by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I took office in the Department of Local Government on 14 March 1973.  The Kenny Report was not made available to me; it was made available to my predecessor and did not come into my hands until almost the end of the year.  To suggest that it was in my possession from March, 1973&mdash;as indeed was suggested a few days ago in the newspapers&mdash;is something I should like to kill here and now.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we did have the report studied.  The Minister has available to him in the Department quite a substantial amount of work done on the Kenny Report.  But when one talks of the Kenny Report many people seem to think it is the be all and end all of land control or price control of land.  In my opinion the one big weakness of the Kenny Report was that it did not touch at all on urban sites.  This Bill does.  I agree with Deputy Andrews that the scandal of urban site prices is one of the things that must be tackled fairly quickly.  We see now broken down coal yards and piggeries having been rented for a couple of shillings a week being offered as sites at £250,000 overnight.  Yet people here seem to consider that there is no necessity whatsoever to deal with this matter now.  The attitude is: Oh, deal with it sometime&mdash;Saint Augustine again&mdash;but not just yet.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is really serious about controlling land prices there is no point in pointing the finger at the Coalition and saying: you had it for years.  We had it for three years but let it not be forgotten that the Minister has had it on his table now for three years, with a lot of work having been done on it, and he has done absolutely nothing about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;good, bad or indifferent. Well, if he has got something done about it, why did he not make an intelligent comment on Deputy Quinn's opening statement here yesterday evening instead of the waffle we had from him?  There was no reference whatever made to the Bill or what was proposed to be done with regard to the control of land prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather it appeared to have been a matter of filling in half an hour's time and letting it go at that.  That appears to have been the object of the exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the price of land is concerned, Deputy Fitzpatrick was perfectly right.  There are two types of people who own land, farmers who want to work their land and those who have land, who would be just as happy doing something else and, if they can get out having made a quick buck, that is all right.  But the trouble about it is that very often it happens, particularly around our cities, towns and villages, that there is a situation in which a local authority spend an enormous amount of money on water and sewerage schemes.  Then one of the non-farmers who own land, some speculator, or some so-called respectable person, having the necessary money will acquire the land.  As soon as the job is finished, they sell it.  But who pays the enormous amount which has been paid for that land to the speculator?  Not the person who buys it to develop houses? No, it is the unfortunates who purchase the houses and who subsequently must pay by way of repayment of loans. Remember it is public money, which has been spent on the provision of water and sewerage for those sites.  Yet the profit on that land is picked up by somebody who moves on to look for greener pastures in a couple of months' time, finding some other place they can do the same thing and get away with it if they <Col N="1752" /> possibly can.  There is no use at all trying to brush it under the carpet.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Bill is not perfect.  Seldom is a Bill prepared by a party in opposition perfect.  But to say simply that the Government are not prepared to accept it, full stop, is not good enough.  I can assure the Minister that when this Bill is voted down, as probably it will be, he will not have heard the end of it, because once this has been started it must be continued. We heard this ridiculous nonsense about taking away the rights of the farmer, that we were trying to take his land from him.  At present land can be acquired from people who have land around our cities and towns and they have the right, if they are not satisfied with its price, to have it fixed.  But we do not think they are entitled for land at present valued at £1,000 or £2,000 an acre to pick up, say, £10,000, £15,000, £20,000 or perhaps more.  The only way to stop it is by legislation passed in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and indeed Deputy Andrews, referred to the fact that I did not do anything about it, when I was in the Department.  I can tell both of them this: there were so many things to be done after 16 years of Fianna Fáil misrule, things that had to be straightened out in the Department of Local Government. If they want to have a look at the record they will see what was done.  They will see we were really working fulltime in an effort to get matters straightened out.  But again we were in the midst of what Deputy Andrews referred to a few moments ago as the worst recession the world had experienced for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Well the Deputy can refer to 1973, 1974 and 1975 when the world experienced its worst recession for a long time, the worst the western world had experienced since 1929.  Yet in spite of that we were able to get things going.  What has happened now?  What excuse has the Minister now?  I know he will say that of course there is a recession now.  He will tell us how the cost of oil has pushed up the price of everything and he cannot do <Col N="1753" /> things he would like to do.  But when we were in power Fianna Fáil were not prepared to accept that.  Every day they tried to blame on our Government things that were happening because of outside influences.  Now they come along moaning to us that outside influences are preventing them from doing many things.  I am prepared to admit that many things have been held up because of outside influences.  This is something that could be dealt with by the Government if they had the will.  They have not got the will.</P>
      <P>In relation to Dublin inner city development, in 1968 an effort was made to have a CPO sanctioned&mdash;it had been passed by the city council&mdash;by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government.  It related to a coalyard in City Quay.  The Minister refused to sanction it though there were many people awaiting houses there.  Later the matter came before me in my time as Minister and I sanctioned a second C.P.O.  Some of the houses have since been built and some of them are occupied.  Three years ago that coalyard cost £100,000.  It could have been bought for £200 in 1968 if the Minister then and the Government had the courage to put a name at the bottom of a piece of paper.</P>
      <P>That has been the attitude of Fianna Fáil.  This Bill deals with the acquisition of sites for local authority houses.  I have been checking with a number of local authorities and I find that there will not be a start made on the building of any local authority houses this year.  Houses which local authorities were ready to start last year were not allocated any money if a beginning had not been made by 31 March last.  There is no money for housing.  Managers of housing authorities are sending letters to the Minister begging and imploring him to give them money to finish houses already started.  In December 1976 Deputy Lynch, then Leader of the Opposition, said here that the Coalition Government were building too many local authority houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot make the case I want to make if I am not allowed by the Chair to develop my argument.  My argument is that the cost of local authority housing now will be so high that the Minister will not have any trouble keeping to the decision taken by Fianna Fáil a few years ago in Opposition that they would not continue to build local authority houses.  None can be built this year and next year we will be told that local authority houses cannot be built because the cost of sites will be too high.  During my time as Minister there were comments by Fianna Fáil about the cost of sites in the Dublin inner city area.  They said that the inner city could not be developed because the cost of sites was too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is a question of housing our people we should not think of costs being too high.  People who need houses must have them and if they cannot provide them themselves the responsibility lies fairly and squarely on the Government of the day.  The Minister or anyone else from his party should not try to put it across on this House that houses cannot be built because the site costs are too <Col N="1755" /> high at a time when the Minister has not been taking the necessary steps to try to control the price of sites.  Is it not ludicrous that in any part of the country a young couple wanting to build their own house, who have been saving perhaps £3,000 or £4,000, when they go on the market find that that money will not buy a site for them even in a country area, not to talk of the cities or towns? That being so, there is no reason why the Government should allow a group of people to get away with rack renting, getting money for land which they may have had for a long time or which they may have recently acquired, making big profits.  It does not stop there because these profits are made from the unfortunate people who will eventually buy houses built from that land.</P>
    <P>At one time we heard complaints about the high cost of building materials and when a wage round was being negotiated we were told if an increase of twopence or threepence an hour was conceded it would push up the cost of houses and people would not be able to afford them.  Now we have a situation where a group of people, many of them completely unconnected with the building industry, can pick up colossal sums of money and slide off with it.  If such people are lucky enough to be able to acquire another site, another bit of land, cheaply somewhere else they will repeat their practice.</P>
    <P>It can be said that if people sell land cheaply it is their own fault.  A man came to me not so long ago and told me he had sold 12 acres of land for £24,000. He understood he was selling it to a building contractor, but a month after the sale he discovered that the man who had bought it is a speculator who later sold the land to a building contractor for £72,000.  He asked me if I could do anything about it.  I told him he had been satisfied with the £24,000 at the time of the sale and that it was just his hard luck.  Worse still, houses have since being built on the land and although there is a CRV in operation, the contractor who built the houses produced documents which proved the value of the site, <Col N="1756" /> in my opinion an exorbitant value, far above what it should be.  Many of the people in those houses are friends of mine and have told me about the very high repayments they have to make on their loans.  That contractor probably spends six months every year in the Canary Islands.  So well he can.  He has got a lot of money, he has not to work, he just worked his head for a short while and got away with it.</P>
    <P>If that were simply an isolated case one could say that the original owner of that land was foolish, but this has been happening over and over again throughout the country.  We find people who owned bits of land being approached by people who through a grapevine hear that public water supplies or sewerage schemes have been planned for the neighbourhood.  Those people chase that farmer for that land, buy it rather cheaply, eventually the sewerage and water are installed and suddenly those who bought the land are very rich.</P>
    <P>This Bill aims to put an end to that sort of thing.  People should not be allowed to make colossal sums of money in land speculation when they have not done a thing to provide the infrastructure which makes the land valuable.</P>
    <P>We have an extraordinary situation here.  One could pass through Dublin city and not realise what the situation is. There are thousands of young people&mdash;some of them not so young&mdash; married couples living in what can only be described as hovels with no hope of ever having homes of their own, either to buy or to be provided by the corporation. The reason is that the sites on which their houses should be built are being held by some greedy persons living in comfortable homes, held until they get the price they want.</P>
    <P>This Bill would put the fear of God in those people.  It would make them develop the sites or get rid of them quickly.  It is ridiculous that this situation should have been allowed to continue for so long.  During my time as Minister I tried to get a tax put on derelict sites.  It is a sin to see such sites being left there for years when people could be living in <Col N="1757" /> houses built there.  I had a good laugh on one occasion when a newspaper reported a tax was being imposed on derelict sites. The following morning in one area there were signs reading &ldquo;This site to be developed by July 1976&rdquo;.  Those people were afraid they would be caught.</P>
    <P>If the Minister tries to end this speculation he will have the full support of the Labour Party.  If he does not, we will do everything we can to have this matter righted in another way.  This Bill may not be perfect, but a lot of time and attention was spent drafting it.  If the Minister had stood up yesterday and gone through this Bill section by section, as Deputy Fitzpatrick did, I could understand it.  But the Minister did not.  All he did was make a report which did not say anything except that Fianna Fáil would vote against the Bill and that they would not let it go any further.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>When people are in a tight corner they attempt to get out of it by quoting the Kenny Report.  In my opinion the Kenny Report is as near to being adopted and turned into legislation as it was when I left office.  The Minister has a lot of material which his very excellent staff dug out for me, and subsequently for him.  That documentation is there.  If he has the will to do something about this he will do it, but he sits back and listens to his colleagues in the Cabinet who have no interest in rehousing the poor.  If he does that, we can expect continuation of this racket.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at this report.  There is not, as Deputy Andrews suggested, a pile of dust on it.  It is very actively considered for a long time.  The three years the Minister has been in office is a very long time and a considerable amount of dust may have gathered during that time if it has not been disturbed.</P>

      <P>I will accept the Minister's word that something has been done about it if somebody, during this debate, <Col N="1758" /> can give an inkling if legislation is to be introduced to implement the Kenny Report or to bring in a Bill to control this scandal.  I do not have to ask the Minister if he has the heads of a Bill because I am sure he has not.  If he had it would have been in his brief last night.  I am afraid it is simply a question of putting this off.  As far as the Government were concerned, this was just another Bill and their idea was to get out of it the handiest way possible.  That is not the way to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>Let me go back to a comment made by Deputy Andrews about the alien influence. He suggested that the Labour Party proposed to go out and grab the land from the farmers.  Fianna Fáil did damn well out of that in 1969 and it was as big a lie then as it is now.  We have no intention of attempting to take land from the farmers or from anybody else against their will but we hold, and will continue to hold, that there is no way somebody who owns by accident a portion of land, which a local authority require to build local authority houses, should be allowed to hold on to it and force the price up so that when the houses are built their cost to the State, to the local authority and to the tenant is far too high for anyone to bear.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to discuss the cities, because we have similar situations in Dublin, Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. There are ideal sites in the middle of these cities which could be acquired if the people who own them got the value of the sites for which they are using them.  They would not be able to look into the sky, think of a figure and demand that it should be paid.  The result is that at present these sites are not built on.  We believe the answer is to allow this Bill through, to amend it where it is considered necessary, or if it is not workable to come up with a reasonable alternative. There is no way we will accept from the Government that they are doing their duty by sitting back and allowing the Bill to be debated here, throwing in an odd snide remark and going back to where they came from and ignoring the fact that there is a demand for local authority <Col N="1759" /> houses but that the sites are not available.</P>
    <P>An example of what can be done when the proper approach is made can be seen in the Coombe, City Quay and the cattle market.  I was delighted to be able to make available the necessary money and sanctions to have houses built in those areas.  No more are such houses being built because, apart from the fact that there does not appear to be any money, the sites cannot be acquired as the owners feel they should become millionaires overnight at the expense of Dublin's poor, not at the expense of the State.  The poor who require housing will be left in the cold as a result of the inaction of a Government which seem to be bankrupt of everything including ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter before us arises, as I understand it, from the need for additional accommodation for Members of this House.  The premises of the National College of Art and Design in Kildare Street are in a situation which, from our point of view, is very valuable because we are very much pressed for space.  We appreciate the concern of the Government and the Taoiseach that we should be adequately accommodated and the efforts being made in that respect.  However, it is my duty not just as a Member of this House but as someone who must be concerned about the interests of people outside this House to express concern at the manner in which decisions seem to have been taken at a very late stage with regard to the taking over of this accommodation and the displacement of those at present in the college of art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the process by which this situation has come about.  There is a long history behind this matter going back many years but I am concerned with the immediate future rather than the distant past.  On 6 February the board of the National College of Art and Design unanimously <Col N="1760" /> resolved urgently to request the Minister for Education to begin negotiations immediately with the authorities of University College, Dublin to acquire premises at Earlsfort Terrace and Iveagh Gardens as a permanent solution to the accommodation problems of the college.  They made it clear to the Minister that they could accept temporary accommodation only at Earlsfort Terrace.  I do not know the process by which we have moved from that to a situation where the board appear to have been told that they must move within six weeks and be installed in Power's distillery, a totally different premises to the one which they have identified as appropriate to their needs. They are to be installed there by next September.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter in the House recently the Minister gave a very easy assurance that there would be no problem about their being installed by next September.  Nothing in the history of the acquisition and conversion of accommodation for the public authorities of this State since its foundation justifies that optimism.  I say that with no disrespect to those concerned.  The procedures and mechanisms of public authorities in dealing with these matters are necessarily time-consuming.  The property or at least a lease must be acquired and things rarely happen rapidly where lawyers are involved.  There are problems of design and in this instance a feasibility study was carried out several years ago.  Since then I understand the number of students has increased by 60 per cent and it seems improbable that the provisions of the feasibility study would be adequate for the present number of students.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this.  It may have been a very farsighted feasibility study which would have seen the accommodation at Power's as being far beyond the immediate requirements.  Again nothing in the history of the way in which the public authorities of this State operate suggests that it is probable that such a feasibility study would leave room for that kind of expansion.  If it did not, that feasibility study is no basis for the conversion of Power's distillery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> The buildings there are substantial and it may be that they are convertible for the use of the college and that this conversion can be planned and carried through, but it is not credible that it could be done at such a pace as to be able within six weeks to move from the Kildare Street premises the heavy equipment and many objects necessary for the work of the students.  The Minister does not carry credibility in assuring us that this can be done in a matter of weeks and recent experience suggests that it is highly improbable.</P>
    <P>The College of Art is divided into four different parts and I understand that one section was abandoned last year and a move took place to one of three sites in the vicinity of City Quay.  The assurance was given that the move would be completed in time and that builders would be out of the way by September.  In the event people were still hammering around the place finishing it off last Easter, seven months after the date by which this work was to be completed. That work was not rushed or decided at a few week's notice; it was prepared in advance, but it still over-ran by seven months the period provided.  The heavy equipment belonging to the college of art has remained in Kildare Street because of the difficulty of removing it to another site and now we are told that everything can be transferred and installed within six weeks in a building which is miraculously to be converted from a distillery into a college of art.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not over-strain the credulity of this House in the matter. He should come clean on the problems and in fairness to the board, students and staff they should be told exactly what will happen.  I have put down questions to the Minister as to what communications have been sent by him or other members of the Government, and on what dates, to the board of the National College of Art and Design relating to a proposed move by the college from the existing premises in Kildare Street and also asking what communications he has received from <Col N="1762" /> the board, the FWUI and the NCAD Students' Union.  I hope the Minister in his reply will enlighten us on these matters. He should tell us whether he or the Taoiseach wrote and what were the terms of these communications.  What notice was given of this move?  Has this move been accepted by the board?  Have the board decided to accept this accommodation which by implication they rejected as recently as February last in saying that the only accommodation they would accept was in Earlsfort Terrace?  If the board have taken such a decision, have they communicated it to the staff or to the students?  I understand there has been no communication, possibly because there was no decision. Neither staff nor students know what is intended and it is not all clear that the board know what is intended.  They do not seem to have been able to communicate.</P>
    <P>This is a thoroughly unsatisfactory position, particularly as this institution has had an unhappy history of neglect by the public authorities of this State which culminated in great difficulties ten years ago and led to the introduction of legislation in this House to reconstitute the college on a new basis.  This legislation was in many ways inadequate but gave some basis for the college to operate.  The difficulties which arose at that time and the disturbances related to them reflected the neglect of the National College of Art and Design by the Government of the day and probably by other Governments, although the Government of the day had been in office for twelve or thirteen years and certainly bore the principal responsibility for that neglect.  This institution is central to the whole question of art and design in a country whose deficiencies in this area are as legendary as our feats of literary prowess.</P>
    <P>Is it the case that this institution has been given an ultimatum at a few months' notice to move to a building not yet leased or acquired whose conversion from one use, a distillery, to a different use, a college of art and design, is obviously a major operation, contrary to their own clear will unanimously expressed <Col N="1763" /> to the Minister a few months ago?  If the institution are accommodated there, with whatever hammering will be going on for many years thereafter, distracting the students from their work as the process of conversion goes on, is it the case that they will find themselves on three other sites 20 minutes walk away, as they are at the moment in three buildings ten minutes walk from Kildare Street?  Is it proposed to move them temporarily for a few years to Power's Distillery with a view to a later move to Earlsfort Terrace?  Is it the case that the complete conversion of Power's Distillery is likely to take three years during which the College of Art and Design will be divided on four different occasions and that by the time the hammering stops and the conversion is completed they will be moved again to Earlsfort Terrace?</P>
    <P>The board, staff and students are entitled to know the situation.  They are entitled to fair treatment.  It would be wrong if we, in our legitimate and understandable concern to alleviate problems of accommodation here which are so acute for Members of this House, should be so totally lacking in consideration that the present generation of students and possibly students for several years to come will be discommoded in a way that will interrupt and damage their education in order to gain for us a few months in the matter of additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>The answer is that if this had to be done it should have been done much quicker.  If we need this accommodation next September or October, the process of making the change should have been initiated much earlier.  The distillery should have been acquired on a temporary or permanent basis and the conversion should have been proceeded with.  The staff, students and board should have been in a position to see the work nearing completion and they should have visible assurance that they could settle in next year without the kind of disturbance that went on for several months after their move from Clarendon Street to a new location at City Quay. <Col N="1764" /> They did not get that assurance.  At this stage they do not know if the accommodation has even been acquired, never mind any work of conversion.</P>
    <P>The experience they had in the case of Clarendon Street and our general experience of the pace at which this kind of work is done means they have little prospect of being adequately housed next September having regard to the way the decision is being proceeded with without warning.  There is every certainty that next September they will find themselves in a number of different sites, having to trundle backwards and forwards during the day in hail, rain and snow from one place to the other ten years after this Government enacted legislation which proposed to set up a structure&mdash;I think it meant a physical as well as an administrative structure&mdash;for this college, one that would do credit to the country and which would be fair to the students.</P>

      <P>I share the concern of Deputy FitzGerald with regard to the imminent displacement of the National College of Art and Design by what could be called a virtual eviction by the Government if the rumours we have heard are to be believed.  I urge the Minister to give us a definitive statement tonight as to the Government's intentions with regard to the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the Government have been approached by all parties in their concern for adequate facilities for Deputies and we share the dilemma in which the Minister and the Government find themselves.  However, we cannot facilitate one section by discommoding another section.  To do what it is rumoured the Minister proposes would be tantamount to compounding an already distressing situation.  The National College of Art and Design is fragmented.  There is one portion adjoining Leinster House and other sections are at City Quay, George's Quay and South Prince's Street.  A national institution such as the college is not getting the rightful recognition it deserves especially when we saw recently other institutions <Col N="1765" /> of national importance being funded.  Is the National College of Art and Design forever to be the pauper, the poor section of our educational system?  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> to today's date the Minister is quoted as saying that he hopes to have Power's Distillery ready at the end of this term.  I was speaking with the students and members of the staff association and the unions involved.  We want to be helpful to the Minister.  The method he is using at the moment is leading to a direct confrontation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to be helpful.  I can assure him our one concern is to avoid this direct confrontation which seems imminent.  How can he realistically tell the House that the college can have their premises vacated and be set up in a place not yet agreed by the board in readiness for the next academic year?  The Minister knows the board will only agree on a permanent site.  They will accept a temporary suitable site provided the Minister gives them an undertaking that it will lead to permanency. For too long the college has been neglected. In all the reports issued by the institution the one train of thought running through them is the total inadequacy of the facilities available.  Perhaps it is fortuitous that the Minister once and for all can make a decision to give this college its rightful place and a permanent site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the members of the staff association were appalled at the rumours about the college.  They were not consulted or informed at any stage.  They have indicated that their first preference is for Earlsfort Terrace.  I should like the <Col N="1766" /> Minister to tell us tonight if he has made arrangements for the transfer to Earlsfort Terrace even in a temporary capacity with a view ultimately to making it a permanent site for the National College of Art and Design.  It is grossly unfair to the students and staff of this national institution that they should be treated in this terrible way, not being consulted as to their future.  It would not encourage students to undertake any courses in art and design.  We are informed that there are approximately 450 full-time students and approximately 700 evening students availing of these facilities.  I would ask the Minister to at least give a definitive statement here tonight as to his exact intentions in respect of the displacement of the National College of Art and Design.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify some of the points raised.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald was correct in relating some of the problems to the needs of this House.  My priority is the educational one and the welfare of the College of Art.  I go along with what Deputy Dr. FitzGerald said about the college being central to the development of art education and that it is an area where we have been weak by tradition.  Some people explain that by the fact that art materials were too expensive and that pen and paper was cheap and consequently we excelled in the areas that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald outlined.  Worthwhile art has always been produced here and worthwhile work has been done in the college under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald said that the way in which public authorities operate gives no grounds for the optimism I have.  The general tendency of the contributions of both Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and Deputy Griffin was that there was some kind of hurried tripping over the ultimatum issued in this case. As I explain what happened, the House will see that this is not so.  There is an obligation on the Members of this House not to foment confrontation when negotiation, discussion and arrangements can be made for the betterment of <Col N="1767" /> any educational institution.  I am convinced that this transfer can be made.  It is not beyond the wit of man to move heavy equipment, and to make arrangements that will satisfy the staff and the students of the College of Art in this instance. The House will see that I have had discussions with bodies involved during the last few months and that it is my intention and my instruction to my staff that the students and staff should be fully informed of what is going on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there was an unhappy history there in the past, and except for the possibility that a little bit of irritation, as it does in the oyster, might produce pearls of art, I do not want to see that kind of situation again, and I know that I will not.</P>
      <P>The Kildare Street premises occupied by the National College of Art and Design were vested in the Commissioners of Public Works by the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, 1877, on payment of a consideration of £10,000 to the Royal Dublin Society, in respect of the lands to be acquired by the Commissioners from the Society.</P>
      <P>The College had its immediate origins in the Metropolitan School of Art which had its antecedents in &ldquo;a little academy or school for drawing and painting&rdquo; which the Dublin Society decided to establish in 1746.  It was opened in 1749 in premises built for it by the Society in Shaw's Court, off Dame Street.  The Society's school was subsequently transferred at different periods to various other premises, the last such transfer prior to its move to its present premises in Kildare Street being to Leinster House in 1815.</P>
      <P>While the date of transfer to the Kildare Street premises is unknown, what is known, and what is patently obvious is that the accommodation there is unsuitable on a long-term basis and, in fact, with the development of the college, particularly in the area of industrial arts, it is less and less satisfactory even on a short-term basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  At the same time, the provision of more adequate accommodation for the needs of the Houses of the Oireachtas was under examination by the Office of Public Works.  Clearly one of the options, rather than provide premises at a distance from Leinster House, was to acquire some of the buildings adjacent to the building in which we now are, and this the more so, when there was already question of finding alternative accommodation for the College of Art.</P>
      <P>With the setting up of An Bord of the NCAD on 1 May 1972, the establishment day, a leasing of the Kildare Street premises to An Bord became necessary. Section 27 (1) of the NCAD Act, 1971, provided for the transfer of all property real or personal held or enjoyed before the establishment day by the Minister to An Bord excepting the buildings and premises at Kildare Street, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The issue of a new College had, of course, already been raised before the 1971 Act was passed and it had been decided that a college was to have a new building.  A problem here was to find a site which would be suitable as a location for a college of this kind and, of course, which would also be acceptable architecturally.  One could doubtless acquire sites by going out to newly-developing areas but obviously it is desirable, in the case of the National College of Art, if it can be located in a city centre area, within reasonable access of artistic, educational and commercial facilities.  However, as one would expect, it has not proved easy to find a site measuring up to these requirements in the city area.</P>
      <P>When I assumed office as Minister for Education, the position was that an amount of preliminary planning had gone on but that there was still difficulty about a site.  A site at Morehampton Road was in the possession of the Office of Public Works but it was only about two acres in extent and it has not proved easy to acquire additional land there in order to put together a total site of reasonable size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> It was in this context that the college, as an independent statutory body, commissioned a feasibility study on the former Power's Distillery which had become available following the transfer of Irish Distillers' operations to Midleton.  This study was presented to the Higher Education Authority by the board of the college and discussed with me at a meeting which I had last year with representatives of the colleges and of the Authority.  The proposal has considerable merit in that it would provide a city centre location for the college which would help to revitalise that part of the historic city and in that it is a commendable effort to adapt fine buildings to an educational and aesthetic purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, there were reservations on the part of some people on the merit of settling on the distillery as the permanent location for the college.</P>
      <P>The number of seats in the Dáil has to be increased and this will lead to further pressures on space in Leinster House. The Government as a matter of immediate urgency, have to seek to have alternative accommodation provided on a temporary basis for the college in order to free the space in Kildare Street for the use of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of seeking such alternative accommodation, it became clear that Powers Distillery, already the subject of the feasibility study, presented the most realistic possibility in the short-run. Powers was not the only possibility considered but, as I have said, it appeared to be the most realistic one.  I contacted the Chairman of the board of the college and explained the position to him.  Subsequently, officials of my Department had discussions with representatives of the board of the College of Art, of the Higher Education Authority, and of Irish Distillers in order to further the proposal.  As the college is a designated institution for purposes of the Higher Education Act, my Department formally <Col N="1770" /> requested the Higher Education Authority to arrange for the transfer of the college's accommodation.  The authority was also asked, and I would like to emphasise this, to undertake an initiative with a view to finding permanent accommodation; and Earlsfort Terrace was considered.</P>
    <P>The present position in this regard is that, while the works envisaged in the feasibility study to which I have referred would be a major undertaking in providing the college with permanent accommodation, the present proposal envisages the adaptation on a short-term basis of a section of the distillery which appears suitable for the purpose and does not require major works of adaptation. The board of the college have commissioned a firm of architects, namely, those who undertook the feasibility study, and these are, in conjunction with other consultants, engaged in drawing up detailed plans for the transfer.  The architects have available to them the advice of a steering committee representative of the board of the College of Art, of the Higher Education Authority and of my Department's Building Unit. Irish Distillers Ltd., who have been most co-operative in this whole matter for which I thank them, have indicated that, if required, further accommodation can be made available at their premises in Bow Street, about 7 minutes walk from Powers.  The company had administrative offices there until very recently.</P>
    <P>The college students' union wrote to me about the proposals and I arranged that they would meet with senior officials of my Department.  A fruitful briefing session took place there.  I understand that representatives of the students arranged to visit the distillery premises.  I have no record of any communication from the FWUI.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give the assurance sought by the Deputy.  Levels of Exchequer support are determined annually and undertakings as to the basis for deciding on the appropriate levels of future financial support cannot be made in advance.  However, any income which might accrue to the Agricultural Institute in the foreseeable future as a result of this legislation is unlikely to be significant in the context of their overall support from public funds.</P>

I understand that the managing director expressed concern about the viability of the company's operations at Tuam but added that no decision had been taken by his board about the future of that factory.  I am aware that the company are very concerned about the small acreage of beet grown in the Tuam area on which the commercial viability of the factory primarily depends and the continuing decline in that acreage despite efforts made by the company to encourage beet growing in the west.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will have the claim by a person (details supplied) in County <Col N="1621" /> Waterford for unemployment assistance reinvestigated as this claimant has no means of support.</P>

      <P>The application for unemployment assistance by the person concerned was refused on the ground that his means derived from the value of the board and lodging afforded to him on his father's farm exceeded the statutory limit applicable to him.  This assessment was made as recently as last January and was confirmed by an appeals officer who upheld the disallowance in February of this year.</P>
      <P>As there do not appear to be any changes in the person's circumstances since that time, a reinvestigation of the case does not appear necessary. However, if the person concerned is of opinion that his circumstances have changed, he should reapply for unemployment assistance giving details of the changes and his case will be reinvestigated.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 6 March 1980 to 16 May 1980 as medical certificates were received and there was no delay in the issue of this benefit.</P>
      <P>His entitlement to pay-related benefit is based on his reckonable earnings in the income tax year 1978-79.  As details of his earnings were not available to my Department under the Revenue number quoted by the claimant his entitlement to that benefit could not be immediately determined.  He was requested to furnish evidence of his earnings in that year and on receipt of the necessary information a cheque in payment of all arrears of pay-related benefit due to him to 2 May 1980 was issued on 15 May 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has since been paid disability <Col N="1622" /> benefit and pay-related benefit to 23 May 1980, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision of service was delayed because, following the payment of his deposit, the applicant indicated that he wished to be connected to an exchange other than the local one, as had been proposed.  This change could not be agreed to and the matter was not resolved until the end of February 1980. Service will be provided within the next two months.</P>

      <P>(a)  Defence Force Regulations provide that, apart from a person who is in possession of a university degree, diploma or other special qualification, only non-commissioned officers of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil shall be eligible to be appointed to be officers in An Fórsa. Such non-commissioned officers are required to complete successfully a potential officers' course prior to being recommended for appointment as officers.  This course consists of a continuous period of training of 14 days as well as periods of training of short duration amounting to a total of 48 hours.</P>
      <P>(b)  it is intended to commence courses of instruction for officers of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil at the Military College in August next.</P>
      <P>(c)  The Defence Acts and Defence Force Regulations have separate provisions governing officers of the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  An officer in one class of the Defence Forces cannot readily be compared, therefore, to an officer in the other class.</P>

      <P>(c)  These vehicles are being disposed of in accordance with Defence Force Regulations regarding obsolete stores. As they are items of defensive equipment, it is likely that they will be scrapped and the produce sold.  One tank will, however, be retained for military museum purposes.</P>

      <P>The main reason for the fluctuating trade balance between Ireland and Indonesia lies in the nature of the principal goods traded between both countries.  Since 1974 the bulk of this trade consisted of items having the characteristics of commodity products, which are sensitive to movements in currency rates and prices.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála provides full market research information to Irish firms to enable them to assess the potential of the Indonesian market.  However, in Córas Tráchtála's assessment of international markets generally, Indonesia does not, at this point, rank as a market with major potential for Irish products.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 349, 350 351 and 352 together.</P>
      <P>It is not the case that the Erasmus Smith Trust Funds were intended by the Erasmus Smith Schools Act Scheme of 1941 to be used exclusively for the benefit of the Abbey School, Tipperary. This school's reconstruction, following a fire, and the upkeep of agricultural education therein, were included among the trusts of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Twenty-one thousand pounds was paid by the Minister towards the reconstruction of the Abbey School in the financial year 1953-54.  The Minister is also empowered under the scheme to pay an annual subsidy not exceeding £580 towards the costs and expenses of carrying on and maintaining special agricultural teaching and training in the school and this has been paid every year since the school year 1942-43.</P>
      <P>In addition, certain supplementary payments totalling £10,183 were made by the Minister from the unexpended balances of the endowment funds towards building and other costs incurred by the authorities of the Abbey School over the years 1953-54 to 1971-72.</P>
      <P>The trust scheme provided also for the provision of certain scholarships.  Consequent on the introduction of free post-primary education and schemes of grants for higher education this provision is no longer considered necessary. The question of revision of the scheme to take account of this circumstance is under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to unemployment benefit as he has been paid his maximum entitlement of 390 days benefit.  In accordance with statutory contribution conditions he cannot requalify for unemployment benefit until he obtains a further 13 weeks of insurable employment after 25 April 1979 the date on which he had been paid 156 days of unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1657" /> The claimant has a record of intermittent employment since 25 April 1979. However his entitlement to unemployment benefit cannot be determined until current investigations into the appropriate insurance contributions payable in respect of this intermittent employment have been completed.  It is hoped to have these inquiries completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of the inquiries the claimant's title to unemployment assistance is being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 15 May 1978 to 23 February 1980.  Payment was disallowed after that date following examination by a medical referee, who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the decision disallowing payment of benefit after 23 February 1980 and, in connection with his appeal, was again examined on 21 May 1980 by a different medical referee who was also of the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He was notified of the result of the second examination on 30 May 1980 and invited to set out, on a form supplied, the grounds for his appeal.  On return of the form, duly completed, to my Department his case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the position as stated in my reply to the Deputy on 5 March 1980 regarding the application of the person concerned. <Col N="1658" /> Confirmation of stamping of the Deed of Transfer of his farm is still awaited by the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>I might mention to the Deputy that the question of deeds of transfer as it affects pension claims is under scrutiny in my Department.  I am hopeful that as a result some revised administrative procedure can be introduced to speed up decisions in affected cases.</P>
