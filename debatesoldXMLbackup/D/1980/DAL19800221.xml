      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When I reported progress yesterday we were dealing with an amendment on section 4, but this amendment essentially involves a discussion of section 4 because the amendment the Minister moved proposes to delete section 4 and substitute another section for it.  Section 4 as it stands reads:</P>
      <P>This Act shall not bind a State authority in its capacity as lessor or immediate lessor of any premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> That means that the State as a landlord is not bound by the Act while as a tenant it is entitled to all the benefits of the Act. As a landlord the State does not have to shoulder any of the responsibilities imposed on landlords in general by the Bill but is entitled to all the benefits which accrue to tenants under the Bill.  That is a most undesirable and most unreasonable approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that has always been the law, that the State was never bound by landlord and tenant legislation. I disagree with that.  That has never been adjudicated in the courts nor has it ever been ruled on in the courts.  If the only argument the Minister can put forward in favour of that is the old dictum that the Crown can do do no wrong and that the Crown is exempt from obligations such as this that is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister agrees that in 1926 the question arose out of a long standing letting of part of what is known in this city as the Post Office building but apparently on the advice then given the State settled that case.  As far as I know, it was never litigated on.  The position is that at best, as far as the Minister is concerned, there is a grave doubt whether or not the State was exempt from the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  I say there is no doubt the State was always bound by those Acts and was not exempt from them.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant Commission, which the Minister referred to on a number of occasions, have reported on a lot of things.  They have reported on the updating of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, but they never recommended that the State should be exempt as a landlord from the provisions of this Act. The Minister seeks to give the impression that the Landlord and Tenant Commission had not been asked to consider that point.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission had in their terms of reference the updating of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  If they thought that that Act should have been amended to include the provisions of section 4 <Col N="244" /> they would have so advised.  The case I was making yesterday evening is that it was entirely unreasonable that the State should be exempt from obligations imposed on the landlord by this Bill while at the same time enjoying all the benefits given to tenants.  I made the case that if section 4, or even the amended section proposed by the Minister which is an improvement in regard to the landlords interest bought by the State, is written into the Bill it will mean that a person could have been a tenant of a business premises for many years and could have built up a valuable goodwill and a valuable asset in it and, just because the State happened to be the landlord, he could be ejected from the premises on the termination of his tenancy without the ordinary right of renewal which is enjoyed by every tenant.  That is most unfair and most unjust.</P>
    <P>In replying to my argument yesterday the Minister seemed to suggest that it was necessary that the State should have control over certain property here and there and he instanced airports and other places like that.  But the case he was making was that it is necessary that the State should be in a special position because it is the State and it is acting in the public interest and should have control and be able to recover possession of premises.  As the law stands, and as the law will stand if section 4 unamended were put into the Act or even if the Minister's amendment is accepted, if the State gives a lease for 50 years it cannot recover possession of that premises for 50 years provided the tenant or the lessee observes the terms of the lease and pays the rent.  It might be vital for the State to get possession after ten years because of changes in circumstances but, as the Minister knows, the State is protected because it can proceed then by way of compulsory acquisition order which is available to local authorities and to the State.  In this way they can acquire the property.  The only difference is that the unfortunate lessee would be protected and compensated.  If the State wanted the property it could use the ordinary machinery that is there to get possession but the lessee would be compensated <Col N="245" /> for the loss of his lease, the loss of his premises and the loss of his goodwill and, in default of agreement between the State and the lessee, compensation would be fixed.</P>
    <P>That would be the case if the lease were interrupted in the public interest and for the national good.  But we are not dealing with that position here.  We are dealing with the position that will arise when a lease for 21 years or 50 years expires after a tenant or lessee has built up a valuable asset, valuable goodwill.  In the case of an ordinary landlord the lessee would be entitled to a new tenancy on terms to be fixed in accordance with the Act on the expiration of the old tenancy.  But the Minister, even with his amendment, wants to change that.  He wants to provide that, unless there are very exceptional circumstances, the tenant will not be entitled to a new tenancy but will be turfed out and will not get a penny compensation.</P>
    <P>I want to put the proposition to the Minister&mdash;I do not think it has been argued yet&mdash;that there are cases where, for good reason, the landlord is excused or relieved from granting a new lease because he has a scheme of reconstruction or a scheme of new management for his property and the law recognises that and the Acts to date recognise that but they say that in such a case a tenant is entitled to compensation on serving the usual notice.  But here the State is not going to have to pay compensation.  If the Minister gets his way the State will be entitled to refuse to renew a lease without giving a penny compensation to the tenant.  Surely that is not reasonable. Surely the Minister will not continue to argue that the State should be put in a special category, that it is not going to be asked to renew a tenancy because it wants the property.  Even if it does not want the property for any special purpose it is not going to be asked to renew the tenancy and the tenant will not have any right to have the tenancy renewed. Further it is going to be put in a special favoured position, distinct and apart from other landlords who, if they refuse to renew a lease for good reasons as set <Col N="246" /> out in the Act, have to pay compensa tion.  But the almighty State, on the basis of following the dictum that the king can do no wrong, is to be excused from that too.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When progress is reported one is inclined to have to make things a bit intelligent.  I think I have made the argument sufficiently well for this and I would certainly like to hear the Minister's comments on the necessity for this innovation, and innovation it is in view of the compulsory acquisition proceedings which are available to the State if it wants to interrupt a lease. What objection has the Minister to putting the State in a position similar to the ordinary landlord, that is to say, giving the State the right to refuse to renew a lease on payment of compensation the same as any other citizen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has expressed the opinion that the landlord and tenant Acts do not bind the State.  He is certainly entitled to hold that opinion since, as I pointed out yesterday, the doubt as to whether these Acts do bind the State has never been resolved by judicial decision. Nevertheless, the view has been very widely accepted up to the present time that those Acts do not bind the State.  Accordingly, leases and lettings of State property would not have been framed, indeed would not have been granted, in the manner in which they were had it been assumed that the lesees <Col N="247" /> and the tenants concerned could gain rights under the landlord and tenant code.  Dispositions of State property would have been made differently.  As these leases and lettings stand at present, the position could well be that if the doubt about the position of the State were to be resolved against the State by judicial decision in the absence of section 4 of the Bill, the basis on which these leases were made could very well be undermined. As I mentioned, one opinion about the position of the State under the landlord and tenant code is as valid as another in the absence of judicial decision. However, so far as the substance of section 4 is concerned, the doubt that has been raised must be resolved, because leases have been given by the State in the manner in which I have mentioned that doubt must be resolved in favour of the State.</P>
      <P>Last evening Deputy Fitzpatrick also mentioned the Rent Restrictions Act and it is pertinent to note that the Rent Restrictions Acts of 1960-67 contained no provision exempting the State from liability under those Acts.  Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held in relation to the earlier code of rent control in the case of <i>Cork County Council v. the Commissioners of Local Works and others</i> in 1945 that the State was not bound by the rents Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  To make clear what is at issue here, I shall mention the case referred to yesterday, namely, the shop tenant in the GPO Building in O'Connell Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think the House will agree that the State must seek to keep control of what happens in the GPO and yet this was only one of scores <Col N="248" /> of cases of various kinds.  If we examine each case we will find, as did our predecessors in the preparation of the 1977 Bill when this matter was under consideration, that a clear case can be made for exempting the State as landlord of each type of property.  The idea of providing a schedule of exceptions in connection with the question of State exemption was considered but the idea had to be abandoned as impracticable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned my reference last evening to the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  Perhaps my statement was not as clear as it might have been but I wish to say that I did not use the commission as a crutch in having the package presented in the way it is at the moment.  What I did say was that they did not recommend any change.  I would not want the Deputy to take it that they recommended that it should stay as it is and if I conveyed that impression I was wrong; but certainly they did not recommend any change.</P>
      <P>As I said last evening, section 4 simply writes into statute law a provision which is intended to confirm what has been the position in law since the foundation of the State.  Basically that is all I am doing.  I have paid particular attention to the points raised in the Seanad and it is obvious that the amendment before the House has come as a result. In fairness it must be stated that in theory the points raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick are correct but in practice it would not be as simple as it would appear to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> What is the objection to compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned last evening, I am not prepared to make any change here.  I have come as far as I can. I spelled out the consequences last evening. The Landlord and Tenant Commission are still sitting and they will be up-dating legislation of this kind while they are in existence.  Having carefully studied this extremely complex area and having taken into account the fall-out of the <Col N="249" /> changes which we are now discussing and which I cannot accept, if they come forward with a recommendation and if they make suggestions, I and my successor will certainly try to accommodate any changes suggested.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that tenants of the State should be put on all fours with tenants whose landlords have redevelopment plans in regard to renewal rights, that is refusal of renewal or payment of compensation to business tenants only, is one that could receive consideration. However, this would cover only one aspect of the question.  Questions of covenants could remain and I would be wrong if I gave an off-the-cuff undertaking in regard to changing the proposals as they concern the State.  Tenants of the State accepted their tenancies on the basis that they did not have renewal rights and presumably they were somewhat below market rents on that account.</P>
      <P>It is a complex area.  Nobody has been able to analyse the consequences of what Deputy Fitzpatrick has suggested.  As the records indicate, it has been suggested before.  But the proper analysis that is vital for any Minister before he could bring in that change, which looks quite reasonable and acceptable on the face of it, has not been made.  I am sorry to say that as of now I cannot go any further and I hope my reasons will be accepted. I agree that Deputy Fitzpatrick has an excellent case, but there is much to be said for and against the argument. My only regret is that I cannot go further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is no point in prolonging this debate unduly because the Minister has indicated he is prepared to dig his heels in.  I think this is quite unreasonable. There is no obligation on the State to go into the property business or into the business of letting or leasing property.  If it does not want to lease property, if it wants to keep control of it, it can give a shorter lease.  At any rate, if it goes into the business of letting property it should be bound by the rules <Col N="250" /> the same as anybody else.  It is unreasonable that it should go into the business of letting property and excuse itself from those rules.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that this matter is very complicated but I cannot follow the logic of that.  The only thing that is complicated is that the State does not want to yield an inch.  It wants to keep itself separate and distinct, over and above everyone else.  I cannot see where there is any complication in saying that if the State does not renew then it must compensate especially when other landlords must compensate and when the machinery for assessing compensation has existed since 1931.  There is no mystery about it; there is no question of unlimited or unreasonable compensation being fixed.  The machinery has been there since the 1931 Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not big enough to take a bold step in this matter.  His attitude should be that if the State is not going to be prejudiced irrevocably, if it is not going to be deprived of its property when it is wanted in the national interest, then he is prepared to say the State must compensate the same as everyone else.  I hope that I would be big enough to do this if I were in the Minister's chair, to say that that does not need any research. This puts a completely different complexion on it.  This does not need any commission who will sit for years and whose report will sit in some cubbyhole for another ten or 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple proposition.  If the State wants the property on the termination of a lease, and certifies that it wants it for its business in a Department of State, it will not have to renew the lease but it will have to compensate the unfortunate tenant when the case may be that all he owns in the world is the goodwill in this place.  What is wrong with that?  I do not accept as a reasonable offer that if the Landlord and Tenant Commission, having studied the matter, come up with a reasonable proposition, it will be considered by the Department and that, if they so recommend, consideration will be given to amendment of the law. <Col N="251" /> Several people could be bankrupt and destroyed in the meantime by having their leases refused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy mind me interrupting him?  To my knowledge, up to now nobody has been interfered with.  There is no basic difference. The State is not in this business for the purpose of making profit.  Its role is completely different from that of the ordinary landlord who is involved.  There is an enormous difference.  Would the Deputy agree there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do, but I cannot see the objection to compensating him.  All the other arguments may be at least valid as arguments but the refusal to compensate is not valid as an argument.  I am not prepared to accept an offer that some time when the Landlord and Tenant Commission get round to it and recommend it the law will be changed.  The last comprehensive Landlord and Tenant Act was enacted by this Oireachtas in 1931, and 31 from 80 is 49.  We are getting round to updating it now.  Will it be perhaps another 50 years before this is updated?  We know how hard it is to get any Department to amend legislation piecemeal.  That is an unreasonable approach and I challenge the Minister to debate the reasonableness of agreeing to compensation the same as in the case of any other landlord.  It will not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the State is not in the property market to make money, that the State will not be unreasonable. Supposing there is a case where the State wants the property and it would be reasonable to compensate.  Would not the obvious answer that would be forthcoming from the Department concerned be: &ldquo;We are sorry, we have no statutory authority to pay compensation. We are precluded from paying compensation because you are not legally entitled to it and if we did pay compensation the Comptroller and Auditor General could surcharge the Secretary of the Department as the Accounting <Col N="252" /> Officer&rdquo;?  Is not that the answer that would be given in that case?  Why not provide against that and why not protect the Department from themselves? Why not enable the Department in a case like that to do the right thing?  I believe I have said enough to convince any person who is prepared to move.  I sympathise with the Minister to the extent that the law of landlord and tenant is complicated and to that extent he is in the hands of his advisers.  Advisers are slow to advise the giving away of departmental rights, but surely the principle of compensation is a simple, uncomplicated bit of machinery that would say &ldquo;Yes, the State must be protected, so must the citizen&rdquo;.  The way we protect the State is to ensure that it will not be obliged to renew a lease where it wants the property for its own use and the way we protect a citizen is to put him in the same position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the State as a landlord refusing to renew as he would be <i>vis-á-vis</i> John Citizen as a landlord refusing to renew.  This is a reasonable proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that I am sorry there is such a wide gap between Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself and I am sorry that I cannot bridge the gap because there should be no reason why the gap should be there.  I would be the first to say, &ldquo;Right, let us try.  We can more than meet each other half way and we would possibly have better legislation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Theoretically everything that Deputy Fitzpatrick is saying perhaps is so, but the practicalities of it would cause extremely serious problems, so great that I am advised that we do not even know the extent of these problems.  In no way do I want to point-score off anybody, but my predecessor had the same view as I have and the previous Government had the same view in supporting their Minister as this Government have in supporting me.  I would like the bridge to be there.  I would hope that another review of this legislation will not be as long as 50 years away.  I would hate to think that the Landlord and Tenant Commission would be there for I do not <Col N="253" /> know how long.  It will not do their morale any good if they are going to be hanging around in some shape or form for another 50 years.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of Deputy Fitzpatrick that things could go wrong. They might go wrong and the tenants would be hard done by.  I suppose my line of defence here would naturally have to be that it has not happened up to now, it has never happened and the State is an exceptionally good landlord not motivated by profits as ordinary landlords are.  On the question of compensation, tenants of the State know that they are not in the same position as tenants of private landlords and they know the terms on which they hold and they agree to those terms at certain levels of rent.  Theoretically Deputy Fitzpatrick is correct, but in practice his suggestions would not work.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the record I say again that I would be quite prepared to ask the Landlord and Tenant Commission to give this area priority for the purpose of examination, proper analysis and consultations in relation to the change suggested.  I would then be prepared to use my voice if I am here, or I would suggest to my successor, of whatever party might be in Government, that I will use my voice as a Member of the Dáil to see that any recommendation will not be put on the long finger.  I know this is piecemeal legislation and I know the effects of it, but a start has to be made.  I would not want Deputy Fitzpatrick to believe that I am digging in for the sake of digging it, because I am not; I have no option.</P>

      <P>The only new point that the Minister has made is that when people contract with the State they know the terms on which they contract.  That is not so up to the present time.  Even on the Minister's case there is a doubt.  I am satisfied beyond doubt that if a Court were asked to adjudicate in the absence of section 4 they would hold that the State is bound by the ordinary Landlord and tenant statute law the same as anybody else. The Minister says that when people enter into a contract with the State they know the terms on which they enter.  Human nature being such as it is, I am sure the Minister is aware that people think that 50 years will never pass.  I bought a leasehold premises which was to run for 27 years and it ran and expired.</P>

    <P>The Minister's attitude is utterly unreasonable, especially when I put to him my belief that the solution is to bring in an amendment that will give compensation. <Col N="255" /> This is the first time that that argument was raised and I am convinced that no reasonable Minister or administration could oppose it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 34, after &ldquo;building&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or they consist of land used wholly or partly as a scrap yard, sales yard or arena, a yard used for storing materials in the course of business, a car park or for any similar trade or business&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 5 defines a tenement.  The word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; is very fundamental to the Bill in general and, therefore, it is important that there should be a proper definition of that word.  Otherwise, structures or areas which were intended to be covered by the Bill will not be.  If we do not have a proper definition of tenement structures which should be protected by the Bill will not be.  Section 5 defines &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; as premises complying with a number of conditions including the following:</P>
      <P>(i) they consist either of land covered wholly or partly by buildings or of a defined portion of a building;</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to add land used wholly or partly as a scrap yard, sales yard or arena, a yard used for storing materials in the course of business, a car park or for any similar trade or business. Covered areas or buildings are not as necessary now as they were some years ago.  For example, arenas for showing motor cars are invariably fenced in and uncovered, but they are just as much a building as a building in the real sense of the word.  In the old days big sheds were used for storing cars.  The same applies to cattle yards and builders' warehouses but now non-perishable items are stored in the open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is to cover the type of structure it was intended, the Minister must extend the definition of the word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; as I suggested.  Otherwise a person <Col N="258" /> son who leases a car sales yard or arena for a number of years will not be able to avail of the Bill to renew his lease. However, a person carrying on a similar business in a building is entitled to benefit under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of landlord and tenant legislation applies not to land as such but to buildings or built-on land. If that code were to be extended to apply to lettings of vacant land, as would happen if the amendment was accepted, then I am afraid the scope and character of the entire landlord and tenant code would be changed with consequences that would be difficult to envisage.  For example, the idea of unbuilt-on land that may comprise part of a tenement by reason of being subsidiary and ancillary to the buildings on the land may well lose its significance.  If lettings of merely vacant land were to be brought within the scope of the landlord and tenant code there is no apparent reason left for imposing any restrictions on the amount of unbuilt-on land that may form part of a tenement for the purposes of Part II and Part IV of the Bill or that may form part of the land the subject of a ground rent lease or tenancy for the purpose of establishing the right to buy out the fee simple under the 1967 and 1978 ground rent legislation.  The question of what is subsidiary and ancillary land is extremely important in that connection. This is the most obvious of many far-reaching implications if the kind of change that is in question was to be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several of the types of land use specified in amendment No. 3 indicate vacant land in which little or no investment has been made by anyone and in which an equity to renewal would hardly be said to arise since the tenant is not committed to that particular letting or piece of ground in any way as is, for example, the tenant of a shop premises.  On the other hand, if the vacant land has been developed for use, even if only to the extent of being hard-covered, it is not easy to see why it should not qualify as a building and hence come within the definition of tenement as defined in the <Col N="259" /> Bill.  I should like to point out to the House that a roofless underground petrol tank has been held to be a building for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When I listened to the Minister at the outset I was inclined to accuse him of old-fashioned and back ward thinking, of refusing to move with the times, but I now understand his argument to be that the definition is wide enough to cater for the type of area I have in mind.  I do not agree.  To confine tenant's rights to buildings, as we understand buildings, would be old-fashioned and a refusal to move with the times.  We all know that in recent years the method of displaying goods and the structure of sales areas has changed even within buildings.  Who would have thought of a supermarket type of shop 20 years ago or a supermarket method of displaying goods or a self-service system 50 years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the same can be said of the case by which I am trying to demonstrate my argument, that is, the question of a sales area for second-hand cars.  These cars are sold in areas that have been developed by way of the laying of a metal surface on the ground which is then covered with ornamental gravel, for instance, while the area is surrounded by a proper fence.  I do not think that any reasonable person could define such a development as a building. It might be referred to as an arena, whatever that may be, or it might be referred to as a structure, but not as a building.  That is the type of area that should be included: an area of ground that has been developed for a specific purpose and at considerable expense and which is not suitable for market gardening <Col N="260" /> ing or for other agricultural purposes because of having been transformed into a sales area.</P>
    <P>The Minister's draftsmen would be able to cover this matter in a much better way than any amendment of mine would cover it.  I am told that the definition is not wide enough to include a scrap yard, a car dealer's yard, a yard used for storing material or a private car park which, though without any building, could involve substantial expenditure.  Neither is the definition wide enough to include a market garden or other premises where there is not a building but which may have been actively used by a tenant for business purposes.  That is my advice on the situation and it is advice that appeals to me as being reasonable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would help me to clear my mind as to his attitude.  When he began speaking I thought he was talking about the old traditional building and saying that such should qualify.  But as he continued his argument I understood him to say that he agreed that the type of structure I have in mind should be protected by the Bill but that the definition was wide enough to include such structure.  I disagree with him in both cases.  First, if he is saying that only the old fashioned business should be protected, that is not moving with the times. But, if he is not saying that and is saying that he agrees that the cattle sales yard, the scrap dealer's yard and so on should be included and are included in the definition, I disagree because I do not regard the definition as being wide enough in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the latter part of what I had to say, I thank the Deputy for his complimentary remarks about my not being old fashioned.  I contend that the type of case mentioned by the Deputy, the sales yard for second-hand cars, is covered.  As I have said already, if a roofless petrol tank is a building within the code of law, it must be very fair to argue that a sales yard which had been developed by way of the laying of a metal tarmacadam base is also a building.  But a person who takes a letting on merely a vacant space is not <Col N="261" /> within the scope of this code of law, which began as a code for the protection of town tenants, for tenants whose livelihoods were bound up with their tenancies.  I am satisfied, having regard to the court case of 1952 to which I have referred, that the type of structure referred to by the Deputy are included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House, I wish at this Stage to give notice of my intention to move on the Report Stage a further amendment to section 5 concerning the following matter. A question has been raised very recently concerning the effect of the provisions of section 5 subsection (1) (a) of Part IV of the Bill.  The matter is under examination and an amendment may be necessary to cater for the points in question.  Consequently, I am giving notice now of my intention to table an appropriate amendment for Report Stage, if warranted.</P>
      <P>The question that has been raised concerns the effect of the words &ldquo;the person making the letting or of the person taking it&rdquo;.  The corresponding expressions in the 1931 Act provision, in section 2 (d), are &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo;.  Since the words &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; are defined in the 1931 Act and in the Bill as including successors in title, the argument has been put forward that the change signifies an intention to prevent an assignee of the original lessor or lessee from taking over and relying on the original temporary convenience.  The argument goes that a temporary convenience letting is outside the scope of the legislation initially if it comes within the provisions of section 5, subsection (1) (a) of Part IV of the Bill.  That paragraph excludes such lettings from the definition of a tenament.  However, it is argued that since an assignee or, say, the person making a letting is not that person, the application of section 5, subsection (1) (a) of Part IV ceases with the assignment and with it the exclusion from the scope of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the change in the wording of section 5 (1) (a) (iv) was made so that oral lettings for temporary convenience would come within the ambit of the provision as well as lettings in writing to which alone the expressions &ldquo;lessor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lessee&rdquo; refer.  The view was not taken that section 5 (1) (a) (iv) would cease to apply by reason of an assignment of the <Col N="263" /> letting.  The matter is of particular importance in regard to the question of renewal rights for tenants who take lettings for temporary convenience in premises that are awaiting redevelopment. It is at present under examination by the Landlord and Tenant Commission. It would be well to have the commission's considered view of the matter before deciding the question of the need for an amendment.</P>
    <P>I formally give notice to the House of my intention on Report Stage, if it is necessary, to introduce an amendment but I am awaiting advice on the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 4, after &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;notwithstanding that they may be occupied for the purposes of another State authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the requirements to qualify as a tenement&mdash;see section 5 (1) (a) (iii)&mdash;is that the tenant is the actual occupier. The Landlord and Tenant Commission point out in their first report, paragraphs 76 and 77, that this condition is not satisfied in cases where a tenancy of premises is taken by the Commissioner of Public Works for the accommodation of one or other of the branches of the Public Service so that the Commissioners are not themselves the occupiers. They recommend in paragraph 34 (3) of the first report that in such cases the Commissioners should be <Col N="264" /> taken to be the tenants and to be in exclusive occupation for the purposes of the 1931 Act.  This would mean that the Commissioners would, for example, be able to claim a new tenancy under Part II on the same terms as ordinary business tenants.  Subsection (2) provides accordingly and uses the expression &ldquo;State authority&rdquo;.  This can be seen in section 4 and in the definition section 3 (1) which, as well as the Commissioners of Public Works, includes a Minister of the Government and the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In their comments on this Bill which they furnished recently, the Landlord and Tenant Commission gave it as their opinion that the protection of section 5 (2) should apply only where the property let by the State has been let to any branch of the public service.  The amendment before the House proposes to restrict the scope of that subsection accordingly. This is basically to comply with the recommendation and advice of the commission in this area.</P>

The State is grasping out in all directions to protect its own little self against the big, bad, private citizen but it will not give the big, bad, private citizen any protection under this legislation.  That is my immediate reaction to this.</P>
      <P>I think that is a reasonable amendment because the Office of Public Works are usually the agency who take the lettings for the State.  It is reasonable that they should be able to tenant them by any Department of State as long as they comply with the terms of the lease.  I repeat that this emphasises how unreasonably the state and the Minister are behaving in regard to section 4.  I accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 16 to 26 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  that person being a company which is another company's holding company, the premises are used for the purpose of carrying on a business by the other company, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  that person being a company which is another company's subsidiary, the premises are used for the purpose of carrying on a business by the other company, or</P>
      <P>(iv)  that person being a company which is another company's subsidiary, the premises are used for the purpose of carrying on a business by another subsidiary of the other company,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private company, the other company or the other subsidiary (as the case may be) shall be deemed for the purposes of subsection (1) (a) (iii) to be the tenant of <Col N="266" /> the premises and to be in exclusive occupation thereof.</P>
    <P>(4) In subsection (3) `company', `private company', `holding company' and `subsidiary' have the same meanings respectively as in the Companies Act, 1963.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 5 (3) (e) (i) and (ii) of the Bill as they stand stem from recommendations made in the First Report of the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  They ensure that rights of renewal are secured in certain places where a tenement would not otherwise exist because the tenant is not the person in actual occupation by reason of the formation of a private company to carry on the business of the individual who holds the tenancy, or by reason of the tenancy being held by a holding company while the business is being carried on by a subsidiary of the holding company.</P>
    <P>The amendment now proposes for two further cases as follows.  Firstly, where the company that holds the tenancy is a subsidiary of the company that carries on the business and secondly, where the company that holds the tenancy and the company that carries on the business are both subsidiaries of the same holding company.</P>
    <P>Representations were made by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland that the provisions in section 5 (3) (c) (ii) of the Bill no longer reflect the general practice in company arrangements involving a property holding company and a trading company.  It has been pointed out that the more usual practice nowadays is for a holding company to have two collateral subsidiaries, one of which holds the group's properties while the other is a trading company.  It was suggested that the provision in question should cover the circumstances where the trading and tenancy are divided between a parent company and a subsidiary or between the two subsidiaries of the one parent company, regardless of which company is doing which.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to take that view if the situation is to be catered for effectively <Col N="267" /> and in up-to-date terms&mdash;that was the subject of the relevant recommendation of the Landlord and Tenant Commission, First Report, paragraph 84&mdash;and the amendment is proposed accordingly.</P>
    <P>The amendment also incorporates a drafting amendment in respect of the provision in section 5 (3) (c) (ii) by deleting the reference to &ldquo;permission&rdquo;. The preceding provision in (3) (c) (i) deals with the case of a private company using the premises with the permission of the person who is entitled to be in occupation. However, a similar reference to &ldquo;permission&rdquo; is included in the following provision to which I have referred.  That concerns quite a different situation involving arrangements between two associated companies.  The reference to &ldquo;permission&rdquo; in that provision is inappropriate and incorrect and it is proposed to delete it.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.

However, section 6 goes further than is intended in one type of case, that is, where the building provided by the housing authority is the subject of separate lettings, some for business and some for residential purposes. In such a case, section 6 as it stands might be held to give rights under the Bill to all tenants, whether business or not.  The proposed amendment makes it clear that the exemption of housing authorities from the obligations of the legislation is being preserved except where business lettings are concerned. The word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; defines the property that is the subject of the individual lettings whereas &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; is not so restricted or might be held not to be so restricted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 29 to 31 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the tenement was, during the whole of the period of three years ending at that time, continuously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant immediately before that time or of his predecessors in title and bona fide used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act the right to a new tenancy is given <i>inter alia</i> to a tenant where the tenancy is on a yearly basis at least and where the tenement has been used for business for three years by the tenant for the time being.  In the 1931 Act and this Bill the relevant part of the definition of tenant is that the person for the time being entitled to the occupation of a tenement.  On the basis that the right to a new tenancy is and was intended to apply where a tenant with his predecessors has used the property for business for three years, the qualification for the time being in section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act was dropped. Section 13 (1) (a) of the Bill as it stands refers simply to the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent comments on the Bill the Landlord and Tenant Commission recommended that the subsection be <Col N="271" /> amended to make it clear that the reference to tenant therein includes a reference to the predecessors in title of the tenant.  Moreover, apart from this recommendation of the commission, two cases have come to notice that bear meaning of that expression, the O'Neill <i>v</i> Whelan case and the Gatien Motor Company Limited <i>v</i> Continental Oil Company of Ireland Limited.  The decision in these cases raised a doubt as to the circumstances in which the right to a new tenancy arises under the relevant provision of the 1931 Act.  In particular they leave it unclear whether that right applies whenever there has been three years' business use, perhaps for a series of unrelated businesses, provided only that both business use and the tenancies of more than one have been continuous.</P>
    <P>The amendment makes it clear that, provided there has been a continuous business use for the three-year period, the right to a new tenancy applies in two kinds of cases: firstly, where an individual person or firm has been the tenant for three years, whether under one continuous tenancy or under a series of consecutive tenancies, and, secondly, where the business use has been by a tenant together with his predecessors under a single continuous tenancy.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes also to rehabilitate a requirement in the corresponding provisions in section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act in accordance with which the use for business must be bona fide.  The expression has been dropped as unnecessary, as indeed it has been dropped elsewhere in the Bill.  However, in the course of debate on this Bill in Seanad Éireann a good argument was advanced in favour of the retention of that expression in section 13 (1) (a) of the Bill.  It was pointed out by Senator Alexis FitzGerald, and later by Senator Molony, that certain premises may be used simply as accommodation addresses or may be used for a business in an occasional or almost frivolous way merely for the purpose of gaining rights under the landlord and tenant code.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the requirement of the 1931 Act that the business use should be <Col N="272" /> bona fide or genuine is a substantive requirement. On mature consideration of the argument I have come to share that view and, accordingly, the amendment proposes to restore the requirement that the business use must be bona fide.  A degree of uncertainty exists as to the intentions of the Legislature as regards section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act, that is section 13 (1) (a) of this Bill.  In the debates on the 1931 Act what was mainly under discussion was the question of the right to a new tenancy for a business tenant who had by three years' business user built up a goodwill.  It is certainly reasonable to argue that a tenant could, with his predecessors in title, build up that goodwill and thus qualify for a renewal of his tenancy.  This interpretation was implicitly adopted by the Landlord and Tenant Commission in their first report, paragraph 154, and explicitly in their recent comments, despite the apparent distinction that appears in section 19 of the 1931 Act, which refers, in section 19 (1) (a), to the &ldquo;tenant for the time being&rdquo; and in section 19 (1) (b), (c) and (d) to the &ldquo;tenant or his predecessors in title&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 18, to delete &ldquo;under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 (1) of the Bill defines a controlled dwelling as a controlled dwelling under the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960. That is the 1960 Act as amended by the 1967 Rent Act.  The reference to subsection 1 of section 15 to a controlled dwelling under the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960 denotes in the light of the definition of section 3 (1) of the Bill a dwelling whose control is under the 1960 Act apart from the 1967 Act.  This is intended to confine the scope of the provision to the scope of the corresponding Rent Act provision that is being re-enacted, that is, section 13 (1) of the 1967 Rent <Col N="274" /> Act.  However, not only is the reference to a controlled dwelling under the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960 possibly confusing, or at least confusing until the provision is carefully analysed, but it is also unnecessary.  In subsection (1) the scope of the provision extends to houses and self-contained flats that were controlled dwellings immediately before the passing of the 1967 Rent Act.  Such a dwelling could have been controlled only under the 1960 Rent Act and the inclusion in the subsection of a reference to the 1960 Act is unnecessary.  Accordingly, in order to improve the clarity of the provision the deletion of the reference to the 1960 Act is being proposed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 15 as drafted is correcting a defect in section 13 (2) of the 1967 Rent Act by relating the scope of the provision to dwellings that previously had been controlled dwellings but it goes unnecessarily far in specifying that the control similarly should have been under the 1960 Rent Act.  After the passing of the 1967 Rent Act a dwelling could only be a controlled dwelling under the 1960 Rent Act as amended by the 1967 Rent Act.  What is in question in subsection (2) is a controlled house with a rateable valuation exceeding £10 that becomes decontrolled in accordance with sections 3 (2) (1) of the 1960 Rent Restrictions Act as inserted by section 2 (4) of the 1967 Rent Act.  Such decontrol takes place if an unmarried person between 21 and 65 years becomes the tenant. Accordingly the reference in subsection (2) of section 15 of the 1960 Rent Act should be deleted since the provision is concerned only with events taking place after the passing of the 1967 Rent Act. In other words, if the dwelling in question had been a controlled dwelling under the 1960 Act before its amendment by the 1967 Act but would not be a controlled dwelling after the passing of the 1967 Rent Act, then that dwelling would already have been decontrolled.  In such a circumstance section 15 (2) of the Bill, if it were not to be amended as it is now proposed, could give special rise to a new tenancy in cases where no grounds exist for the grant of such special rights.</P>

      <P>In page 11, line 41, after &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 is the section which restricts the tenant's right to a new tenancy in certain circumstances, one of the circumstances being that the landlord intends to pull down and rebuild or reconstruct the buildings.  This is the sort of case I was talking about this morning that I thought should apply to the State as a landlord under section 4.  Section 17 (2) (a) provides that a tenant shall not be entitled to a new tenancy under this part where it appears to the court that the landlord intends or has agreed to pull down and rebuild or reconstruct the buildings or any part of the buildings included in a tenement and has obtained planning permission for the work.  We have nearly reached a stage where people have become a bit obsessed by planning permission and think that it is the evidence of anything and everything. For example if a man's land is going to <Col N="276" /> be taken from him by the Land Commission he will run in with planning permission for building and he then thinks that should frighten off the Land Commission immediately and they should accept that as conclusive evidence that he is going to build.  I do not regard planning permission as evidence of anything but the fact that the planning authority have agreed to the proposed buildings if and when they are erected.  To write it into this subsection here as a condition precedent to refusing a new tenancy is going too far.  Insisting on planning permission as a condition precedent to the refusal of a tenant's application for a new tenancy is going too far because the tenant might not have got around to applying for planning permission or indeed the planning authority might&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This is really part and parcel of the argument I am going to make anyway.  I do not believe that planning permission should be a condition precedent to the refusal of a tenant's application for a new tenancy if that application is opposed on the grounds that it is proposed to pull down and rebuild or reconstruct the premises, but it should be made clear beyond doubt that the landlord must have a bona fide intention of pulling down and reconstructing or rebuilding the premises.  I see, to write in the words &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; here as a protection and in lieu of the planning permission and if the court is satisfied that the landlord bona fide intends to pull down the building and rebuild or reconstruct it, then planning permission should not be insisted upon.  It is not necessary to go any further with the argument here.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 13 seeks to revert to the wording of the corresponding provision, section 22 of the 1931 Act where the intention of the landlord must expressly be bona fide. Amendment No. 16 would insert the expression &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; where it does not occur in the corresponding provision of the 1931 Act.  The dropping of the expression &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; in subparagraph (2) (a) (i) is a matter of drafting practice. The expression here lacks altogether the significance which it had in section 19 (1) (a) of the 1931 Act where that expression relates to the genuineness of the use of the property for a business.  The modern view is that as a drafting matter the expression &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; in section 17 (2) (a) (i) is unnecessary since the landlord's intention must be bona fide.  If it is not he will not succeed in his case.</P>
      <P>However, it is not simply a matter of indifference whether the expression is inserted or dropped.  If it is not necessary, and the view is that its insertion is not necessary, then to insert it here could raise confusion as to the construction of other provisions in the law, not by any means confined to the landlord and tenant code, that mention a person's intention without expressly mentioning that the intention should be bona fide.  It is not modern drafting practice to use that expression when it is already clear that the intention must be bona fide.  Since that is the case, to introduce it here could serve no purpose but could risk a certain amount of confusion.</P>

      <P>I am not certain of the reason for writing into the sections the planning permission requirement.  If it is as evidence of the intention of the landlord to rebuild, reconstruct or redevelop, I say it is valueless entirely.  I believe there are other provisions in the Bill to penalise the landlord or to subject him to an action for damages if he gets permission of the premises under false pretences as would be the case if he said he was going to rebuild, reconstruct or to redevelop the premises and did not do so.  I will confine myself to that remark until I hear the Minister's comments.  In my opinion the planning permission requirement is unnecessary and it should not be included.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Government amendments is to make it clear that the requirement in section 17 (2) (a) (i) and (ii) concerning planning permission is a requirement for a current unexpired planning permission and is not satisfied by a planning permission that, although valid during a period in the past, has ceased to be valid by reason of the lapse of time since the permission was granted.  Planning permission normally expires five years after the date of granting the permission&mdash;that is under section 29 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976&mdash;if the development has not been carried out within that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendments put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick would be to delete completely these requirements concerning planning permission in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of section 17 (2) (a).  Section 17 (2) (a) (i) and (ii) of the Bill re-enact the provisions of section 22 (i) (a) and (b) of the Landlord and Tenant <Col N="279" /> Act, 1931.  The Supreme Court in the case of Dolan <i>v.</i> the Corn Exchange Building Company and Vico Estates Limited, 1975, on page 315 of the report read an implied requirement to have obtained planning permission into section 22 (i) (b) of the 1931 Act.  Section 17 (2) (a) (i) and (ii), as drafted, incorporate this judgment into statute law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendments, if carried, would represent not a re-enactment of the corresponding provisions in the 1931 Act&mdash;if that is what is intended&mdash;but an actual change in the law as it stands.  Moreover it is difficult to see the point of the amendments inasmuch as the landlord must have planning permission before he can carry out the works and the deletion of the references to planning permission would not improve his position.  On the other hand, the court, where it is being asked to refuse the grant of a new tenancy on the ground that such works are proposed, could very reasonably raise the question of planning permission; that is the gist of the Supreme Court judgment that has just been mentioned and it is the basis of the express provision concerning planning permission that is now being made.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 33, 34, 36 and 37 are consequential on the above amendments. Amendments Nos. 34 and 37 are Government amendments that are consequential on Government amendments Nos. 15 and 18.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 36 are Opposition amendments that are consequential on Opposition amendments Nos. 14 and 17.  I presume the discussion incorporates all the amendments.</P>
    <P>The case for Government amendments Nos. 34 and 37 is the same as the case for Government amendments Nos. 15 and 18.  Their purpose is to make it clear that the planning requirement for a landlord's rebuilding or redevelopment plans&mdash;where that landlord is opposing the grant of a reversionary lease&mdash;is satisfied only by possession of a current valid planning permission and not by a planning permission that has lapsed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> The case against amendments Nos. 33 and 36 is the same as the case against amendments Nos. 14 and 17.  A marginal difference is that the requirement to have planning permission covering the intended rebuilding or development work is not, in the case of the landlord who is opposing the grant of a reversionary lease, covered specifically by judicial decision.  However, it is reasonable to assume that the court would come to a similar decision.  There could not, in any event, be a difference in the treatment of the case where an application for a reversionary lease is not involved as against the treatment of the case where an application for the grant of a new tenancy is involved.  Under the proposals in part 2 of the Bill a tenant may apply for and obtain the grant of a new tenancy as soon as he is qualified therefor and without awaiting the termination of his existing tenancy.  Accordingly, the time of any such application may be uncertain so far as the landlord is concerned.  Nevertheless, if the landlord has rebuilding or redevelopment plans involving a tenement whose existing tenancy still has a considerable period of time to run, it is reasonable that he should have to apply for and obtain planning permission as soon as he has formulated those plans and that he should update the planning permission as may be necessary, since so far as he, the landlord, is concerned he may at any time have to contest the tenant's claims for the grant of a new tenancy on the basis of those plans.  If the argument were to be accepted that this is onerous and that the requirement concerning planning permission should be dropped, the further consideration remains that to drop that requirement in the face of the Supreme Court judgment would be to risk introducing confusion into law.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I concede one point and that is that, of course, the landlord must obtain planning permission before he actually carries out the work.  The argument then is that if the court were to refuse a new tenancy on the basis that the landlord was going to reconstruct, rebuild or redevelop and he was then refused planning permission, he would have the vacant possession of his property and he would not have to rebuild, redevelop or reconstruct because it would be illegal for him to do so.  I would be satisfied if the Minister would have a look at the matter with a view to providing for the case where the landlord had overlooked getting planning permission to see if the proceedings could be adjourned for a reasonable time to give him an opportunity of applying for planning permission.  I suppose the court would have power to adjourn the case in any event and they probably would. That is one way around it, but I was thinking that the landlord&mdash;I have been thinking of the tenant all the way up, now I am thinking of the landlord&mdash;who finds himself confronted with an application for a new tenancy and does intend genuinely to redevelop or rebuild his property but has not obtained planning permission, would find himself without this defence to the application for a new tenancy.  I suggest that the Minister would have a look at this between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The provisions of section 20 (2) appear to be too wide because a tenant can serve notice of intention to claim relief while there are still 30 years of the lease unexpired or at the beginning of a fairly substantial leasehold term.  This could give rise to considerable problems arising out of changes of ownership in the interests of either landlord or tenant or a change of user by the tenant prior to the expiry of the lease that would have deprived the tenant of a right to a new tenancy under section 13.  I suggest that a notice of intention to claim relief should not be allowed earlier than three years before the termination of the tenancy.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide that notice of intention to claim relief may not be served earlier than 3 years before the lease of a tenancy expires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20 (2) as it stands represents one of the major policy planks of the Bill in that in contrast with the provisions of the 1931 Act it permits a tenant to apply for and obtain a grant of a new tenancy as soon as he has satisfied the conditions necessary for the granting of that new tenancy.  Under the 1931 Act a new tenancy may be obtained at or about the time of the termination of the existing tenancy.  The policy of the Bill in this regard follows on from a recommendation of the Landlord <Col N="283" /> and Tenant Commission in their first report, paragraphs 225 and 235-237. That policy has important benefits for the tenant in terms of security of tenure and consequently in terms of collateral to finance development.  The proposed amendments would represent a substantial departure from that position and it would be a change in the policy embodied in the Bill.  In addition I should point out that the amendments if accepted would mean that the provision in section 20 (2) (a) would be at variance with the provisions in the two succeeding paragraphs (b) and (c) of the subsection. In other words, a tenant coming under paragraph (a) could not apply for and obtain the grant of a new tenancy until the existing tenancy was within three years of termination.  However, a tenant under a tenancy to which paragraphs (b) or (c) of the subsection applied would remain free to apply for and obtain the grant of a new tenancy as soon as he had qualified therefor and without reference to any termination date.  Furthermore, changes elsewhere in the Bill, for example in sections 13 (1) and 16, could be involved if an amendment on these lines were to be accepted.  Since this part of the Bill is structured on the basis of a tenant's right to apply for and obtain a grant of new tenancy without reference to the date of termination of his existing tenancy, a change in section 20 (2) (a) (i), or even a series of changes to section 20, would hardly cover the kind of change sought to be made.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Instead of creating certainty this Bill creates a lot of uncertainty because it means that the tenant could serve a notice 20 or 30 years before the lease expired.  All the circumstances might be changed at the time of expiration.  The landlord might not have the funds to knock down and redevelop his property now, but in 50 years' time the circumstances might have changed and he might have acquired the funds and his intentions might be totally different.  The circumstances prevailing in or about the time of the termination <Col N="284" /> of the tenancy should determine the right to a new tenancy.  If the section stands as it is now we might as well give the tenant a lease for 999 years in the first instance.  The whole circumstances of both parties could change completely and the landlord might have valid reasons for refusing to renew the tenancy and he would have to give compensation in lieu of it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Minister's argument that if he were to accept the amendment the other two subsections would be out of line, I do not attach any weight to that because the obvious thing to do would be to amend them.  I only put forward this amendment as a basis for argument. I feel strongly about it and am convinced that my proposal is reasonable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is quite right in that this is a very definite major change.  It is a change in favour of the tenant on foot of a recommendation from the Landlord and Tenant Commission. The change has important benefits for the tenant in terms of security of tenure and certainly if he wishes to get collateral to develop it.  If I accepted the Deputy's amendment the tenant would lose out.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided here that in order to claim or be entitled to a new tenancy the tenant must serve a notice claiming a new tenancy.  The Minister has just provided in the Bill that he can do that at any time after he becomes entitled to a new <Col N="285" /> tenancy.  It is also provided in the section that he loses the right to a new tenancy if his right to a new tenancy arises from the happening of an uncertain event such as the death of some person or if it happens by the effluxion of time or on the termination of the tenancy if he does not claim that new tenancy within one month of the happening of the uncertain event.</P>
    <P>I am convinced beyond doubt that a period of one month is far too short.  If the right arises on the death of some person it might not even be known about and if it arises on the death of a near relative, for instance, it could be overlooked having regard to the trauma that accompanies such an event.  People can also be grossly careless and can overlook their right to claim a tenancy. Also, a person could be ill in hospital, or in this age of modern travel he could be at the far ends of the earth for a number of months.  My only doubt is that three months may not be long enough.  There should be a period of six months.  A period of six months is provided for elsewhere in the Bill where a person who would not but for the Bill be entitled to a new tenancy is given six months to claim it.  Will the Minister at least accept the amendment and perhaps he might put in six instead of three months?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment seeks to extend from one month to three months the period during which, following service by the landlord of notice of the termination of a tenancy, the tenant may serve notice of his claim for a new tenancy.  The corresponding provision in the 1931 Act, section 24 (2) (b), requires the tenant to serve notice of his claim at least three months before the termination of his existing tenancy.  The proposal in the Bill extends that time up to one month after service of the landlord's notice.  This is already a considerable change in favour of the tenant, since if the landlord has not served his notice of termination the tenant's right to serve his claim continues whether or not termination has already occurred.  The proposals in the <Col N="286" /> Bill would enable a tenant to serve his notice of claim at any time, perhaps long before the termination of the existing tenancy.  This is also a considerable change in favour of tenants.  A tenant who nevertheless does not initiate proceedings to obtain a new tenancy until the existing tenancy has almost run out is still protected inasmuch as he may validly initiate those proceedings up to one month after the service of the landlord's notice of termination.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Landlord and Tenant Commission in their first report were concerned in a number of recommendations to shorten the time limits provided in the 1931 Act so as to speed up the various procedures.  These recommendations are embodied in the proposals in the Bill.  The commission recently furnished their comments on these proposals and endorsed the policy of speeding up the procedures I have mentioned.  I believe that to grant an extension of the time limit as proposed in the amendment would raise an argument for similar or even greater extensions elsewhere in the Bill which would completely undermine the policy of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Attention may be drawn to the proposals contained in section 78 under which provision is made for the grant by the court of an extension of time in every case, unless injustice would be caused, provided the failure to observe the time limit arose from any reasonable cause. There is a convincing argument in favour of maintaining the position in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am sorry that I cannot accept the Minister's argument.  I am aware of section 78 but I believe that a period of one month from the service of a notice to quit or the death of a person is too short.  People do not always act as quickly as they should and a much longer period than one month could elapse before the lessee gets around to thinking about his position, consulting a solicitor and the service of a notice by the solicitor.  I may have put down an amendment in regard to one paragraph <Col N="287" /> but of course I mean the amendment to cover all the cases where notice is necessary.  There could be carelessness involved or the tenant or his solicitor could be out of the country.</P>
      <P>Section 78 foresees all this and states:</P>
      <P>Where a person fails to do any act or thing in the time provided for by or under this Act, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks proper (and shall unless satisfied that injustice would be caused) extend the time where it is shown that the failure was occasioned by disability, mistake, absence from the State, inability to obtain requisite information or any other reasonable cause.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Minister, I think section 78 is an argument for giving reasonable time in the first instance rather than providing for this short period of one month, thereby putting people to the expense of making a special application to the court and cluttering up court files with unnecessary applications of this sort.  The reasonable approach is to provide the time of three or six months in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Section 20 (2) (d) states:</P>
      <P>in the case of a tenancy to which section 29 applies&mdash;within six months after the commencement of this Act.</P>
      <P>I agree that this is a once-off operation where a lot of applications would be made, but at the same time there is provision for six months.  Section 78 will apply there and the six months could be extended to ten years if it were thought necessary.</P>
      <P>The period three months used to be a nightmare and a solicitor invariably told the tenant to make a note of it and remind him because the solicitor would not want that responsibility.  The period of one month is too short and it will be extended automatically because of the provisions of section 78.  The Minister may take it that, unless the Judiciary are changed, judges will extend the time as a matter of course but people will be put to expense and trouble.</P>

I am prepared to do everything possible to go more than half way to meet the Deputy if he withdraws his amendment.</P>

    <P>These are two drafting amendments.  The time limits set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (2) are in all cases the later time limits for service of a notice of intention to claim relief.  No early time limits are prescribed since it is <Col N="290" /> the intention that an applicant may serve that notice as soon as he wishes to do so. However, it has been represented to me by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland that paragraphs (b) and (c) restrict the times for claiming a new tenancy to the periods after service of the landlord's notice.  Although this is not what is intended, it is a possible reading of those provisions as they stand.  The amendments are, accordingly, being proposed so as to clarify the meaning of those provisions.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Did the Minister bear in mind what the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland said in relation to this?  They pointed out that there was an anomaly in relation to tenancies which do not terminate by the effluxion of time or the happening of a particular event, namely, yearly, quarterly, monthly or weekly tenancies.  Although these tenancies may enjoy the protection of Part II of the Bill such tenants cannot claim a new tenancy unless and until notice to quit is served.  The committee of the society supported the recommendation of the Landlord and Tenant Commission that such tenants should be given a right to apply for and serve notice of intention to claim relief.  Has the Minister made provision for that?</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 44, to delete &ldquo;is or&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;and the tenant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is purely a drafting amendment. The subsection represents the re-enactment of subsection (5) of section 28 of the 1931 Act.  In that re-enactment a reference to the tenant was omitted in this Bill on the basis that the reference to person or persons already includes a reference to the tenant.  However, such a reading raises a difficulty about the interpretation of the word &ldquo;respectively&rdquo; where the word occurred in these subsections. In addition, the restoration of the reference to &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; makes for easier reading of the provision.  The insertion of a reference to the tenant enables the subsection to be read lucidly in the context of section 22, subsection (4).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> In page 15, line 6, after &ldquo;rent&rdquo; where it secondly occurs to insert &ldquo;at the date of the commencement of the new tenancy if the application to the court is contemporaneous with or after the commencement of the new tenancy or at the date of the hearing or such earlier date as may be stipulated by the Court if the application to the Court pre-dates the commencement of the tenancy.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I move this amendment because I do not consider it clear from the section what date should be taken by the courts for the assessment of the gross rent and for any allowance for improvements.  It is suggested that, having regard to the continuing inflation, an appropriate date should be stipulated so that the court will not be faced with the almost impossible task of trying to assess a rent for a new tenancy commencing two or three years later.  It is submitted that this should be whichever of the following is appropriate. If the application to the court is contemporaneous with or is after the commencement of the tenancy, the rent should be the rent prevailing at the date of the commencement of the new tenancy.  If the application pre-dates by several years, as may well happen, the commencement of the tenancy, the rent should be assessed by reference to the date of the hearing or such earlier date as may be stipulated by the court.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that after &ldquo;rent&rdquo;, where it occurs secondly, to insert &ldquo;at the date of the commencement of the new tenancy if the applications to the court is contemporaneous with or after the commencement of the new tenancy or at the date of the hearing or such earlier date as may be stipulated by the court, if the application to the court pre-dates the commencement of the tenancy&rdquo;.  I am told that after much consideration it is considered necessary that this amendment is necessary because otherwise the court would be faced with an impossible situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the amendment, if agreed to, would bring <Col N="293" /> about two changes which would have very serious consequences.</P>
      <P>The first of these changes concerns the case where the court is fixing the term of a new tenancy at some date subsequent to the termination of the previous tenancy, that is to say, at some date subsequent to the date for which the new tenancy is to commence.  This could happen under the provisions of section 20 of the Bill in certain cases or again, for example, under the provisions of section 22.  In such a case the amendment seeks to have the gross rent determined by reference to the date of that commencement instead of having the court take the current gross rent.  What this implies is that if rents were tending to rise and if some significant period of time were involved as between the date of commencement of the new tenancy and the date of the hearing, the tenant would stand to gain to the extent that that historic gross rent could be less than the current gross rent, so that at least until the first review of rent came to be made the rent payable under the new tenancy, which falls to be calculated partly on the basis of the gross rent, could be less than it might otherwise be.</P>
      <P>The argument for this kind of change could be that, where the terms of the new tenancy have to be back-dated, as it were, though being fixed in arrear, the rent should be calculated by reference to that past date instead of to a current date when that rent might work out at a rather higher figure.  However, the benefit of this kind of change is likely to be quite marginal since the time span involved is likely to be a year or so at most in the usual type of case where this situation would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there are objections to a change of this kind and the objections well outweigh the benefits.  In the first place, such a provision would add a further complication to a court of law which we are concerned to simplify and would do so for a marginal benefit only. In the second place, apart from the complications of such a provision there could be difficulties in applying it.  The ascertainment of the current gross rent of a <Col N="294" /> property is one matter.  To require the parties concerned in effect to equip themselves in respect of a further matter, that is the calculation of a historic gross rent, could be burdensome and expensive.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the tenant, under the proposals in this Bill, is being given the considerable concession of being able to obtain the grant of a new tenancy even after his previous tenancy has terminated, if the landlord has failed to notify him of that termination.  It is hardly reasonable to give that tenant the further concession of a historic gross rent.</P>
    <P>The second change that the amendment seeks to bring about concerns the case where the court is fixing the terms of the new tenancy at a date prior to the date of the commencement of the new tenancy.  In such a case the amendment would give the court a discretion to fix the rent either by a reference to the current gross rent or by reference to the gross rent as it could have been at some date in the past.  There is not proposed to be given to the court any indication as to the basis on which it might exercise that discretion.  There would not be any indication given to it as to what date in the past might be chosen for the historic gross rent, whether a recent date or a date in the distant past.  There is not evidence of any ground for fixing, in any circumstances, a historic gross rent in relation to a tenancy that is not to commence until a further date.  For these reasons and because the objections to the amendment outweigh by far any benefits that might accrue if the amendment were accepted, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There are a few questions I wish to ask the Minister in order to assure myself that I understand the position clearly.  Am I right in thinking that the rent might be fixed 20 years before the expiration of an old lease and the beginning of a new lease?  Am I also right in thinking that all these leases will provide for five-yearly revisions of the rent?  Could it happen that there would <Col N="295" /> be three or four revision of the old rent subsequent to the fixing of the new rent and that at the expiration of the old lease, there would be a situation where the rent of the old lease might be far more than the rent of the new lease and that until the first revision of the new lease, the tenant would be paying a far lower rent for the new lease than he was paying for the old lease?  I imagine that would be rectified on the first revision.  Is that the position?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; is the basis on which the rent to be reserved under either a new occupational tenancy or a reversionary lease falls to be calculated.  The grant of a new tenancy is provided for in Part II of the Bill and the grant of a reversionary lease in Part III.  The formula for determining the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; in relation to a new occupational tenancy is set out in section 29 <i>(f)</i> of the 1931 Act. This formula was considered by the Landlord and Tenant commission and in their first report, paragraphs 266 to 268 they recorded their conclusions.  The commission recommended one change in the formula and that change is proposed in the Bill: this change permits a comparison to be made with the rents of similar tenements, whether or not those tenements are in the same vicinity, so long as they are in a comparable area. Apart from that, however, the commission, while accepting that certain criticisms of the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula were well founded, considered that except in a period of continuing inflation it <Col N="298" /> had been possible to work the formula reasonably satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>On 28 July 1977 in the course of its judgment in Byrne <i>v.</i> Loftus&mdash;that case is unreported as yet&mdash;the Supreme Court commented unfavourably on the provisions of section 29 <i>(f)</i> of the 1931 Act.  Arising out of this judgment, the question of the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula was referred to the Landlord and Tenant Commission for re-examination.  This re-examination was still in progress at the time the Bill was before Seanad Éireann. In consequence, although the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula came under criticism also in that House, the Minister of State was not at that time in a position to introduce any amendment to meet those criticisms.</P>
    <P>The views of the Landlord and Tenant Commission have since been received arising out of their re-examination of the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula.  The burden of their findings is that the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; formula should be revised so that &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; would mean in effect the open market rent of the property, less the value of the tenant's goodwill.  The rent to be fixed on the grant of a new occupational tenancy should accordingly be that gross rent, less any further allowance for improvements carried out by the tenant that would qualify for compensation for improvements under Part IV of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment I am proposing is designed to give effect to the findings of the commission.  It also meets the criticism of the 1931 Act provisions that was made in the Supreme Court judgment in so far as that criticism is relevant to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 40 proposes a corresponding change in the definition of &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo; where that definition appears&mdash;in a somewhat different form, in section 36 (1) of the Bill&mdash;as part of the provisions for the determination of the rent in a reversionary lease granted under Part III of the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That phrase has been in the legislation since 1931, as the Minister has said, and I was never too clear as to what exactly it meant.  I should not like to think that its removal from the Act would leave the way open to what I would call a black market where if there was a great scarcity of houses in a town there would be what the Minister has called an open market and where scarce commodity prices would obtain.  I do not think that would be desirable.</P>
      <P>Let us take Navan as an example. There is an influx of people because of the mines and houses could become virtually unobtainable.  That is the danger that would prevail with this provision gone from the Bill.  I was never too clear about what it meant but it seems to me to be an indication to the courts to disregard impossibility to get houses.  We should be very careful.  I am afraid we are doing what I fear because the provision would then read:</P>
      <P>The gross rent shall be the rent which in the opinion of the Court a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the tenement, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to other terms of the tenancy and to the letting value of tenements of a similar character to the tenement, and situated in a comparable area, without regard to any goodwill which may exist in respect of the tenement.</P>
      <P>That leaves the door open to the fixing of grossly excessive rents where the population of a town is increasing or where a town is developing but where house building is not keeping pace with the development of the town or the increase in the population.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.  It would be our intention and that of the House to rectify a situation brought to our attention by the Supreme Court.  I assure the Deputy about that.  In the Byrne v Loftus case, which is unreported so far, Mr. Justice Kenny said:</P>
      <P>Rarely can a draftsman have produced such an ill-framed paragraph.  It contains an economic absurdity and a phrase &ldquo;a willing lessor&rdquo; whose literal meaning makes nonsense of the paragraph.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;economic absurdity&rdquo; to which Mr. Justice Kenny refers is the phrase which it is proposed to delete from section 23 (5).  It was made clear later in his judgment that Mr. Justice Kenny was criticising that phrase in the context of the 1931 Act provision for renewed occupational leases of 21 to 99 years without rent reviews, his point being that a lessor would not willingly enter into such an arrangement.  The criticism does not invalidate the retention of that phrase in a Bill that provides for rent reviews.</P>
      <P>I have already given the background to the necessity for the amendment.  I will consider carefully what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said that we may be creating other problems by doing what we are doing now.  I will have it examined in great detail before Report Stage.</P>

It probably got on Mr. Justice Kenny's nerves as it got on mine.  Whatever it does not mean, it lays down clearly that the court is not to have regard to the scarcity of houses.

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 42 and 43, to delete &ldquo;the commencement of the tenancy&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the date on which the terms were fixed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 24 (1), as it stands, is open to the objection&mdash;indeed the objection has been raised&mdash;that, where the terms of a new tenancy have been fixed somewhat longer than five years prior to the termination of the existing tenancy, the first review of rent under that new tenancy is not obtainable until after five years of the term of the new tenancy have expired. That means that almost ten years could elapse before the rent could be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Under the proposals in Part II of the Bill an occupational tenant may apply for and obtain the grant of a new tenancy as soon as he satisfies the necessary conditions for the grant of that new tenancy regardless of the date of the expiration of his existing tenancy.  Accordingly, the grant of that new tenancy might be obtained just under five years short of that expiration, and the new tenancy would not accordingly become subject to rent review until almost ten years had elapsed from the time its term were fixed.  This is not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment of paragraph (a) of section 24 (1), by relating the five year review periods to the date the terms of the new tenancy are fixed instead of to the date of commencement of the new tenancy, ensures that a <Col N="302" /> rent review will always be obtainable by either the landlord or the tenant as soon as five years have elapsed, regardless of the date of that commencement.</P>
    <P>The amendments affecting paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 24 (1) are consequential on the amendment proposed in paragraph (a).  Since under paragraph (a), as proposed to be amended, taken together with the provisions in paragraph (c), a review of the rent will always be obtainable after five years have elapsed from the time the terms of the new tenancy are fixed&mdash;or from the time of the preceeding review of the rent&mdash;the provision in paragraph (b) becomes unnecessary and that paragraph is proposed to be deleted. Where, for example, either the terms of the new tenancy or the first review of rent are settled a little less than five years before the commencement of that new tenancy, the first or second review of rent, as the case may be, is obtainable very shortly after that commencement. The change affecting paragraph (c) is simply a consequential change arising from the deletion of paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>I understand that amendment No. 28 in the name of Deputy Fitzpatrick has a purpose similar to that of amendment No. 27, in that it would seek to relate the five-yearly review periods, not to the commencement of the tenancy, but to the time by reference to which the rent is fixed initially.  As a matter of wording, it appears to have been framed by reference to the change that is sought to be made in section 23 of the Bill by amendment No. 25.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 16, to delete lines 1 to 4 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In default of agreement, the rent fixed upon such review shall become payable on whichever of the following dates is the later&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the first gale day after service of the notice of intention to apply for the review, or</P>
      <P>(b) (i) where the rent has not previously been reviewed, the first gale day following the review,</P>
      <P>(ii) where the rent has previously been reviewed, five years after the first gale day following the previous review.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  In the first place, the amendment proposes to delete the references in the subsection, as it stands, to the date for commencing payment of a reviewed rent where that review is settled by agreement between the parties.  It is not appropriate that the legislation should prescribe any such date.  Where the parties are settling matters by agreement they should be left free to do so.  Just as section 23 of the Bill <Col N="304" /> provides for the fixing of the terms of the new tenancy&mdash;but only where the court is being asked to do so and where the parties cannot agree&mdash;so in section 24 provision need be made, and should be made, only for review of the rent where the parties themselves cannot agree.</P>
    <P>In the second place, the amendment is designed to eliminate any doubt as to the meaning of the expression &ldquo;the relevant period&rdquo;, in the subsection as it stands, in the light of the circumstances that reviews of the rent may take place at any time after the expiration of five years from the date on which the terms of the tenancy were fixed, or from the date of any subsequent review of rent and need not necessarily take place once in every such five-year period.</P>
    <P>For example, it could happen that neither landlord nor tenant takes any action in regard to a rent review until, let us say, almost ten years have elapsed, instead of five years.  In consequence, the notice of intention to apply for a review of rent that is required to be served under subsection (2) of the section is not served until sometime during the tenth year instead of, as might have been the case, sometime during the fifth year.  In accordance with subsection (4) of the section, as it stands in the Bill, the reviewed rent is, accordingly, payable only from the first gale day, following service of that notice under subsection (2), which in this example, would be from about the beginning of the eleventh year&mdash;that is, the first rent review becomes effective only in the third five-year period instead of, as might have been arranged, during the second five-year period.</P>
    <P>Now let us further suppose that the next notice under subsection (2) is given in good time&mdash;let us suppose it is given very early in the course of the third five-year period, say during the eleventh year. In accordance with subsection (1) of the section, the second review cannot take place until after five years have elapsed following the previous rent review, however prompt the notice of that review.  That is, this second review cannot take place until during perhaps the <Col N="305" /> sixteenth year.  It is in such a case that the question could become perplexing: what is the relevant period?  Is it the commencement of the third five-year period, counting from the beginning?  Or is it the five-year period counting from the previous review which, in the example I have taken, did not take place until the ninth year or thereabouts?</P>
    <P>Depending on the circumstances of the case, &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; in section 24 (4), as it stands, could mean each five-year period of the term of the new tenancy, or each five-year period counting from the date the terms of the new tenancy are fixed, or the period of five years since the preceding rent review.  Clearly, it would be unsatisfactory to leave the provision open to this kind of misunderstanding.  The proposed amendment is designed to eliminate any such problems by making it clear from just what gale day the reviewed rent is payable, whatever the date of the review.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i>): Subsection (4) is being deleted and this is the new subsection (4).  Under subsection (4) (b) (ii) where the rent has been reviewed previously, five years after the first gale day following the previous review, if this were the case of a long lease and the landlord reviewed after the first five years and then let 20 years elapse before he made another application to the court for a review, the new rent would then be payable retrospectively for 15 years.  I think that is so.  If it is, it could impose a considerable hardship on the tenant.  It is complicated.  My case is where the rent has been reviewed previously.  It is a lease for 50 years from this year.  It is reviewed after the first five years and then it is not reviewed for another 20 years.  Therefore, there are 15 years payable at the rate of the first reviewed rent, but the new rent is to be payable five years after the first gale day following the previous review.  Surely that would be paid retrospectively for 15 years.  Does the Minister agree with that?</P>

      <P>That is correct.  This section represents a re-enactment of section 39 of the 1931 Act.  However, as a matter of drafting, the wording of the provision follows the modern form of wording of such provisions, such as section 9 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1931, section 13 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978, instead of the wording of the 1931 Act provision. While the reference in the 1931 Act provision to the passing of that Act becomes a reference to the commencement of the present legislation, in accordance with section 20 (2) (d) of the Bill, corresponding to section 24 (2) (d) of the 1931 Act, tenants coming within the scope of this provision may lodge a claim for a new tenancy under Part II within six months of the commencement of the new Act.  Therefore, tenants whose tenancies terminated before the commencement of the new Act but who nevertheless are still in possession&mdash;although without having obtained a new tenancy&mdash;may benefit under the provision in two types of cases, the first, where the right to the new tenancy is being given for the first time, that is, under section 13 (1) (b) of this Bill and, secondly, where the tenant previously had a right to a new tenancy under Part III of the 1931 Act but failed to serve the necessary notice in time&mdash;section 24 (1) and (2) of the 1931 Act which we have just been talking about.  As regards the second type of case, it may be noted that under the proposals in the Bill tenants are being protected against inadvertently losing the right to a new tenancy, to losing sight of the need to claim a new tenancy in time.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The provisions of subsection (5) contrast with section 45 (2) of the 1977 Bill.  The present Bill appears to exclude the award of damages where the order was obtained by misrepresentation or concealment of material facts.  It is not clear why such an exclusion should be allowed and it is submitted that the section should be suitably amended.  Under the previous Bill if a land person&mdash;we will have to talk about land persons instead of landlords&mdash;got possession by misrepresentation or by concealment of material facts he was liable to damages.  Apparently under this Bill that right to damages is being taken <Col N="310" /> away.  It would be more important to leave that provision in than to insist on planning permission.</P>

      <P>Section 33 (5) is a new provision to replace section 15 (3) of the 1958 Act.  Section 15 (3) of the 1958 Act makes it an offence, carrying liability of a fine up to £500, where a person who successfully objected to the granting of a reversionary lease failed within a reasonable time to carry out any intention on account of which the lease was refused.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission in their first report recommended that the corresponding provisions in section 22 of the 1931 Act dealing with the grounds on which the grant of a new tenancy under Part III of the 1931 Act may be refused should be amended so as to entitle the tenant to recover compensation from his landlord where the intention was not carried out.  The Bill provides for punitive damages against the person who obtained refusal of the grant of a new tenancy under Part II but fails to carry out the intention, agreement or purpose on account of which the refusal was made.  Subsection (5) proposes a similar provision in relation to obtaining refusal of the grant of a reversionary lease.</P>

The lapsed Bill as it would have been amended if the official amendment had gone through would have been <Col N="311" /> completely in line with section 33 (5).  In subsection (5) the court has discretion as to the damages it can award and so may take into account the circumstances that the lessor offered or failed to offer a reversionary lease as soon as he became unable to proceed with his development, if honest inability was the reason.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 55 and 56 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The lease shall be for a term expiring ninety-nine years after the expiration of the lease to which it is reversionary.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Under Part III a reversionary lease may in certain circumstances be applied for and obtained after the expiration of the previous lease&mdash;for example, when the landlords notice of expiration of the previous lease is served after that lease has expired.  Section 32 (4) of the Bill, as it stands, may be unclear, that is, it might be held that in such a case section 34 (1) of the Bill means that the reversionary lease is to expire, not 99 years after the expiration of the previous lease but 99 years after the date it is granted.  Accordingly, the amendment clarifies that the reversionary lease shall be for a term expiring 99 years after the expiration of the previous lease.  This provision re-enacts the provisions of section 18 (2) of the 1958 Reversionary Leases Act.  No change in the substance of section 18 (2) is, or was, intended.  This is truly a drafting amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 14, after &ldquo;fire&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for their full reinstatement value or their full market value at the option of the lessor&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 34 (6) says:</P>
      <P>If the Court fixes the covenants of the lease, the lessee shall be made liable to pay all rates and taxes in respect of the land and to insure against fire and keep the premises in repair.</P>
      <P>My amendment is in regard to insurance. This subsection merely says &ldquo;and to insure against fire&rdquo;; it does not say in what amount.  There is no direction as to whether it is to be for the market value of the premises or for the reinstatement value of the premises.  There are very often long and cantankerous arguments on things like that.  My amendment seeks to insert after the word &ldquo;fire&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;for their full reinstatement value or their full market value at the option of the lessor&rdquo;.  Certainly, whichever formula is accepted, there is no doubt that the subsection needs clarification.  It is unsatisfactory merely to provide&mdash;as is provided in subsection (6) of section 34&mdash;that the lessee is to be obliged to insure against fire without stipulating the amount.  I know it would not be possible in a Bill to write in the amount, but it is possible to provide a yardstick, and the usual yardstick is to say &ldquo;for their full replacement value or their full market value&rdquo;.  Indeed, it might be advisable to move in accordance with modern thinking on insurance and to provide for the index-linking of the policy.  Perhaps that is going too far, but certainly we should say whether we want the lessee to insure for the reinstatement value or the market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the relevant provisions in section 34 (6) of the Bill is to provide that, in default of agreement by the parties, the covenants in the lease will include covenants to insure against fire and to keep in repair.  I <Col N="314" /> am advised that it would not be proper for the statute to set out the details of these covenants or indeed of any other covenants.  Under the insurance covenant the duty of the lessee is to insure against his liability under the general law and against his liability under the terms of the lease.  To include in the statutory provisions any reference to insurance for market value or to insurance on some other kind of basis could be not only irrelevant but confusing.  Under the general law, the Accidental Fires Act of 1943 could, for example, have a bearing on the lessee's liability.</P>
      <P>Again, the other terms of the lease may themselves indicate what kind of insurance is required to comply with the covenant to insure, and where the court is settling the matter it will certainly do so having regard to the general terms of the lease.  Apart from those other terms, the insurance liability of the lessee is a liability to insure against whatever damage the lessor might suffer in consequence of a fire and, depending on the case, this may have no relationship to either market value or reinstatement value.  As far as the lessee's obligation under the reinstatement value is concerned, it would be extremely difficult, for example, in the case of damage to a period building constructed of material not now readily available.  I am advised that what is in the Bill is more than sufficient to cover the situation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I think this is too vague. Here we are directing the court to covenants that are to be written into the Bill. We say that, if the court fixes the covenant of the lease, the lessee shall be made liable to pay all rates&mdash;I understand that&mdash;and taxes in regard to the land. That is clear.  The tenant will have to pay all rates if rates are payable and all taxes payable on the lands.  But, in regard to insuring against fire, surely to goodness <Col N="315" /> the extent of the insurance should be stated?  One person might argue to the judge that it should be the full market value of the premises for the time being. Somebody else might argue that it should be the reinstatement value, that it is reinstatement with which we are concerned. It should be a comparatively simple matter arriving at whether we mean reinstatement or market value.  It is inviting confusion not to do so.  I do not accept the argument that the Minister has been given.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To keep the premises in repair&rdquo;&mdash;that is a loose phrase also.  This would probably be interpreted as to keep the premises in repair, both exterior and interior.  We all know that there is a distinction drawn very often between structural repair and non-structural repair, between interior and exterior repair. Those two things need to be clarified. Anybody would require a direction, or a guideline, in regard to insurance because there are certainly two different standards of insurance, either replacement value or market value.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that matter before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement to insure against fire is a requirement to insure against such losses as the lessor may suffer.  It is a covenant in the lease that is in question, not a term in an insurance context, as such.  The lessor's loss to be insured against has no necessary relationship to reinstatement value or market value.</P>
      <P>I take the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  We did have consultations with the draftsman to see if he was satisfied with it as it is, and he was satisfied.  However, I am quite prepared to go back for further discussions and, if the Deputy likes, we can raise the matter again on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that there are about 60,000 acres of bogland in course of development at present by the board.  This is an increase of almost 50 per cent on the area already in production.  The total of approximately 200,000 acres now acquired or in course of acquisition by the board includes all the large bog areas in the midlands and many other smaller bogs.  The board's third development programme provides for the production of an additional 2.75 million tonnes of milled peat to be used for electricity generation and the manufacture of briquettes in two new briquette factories; an additional 32,000 tonnes of sod peat and 650,000 cubic metres of moss peat.  This represents an increase of about 75 per cent on current production.  Bord na Móna are continuously reviewing their development plans in the light of data available from their surveys with a view to including all <Col N="319" /> bogland which can be developed for fuel production on an economically viable basis.  Virtually all such bogland has already been identified.  Most of the remaining bog area is comprised of shallow bog in the western part of the country where unfavourable conditions such as peat depth, terrain and climate militate against peat production on a commercial scale.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Central Development Committee have initiated an investigation into the problems of turf production in the west and that the investigation is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the National Board for Science and Technology have applied to the EEC for aid towards a project to develop peat harvesting machinery for use on smaller bogs where at present harvesting is unmechanised and costly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite right, although I understand how the Deputy may have got that impression.  It is 60,000 acres in course of development and 200,000 acres now acquired or in course of acquisition.  The Deputy will understand that the major portion on which Bord na Móna are and have been working is not included in either of those figures because one is in course of development and the other in course of acquisition.</P>

What is outstanding may well be commercially viable with the aid of new machinery, which I referred to in my reply and for which aid is being sought from the EEC&mdash;light machinery suitable for use on small and heretofore uneconomic bogland.

      <P>Apart from a scheme administered by my Department which is confined to the development and maintenance of roads for access to bogs, which are supplying turf to certain ESB generating stations, my Department do not have any function in this matter.  The Deputy has referred to the fact that local authorities receive money from the Department of the Environment under broad headings which enable them to provide money for the purpose he suggests.  Considerable extra money was provided under this heading last year but few, if any, local authorities provided any money for the purpose suggested by the Deputy.  The local authorities, having received extra money, could have chosen if they wished, to devote it to the purpose now recommended by the Deputy.  They chose instead to devote it to other purposes. That suggests that the local authorities do not regard this matter as one of top priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position in Ballyshannon is that space has been allocated for an extra turbine on the Erne.  The general opinion seems to be that there is not enough water available to install an extra turbine.  Would the Minister explain this?  I understand that the level of the water behind the turbines only falls by one foot, that there are hundreds of feet of water and plenty of water available.  Is it not a fact that the Government will not allocate the money to erect this extra turbine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The ESB have said that the total flow of the River Erne is fully utilised by the existing two turbines and a further unit would, therefore, be incapable of providing additional electrical energy in substitution for that, for example, derived from imported oil or something like that.  The value of installing another turbine, if one were to be installed, would be to increase the board's total installed capacity and thereby help them in meeting peak demand.  There would be no addition to the base load but there would be an addition to the capacity to meet the peak demand.  In fact, that could result in a certain reduction in the contribution to the base load from Ballyshannon.  Heretofore, the addition of another turbine for the purpose of dealing with the peak load has not been economical.  But it has been kept consistently under review so that, if it does become economical, it will be done. That is probably why the Deputy says there is a space left there for the installation of this turbine.</P>

      <P>There are a number of questions, including the methods and costs of administration, which must be reviewed before a decision can be taken.</P>
      <P>I might add that, at least in the case of &ldquo;first-phase&rdquo; insulation, that is, where there is no existing insulation, the cost of providing a reasonable degree of lagging and so on can be recovered through energy saving in a short period of time. The case for incentives of a financial nature is, therefore, in certain categories not compelling.  Information on the savings that can be achieved by insulation is readily available from a number of sources including my Department and the IIRS.</P>

I also pointed out that, while these grants had the effect of switching demand from imported oil to solid fuel, they did not have the effect of reducing the amount of energy consumed and in fact in many cases people were switching from oil&mdash;which is desirable&mdash;to imported coal.  For that reason I have never been fully convinced of the efficacy of these schemes and would hope to produce proposals which would be more effective so far as energy savings are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth in demand for briquettes has been such that for some time the production capacity of Bord na Móna's three briquetting factories, which is 360,000 tonnes per annum, has been insufficient to cope with the demand.</P>

      <Col N="328" /> Bog development operations and plant design are in progress to provide for the production of an additional 260,000 tonnes of briquettes per annum from a factory based on the Derryfadda group of bogs in Counties Galway and Roscommon.  This factory is scheduled to commence production in 1984.

At 317,065 tonnes, it was a reduction of just over 10 per cent on the previous year's figures and this was attributable to the shortfall in the production target.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that at the meeting of the European Council in Dublin on 29-30 November last the Commission proposed certain modifications to the financial mechanism.  If these modifications were accepted Britain would get a net refund of 520m EUA&mdash;£350 million.  The European Council agreed that this Commission proposal could form a useful basis for a solution.</P>
      <P>The Commission was also asked to submit proposals for additional expenditure measures in the UK.  The Commission submitted a paper to the Council of Ministers on 5 February 1980 and this paper is under discussion by the Council.  The paper, a copy of which is available in the Dáil Library, suggests that additional expenditure measures for the UK could cover such areas as coal exploitation, transport infrastructure and urban renewal.  Furthermore, on the general question of convergence, the Commission suggests ways of assisting regions and zones in the less prosperous member states.  Following consideration of these proposals by the Council of Foreign Ministers and of Finance Ministers, they will be discussed by the European Council at its next meeting at present scheduled for 31 March-1 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general the Government consider it desirable in the interests of the Community that a solution to the British budgetary problem be reached as soon as possible.  Any such solution must, in <Col N="333" /> our view, be consistent with Community principles and, in particular, must not infringe the principle of <i>own resources</i> nor introduce the principle of juste retour.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland's principal objective in seeking a solution to this problem will be to ensure that our position is not adversely affected and that any solution agreed is consistent with the promotion of convergence of the economies of the member states which is the context in which this matter is being discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the matter has not been fully resolved as yet but I should like the Minister to tell the House how he thinks a solution could be found that will (a) allow a reduction in the UK contribution and (b) not have the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing our contribution.  In that context how would the Minister explain such a solution in the context of our commitment to the principle of convergence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our very strong case and position, which is the same as that of Italy, is that countries with a lower GNP than the UK, as is the case with Ireland and Italy, should not be penalised in any way.  Any benefit that the UK may obtain from its proposals in this direction should not in any way adversely affect those countries who have a lower GNP. Britain is seventh in the GNP league and Italy and Ireland are eighth and ninth. That has been our approach to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

In the context of the offer to Britain of £350 million at the Dublin Summit or in the context of the present suggestion, will the Minister explain how the matter can be finalised without Ireland, either directly or indirectly, having to make an increased contribution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Through either the Ortoli facility or through an increase in regional aid we would hope to be more than compensated for any contribution <Col N="334" /> increase that might arise.  This is the way we are thinking.  Our approach in principle has been accepted by the Commission because it is absolutely rational that the two countries I mentioned&mdash;Italy and Ireland&mdash;should not in any way be prejudiced because of a concession given to the UK.  Any concession to the UK will have to be carried by the more prosperous countries within the Community.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 21 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, together with other Heads of Government, has received a message from the President of the United States, regarding the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>A reply to President Carter's message is being kept under careful consideration by the Government.  The matter has been considered by the Foreign Ministers of the Nine on three recent occasions with a view to seeing whether a common policy can be arrived at, and at our recent meeting on 19 February it was decided that we should continue with these consultations.  Ireland has of course made clear its position of principle on the substantive issues involved in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by stressing, both bilaterally to the USSR and in statements made by the Foreign Ministers of the Nine, our serious concern at the Soviet action which amounts to a flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>I have had no contact formal or informal with Lord Killanin, Chairperson of the International Olympic Committee, in relation to the proposed boycott of the Moscow Olympics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give an indication in response to the questions on the Order Paper, what is the Government's attitude to the call for a boycott?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our attitude in regard to that matter is the same as the attitude of a number of our EEC partners and it is this: at present there is no need to make a definitive decision.  There is a deadline of 24 May before the specific application to compete in the games must be received by the Moscow authorities.  At their meeting on Tuesday all of the Community countries, including Ireland, agreed to reserve our position for the time being to see whether there would be any cooling of the situation in Afghanistan.  As a contribution towards inching forward towards some peace in <Col N="341" /> that country we as a Community put forward a proposal unanimously to introduce in effect neutralisation of Afghanistan and to have Afghanistan's neutral status guaranteed by neighbouring countries and by the United Nations. We have set up a committee of experts to examine the ways and means by which that could be done.  I understand that the US Government are interested in some progress along these lines.  This initiative has been taken to fill a political vacuum in Afghanistan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a TASS Report this morning and it is the first reaction, but we hope that we can work towards some solution along those lines.  It is interesting to note that 25 years ago almost to the day a similar solution was reached in Austria when the Russian forces withdrew from there.  Austria still remains in a state of neutrality with the guarantees of the four major powers of the Soviet Union, US, France and Britain.</P>
      <P>Something along those lines is what is envisaged and we hope to see some progress.  The Community, including ourselves, would prefer a more gradual response to what has happened in Afghanistan, because it is important to preserve detente.  We do not believe in any heavy response at this stage.  A cooling down period is what is needed.  If there were evidence of bona fide on the part of Russia in Afghanistan, there would be a new situation.  Another new situation would be created if a large number of countries follow the lead taken by the United States since yesterday by recommending a boycott of the games to their national Olympic authorities.  In that situation the games would be a futile exercise because a great part of the world would have refused to take part in them.  At this stage these are all imponderables and all the Community countries take the view that we should reserve our decision and await developments especially since there is no need to come to a definitive conclusion before 24 May.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to set up a legal structure whereby exclusive proprietary rights, and protection of those rights against infringement, can be afforded to plant breeders, Irish or foreign, in respect of new plant varieties which they have created.</P>
      <P>The concept of plant breeders' rights has been well established for many years in Europe and indeed in many other parts of the world where the breeding of new varieties of botanical species is carried on, for example, in the USA, New Zealand, South Africa, Japan.</P>
      <P>The creation of new plant varieties in order to obtain higher yields, better quality and security of crops from the hazards of weather and disease is an important service to mankind.  A new plant variety is the result of substantial investment of human skill and resources for anything up to 15 years.  Breeding costs money and time.  Like the creators of other intellectual property such as industrial patents, plant breeders are ready to undertake such expensive and time-consuming work only if they receive adequate remuneration for their work.  They cannot receive such remuneration simply by selling their propagating material, because other persons who have not made such substantial investments could freely use the breeders' propagating material for the production of further propagating material for commercial use.  In order to protect breeders from the exploitation of their work and investment by others, this concept of breeders' rights has evolved whereby breeders are granted a right under which, for a limited period of time, and for commercial purposes, the propagating material of their new plant varieties may only be produced or marketed by themselves, or by others with the breeder's prior authorisation and on his conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some countries have established breeders' rights systems under individual <Col N="374" /> national law such as patent law. However, the dominant and expanding rights system, in Europe at any rate, is that which is enshrined in the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, signed at Paris in 1961 and revised at Geneva in 1972, and 1978.  States which are party to this convention constitute the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants&mdash;known as UPOV for short&mdash;which has its headquarters in Geneva and administers the convention.  My Department have been represented by observers at UPOV meetings for some years and participated in the conference in Geneva last year which revised the convention.  An important aim, and achievement, of the revised convention was to make it easier for States to accede to it and join UPOV.</P>
    <P>Seven EEC member states (Ireland and Luxembourg being the exceptions) together with South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Israel and Switzerland are party to the convention and constitute UPOV. Some other States&mdash;particularly USA, Canada and New Zealand&mdash;are preparing to adopt the convention in the near future.  It can be said, therefore, that all those countries from which we obtain seeds or plant material are or will be members of UPOV.  The EEC Commission recommend that all EEC member states should accede to the convention. The Commission take a special interest in the work of UPOV, bearing in mind that both UPOV and the EEC are working towards harmonised systems of plant variety testing in order to minimise work and costs.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been constant pressure from Irish interests, particularly those concerned with plant breeding, that we should establish a rights system in accordance with the convention.  Our own plant breeding interests certainly need protection against infringement of rights on plant varieties which they may release for export, but this presents certain problems in the absence of a rights system here which could ensure reciprocal protection arrangements in the spirit of the convention <Col N="375" /> tion.  Furthermore, we depend very greatly on foreign varieties for our main agricultural crops such as cereals and grasses.  Most of the new valuable varieties of these species are protected under the UPOV system, and until now we have been able to use them under commercial marketing arrangements involving royalties etc.  However, there are grounds for concern that, in the absence of a rights system here and the legal protection which it affords, some foreign breeders may not continue to be so accommodating in allowing us the use of their varieties.  Those then are the compelling reasons for this legislation&mdash;protection and encouragement for Irish breeding interests, and continued access to foreign varieties of importance to us agriculturally.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will appreciate from my remarks so far that this Bill is based on the principles of the international convention, which I may add was signed by Ireland on 27 September last subject to eventual ratification when this Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>The main provisions in the Bill are: firstly, countries which are party to the convention will be recognised as having a special status in regard to breeders' rights.  Secondly, the nature of the rights granted to a breeder will be such that he will have the sole right to produce, for marketing purposes, and to export or import, any reproductive material of the variety for which rights are granted: and that he may authorise others to do the same on conditions which he may specify, including of course, royalties.  In the exercise of these exclusive rights breeders will in turn have an obligation to ensure that their varieties are made available to others on reasonable terms and that the varieties will be maintained true to the characteristics which qualified them for rights.  However, if a breeder abuses these exclusive rights by, for example, unreasonable restrictions on giving authorisations, or if the public interest so requires, then corrective action can be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> Thirdly, it must be kept in mind that the convention is concerned only with the grant and protection of proprietary rights in respect of plant varieties which are new, that is, newly-created at the time the rights are granted.  Precise criteria for grant of rights are, therefore, laid down.  A variety must be distinct from others of the same species, it must be uniform and stable in its reproduction, and (subject to some transitional arrangements) it must not have been previously commercialised outside certain periods.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, subject to the general superintendence of the Minister for Agriculture, the rights system will be administered by a body corporate to be called the Office of the Controller of Plant Breeders' Rights.  The controller will be responsible for the day-to-day decisions for which the Bill provides and will charge fees for the various services provided by his office.  This body will in many ways be comparable to the Patents Office, though not anything on the same scale as regards personnel and activity. There is provision for appeals, objections and representations relating to all decisions by the controller.  The technical and scientific work of evaluating applications for rights will be integrated into the seed variety testing arrangements at present conducted by my Department.  In this work the controller is empowered to have recourse to other appropriate institutions or services inside or outside the State.</P>
    <P>In preparing the Bill full consultation took place with all the interests concerned and their views were fully taken into account.  The aim is, therefore, to start off with a rights system of suitably modest proportions to meet our needs in the foreseeable future.  Rights under the Bill may be applied to varieties of any botanical species, but it would be our intention, as a beginning, to confine rights to varieties of wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, ryegrass and white clover.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to facing some difficulty in coming to a conclusion <Col N="377" /> about the appropriateness of this Bill for Irish conditions.  I say that having had fairly extensive consultations with people who are in favour of and against the Bill. Indeed, a Bill of this nature which is very complex and is concerned with abstruse points of law concerning intellectual property and also requiring very detailed knowledge of the scientific position in relation to the evolution of plant breeding in the world, is one which legislators here face great difficulty in coming to conclusions about.  It is a very convincing argument for the type of proposal which my party put forward in relation to the consideration of such pieces of legislation by a Committee of the House which would take evidence in public from the various interested groups, those for and against, and crossexamine such groups on their views.  We should have had an opportunity in a Committee of the House to hear the arguments put forward by the plant breeding interests, the Agricultural Institute and individuals who are interested in plant breeding, all of whom are in favour of the Bill, and an opportunity of hearing evidence from the Irish Commission on Justice and Peace, a commission of the Irish Episcopal Conference who expressed strong views if not outright opposition to the Bill and Comhlamh, a body which represents the interests of those who worked as volunteers in the Third World.  The latter body expressed similar reservations to those of the Irish Episcopal Conference about the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could have heard the opinions of those for and against the provisions of the Bill, we would have been able to deal with this matter more appropriately and with greater assurance than we can now. The evidence of those interests must be obtained privately and without the assistance of the resources of the House. I notice that the Bill was prepared after the circulation of a discussion document to the various Irish interests concerned and that discussions were held where requested. It surprises me that the Bill was prepared without those discussion documents being circulated to Members of the House.  It seems anomalous that individuals or groups outside the House <Col N="378" /> should receive advance notice of the Bill and material in respect of the arguments for and against its provisions without the people who have the responsibility for enacting the Bill receiving a similar courtesy. I know that this is not the first time such a procedure was adopted by the Department of Agriculture.  It was a discourtesy to the House that other people should receive written communications in respect of proposed legislation before the people responsible for enacting it, Members of this House, received it.  It is possible that agreements were entered into in respect of the contents of the Bill outside the House before we were made aware that the legislation was contemplated. That is a serious matter which should not be allowed to happen again. We must ask ourselves the fundamental question as to what the House is being asked to do in enacting plant breeders legislation.  We are being asked to create a situation whereby a monopoly can be conferred on certain individuals in respect of the propagation of certain varieties of seed.  It is my view that in the case of anybody seeking to establish a monopoly the case for the monopoly must be made out by the person seeking to establish it.  There is always a <i>prima facie</i> case against a monopoly of any description.  We must look carefully through the Minister's speech to see if he has established a case which is sufficiently strong to justify us creating a new type of monopoly in our law which did not exist hitherto.  This type of monopoly is analogous, though not exactly the same, to the monopoly which already exists in respect of patents in regard to industrial and material inventions. The difference is that in this case we are seeking to create a monopoly in respect of a naturally occurring species of natural life whereas in the case of a patent one establishes a monopoly in respect of something which is not naturally occurring but is the result solely of mechanical contrivance by a human being.</P>
    <P>One could argue that there is possibly a greater case for a monopoly in the case of patents than in this case but that is something we must decide in the course <Col N="379" /> of the next few weeks.  In this context it is worth quoting what has been said in other countries about the whole concept of the granting of patents, whether they are in respect of plants or mechanical inventions. The Canadian Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs established a commission to consider the entire field of intellectual property, in particular patent law.  The Commission, chaired by a person called Ostry, reported to the then Minister for Consumer and Corporate Affairs of Canada, the Hon.  Bryce Mackasey, in June 1976.  I should like to quote the commission's conclusions about the validity of patent law in Canada because I believe the arguments adduced on that occasion in respect of patent law of which Canada had considerable experience can be applied to the creation of a new type of patent in our law in respect of plant varieties.  I hope the House will bear with me while I quote extensively from this document, as I understand that it is not otherwise available in this country.  In their conclusions to a very lengthy review, comprising almost 100 pages, of all the arguments for and against having patent legislation, the commission said that on the basis of the review and analysis contained in the first part of the working paper, it was evident that Canada should give serious consideration to the possibility of abandoning the continued maintenance of a patent system in any form.  However, they go on to say that they are not convinced that they would be in a position there and then to recommend such a radical step as the entire abandonment of patent law.  As a compromise they proposed that a revised law should be enacted in respect of patents and they said that as an essential feature of such proposed revision, the Canadian patent system should be submitted to a 10-year trial period during which time a case for or against the system should be developed in a definitive and rational manner.  They said that to facilitate this review they were proposing that, subject to the approval by order in council and the <Col N="380" /> associated public scrutiny inherent in this political process, patentees would be required to supply such fundamental and essential information as they had in their possession which would reflect on the actual operation of the patent system in Canada.</P>
    <P>Their basic reason for putting this case was their belief that there was not available sufficient information as to who was benefiting from the existence of a patent system because most of the relevant information as to the utilisation or otherwise of particular inventions, as to whether they were being used to the full or as to whether their use was leading to the optimum use of resources then in existence in Canada, was not available publicly but was in the hands of the people who held the patent monopoly and they alone know whether these patented inventions were being used to the full and in the best manner possible and whether the existence of such patent protection was the key determinant as to whether these inventions would be effective.</P>
    <P>The commission were of the opinion that the only way one could reach a decision as to whether there was a need for a patent system at all, was to have a system whereby those companies who had been granted the patents would make available publicly the information which they had solely at their disposal privately.  Therefore, the commission proposed that the legislation should contain specific requirements for the disclosure of all information on certain defined subjects to an authority who, at the end of a 10-year period of the operation of the legislation, would be in a position to reach a balanced decision in respect of the merits or otherwise of having a patent system.  They could not do this in the situation of paucity of information then available to the public.</P>
    <P>The commission went on to say that the essential factors which must be evaluated ultimately in determining whether the patent system should be continued included the following, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...the extent to which the patent <Col N="381" /> system actually performs as an meentive to research, disclosure and innovation; the costs entailed in the system, including costs arising through misallocation of resources and restraints on the use of new technology; and the ultimate impact and benefit to Canada arising from the participation of foreigners in our national patent system.</P>
    <P>I might mention in that respect that it is important to note who will be likely to benefit from the new scheme of patents that we are to institute here in respect of plant varieties.  If the experience of our existing legislation in relation to patents for industrial inventions is anything to go by, the bulk of the people who will be receiving patents under this legislation will not be Irish people.  Of all the patents granted last year by the Patents Office here, only 2 per cent were granted to Irish inventors while the remaining 98 per cent were granted to foreign inventors. These figures represented 16 Irish patented inventions out of a total of 1,271 patented inventions.  It is likely that the bulk of those who will be applying for and obtaining rights under this new legislation will be distributed on a similar basis.  Perhaps not 98 per cent but a figure approaching that percentage of those who will be protected under the legislation will not be Irish people.  The granting of that protection will imply that if we are to use the varieties of plants that these people will now be able to patent under our legislation, Irish users of these varieties of plants will find themselves in the position of having to pay royalties to people outside the country. At present there is not any legal requirement on them to pay such royalties but one effect of the legislation could be to create a situation in which more money would be flowing out of the country by way of royalties for the use of plant varieties than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>However, matters are not as simple as that because it is not all that easy to go abroad and pick up a variety of plant to bring back here and begin to use without paying royalties because many of these varieties are in the possession of very <Col N="382" /> large companies.  The position at the moment is that if an Irish farmer, for instance, picks up a variety of barley in Sweden while on holidays in that country and wishes to bring back the plant for propagating here, the Swedes are not in a position to demand royalties from him because of our not being a member of the UPOV Convention but if this legislation were in operation, the situation would be different and an Irish farmer using Swedish grain would have to pay royalties on it.  This is a situation which must be borne in mind and, like the Canadians, we must ask ourselves whether on balance the situation created by such legislation is warranted.  I might mention that the situation in Canada was found to be that 95 per cent of those holding patents were not Canadian. Therefore, we are not the only country facing that difficulty.</P>
    <P>Under the general heading of issues that had to be considered, the commission said that the other matters to be looked at were the extent to which patents supported licensing arrangements, in other words, that people wishing to use a particular invention could do so only on the basis that they paid not only a fee but a share of the profits to a foreign owner of the patent.  The extent to which foreign ownership in Canada affects the decisions of industry to exploit new technology, is a question which should be answered only once details of authoritative data have been published.</P>
    <P>If that has been the experience of patents in another country larger than ours, Canada, there are <i>prima facie</i> grounds for questioning whether we should create a new system of patent protection here.  It is in that spirit that we on the Opposition benches approach this legislation.  I do not think we have the knowledge to say we can oppose or that we do not need this legislation, but we have the right and the duty to ask certain questions which have not so far been answered.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Those then are the compelling reasons for this legislation&mdash;protection <Col N="383" /> tion and encouragement for Irish breeding interests, and continued access to foreign varieties of importance to us agriculturally.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss how compelling are the reasons he cited.  I will take the second reason first.  He said:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we depend greatly on foreign varieties for our main agricultural crops such as cereals and grasses.  Most of the new valuable varieties of these species are protected under the UPOV system, and until now we have been able to use them under commercial marketing arrangements involving royalties....</P>
    <P>Up to now we have been able to get royalties although we are not a signatory to the UPOV Convention.  The Minister is saying that we have been able to get them up to now but if we do not pass this legislation we will not be able to get them in future.</P>
    <P>This convention has been in existence since 1961.  If it were to be impossible to get these varieties as the Minister said, it is surprising that it has not happened so far and, on the Minister's own admission, it has not happened.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>However, there are grounds for concern that, in the absence of a rights system here and the legal protection which it affords, some foreign breeders may not continue to be so accommodating in allowing us the use of their varieties.</P>
    <P>The Minister described &ldquo;some foreign breeders may not continue to be so accommodating&rdquo; as a compelling reason. That does not seem to be a very compelling reason because it is only a supposition about something which could have happened in the last 20 years, but which has not happened, and only may happen in the future.</P>
    <P>The first point he made has a greater degree of substance.  He said:</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been constant pressure from Irish interests, particularly those concerned with plant <Col N="384" /> breeding, that we should establish a rights system in accordance with the convention.  Our own plant breeding interests certainly need protection against infringement of rights on plant varieties which they may release for export, but this presents certain problems in the absence of a rights system here which could ensure reciprocal arrangements in the spirit of the convention.</P>
    <P>I am aware that we have been active and very successful in developing varieties of seed potato which can be propagated in warmer countries, such as Cyprus and Egypt, but there is a danger that one or two notable Irish breakthroughs in the breeding of potatoes are likely to be stolen by countries which are signatories to the UPOV Convention.  For example, people have been able to walk around the fields in Egypt, pick up potatoes and bring them back to their own country&mdash;Holland&mdash;where they develop them and they will be able to use them as their own varieties.  Because Ireland is not a member of the UPOV Convention there is nothing we can do to stop this happening.  That argument has considerable force and is one of the reasons why I should be hesitant to oppose this legislation.  I know the very great work which is being done here in potato breeding.  Notwithstanding that, other questions about the general tenor of the legislation have to be answered.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second argument about not having access to foreign varieties has not yet been proved.  Where one is seeking to create a monopoly, as this Bill does, the burden of proof is on the people proposing the monopoly, not on those opposing it.  In this case the Minister has not discharged the burden of proof and I believe he must do so.</P>
    <P>I note that Ireland and Luxembourg are not yet signatories to the convention. Why is Luxembourg not a signatory?  Is it simply that they have not got round to enacting legislation or do they have reservations?  If so, we should have access to the information they have available to them.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation a person who <Col N="385" /> obtains a plant breeder's right will have the exclusive right to use the variety for 16 years.  Does the Minister consider it necessary to give that exclusive right? As he said, these people will not only be given the right to obtain royalties from anyone who later uses these plant varieties, but they will have this exclusive right for 16 years.  A person who patented a plant should be satisfied that anybody who uses that variety in the future would be required to pay a substantial amount of reasonable royalties. That should ensure a sufficient financial reward, but this Bill goes further.  It says that not only does he have a right to financial reward but for 16 years he will have the right to say that he, and he alone, shall have the right to market that particular variety of plant, but that prohibition on the use of that plant applies to all countries in the UPOV Convention, and that in itself gives a right to multi-national companies, because they are the only people likely to have the ability to use that right throughout a large number of countries who adhere to UPOV.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the exclusive right to propagate a new variety of potato. Those concerned might not have marketing arrangements with signatories to UPOV.  The only way they could use their exclusive right in full would be to enter into an agreement with multi-national companies which have a marketing arm in UPOV countries.  The creation of an exclusive right could only be exercised, therefore, through multi-national companies and I question whether in our legislation we should deliberately encourage such multinationalisation, if I may use the word, in this or any other business.  I also question whether it would be sufficient simply to give a right to royalties to the inventor, if that is the proper description, of a new plant without also giving him a right to the exclusive use of that plant for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not make that case in his speech.  I agree a person who invents a plant variety must invest much time and money and therefore he is entitled <Col N="386" /> not only to have that time and money adequately compensated for by those who benefit from the fruits of his labour but he is entitled to a good deal extra in large royalties.  Why should he get only royalties?  Why should he not also get the exclusive right to use the commodity?</P>
    <P>It seems to me there should be a situation in which a person who wishes to use a variety which has been patented by somebody should be entitled to use it if he is prepared to pay a reasonable royalty, but under this legislation, no matter how big a set of royalties you offer to somebody who has patented a variety of plant, the person can say simply: &ldquo;I will not let you use it no matter how much you offer me&rdquo;.  There is no procedure through which he can be prohibited from doing that.</P>
    <P>There is a procedure called &ldquo;compulsory licensing&rdquo; which is concerned, as stated in the Explanatory Memorandum, with empowering the controller to grant compulsory licences for the propagation of a protected variety in cases where the holder of the rights imposes unreasonable conditions on persons seeking licences to use the variety or where such action is considered necessary in the public interest.</P>
    <P>On the face of it one would have thought that that provision in section 8, by which the controller can force a person to grant the right to someone else to use the variety in certain circumstances, would be sufficient protection.  But there has been sad experience in respect of compulsory licensing under our patents legislation.  Our patents legislation dates from 1963 and it contains compulsory licensing procedure under which if a person has an invention and if he unreasonably refuses the right to others to use it in certain circumstances he can be sued or the controller can require him to grant a licence to someone else.</P>
    <P>That legislation has existed since 1963 but not once has it been used.  Not a single compulsory licence has been granted to anyone.  I do not know why that is so but I imagine that the burden of proof that has to be carried by the person seeking <Col N="387" /> ing the licence is so great that nobody has bothered and I foresee that it will be exactly the same in regard to this legislation. It will be so difficult to get a compulsory licence that nobody will bother and the situation will continue whereby people will have an exclusive monopoly for the full 16 years in regard to plant varieties, whether they are making use of them or not.  I do not know whether that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I am seeking information about what will be done with the fees obtained by the controller of plant varieties.  It seems to me that determination of whether a plant variety is new or not will be a matter for very detailed technical analysis.  It will require a large input of skills which are in very limited supply in this country.  If the controller has to employ seven or eight people with specific skills in regard to plant breeding in order to enforce this legislation and to ensure that individual applications will be dealt with in a serious way, it is quite likely the controller's office will absorb a large proportion of the people in this country suitably qualified for this work and that people who might otherwise be engaged in more productive activities will be absorbed in that office going through inventions submitted by people in foreign countries in order that people in those countries can get protection for their inventions in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Is that the best possible use of the limited number of people in this country with particular competence in plant breeding?  Is putting them into an office like this the best way we could use them or should we have them out doing other work?  We may be told the existing staff of the Department of Agriculture will be used, who are at present involved in plant breeding activities, that new staff will not be required.  If they are to spend a lot of their time in future examining applications for patents, who will do the work they are doing now?  Will that work suffer as a result of this legislation? I do not think the taxpayer should have to subsidise plant breeders' rights.</P>
    <P>There should be no net cost to the Exchequer. <Col N="388" /> The fees obtained by this office should cover the costs completely of the office.  I would not accept that there would have to be a subsidy.  As I have said, probably about 98 per cent of the people obtaining these patents will be foreigners.  Why should the Irish taxpayer have to pay the cost of granting them protection?  I know 2 per cent of the Irish people will be able to get benefits abroad as a result of getting their patents here but, on balance, this office should pay for itself.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to section 4 (5) and asked why exclusive rights should be given rather than just rights to royalties or the system of inventors' certificates which is used in other countries as against outright patents.  I wonder also why the period of protection is 15 years for most plants and 18 years for trees and vines.  I know it is 15 years in some other countries which are involved in the UPOV Convention.  Would we be prevented from adhering to the convention if we did not provide 15 years too? Are we satisfied that 15 years is the necessary period?</P>
    <P>There are arguments that, given the rapid rate at which seeds can be propagated now, and the rapid turnover of new varieties, one could get one's return, and a very adequate return, from the development of a new variety of plant in far less than 15 years.  It would seem that the rate at which new varieties are replacing old varieties in agriculture is so great at the moment that a new variety can replace an old variety in the space of four or five years.  Deputy Donegan will know far better than I whether that is so, and he will be contributing to the debate later.</P>
    <P>Granting protection for 15 years when a new invention might be exhausted as far as its usefulness was concerned in four or five years seems to be creating a situation in which nobody will ever use that variety, except the person who invents it.  By the time the 15-year period is up, disease problems, or whatever, will have arisen in respect of that variety, and it will not be usable and nobody will want it at the end of 15 years.  It seems <Col N="389" /> odd to me that 15 years should be the chosen period.</P>
    <P>I know it is 16 years in respect of industrial patents.  Did we take the figure for industrial patents and transfer it to plants without regard to the different characteristics of plants as against industrial patents?  Industrial inventions are not subject to disease or immunities. A new type of refrigerator does not get a particular disease which makes it unusable after a certain period.  Why should we take the same period straight from the patents legislation and put it into the plant varieties legislation without regard to the very different characteristics of plants?  I do not know.  We were not told in the Minister's speech why he chose 15 years, and he certainly has not proved his case.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about analogous legislation adopted by the EEC.  I refer the Minister to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Thursday, 7 December 1978 headed &ldquo;EEC Threat to Vegetable Strains&rdquo; in which it is claimed that the EEC have adopted legislation concerning common catalogues of agricultural and vegetable varieties and strains.  It says that strains which are not listed in this common catalogue will be phased out after 1981, with penalties, including fines of up to £100, to discourage farmers and gardeners from planting them.  It says that the catalogue will also name firms chosen to maintain the remaining legal varieties.</P>
    <P>The whole idea is that, in future, you will not be able to sell a variety of potatoes, even if it is an old traditional variety, if it is not approved by the EEC. They will try to narrow down to a limited number of uniform types of varieties the plants which can be sold on the market.  They will give a monopoly in respect of those individual types of plants to certain companies who will have the right to say who shall or shall not have use of those varieties.</P>
    <P>It was claimed in the article that the result of the adoption of common catalogues in tandem with breeders' rights legislation would be to create a vice out of which individuals who wanted <Col N="390" /> ted to develop individual types of plants, and use them, would not be able to escape. It would create a complete monopoly and, between the plant breeder's rights legislation and the EEC common catalogues, they would have the whole thing completely tied up.  The article went on to say the result would be that the price of seeds would be likely to rise as the big companies who would have the monopoly would use their market power to ask for the highest possible price.</P>
    <P>Even if the people in charge of the multi-national companies who would have these patents were saints&mdash;and I am not claiming that they are saints&mdash;when they knew they were the only people who had a certain variety, and that nobody else could use it without their permission, the temptation for them to jack up their price above what they would normally charge on the basis of their real costs and reasonable profits would be very great indeed.  Even if they were saints, I doubt that they would charge a reasonable price.  Yet we are enacting legislation which gives them the potential to charge more than the reasonable price for using a particular variety.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed that the common catalogue legislation would lead to greater uniformity and that there would be a lesser number of varieties of plants in use and, if a disease developed it was more likely that it would sweep through the entire crop in the entire country and perhaps in the entire Community than it would be if there were a large variety, some of them good and some of them bad.  Some of them would be resistant to whatever new disease was introduced and the entire crop would not be wiped out in the entire country.  If an entire crop were wiped out there could be something like the potato famine which occurred in 1846 and 1847.  One of the reasons why that potato famine occurred was that, in order to get high yields to feed the excessively large population which existed at that time, they had to concentrate on the highest yielding varieties of potatoes.  The concentration <Col N="391" /> on the smaller number of varieties apparently facilitated the development of blight which led to the famine.</P>
    <P>I am not saying the plant breeders' rights legislation will lead to that sort of situation in Ireland again but, on the face of it, there are arguments that if you tend to concentrate on a smaller and smaller number of varieties, the danger of disease sweeping through the entire crop is increased.  The larger the number of varieties you have, the lesser is the likelihood of this happening, because some at least of the varieties in use will probably be resistant to whatever disease is introduced.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he considers that plant breeders' rights legislation is necessary at all in respect of hybrid varieties of plants.  The nature of hybrid varieties is that many of them cannot re-produce themselves; some hybrid plants can re-produce but others cannot.  I think barely is one.  If one develops a hybrid barley it cannot reproduce.  If a particular company already has the rights in respect of the parents of this hybrid and the hybrid itself cannot reproduce it seems likely&mdash;if one is using hybrids&mdash;one must go back to the person who owns the parents if one wants to produce more of the hybrid.  On the face of it would seem that there is not a great need for patent protection in that situation because one cannot reproduce the hybrid anyway in a pirate fashion unless one has not only the hybrid variety but also the parents of the hybrid.</P>
    <P>A hybrid plant is basically a sexless plant&mdash;it is like a mule&mdash;it cannot reproduce.  There is no point in charging stud fees for a mule.  Therefore there is not much point in having plant varieties legislation for a hybrid plant.  That is the argument I am endeavouring to put to the Minister&mdash;whether he believes these mules need the protection he proposes so generously to give them.  I do not know whether or not he has really met that case.  I understand that a lot of varieties in use at present, if not the bulk of them, <Col N="392" /> are hybrid varieties.  It would not seem to me to be necessary to have plant breeders' legislation in respect of hybrids.</P>
    <P>Another argument advanced by a number of people in favour of the legislation is that there is insufficient activity in Ireland to develop new varieties of plant specifically suited to our conditions, that what we need to do is to attract more breeders here to develop plants specifically suitable to Irish conditions. It is further advanced that, at present, because we have a rather weak plant-breeding industry here, we are left in the position in which instead of developing varieties specifically suitable to our conditions we have to borrow varieties from abroad and develop them for conditions that are not ours.  The argument is further advanced that often what happens is that we take a variety which is, say, developed in Sweden, which is not suitable for Swedish conditions but which happens, simply by accident, to be suitable to ours, when we find out about it and start to propagate it here.  I understand that the situation in respect of many of the varieties in use in this country is that they were developed in foreign countries, could not be used there but can be used here.  The fact that the are in use here is purely accidental.  They were not developed specifically for Irish conditions.  Therefore, essentially we are using second best.  The reason more people are not developing plant varieties specifically for Irish conditions is that if they did they would not have the protection of plant breeders' rights legislation for getting royalties and the exclusive right to use their inventions.</P>
    <P>One of the expected results of the enactment of this Bill is that foreigners will be attracted here and, instead of breeding their plants, say, in Holland or Sweden and selling us their second best&mdash;if they happen by chance to be useful to us&mdash;they will actually come in here and breed the plants specifically for Irish conditions, when we would get better value.  I have no doubt that that is a very valid argument.  However, it raises the question: does this mean that plant <Col N="393" /> breeding in this country&mdash;which up to now has tended to be the preserve either of the Agricultural Institute or Irish owned plant breeders&mdash;on the enactment of this Bill will lead, on the one hand, to many foreigners applying to patent inventions here and, on the other, to many more foreign companies coming in seeking to develop seeds here, thereby possibly putting the Irish seed merchants out of business by subjecting them to much more severe competition than they can withstand at present?  Probably such people coming in here would have resources available to them because of their being engaged in active work in practically all of the countries at present complying with the UPOV Convention, enabling them to spread their costs over the entire market.  Under the terms of this Bill they will be enabled to come in here and, by utilising money they will have made elsewhere, will be able to undercut and put Irish seed merchants out of business, taking over the entire market.  Of course, they would be coming in to do something very fruitful, which we want them to do, namely, develop Irish seed varieties specifically suitable to our conditions, using their resources to do so, resources we want to see brought in here, using expertise which likewise we want to see brought in here, and which the legislation will attract, but also in the process perhaps putting Irish seedsmen out of business.</P>
    <P>One firm with which I have had some dealings has been taken over in the last few weeks by a foreign company. Whereas it was an Irish firm a month ago it is now Dutch.  I understand that this is happening at quite a rate in anticipation of the enactment of this Bill. While there is for and against, the for is that we will have perhaps more efficient plant breeding, the against is that native Irish breeding will be disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>A situation could develop in which more and more of our seed business would be under the control of people coming in from abroad&mdash;as a result of this Bill&mdash;because it will afford them protection they would not have had heretofore.  We must ask ourselves: is <Col N="394" /> that a good thing?  Perhaps it is not. Perhaps, if the immediate benefits are considered, when they are in the process of taking over the market they would be offering us far better value than we would be getting otherwise from existing Irish seed breeders who have not the resources available to them to serve the market sufficiently.  When these new companies come in initially they will be of considerable benefit to us because they will be importing expertise we have not got at present.  But it is argued that in the longer run it will be to our disadvantage because once they have established themselves in the market they will then control it, charging whatever prices they like for seeds we seek to use here.  It is also argued that we will be involved in the process of facilitating the creation of a monopoly by people outside this country. We must look at the matter in that sort of long perspective.  One cannot look at this Bill and say it will bring us benefits in the first two or three years and therefore we should enact it.  In this type of legislation we must look ahead at least 20 years and ask ourselves what will be the situation in 20 years' time?  It is quite possible that although the immediate impact of this Bill will be highly beneficial to us, in the long run it might not be all that beneficial.  Indeed, there are strong arguments for looking at foreign countries to assertain whether or not those countries that have had patent legislation have benefited more than those that have not.</P>
    <P>There is one country that does not bother with copyright legislation at all and that is Taiwan.  Taiwan has one of the most dynamic economies in the world.  It has a more rapid growth rate than any other country.  They have been able to take inventions from anywhere, pay no royalties and flog them to the full anywhere they can sell them.  When Henry Kissinger brought out his memories, which he proceeded to try to sell to the rest of the world at a high price, within a short time Taiwan brought out an edition of his book which they sold at about one-quarter of the price.  They paid no royalties whatever to Henry Kissinger and were able to make <Col N="395" /> a good profit for themselves in the process.  It has a dynamic economy and is able to do so by not having this kind of legislation in respect of copyright.  We should ask whether or not we might be able to have benefits of that kind if we had a similar position.  That is open to argument.  It might not work out that well, but on the other hand it might.</P>
    <P>One result of the introduction of this legislation will be the winding down of publicly-funded plant breeding programmes.  As more and more private companies enjoy the monopoly afforded by plant breeders' rights legislation more and more of them will become involved in this activity.  Gradually public authorities will find that all the work they were doing is being done more efficiently by private concerns.  As Governments are usually stuck for money every four or five years the immediate temptation for the Government of the day will be to say that there is no point in putting money into plant breeding operations when the work is being done by private concerns.  The result will be that the entire plant breeding operation will be carried out by private concerns and there will be no publicly supported plant breeding programme. Once such a programme has been abandoned it is hard to get it back.  Irish farmers would have no specific protection as far as the development of varieties here are concerned.</P>
    <P>Foreign companies, who will probably become very dominant in the seed breeding market, will have it all their own way and be able to charge whatever price they like for the varities of plant they sell here.  That would not be a desirable situation.  There should be a commitment in this legislation by the Minister to maintain or increase the present level of public funding of plant breeding so as not to allow a situation where, as a result of the advantages created by this legislation for increased private plant breeding, public plant breeding programmes would be phased out.  Admittedly, this is in the realm of <Col N="396" /> speculation.  It is like one of the two compelling reasons given by the Minister for advancing the legislation.  My argument against it is no more compelling.  It is something that could happen and we should have an answer to it.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion which has been made&mdash;I do not know whether it is possible or valid&mdash;is that, instead of adhering to the UPOV Convention and enacting all the legislation which is required by the convention, we should seek some form of external association with individual countries so that if we want to get certain varieties of Dutch wheat, for example, we would enter into agreement with the Dutch whereby we would have the right to use some of their varities of wheat and in return for that they would, in respect of any use they made of varities of certain commodities we had developed, pay us royalties or give us exclusive rights to propagate or sell those varities.  Rather than adopt the whole convention holus bolus without knowing where we are going we would take it on a case by case basis and where it was necessary for the development of plant breeding we would enter into agreements and seek specific protection in respect of specific varities of plant we are interested in in return for giving specific concessions to the people from whom we are seeking compensating concessions. There is power under section 2 of the Bill whereby the Minister can enter into such agreements and possibly that would cover the case.  If we had such bilateral agreements in respect of individual areas of plant breeding that would afford us sufficient protection without necessarily getting into the area of plant breeders' rights legislation to cover all varities.  I doubt if that argument is true.  It probably would not work like that but it is an argument that has been put to me and should be answered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is the impact of this kind of legislation on the Third World.  Whether or not this Bill is enacted it will not create a situation where any more people will or will not starve in the Third World than might otherwise do so.  There are people who <Col N="397" /> have questioned the whole ethos of plant breeders' rights on the grounds that they endanger the continued healthy life of people in the Third World.  By adhering to this legislation, although we may not be making a material contribution to the problem, we will be lending our moral prestige as a country which is nonaligned at least in the sense that we are not part of any military bloc, and to a system which, it is argued, does not help the Third World.  I should like to explain why people in the Third World have reservations about plant breeders' rights generally.  The Minister should allay these fears, in justification of the convention which he is seeking to ratify, not only in so far as it applies to Ireland, but in so far as it applies to the entire world.</P>
    <P>One argument is that by creating these monopolies in respect of the development of particular types of plants, the people who avail of these monopolies will tend to be large multi-national companies and these multi-national companies also sell fertilisers and pesticides.  It is argued that they will have the temptation, first of all, to promote these varieties which will obviously have initial benefits but that conditional on their being used will be a requirement also to use pesticides and fertilisers sold by the same company.  The company will not have the same incentive to develop and sell to poor countries varieties which do not require that, as well as using their seed, they must also use their fertilisers and pesticides.  The result of that will be that, although in the short-run the producer in the Third World may get increased yields, he will get them at the cost of having to use far more fertilisers and pesticides imported from the same multi-national company that sold him the seed.</P>
    <P>While in the initial period this may be very attractive and the price of the fertilisers and pesticides will be kept reasonably low by the company supplying them in order to get them hooked, so to speak, onto the use of this new variety, gradually, once the producer has become hooked and has no way but to use these particular varities because the <Col N="398" /> varieties of plant he was using previously, perhaps not specifically developed at all but traditional&mdash;which did not need so much fertiliser or pesticide but which also did not give half the yield&mdash;will have died out or may not be available in sufficient quantities for propagating quickly by seed.  The multi-national company will then be in a position to raise the price of their products as much as they like, since the farmer in the Third World will have no option but to continue using the varities with this dependence, because no alternative varieties without a similar dependence are available.  It is argued, in respect of this legislation, that, by encouraging such an international monopoly, one will allow that sort of bind to be created for the farmer of the Third World.  I do not think the enactment of this legislation here in Ireland will make much difference, one way or the other, to the growth or otherwise of international seed companies and consequently to whatever difficulties the people in the Third World face, but it is something we should consider.</P>
    <P>It has also been said, in contradiction of that argument that, in fact, since the oil crisis, the price of fertiliser has risen considerably and the international companies have switched to developing varieties of seed which are not so dependent on fertilisers, that they do not operate in the way I have described and that they try to develop varities which will not have this requirement.  Although the evidence, one way or the other, is not conclusive, this point has been raised by a number of responsible bodies here including the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace which is sponsored by the Catholic bishops.  It is a point which should be answered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Basically, this legislation should be enacted because it is probably inevitable and necessary to allow protection to people who are breeding such plants here, but it must be enacted with sufficient safeguards.  The necessary safeguards, which are not present in this Bill are, firstly, to ensure that in no circumstances will people be allowed to unreasonably <Col N="399" /> continue to withhold the availability of particular varieties of plants under this legislation from people here.  There must be stringent powers, with the burden of proof appropriately distributed, to allow the controller to intervene and, if he or anybody feels that someone with a patent is not making it adequately available, the controller will be able to step in quickly and do something about it.  The powers will have to be far stronger than those contained in the patents legislation which manifestly has not worked.  We must consider very carefully whether or not it is necessary to give, under this legislation, the exclusive right to use the plant for 15 years, whether or not that period is too long&mdash;I would argue that perhaps it should be reduced to about half that period&mdash;and, furthermore, whether or not an exclusive right should be granted at all, or whether it should be sufficient simply to allow the person who developed the variety to get royalties from it.</P>
    <P>I would also ask that the legislation be subject to review after a period of five years and that the provisions for such a review be contained in the Bill in the form of amendments to it.  In other words we would set up amendments in the legislation whereby an independent body would be established which would have the right to demand any information it thought fit in respect of the operation of the legislation during the five year trial period.  At the end of that period it should be required by law to give a report to this House as to whether this legislation had worked in the manner in which it is expected it would, whether it had encouraged more plant breeding, whether, if it had done so, that had worked to the benefit or otherwise of the farming community and the community as a whole, or whether there was evidence to suggest that the protection contained in the legislation had, in fact, resulted in higher prices for plant varieties, rather than lower.  At the end of that five year period, the committee which I propose should be set up would <Col N="400" /> report to this House in a predetermined formal manner and the House would then decide at the end of that period whether the legislation would continue.</P>
    <P>We should consider whether the legislation should be of limited duration rather than creating indefinite commitment to legislation.  Whether that would meet the terms of the UPOV Convention is something I cannot say.  It possibly would not do so.  This is, however, something we should consider carefully. We do not know at present whether, on balance, this legislation will work, in the long run, to the benefit of this country.  I do not believe the Minister is convinced or that most people in the country are convinced of this.  They feel that, on balance, on the available evidence it is probably something we need but nobody can be sure it is something that we should have.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton has received permission to raise on the Adjournment the delay in publication of the archaeological survey carried out by the Office of Public Works in respect of counties in regard to which the survey is complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The archaeology survey was begun in 1963.  It is concerned with all ancient monuments in the country, to mark them out in a comprehensive manner so that we will know what monuments exist and, in other words, to find out and establish in one document our physical heritage.  The survey was being carried out on a county by county basis. As far as I know, only three countries have been completed so far in almost 20 years&mdash;County Louth, County Meath and County Monaghan.  One might be forgiven for saying that the rate of progress has been less than speedy.  I think work has commenced on three other countries&mdash;Westmeath, Longford <Col N="401" /> and Cavan.  Notwithstanding that the survey is proceeding slowly&mdash;I suggest it should proceed much faster&mdash;there is strong argument for publishing what has been done already in respect of these three countries.  I understand that the County Louth survey has been completed for more than ten years and has been gathering dust on the shelves of the Office of Public Works where nobody except the staff can see the result of ten years' work in surveying the ancient monuments of County Louth.  The same applies, only for a lesser period, in regard to the survey done in my own County Meath and in County Monaghan.  It seems to be a great waste of public resources that the Board of Works should do a survey of this nature of something which is of intense public interest and allow that survey to remain unpublished particularly when one bears in mind, given that the survey has been in operation for almost 20 years and has involved staff of various grades up to probably ten people, that it has probably cost about £500,000 or more over the entire period.  This is a considerable amount of money and that the result of the expenditure of such a sum of money should not be available to public inspection is to my mind a matter of some concern, whether the information is of great interest or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other arguments for publishing the survey.  First, publishing the results of the survey of the counties in which it has been carried out would make available to people all over the world information which is not now available in a comprehensive form about all our ancient monuments, ring forts, medieval sites and other material of immence interest.  There are more remains of Celtic civilisation in this country than in any other and there is intense international interest in these remains.  Yet people who want a comprehensive guide to all the available sites in this country cannot get it because it has not been published notwithstanding that the Board of Works has been collecting that information for 20 years.  If the survey were published it would lead to much greater international interest in Irish <Col N="402" /> archaeology and would boost tourism because people like to see things of archaeological interest when on holiday. If there were more interest internationally as a result of the publication of this survey in Irish archaeological remains and more international discussion of the subject, more tourists would come here.  Therefore, publication of the document would contribute to tourism.</P>
    <P>Publication of the survey would greatly assist in preventing the destruction of many national monuments.  In the course of land reclamation work particularly, and also other developments, large numbers of monuments are being destroyed.  Ancient monuments which cannot be replaced are being bulldozed. In one parish of Nobber in north County Meath an archaeologist who recently carried out a survey there discovered that in that small parish six ring forts had been destroyed which had been previously recorded as existing there.  In County Wicklow there are records of 16 medieval moated sites, but in a recent survey it was shown that only two or three of them still exist.  The remaining 13 or 14 have disappeared in the course of land reclamation.</P>
    <P>Officers of the Department of Agriculture who are concerned with giving grants for land reclamation are very anxious to stop this kind of activity as also are local people, I feel sure, but at present they do not have the power, the ability or the knowledge to do so because they have no list of the relevant sites which they can consult and say: &ldquo;There is a site of particular interest on Johnny Murphy's farm at Nobber and if any agricultural development takes place in that area we must ensure that nothing happens to destroy this particular monument.&rdquo; Such a document could be on the shelves of the county council planning department so that any planning application in respect of any townland and inrespect of which there was an entry in the book could be immediately checked to ensure that nothing in the planning application could destroy the ancient monument.  The same result could be achieved by having the survey available <Col N="403" /> to the farm development service so that any land reclamation work in a townland could be cross-checked to ensure that it would not interfere with any previously recorded monument.</P>
    <P>That information is not now available in that form and, unless either the county council planning officials or the Department of Agriculture inspectors actually see in the course of approving the proposed work that there is a monument of some interest there, they can do nothing about stopping that work.  Most of them are not trained to recognise such monuments and, perfectly innocently, might easily approve, even while intending to avoid such a situation, a particular land reclamation programme or housing development which would interfere with the monument without knowing they were doing so.  These monuments are not always things that stand up; they may very well be underground. If the project is approved, the work is done and by the time the Board of Works discover this the monument is gone.  If the survey were published and available to all these official agencies this situation could be avoided without any inspection, by simply looking up the book to see if there was a recorded monument in the townland concerned and ensuring that any development work did not interfere with the monument. That would be of immense benefit.</P>
    <P>The rate of destruction of these monuments is alarming in this country.  I would say that up to half the monuments in parts of rural Ireland have already been destroyed.  There was a tremendous furore about the destruction of Wood Quay but I believe far more destruction is taking place every day in other parts of the country without any public controversy and without measures being taken to prevent it.  I should like to see this interest extended and, if the survey were published as I propose, it would be a useful contribution.  If there were frequent publications of this work it would improve the whole ethos and the morale of the national monuments section of the Board of Works.  If they were working <Col N="404" /> towards specific publications for specific counties there would be much more impetus to get the work done.  At the moment they are producing a survey on particular monuments in the knowledge that when the work is done and everything is completed painstakingly all that will happen is that the report will remain on a shelf and not be published. It would be surprising if the archaeologists engaged in the survey were not a little demoralised&mdash;in County Louth their work has been completed for almost ten years but has not yet been published&mdash;by the fact that they are not working towards any particular target at all.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Finance gave a commitment to publish this survey in reply to a question I put to him about six months ago.  I am raising this matter again not because I belive that there is any suggestion that his successor would wish to go back on the commitment previously given&mdash;I am sure he would wish to honour it&mdash;but to get the maximum pressure brought to bear on having this material published quickly. Although a government may decide to publish something, unless continued pressure is put on them it may not be published for many years.  I hope in raising this matter this evening that I will be able to get this survey published quickly.</P>

      <P>The Archaeological Survey of the Republic was initiated in 1963, and field work commenced in 1965 in County Louth. The aim of the survey is the systematic recording of all monuments in the country, (a) to enable the Commissioners to formulate a comprehensive programme for the protection and preservation of monuments of national importance and (b) as an aid towards historical studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey is in two parts, first, an inventory of all monuments of every period and second, a scientific survey of each monument depending on its state of preservation.  It is intended that the results of the survey will be published and the question of publication is being <Col N="405" /> actively considered at present but no indication can be given at this stage as to when publication will take place.</P>
    <P>The Archaeological Survey has been completed in Louth, Monaghan and Meath.  The survey of Westmeath will be completed in 1980.  In Longford, Cavan, Kildare, Dublin and Offaly preliminary surveys have been carried out.</P>
    <P>Through lack of suitably qualified staff, either architects or architectural historians, it has not yet been possible to undertake the scientific survey of architectural monuments.  Recently, however, an architectural historian (senior archaeologist) has been allocated to the preparation of the preliminary inventory for County Dublin.  The authorised fulltime staff of the survey until recently was one senior archaeologist, two archaeologists and three surveyors, working under the general guidance of the Chief Archaeologist.  However, to expedite the work two additional archaeologists and a draftsman have been released from the general staff of the National Monuments Section and have been temporarily assigned to the survey in recent years.</P>
    <P>Much preparatory work for the publication of the survey for the counties where the field work has been completed has been done.  However, strength of the survey staff up to now did not allow of any archaeologists being assigned fulltime to this task.  The momentum of <Col N="406" /> the field work had to be maintained and, if staff were diverted from this, many more monuments would have been destroyed before they were reached.  The survey material however was availed of all the time to afford protection to threatened monuments brought to notice through the Department of Agriculture's inspectors, Land Commission inspectors, local authorities and conservation interests.  In the past ten years 269 monuments in the counties where the survey has been in operation have been afforded legal protection, 223 subject to listing order and 46 subject to preservation order.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Public Service have sanctioned additional staff for the survey as follows: one senior archaeologist, three archaeologists and two surveyors, to enable an additional survey team to be set up and to allow of one archaeologist being assigned to preparing survey material for publication. When these posts are filled, greater progress will be made both in the field work and towards publication of the survey in respect of the counties where the field work had been completed.</P>

      <P>The structure and general staffing arrangements appropriate for the new Department, at this initial stage of its operation, have been settled only within the past couple of days.  Discussions have taken place with staff representatives and I will now be putting these decisions into effect.</P>
      <P>The structure provides for three divisions, the Geological Survey Office, and the usual additional staff to handle personnel and ancillary services.  One division will deal with energy supply and utilisation, including conservation; the second with petroleum and minerals exploration and development; and the third will be responsible for planning and finance.  Each of these divisions will be under the control of an assistant secretary with appropriate supporting staff.  The Geological Survey is headed by a director.</P>
      <P>One hundred and seventy-four officers&mdash;including 84 serving in the GSO&mdash;have been transferred into the Department in conjunction with the transfer of specific blocks of work.

    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> Apart from the GSO, in which almost all the staff are professional and technical officers, the new structure provides for 13 posts to be filled by people with various specified professional, scientific or technical qualifications or training.  These will be primarily engaged on the exploration side and on planning. Certain of these posts are already filled under the transfer of staff and functions arrangements referred to.  Some of the new appointments to be made will be to permanent posts and the remainder will be made on the basis most appropriate in each case&mdash;for example, by secondment or under limited-term contracts.</P>
    <P>The Department has no research facilities under its direct control but, in pursuance of its general role, it will be taking up with the various scientific and research organisations and institutions, including the National Board for Science and Technology, the question of developing an overall, co-ordinated policy in the field of energy research.</P>
    <P>As regards relationships with the various bodies and energy sectors referred to by the Deputies, these are in certain cases already prescribed by statute, such as for the ESB, Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis Éireann.  In these and other cases the optimum working arrangements with my Department will be discussed and developed over a period of time.  I have already arranged to meet the boards of all the State bodies under the aegis of my Department and I will be extending this process to ensure appropriate consultation with the non-State interests.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Quinn</b> asked the Minister for Energy if it is proposed to undertake studies concerning energy planning in this country, to draw up proposals for the conservation of energy in existing buildings with particular reference to space heating and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Energy planning in a national context involves <Col N="350" /> the development and coordination of a whole range of policies of which conservation is only one, although a most important, element.</P>
      <P>A number of studies in regard to energy conservation have been carried out in recent years, a number of which were commissioned by the Departments with responsibility for energy at the relevant times.  Among these studies are <i>Energy Conservation in Ireland 1975-85</i> undertaken by Dr. Henry of the ESRI and published in 1976, six comprehensive Energy Management Manuals for different industrial sectors drawn up by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in 1978 and 1979, <i>Energy Conservation Options in Housing,</i> published by the IIRS in 1979.  A study on <i>Efficiency and Energy Conservation Potential of Domestic Heating Systems</i> is being carried out by An Foras Forbartha and will shortly be completed and a report published.  In addition, a number of studies have been done independently by State bodies.  Studies relevant to this question have also been carried out within the European Economic Community. Apart altogether from studies, specific regulations in regard to conservation standards in domestic buildings have been introduced by the Department of the Environment and similar regulations applicable to other sectors are being considered.  In addition to all this the IIRS has introduced a wide ranging programme of testing, advisory and other services particularly aimed at the industrial commercial and public sectors. The institute also provides a back-up service for the IDA in relation to the assessment of the energy-saving aspects of new industrial projects covering both processes and buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that at this stage, before proceeding with further studies on a substantial scale, the most sensible and productive approach would be to review all the work that is being done in the field of conservation; to make an attempt to assess the effectiveness of the schemes or measures; and to secure some degree of co-ordination at national level of the objectives and activities of the many public <Col N="351" /> and private bodies operating in this field. Such a comprehensive review of the situation would enable me to identify with a greater degree of confidence the conservation aspects which are most in need of further study and development.</P>

      <P>Liquid petroleum gas accounted for about 2 per cent of total primary energy consumption in this country in 1979.  I am well aware that this small percentage figure disguises the importance of this fuel in certain uses, particularly for domestic cooking and heating, and I am keeping in close contact with the industry here regarding the immediate supply situation and future prospects for the industry.</P>
      <P>The immediate prospects for supplies is satisfactory but, as with other oil products, supplies and prices of liquid petroleum gas are subject to fluctuations as a consequence of the unsettled situation of the oil market generally.  The availability and price of this product in the long term must therefore give cause for some concern and I will be considering what can be done to achieve a greater degree of security of supply.</P>

During that period the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces as a whole and of many corps in particular were subjected to intensive review, resulting in revision of the ranks of many appointments and in increases in the establishments of 3,766 all ranks.  While there was no significant change in the ratio of officers to other ranks in the revised establishment, the percentage of non-commissioned officer appointments in the Defence Forces rose from 28.8 per cent to 32.8 per cent and the percentage of appointments in the rank of private dropped from 60.6 per cent to 57.1 per cent.</P>

      <P>The non-commissioned ranks provided for a unit or formation of the Defence Forces depend on the type of structure to be catered for.  Thus in an infantry battalion of the Permanent Defence Force or comparable combatant formation the highest non-commissioned officer rank is sergeant-major, to which rank any suitably qualified non-commissioned officer can aspire.  The highest non-commissioned rank provided in such a formation for a purely administrative appointment on the &ldquo;A&rdquo; administrative staff is sergeant. One such appointment is provided in establishments for each infantry battalion and field artillery regiment of the Permanent Defence Force and for each infantry battalion and three field artillery regiments of an Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil&mdash;a total of 35 appointments in all.</P>

      <P>The selling technique referred to as a &ldquo;dutch auction&rdquo; can be regarded as subject to the provisions of the Occasional Trading Act, 1979 if, but only if, the selling is taking place at a premises or place, of which the seller has been in occupation for a continuous period of less than three months.  It should be remembered that the purpose of that Act was to control the selling of goods from short term locations and not to regulate any particular methods of sale.</P>
      <P>I have had inspections made of a number of premises in the areas mentioned. Further enquiries are necessary in order to establish definitely the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Occasional Trading Act of the activities concerned.</P>
      <P>In the event of it being established that there has been trading in contravention of the Occasional Trading Act, there is no power to require the close-down of a business.  However, a person engaging in unauthorised occasional trading is liable, on conviction on indictment, to very substantial penalties which are set out in section 9 (1) of the Act.</P>

      <P>The Land Registry has been undergoing a process of reorganisation since 1970. A central feature of the reorganisation is the allocation of all the work appertaining to a particular region of the country to a specific group which is comprised of legal, clerical and mapping staff.  There are five such groups.  This scheme, while not yet fully implemented, is already proving very successful and has considerably improved the efficiency of the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>Another feature of the reorganisation is that, as part of a planned programme which will take some years to implement in full, maps of holdings are being attached to the folios to which the holdings relate.  In this way a comprehensive record of title will be readily available to a registered owner.  Copies of the document (folio and map combined) can be produced photographically thus obviating the need for the time-consuming process of drawing maps by hand.</P>
      <P>A further improvement planned is the computerisation of the Land Registry records.  It is not possible to say yet how soon this can be started.</P>
      <P>Mapping staff are employed on a variety of tasks, of which the production of copy maps is only one.  It is not, accordingly, possible to give a meaningful answer to the question about the ratio of mappers to maps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 377 together.</P>
      <P>At present, the time-lag between the date of setting down of an action for trial by jury and the date of its coming up for hearing is in some cases as long as 16 months in Dublin and Cork.  In Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny the time-lag is at most six months.  The High Court will be on circuit at those venues during the month of March when it is expected that the lists will be brought up to date.</P>
      <P>In the case of non-jury actions the time-lag between the date of setting down and the date of hearing is approximately three months.</P>
      <P>The number of jury actions set down and awaiting hearing at those venues at present is: Dublin, 1,558; Cork, 381; Limerick, 87; Galway, 115; Kilkenny, 4.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to civil jury actions in Dublin and Cork deteriorated in 1979 when, because of the postal dispute, it was not possible to serve jury summonses, with the result that no such actions could be held from 9 March 1979 until the commencement of the Michaelmas law term on 1 October 1979.  This accounted for almost seven months of the time-lag of 16 months already referred to.  When the hearing of jury actions resumed in Dublin, however, a total of 542 such actions was disposed of during the Michaelmas term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the present situation insofar as arrears are concerned but I am hopeful that arrangements which the President of the High Court has made for the disposal of court business over the coming months will <Col N="361" /> considerably reduce the current time-lag in the hearing of jury actions.</P>
    <P>Two additional High Court judges were appointed in October last but since Judge Costello has been involved fulltime in holding the Whiddy Island Disaster Inquiry to the exclusion of ordinary court business, the effective strength of the High Court has, for the moment, only been increased by one.</P>

      <P>The obligation of certain tenants to collect ground rents from other persons and to pay those rents to their ground landlord is one that arises only on foot of private contractual arrangements made between the persons concerned or their predecessors in title.  I have no information as to the number of these cases nor as to the extent to which absentee landlords are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was adverted to by the Ground Rents Commission in their <i>Report on Ground Rents</i> (Pr. 7783) and section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, gives effect to the recommendations of the Commission in that regard.  The provisions of section 11 enable most of the persons who are under an obligation of the kind in question to rid themselves of that obligation if they wish to do so.  Where the relevant lease is a &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; or a &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo;, section 11 of the 1967 Act gives the person concerned the right to have the total rent apportioned so that each tenant becomes directly liable to the ground landlord for his share only of the rent.  Section 44 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1979, which is at present before the House, proposes to extend that right to <Col N="362" /> lessees under every known type of ground rent lease.  Such tenants would, of course, also have the right to acquire the fee simple under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.</P>

      <P>An internal investigation was carried out immediately after the riot and, based on this, I issued a statement, a copy of which is appended.  Subsequently, the Garda Síochána were called in to carry out an investigation.  It is understood that the investigation has been completed and that the file is now with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement issued by the Government Information Services on behalf of the Department of Justice:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disturbance started about 7.30 p.m. when prisoners in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; wing were leaving workshops in order to collect their supper on the first floor of the wing.  When the prisoners reached the end of the wing where the supper was awaiting them some of them threw the utensils etc. about and rushed at the 12 prison officers who were in charge of the wing.  The total number of prisoners was 105 but not all of them were involved in the disturbance.  The prison officers managed to get out of the wing and the prisoners then barricaded themselves in and commenced to smash up furniture and unhinge cell doors.  The alert was sounded and extra staff and gardaí were called in.  In addition, the Dublin Fire Brigade came with extra hoses for prison staff to use.  Army personnel also stood by.  As the rioting continued hoses were played on the rioters on both ends of the wing and the prison officers assisted by gardaí broke their way into the wing. Holes had been made in the passageways known as the cat-walks at the <Col N="363" /> point where prison officers would enter, presumably so that they would fall through and injure themselves.  In fact one prison officer and one prisoner did fall through to the floor beneath but luckily they were not seriously injured. The prisoners were removed from the wing and arrangements were made to accommodate some of them for the night in other parts of the prison.</P>
    <P>Injuries of various kinds were received by 26 members of the staff and by 36 prisoners.  Three members of the staff and 23 prisoners were taken to various hospitals but only one person, a prisoner, was detained overnight.</P>
    <P>Eighty-four prisoners were being accommodated in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; wing this morning and work has already begun to repair the damage.  The estimated cost of the repairs is of the order of a few thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>The disturbance was quite unexpected. No complaints had been made by any of the prisoners and it is assumed that the intention was to make difficulties for the prison administration.  In fact some of the prisoners in &ldquo;A&rdquo; wing had been interviewed by the Visiting Committee of the prison yesterday morning and had made no complaints.  Investigations are continuing.  No decision in regard to disciplinary action has been taken.  The Chairman of the Visiting Committee in accordance with normal practice after a disturbance will visit the prison to-day.</P>
    <P>Among the newspaper accounts this morning there were suggestions that there was overcrowding in the prison and that fires were started round &ldquo;A&rdquo; wing.  There was in fact no overcrowding and the only fire started was a minor one, directed it is thought against a prisoner who refused to take part in the disturbance.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A&rdquo; wing contains the more difficult prisoners, several of them convicted of very serious offences such as robbery and serious assaults.  All the prisoners involved in the disturbance had been convicted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> Visits will not be allowed to-day to prisoners who were in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; wing yesterday.</P>

Experience has shown that compulsory measures can be counterproductive and I would in any event prefer to persuade rather than compel parents and children to cultivate healthy dietary patterns including a balanced intake of fruit.  The Deputy can be assured that I will continue to stimulate relevant agencies to maintain their educational programmes in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the school authorities are increasingly conscious of the need to take dietary patterns fully into account when considering issues such as the sale and distribution of sweets in schools.  For example, during the recent Dental Health Week, over 600,000 competition leaflets stressing the importance of careful eating were issued through the school authorities for completion by pupils.  Over 500,000 completed forms were returned, indicating awareness and interest on the part of school authorities, <Col N="370" /> teachers and pupils in this subject.</P>
    <P>I am informed that a trader's licence is not required by school shops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reasons the maintenance allowance for deserted wives is £15.00 while this allowance is £21.00 per week for a single mother and if he will remedy this discrepancy in view of the similar circumstances of the people involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no discrepancy between the amount of social assistance allowance payable to a deserted wife and a single mother.</P>
      <P>A deserted wife, who has no qualified child residing with her and whose means do not exceed £6 weekly, is entitled to the allowance at the maximum rate of £16.80 a week (£15.80 a week prior to October 1979).  She is, however, entitled to an increase of £5.50 a week in respect of each qualified child residing with her. The rate with one child is therefore £22.30.</P>
      <P>Social assistance allowance is payable to an unmarried (single) mother only when she has at least one qualified child residing with her.  The maximum rate of allowance payable with one child, £22.30 a week (£21.00 prior to October 1979), is equal to the maximum rate payable to a deserted wife with one child.</P>
