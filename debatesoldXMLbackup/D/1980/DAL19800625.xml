      <P>As we approach the summer recess it is opportune to look back over our work here in the Oireachtas during the first six months of the year, to assess what we have achieved, and to look forward to what needs to be done for the rest of the year and beyond.</P>
      <P>In parliamentary terms we have done well.  A considerable amount of legislation has been enacted.  We have scrutinised the financial estimates much more thoroughly, and in greater detail, than has been the practice for some years now and we have also succeeded in providing more time for special debates and for discussing relevant current matters.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most important debate in the last session was that on Northern Ireland at the end of last month.  Because it took place so recently, I shall not now go over the same ground as I covered in opening that debate.  I do wish, however, to reiterate my view that the situation in Northern Ireland is the major issue in our country today.  Our aim is the unity of all the people of Ireland in peace and harmony and the achievement of that aim is our first political priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> The publication of a new document by the British Government on Northern Ireland is expected shortly.  While it would be injudicious to comment in advance on any particular proposal it may contain, I believe it is important that I should state, again, our view that a proposal which is not acceptable to all the community in Northern Ireland and which does not recognise the reality of the physical, political, social and economic relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country will not succeed and it is only in the context of new and closer political co-operation between the Irish and British Governments that a permanent and lasting solution will be found.</P>
    <P>In reporting to the Dáil on the Venice Summit, I referred briefly to the present state of the European Community and to the main problems facing the Community and the implications which these problems of the Community and the Community approach to them will have for Ireland.  In the course of that debate, reference was made to the extra contribution this country will make to the budget of the Community as a result of the settlement of the British budgetary difficulties.</P>
    <P>The first aspect of this situation to be taken into account is the fact that we are net recipients from the Community and net recipients this year to the extent of £360 million.  That money flows to this country from the budget because that is the way in which Community policies are designed under the treaties.  We are benefiting or losing from these policies in precisely the same way as other member states are benefiting or losing.</P>
    <P>While this is true, it must be remembered that this long, difficult and intense debate was about the extent to which member states were either net contributors or net recipients.  Attention was specifically focused on these very specific sums of money, plus or minus, which were involved for the different member states.  Our place in the plus table was a clearly evident one.</P>
    <P>It was also equally evident that we stood to gain to a substantial extent immediately <Col N="1835" /> this year through the additional funds which would flow to us from the set of proposals which were blocked by the failure to resolve the British budgetary problem.</P>
    <P>The amount of these additional funds is estimated at about £75 million in the current year.  In strictly budgetary and financial terms, therefore, in contrasting the additional inflow of about £75 million against the additional contribution of £8 million, there was no doubt as to where our best interests lay.  But there was, of course, a great deal more involved than that.  It was clearly in the best interest of every member state, and none more so than ourselves, to get away from the dissension which was impeding the work of the Community and its development.</P>
    <P>The settlement furthermore cleared the way for the whole agricultural package which in addition to the increase in prices for products contained a number of other very significant benefits for us.  These included the inauguration of a new policy for sheep, progress in regard to fisheries policy, agricultural development proposals for the west of Ireland and, of very considerable importance for us, the abandonment of the supplementary milk levy and the proposal to suspend the system of beef intervention for part of the year.  Against this background of progress and benefits in so many areas, the additional contribution called for from us could not, on any basis of logic or reason, have justified us standing in the way of the solution to the British budgetary problem arrived at so painfully and after so much dissension.</P>
    <P>The Community, in common with the rest of the industrialised western world, is going through a period of high inflation, rising unemployment, low growth and growing balance of payments deficits.  The main cause of the current economic problems of the Community is the fact that oil, on which the Community is so heavily dependent for its energy, has increased two-and-a-half times in price in the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> A Community approach to this international problem is progressively emerging. Its essentials are, to reduce dependence on imported oil by developing alternative sources and by greater economy in the use of oil.  At Venice, also, the need for a dialogue with the oil-producing nations was stressed and it was agreed that such a dialogue should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Community has committed itself internally to changes in its structures which could well be of very great importance to us.  This commitment arises out of the recent solution to the British budgetary contribution problem, and from the imminent approach of Community expenditures to the upper limit of its own resources.  These are serious issues with far-reaching implications.  It is clear that we are in for a protracted period of debate and negotiation on the future policies and mechanisms of the Community.  In the aftermath of the settlement of the British budgetary problem, an outlook has been developing in Community circles which has important implications for the future development of the Community.</P>
    <P>As I indicated when reporting to the Dáil on the Venice Summit, an entirely new emphasis is now being given to the status of the budget, to the possible detriment of the ideals and principles of the Treaties and we shall have to draw attention to the longer-term repercussions of this approach.  I would like to reiterate that while the budget is an important instrument of Community policy, it is only one of a complex of policies and mechanisms which go to make up the Community as a whole. This new mood is nowhere more clearly illustrated than in the attacks which are now being made on the common agricultural policy.  It is our policy to steadfastly and consistently resist these attacks because we believe that the common agricultural policy represents one of the major, political, economic and social achievements of the Community and that without it the Community would be a greatly diminished Community and a much less coherent political entity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> We intend to point out also that the major industrial partners have done well out of the Community and that the Community has not been a one-sided affair. We recognise that reforms are needed in the common agricultural policy and that the problem of surpluses in some areas must be dealt with but we shall press to have the real origins of these surpluses clearly identified so that the remedies proposed are directed towards the root of the problem which will be found, in many cases, to be imports of substantial quantities of the products concerned from third countries.</P>
    <P>The Commission, taking into account the general international economic situation, is of the opinion and this opinion, indeed, is shared by most of the member Governments of the Community that, for the present, priority must be awarded to reducing the rate of inflation and the balance of payments and budgetary deficits and that, for this reason, a regime of physical and monetary restraint should be continued.  This view was again reiterated at the Western Economic Summit which has just concluded in Venice where classical orthodoxy seems to have prevailed completely. We cannot therefore expect any initiatives at Community level to deal with unemployment or to endeavour to generate economic activity at Community level.  So far as our economic problems are concerned, it is clear that while our membership of the Community provides us with a very strong economic base and an essential support system, we cannot expect that Community economic policies in the short term will contribute to a solution.  We shall have to rely on our own efforts to deal with them.  Our own actions and behaviour and the measures we take will determine our success in overcoming our difficulties.  Like the other members of the Community we must continue consistently with our efforts to restore order to our public finances but in our case we must, at the same time, ensure that by good economic management the <Col N="1838" /> measures we take to get our finances under control do not deflate the economy to any harmful extent.</P>
    <P>We will not deflate because deflation is not appropriate in our circumstances. Our economy is still a developing economy and the sort of deflationary policies which might be embarked upon by countries where economic development is at a much higher level than ours would not, at this stage, be suitable for us.  In our efforts to deal with our budget deficit, our balance of payments deficit, excessive borrowing and high inflation, we must be careful not to depress economic activity to a level from which it would be very difficult for it to recover within a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>The budget introduced this year was entirely appropriate to the economic situation.  It had to secure a balance between a number of conflicting demands and is succeeding in doing this.  It is on course and the strategy on which it was based must be maintained.  Government expenditure and borrowing must continue to be kept within sustainable levels.  The task facing the Government, therefore, at present must be, within these constraints, to maintain economic activity at the highest level and to ensure that the financial policies which we are forced to adopt will not inhibit unduly our efforts to secure the highest possible levels of employment.  That is clearly a difficult and complex management objective but we are determined to undertake it.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of Government economic and social policy is the attainment of full employment based on an expanding economy and sound public finances, with a special emphasis on the consistent improvement in the standard of living of the poorer and weaker sections of the Community.  We intend to pursue that objective notwithstanding the many economic difficulties which we are encountering at present.</P>
    <P>I would now like to look in some greater detail at the different aspects of our economic situation.  Because of its significance to our gross national <Col N="1839" /> product, external trade is an area of major importance.  Export performance, the level of imports, the terms of trade and the balance of trade are of crucial importance to our rate of growth.</P>
    <P>The present international economic scene is, to say the least of it, discouraging with many countries adopting a restrictive approach to economic policy and with very low or negative growth forecast for some of the key areas to which we will be exporting.  In the European Community as a whole, for instance, growth is expected to be a mere 1½ per cent and in the OECD area as a whole, it is expected to be only 1¼ per cent.  This reduction in growth is common to all countries and, in particular, the United States and the United Kingdom are expected to have negative rates of growth.</P>
    <P>The European Community as a whole, had a current account deficit for the first quarter of 1980 of 10 billion dollars, compared with a small surplus in the first quarter of 1979.  Some of the strongest European economies are having balance of payments deficits for the first time for many years.  It is against this type of international financial situation that we must decide our own course of action.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments is for us the basic economic indicator in this area.  It has always been recognised that as a developing economy, moderate balance of payments deficits are acceptable in our case.</P>
    <P>Since we broke the link with sterling and joined the EMS, the balance of payments has assumed greater importance both as a measuring rod of economic performance and as an element in monetary policy.  But our basic position is still the same in regard to the acceptability of moderate deficits.  We cannot permit any undue preoccupation with the balance of payments to interfere with our primary economic objectives.</P>
    <P>While we must continue to watch the balance of payments and to assess the different measures we consider taking for their likely effects on it, there are <Col N="1840" /> nonetheless a number of encouraging signs.  Because of the sound management of our public finances, domestic and international confidence has ensured that the Irish pound is remarkably stable in the European Monteary System.  Recently also despite the fact that the terms of trade have moved heavily against us, particularly in regard to oil prices, there is evidence that the balance of payments deficit is being stabilised.</P>
    <P>Our objectives in this area are clearly defined.  We must promote industrial and agricultural exports by every means available to us and develop our earnings from tourism to the greatest extent we can in the face of current difficulties in this area.  We must seek out those areas in our existing export markets where there is still growth and search for new markets which recent experience shows can be found and developed.  Córas Tráchtála are engaged in an active review of these possibilities.  They have a number of special measures under consideration and they do not by any means take a pessimistic view of our prospects. Bord Bainne and CBF are undertaking similar activities.</P>
    <P>An active campaign of import substitution is required and the public sector are fully committed to such a programme. Because oil imports represent such a serious imposition on our balance of payments situation we have a very real interest in efforts being made to recycle petro-dollars.  We have expressed the view that the Community should endeavour to ensure that member states are enabled to finance their oil imports on the most favourable possible terms and will press for action on these lines.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in the European Community has risen to six million and there is the prospect of a further increase this year and next.  This is due both to low economic growth and to the fact that there will be some four million new entrants a year in the labour market in the early eighties.  At present it must be recognised that the Community, as such, has no proposal to undertake any action in regard to unemployment despite being pressed to do so by the trade union <Col N="1841" /> movement throughout Europe.  Our figures in this country reflect the overall European scene.</P>
    <P>The Government see unemployment as the major social problem.  In particular we are concerned about the high number of school leavers seeking their first employment this year.  Our approach to the problem is both comprehensive and detailed.  The public capital programme has been directed primarily towards the maintenance and creation of employment.  Capital for infrastructure, telecommunications, energy and the industrial promotion agencies has been significantly increased in real terms.</P>
    <P>The State-sponsored bodies concerned with economic and commercial development have been requested to explore every possibility open to them for economic development and job creation. In particular they have been asked to maintain their recruitment of apprentices and trainees at the highest possible level. It is to industrial development of course that we must look, principally, for the jobs we need.  This is now a two-fold task.  We must not alone, as we have been doing so successfully, create new jobs, but we must also seek to minimise the haemorrhage of job losses, which are reaching unacceptable levels.</P>
    <P>The prospects for industry this year, bearing in mind the international growth climate, are good.  Output growth in manufacturing at 5 per cent is expected to be the highest in the European Community. At least 25,000 new manufacturing jobs will be created this year and job approvals under the IDA are expected to be about 30,000.  In fact, job approvals negotiated in the first five months of this year at 13,800 represent the best ever January-May performance by the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Government development priorities, set out in the 1980 Public Capital Programme, have been particularly directed to the achievement of industrial growth.  The funds for infrastructure, telecommunications and <Col N="1842" /> the ESB will significantly assist industrial development also.  There has been no slackening, therefore, in spite of our economic difficulties and constraints, in the drive to expand our manufacturing capacity.  This new manufacturing capacity consists in the main of technologically-advanced, high-productivity industry with great growth potential in employment and exports. The Government will continue to make funds available to the greatest extent possible for infrastructural and industrial development.  Small home-based industries will be assisted by the provision of technological advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>The new National Enterprise Agency will identify new opportunities for industrial and service employment.  It will, in particular, seek a domestic response to the new employment possibilities identified.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council, which as Deputies know is representative of the main economic and social interests in our society, has been asked to review overall industrial policy and to make early recommendations to Government on it.</P>
    <P>The possibility of increasing employment in the agricultural industry is also being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>Job creation is unfortunately however only one side of the equation.  It is job losses which are pulling down our overall employment situation.  The considerable success of our job creation programme is being heavily eroded by job losses in industries unable to compete in present market conditions.  Two major factors contributing to this situation are unrealistic pay settlements and intransigent attitudes to restrictive practices and productivity.</P>
    <P>The cost of credit for working capital is adding greatly to the difficulties of a number of firms and is frequently the cause of job losses.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Finance and for Industry, Commerce and Tourism have had this problem of working capital for industry under active examination for some time and will shortly be bringing <Col N="1843" /> forward a scheme to assist in this area. Furthermore, the Government look forward to a reduction in interest rates generally as soon as conditions make this possible.</P>
    <P>High inflation rates are now an international problem.  Most countries have put control on inflation by rigid monetary and fiscal policies as their major economic objective.  The increase in inflation rates over 1979 is about 50 per cent in most Community countries.  On average the rate for the Community is expected to be 12.3 per cent in 1980 as compared with 9 per cent in 1979 and 7.1 per cent in 1978.</P>
    <P>Basically the acceleration in inflation rates is due to the high increase in oil prices in 1979 and 1980.  As already indicated, crude oil prices in the Community are now nearly two and a half times what they were at the beginning of 1979.  Since Ireland is the most open economy in the Community, with imports running at over 65 per cent of GNP, we import external price increases to a greater extent than any of our trading partners.</P>
    <P>The present high rate of inflation has two major consequences for policy: first that we should not add to it by domestic income increases we cannot afford; and, second, that the weaker sections of society be protected from its effects.</P>
    <P>This latter objective was a major Government priority in the 1980 Budget. It involved increases ranging from 20 to 25 per cent to social welfare beneficiaries, and income tax concessions for the lower paid.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate, which was just over 20 per cent at mid-May, should now have reached its peak unless there are further sharp increases in oil prices or unless there are excessive increases in incomes.</P>
    <P>There is some prospect that the staggering increases in oil prices of the last 18 months may not be repeated.  The Government are also determined to make every effort to secure moderation <Col N="1844" /> in incomes.  I believe that responsible people now realise that we must live within our means and that we cannot continue to award ourselves income increases which, because they are not justified by increased output, must be met by borrowing.  I want to repeat that the strongest economies in Europe have already settled for very moderate income increases this year and we have no alternative but to follow suit.</P>
    <P>Overcoming our present economic difficulties will require the full support and the co-operation of the social partners and, equally important, will require a widespread understanding by the general public of the realities of our situation.  A major contribution to success can be made by the achievement of a new national understanding which will be directly related to the needs of the economic situation.  Discussions on such an understanding are now under way and the Minister for Labour, on behalf of the Government, will make every effort to bring them to a successful conclusion. The difficulties are very great with the conflicting pressures on the participating parties.  I want to underline that we attach great importance to these negotiations because a successful outcome would contribute enormously to our efforts to overcome the intense economic difficulties with which we are confronted.</P>
    <P>A new national understanding related to the economic situation would give us something much more than an economic base from which to move forward.  It would give us a major psychological shot in the arm and would give workers, in particular, a sense of security and stability in which a peaceful industrial relations climate can evolve.  Nothing could demonstrate more clearly a national awareness of the economic dangers which confront us and our determination to overcome them than the securing of an agreement on an appropriate understanding.</P>
    <P>I would like to use this occasion to urge the social partners to make every effort to reach an early agreement and to keep constantly in mind the current international <Col N="1845" /> scene which has emerged and in which our economy will have to operate in the times immediately ahead of us.  In economic terms, we are not an island.  We are, more than most, a country which is subject to international and European conditions and we must act accordingly.</P>
    <P>The single most important economic decision facing the community today is the level of incomes we agree to accept over the next 12 months or so.  This decision is central to our whole economic and financial future.  We cannot carry income increases which are out of line with those which have been accepted in Europe generally.</P>
    <P>An unrealistic settlement would increase inflation further and lead directly to a substantial increase in job losses. We are already suffering heavy job losses at present and these, unfortunately, will accelerate if our pay settlements do not give us the breathing space we need. The Government, in order to underline the seriousness of securing a moderation in incomes and in the context of the national understanding discussions, have postponed the implementation of the second phase of the Devlin award in so far as Ministers and Ministers of State are concerned and we will discuss with other categories in the public service a similar postponement in their case also.</P>
    <P>The level of income increases emerging from the national understanding will also have crucial implications for the budgetary situation.  The overall budget deficit must be reduced, and the budget made a significant start in this direction. Any major addition to the bill for public service pay would set us back very considerably.</P>
    <P>Our ability to expand the economy and to increase employment is also heavily dependent on good industrial relations.  Strikes not only reduce national output and earnings but they also inhibit foreign investment.  The vast majority of our employers and employees are fully conscious of this and they do succeed, through patient <Col N="1846" /> negotiation conducted with skill and goodwill, in settling whatever differences may arise.  They anticipate problems and eliminate possible differences by good personnel policies and procedures.  My appeal earlier this year for improved industrial relations has had a positive response.  In the first quarter of this year we had fewer stoppages than in any recent year.  The situation has disimproved in the second quarter, but it is still markedly better than the same quarter of last year.</P>
    <P>It is still bitterly disappointing to find groups in key employment who are prepared, very often by unofficial action, to cause serious disruption in pursuit of increases or benefits which cannot on economic or social grounds justify the damage they cause.  The answer to these situations can only be found through the creation of a general community climate and opinion which will favour conciliation rather than confrontation and which condemns irresponsible and unjustifiable actions in this area.</P>
    <P>The crucial question of industrial relations must also form part of the negotiations of a new national understanding.  In the national interest ways and means of improving industrial relations must be found.  I know it is not easy to find general procedures which can always be successfully applied in particular cases, but we must make it a matter of national pride and self-esteem that we are mature enough so to organise ourselves that costly and destructive stoppages of work can be avoided.  Workers and management in other countries can succeed in doing so and we must constantly ask ourselves where the cause of failure lies in our case.</P>
    <P>The Government are, in the context of the discussions on the national understanding, ready to accept any procedures or actions which the social partners can demonstrate to be useful in improving industrial relations and will give careful consideration to the recommendations expected shortly from the Commission on Industrial Relations.  If we are to continue with the great programme of industrialisation needed <Col N="1847" /> to meet our objective of full employment, there is no alternative to securing a continuing climate of industrial relations comparable with the best obtaining anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Our economic strategy, both domestically and internationally, also has as a top priority the development of the agricultural sector, which is of course, still our greatest industry.  While there has been great progress in recent years, there is scope still for greater progress, as our full potential is far from being realised.</P>
    <P>Due to a combination of factors, last year was not a good year in general for our farmers and some of them incurred fairly serious losses.  The situation with regard to farmer taxation has been uncertain, while the prices farmers receive for their produce have not kept pace with increases in the cost of credit and farm inputs.</P>
    <P>Arising out of these developments and to strengthen farmer confidence in their industry and in the long-term interest of our agriculture, I now wish, on behalf of the Government, to give a number of specific assurances to our farmers.</P>
    <P>Firstly, they can be assured that we will not accept any departure from the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community which has been of such enormous benefit to our farmers in providing guaranteed markets at remunerative prices for their produce.  Secondly, when the resource tax ceases to apply at the end of this year, there will from then on be only one system of taxation on farm profits.  Thirdly, agricultural policy will be administered in the closest possible consultation and co-operation with farming organisations.</P>
    <P>A number of very useful and constructive meetings have been held between the Government and the farmers' representatives to identify problems and suggest solutions.  These meetings will continue.  The Minister for Agriculture will, during the course of this debate, outline our policy for agriculture in greater detail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> Despite the difficulties there is much to encourage us in the present economic situation and outlook.  We are maintaining economic growth at a higher level than many stronger economies.  We are maintaining a high level of new job creation in viable employment.  Our investment programmes, essential for future growth, are at a high level.  We have succeeded in having a good agricultural package adopted by the Community for this year.  Exports went up by nearly 23 per cent in the first 5 months of this year.  We have greatly improved the state of our public finances and the external reserves position is being safeguarded.  The exchange value of our currency within the EMS has remained stable.</P>
    <P>Greater productivity, improved cost-competitiveness, innovation, enterprise and hard work are the key to success in the present harsh international economic climate.  Our economy is so small that even a small development can have an enormous effect on our economic and social progress.  We must seek out every opportunity for growth, no matter how small.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I have been meeting the main State-sponsored bodies concerned in economic and commercial activities and I have been discussing with them how best their enormous potential to contribute to growth and enterprise can be more fully realised.  I am confident that a great deal can be achieved in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a tough period ahead but we are determined to overcome the difficulties facing us.  That is our assurance to the nation.  The real challenge is whether we will get over these difficulties sooner rather than later; whether we will recover quickly or take a longer time to get back to higher standards and better times.</P>
    <P>In either event I give a guarantee that this Government will see to it that the poorer and weaker sections of the community will be protected from the adverse effects of the situation confronting us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> Anyone who might feel dispirited by the state of the world around us or by our internal problems should understand that in fact we have a number of advantages on our side that makes us better placed than most of our partners in Europe to make substantial progress.</P>
    <P>Our prospects in the field of oil exploration are reasonably good.  Industry and agriculture have enormous potential for growth.  Our most important asset of all, however, is our young population. Anyone who goes to a community or sporting event, as I often do and sees the great preponderance there on such occasions of bright, eager young people, full of energy and enthusiasm and a zest for life, cannot but have complete confidence in them and in our country's future and be convinced that whatever the temporary difficulties may be, time is on our side.</P>
    <P>In steering the country through these difficult times, the Government have the most important role, but the trade unions have their part to play and the employers have theirs.  What will really decide the issue, however, is the attitude adopted by individual members of the community and the seriousness and realism with which each person approaches his or her own situation and what decisions they take.</P>
    <P>The reality to which we all must adjust is that the entire western industrialised world has undergone a major piece of economic surgery.</P>
    <P>What the increase in oil prices of the last 18 months really means is that, over and above the normal economic exchanges a major share of the output of goods and services of the western countries, including ourselves, has been transferred to the oil-producing states. That is the true position and it cannot be circumvented.  There is no point either in blaming the Government, employees, trade unions or employers for the consequences of that straightforward transfer. We must accept the economic implication which is that until such time as we make up for that transfer by increasing <Col N="1850" /> our output of goods and services we have to adjust our situation to cope with it.</P>
    <P>If, however, sufficient individuals, seeing clearly what is at stake, decide to genuinely conserve energy and use only what they have to; take a positive stand against strike action until everything else has been tried; resist pressure to demand more in income than they know the traffic will bear; act fairly and considerately if they are employers and responsibly and reasonably if they are workers then we cannot be beaten and we will emerge out of these difficulties safe and sound.</P>
    <P>Severe though the impact of present economic difficulties is, restricted though we are because of the financial constraints now imposed upon us, the path of progress is still open to us and opportunities for further expansion and development in many areas are there to be taken.</P>
    <P>We must, as a nation, see our present difficulties and constraints simply as obstacles along the way to be removed by our own efforts.  Motivated by a spirit of national endeavour, we can, not only make further progress in the years immediately ahead, but we will be ready, when conditions improve, to undertake a major national advance on every front.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the Taoiseach into his numerous excursions to the world outside, a mechanism by means of which he apparently sought to escape some of the more unpleasant realities at home.  He devoted the first quarter of his speech to external issues and returned four times to these in an attempt to distract attention or provide excuses for the Government's failures of performance.  We have had recently several debates on foreign policy, particularly in relation to the Community arising from what could only be described as inquests on recent European Council meetings.  There is no need to go over that ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to concentrate my remarks on domestic issues within this State especially  <Col N="1851" /> as we have had recently a debate on Northern Ireland, as our positions have been made clear and as there is nothing further that can usefully be said until we can judge the British initiative of which I am afraid at this stage few of us have much hope.</P>
    <P>The magnitude of the economic crisis now facing us in default of Government action has to be stressed.  I shall have to develop this theme at some length especially in view of the Taoiseach's failure to face these realities except in one single respect in his reference to redundancies.  This I must do in the hope that belatedly, by identifying these issues, we may force the Government to tackle the problems they have created for us all.</P>
    <P>I should say at the outset that our present difficulties, being largely selfinflicted, can be overcome.  With a Government in power who have themselves created the problems and failed under new leadership even to start the process of solving them, it is inevitable that there should be in the country a mood of depression.  It has to be added that realism requires us to recognise that the external situation is not encouraging but experience has shown that we can transcend our environment. Skilled economic management can, as in 1977, give us soundly-based economic growth at three times the rate of our neighbours, combined with falling inflation, reduced borrowing, falling unemployment and rapidly rising investment.  What was achieved after the first oil crisis by good economic management can be achieved again.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem now is the almost universal lack of confidence under this Fianna Fáil Government.  We have seen the shattering of confidence in the farming sector where there has been a disastrous drop in incomes.  I will return later to this point because the magnitude of the problem is not sufficiently appreciated outside farming circles and certainly not by the Government.  This has been accompanied by an erratic and, for farmers, a nerve-shattering series of attempts to inflict on them taxes to be <Col N="1852" /> paid regardless of whether they have any incomes left.  First, there was the levy and now the resource tax.  These attacks on the viability of the farm sector, where real incomes have fallen by one-third in two years, have been reinforced by the impact of the credit restrictions and high interest rates which the Government's policies have created.</P>
    <P>The first thing to be done is to restore the confidence of farmers.  This can be done by a Fine Gael Government which farmers will recognise as sensitive to their very real problems, while&mdash;as we showed in Government&mdash;insisting that they pay the same share of income earned as the rest of the community.  Impositions like the resource tax must be done away with and one gathers from the Taoiseach's speech that the Government have belatedly realised and accepted this in one of their numerous U-turns which have undermined confidence not only among the farming community but elsewhere.  Steps should be taken by the Government by guaranteeing exchange risks to make credit available to this productive sector at rates which the potential of Irish land at this stage of its development could carry.  If this were done, there is still the possibility of reversing the threatened downturn in agriculture which, if it continues, could affect the ability of Irish agriculture to develop its potential for years to come. There is hope because the potential for growth is there in agriculture if it were released by Government action instead of being repressed.</P>
    <P>The same is true in industry.  The underlying strength of our competitive position in world markets remains and our share of world trade is increasing. But industry too needs to be helped through the present liquidity crisis created by Government policy and needs access to borrowing at more sustainable rates if it is to compete with firms in other countries who have access to capital on this basis.  The Government have failed so far to act here.  Government agencies in industry, unlike agriculture, are situated remote from firms, based entirely in Dublin and <Col N="1853" /> without the network of locally-based people who would know the needs and capacity of individual firms, which cannot be assessed from a distance by people without personal knowledge of such enterprises.</P>
    <P>I repeat that present difficulties in industry, as in agriculture, can be alleviated and even removed.  The problem for most firms is not that they cannot compete or lack the potential for expansion; it is that they are being torpedoed by credit restrictions and high interest rates which are putting them out of action.  Aided by the high value of sterling, our firms have a competitive advantage in their major market, which for domestic firms is the main market and in some cases the only market, if they can be helped through the present crisis, instead of being forced into liquidation by Government policies.  The Taoiseach has referred to a scheme to assist in these areas and says this matter has been under active consideration for some time and perhaps something will happen in this regard in the months ahead.  It is not good enough that firm after firm is forced into liquidation and jobs are lost irretrievably over months during which the Government have, apparently been considering the matter but failing to act.</P>
    <P>Tourism, too, has a potential for the future if it can survive the present crisis and should be helped so as to ensure that our tourist infrastructure does not disappear, leaving us without the means to cater for visitors in future years.  Our spokesman on tourism, Deputy Hegarty has recently outlined steps which can be taken towards this end.</P>
    <P>In all we do to restore our economy to health in each of these sectors we must give priority to the problems of young people in education&mdash;where the Government have with great insensitivity concentrated cuts in spending which would have been better tackled elsewhere&mdash;in housing and in employment.  The younger generation must be given hope and must have an assurance that those who are the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; in society, having property or having jobs, are willing to <Col N="1854" /> sacrifice some of their material prosperity to release the resources needed to give the young a chance. Employment for young people cannot be provided on a sufficient scale in the short term&mdash;and perhaps not even in the long term&mdash;within the existing parameters. Problems that stand in the way of youth employment, such as the working of excessive regular overtime, must be tackled as proposed by a working party on this subject whose recommendation the Government have promised to implement but about which we have heard nothing, as usual, since it was published several months ago.  We must also seek to release more jobs for the young by facilitating the retirement of older people who want to retire, many of whom could and would wish to take on useful work in voluntary organisations where they could apply their skills, if their pension arrangements could be adjusted to make this possible.  We must apply some imagination to this problem of youth unemployment which this year looks like reaching alarming proportions.</P>
    <P>All these problems can be tackled by skilful and imaginative economic management, especially if they are seen to be tackled within the framework of a realistic plan for recovery and development. The discrediting of the phoney planning of earlier years of this Fianna Fáil administration should not prevent this Government from tackling the planning problem on a sound basis and restoring the confidence of people in the capacity of our economy to survive and prosper.  A plan which sets out the Government's priorities and how they propose to use additional resources as they become available &mdash; even under this Government at some stage some recovery must take place in our economy &mdash; would help to provide a certain discipline within the public sector to secure an orderly development of our economic potential and an orderly tackling of the problems of social development.</P>
    <P>Before we get to that, we face the clear problem evident in the Taoiseach's speech of the failure of the Government <Col N="1855" /> to grasp the nature and extent of the crisis they have created and their failure to admit to this crisis.  Only by facing the grim facts can we plan realistically to put things right.  The facts are grim.  The growth of national output has come to a halt.  Three years ago when we left office output was expanding at a rate of 5 per cent, almost three times the EEC level. Today there is total stagnation.  Indeed, the latest data suggests that output this year may fall.  In their report published on 5 June the Central Bank estimated an increase of 0.5 per cent in output, but even as that report was being printed bad news was coming in so fast that the Central Bank estimate of the drop in investment this year was increased four-fold between the time when the report went to print and the time of the press conference.  Such a reduction in investment of the order of 5 per cent as against 1.25 per cent seems certain to turn the estimate of a marginal growth in total output into a decline in output.</P>
    <P>One then comes up against the &ldquo;cloud cuckoo land&rdquo; type of fantasy the Taoiseach is endeavouring to maintain. He told us that we are maintaining economic growth at a higher level than in many stronger economies.  I have not had an opportunity since I started speaking to check the facts, but maybe what he meant to say is that our decline is slower than in some stronger economies.  He is trying to pretend that we are maintaining economic growth at a time when such growth as was expected earlier this year, even by the most pessimistic of us who felt there would be some growth in the economy this year, is disappearing before our eyes half way through the year.  It is now clear that the next authoritative forecast will show some marginal decline in total output.  In those circumstances for the Taoiseach to talk about maintaining economic growth is a desperate and foolish attempt to fool people and we will not solve our problems by such attempts.</P>
    <P>If, as is the case, the volume of our output is stagnant or declining, we will be significantly worse off because at present we are facing a much sharper rise in <Col N="1856" /> import prices than in export prices, and imports account for the equivalent of 60 per cent of our total expenditure.  Even if we manage to produce the same amount this year as last year, that production will buy us in terms of goods and services, 2½ per cent less than last year. Since it looks as if output is declining slightly, it is clear that for the first time in two decades we will face a situation in which what we produce will buy us significantly less in goods and services than in the previous year.  There is no precedent for this over the past two decades.  I challenge the Taoiseach or his Ministers to contradict that statement by reference to the official statistics of national output expenditure.  No other Government have ever succeeded in this 20-year period in creating a situation in which we will be worse off because of failure to maintain the kind of economic growth we would need to sustain the purchasing power of our national output at a time when the terms of trade are running against us.</P>
    <P>The prospect for the future is worse because of the decline in investment.  The Taoiseach in his speech used words which were designed to mislead.  The Taoiseach told us that the investment programmes are at a high level.  As the Central Bank pointed out at their press conference, investment is now likely to decline by 5 per cent this year.  The collapse in the construction industry, occurring so rapidly that it required this most extraordinary modification of the forecast while the report was being printed, is on such a scale that it is now clear that we face a fall in investment that will threaten our capacity to expand our economy in the year or two ahead. In our last two years in office investment was rising by 10½ to 12 per cent a year. Under this Government there was a decline of 5 per cent in a single year.</P>
    <P>The gravity of this can be seen from what the Government said a mere five months ago when describing the growth in investment which took place in 1979. They said that this demonstrated the success of the Government's policy in reviving the confidence of investors and <Col N="1857" /> meant that the economy was investing in the extra capacity needed to sustain a rapid rate in progress in future years. The Government were wrong, because what we have this year is economic decline and not growth.  So far as there was any validity in the suggestion that a growth in investment would sustain a rapid rate of progress in future years, I can only say that what is happening now, by the Government's criteria, shows the failure of the Government's policies to revive the confidence of investors and it means that the economy is failing to invest in the extra capacity needed to sustain progress.</P>
    <P>In two short years this Government have raised the annual inflation rate from 6 per cent in the 12 months ended May 1978 to 13½ per cent in the year ended May 1979 and to 20¼ per cent in the 12 months ended May 1980.  Some of this is due to external factors.  The Taoiseach attempted to pretend that it is all due to external factors.  The only thing the Taoiseach mentioned in relation to inflation was oil, and he made no reference to the Fianna Fáil budgets two of which increased indirect taxation putting up the cost of living and one of which cut subsidies.  There was no reference to the fact that half of the acceleration in the cost of living increase from 6 per cent to over 20 per cent is directly attributable to these budgets as seen in the consumer price index immediately afterwards and identified by the authorities in terms of the impact on the consumer price index.  Not only is half the acceleration due to direct budgetary decisions but about a quarter is due to the effect of this acceleration in prices upon pay claims, pushing them up within a year from the annual rate of basic pay increase negotiated in 1977 at not much more than 7 per cent to a rate of 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>This could have been avoided.  When in office we showed how inflation could be reduced after the first oil crisis by using food subsidies to cut the cost of living and to secure the agreement of unions to moderate pay increases.  That <Col N="1858" /> agreement was based on the confidence of the unions that we were tackling inflation and that we would succeed.  We would not have easily persuaded people by exhortation alone that they should moderate pay demands in the face of high inflation.  They had to have the prospect of a decline in inflation and they had to see the determination of the Government to achieve that and action by the Government that would achieve it.  In those circumstances it is possible to get the co-operation of unions.  The Government must be willing to take the necessary action to secure that co-operation. Nothing this Government have done will inspire such confidence in unions or workers who have seen the inflation rate more than trebled in two years as a result of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Union co-operation is also endangered by the impact of the Government policies on unemployment.  Since the end of last year the process of reduction in unemployment, almost uninterrupted since mid-1976, has been practically reversed.  There were average increases of 1,500 per month in unemployment in the first quarter followed by 2,700 in April and 4,200 in May.  Even if this recent acceleration in April and May turned out to be temporary, of which there is no sign, as news of closures of firms keep pouring in, and even if the unemployment increase moderated in the second half of this year back down to the trend in the first quarter, that would still leave 105,000 people out of work by the end of the year on a seasonally adjusted basis or, in terms of the actual number out of work, almost 110,000 people.  If it happens that we get back to the lower rate of unemployment increase in the first quarter of the year it would mean that everything achieved in terms of the reduction in unemployment two and a half years, a process begun by the National Coalition, will by a continuation of this Government have been wiped out in 12 short months.  There is also the phenomenon of the short-term worker now on a scale twice as large as a year ago and there is the new phenomenon of the three-day fortnight <Col N="1859" /> as well as the three-day week.  This is an aspect of our employment situation to which inadequate attention has been drawn.</P>
    <P>The only sign of realism in the Taoiseach's approach was in relation to this matter.  Having pretended that the economy was expanding and that investment was rising, with inflation increases due entirely to external factors, the Taoiseach showed some sign of realism when referring to the haemorrhage of job losses, which is reaching unacceptable levels.  The Taoiseach did not provide any credible proposals as to what the Government would do about this.  The Taoiseach's reasons were not entirely convincing and only one of his reasons deserves credibility&mdash;that was his reference to the increased cost of credit.  The Taoiseach identified a problem there, again without offering any proposals to resolve it other than the hope that interest rates would come down.  We have to face the fact that at no time since this state started on the path of economic recovery as a result of the Whitaker plan 20 years ago has the situation been so serious or has the need to boost our economy been so great. Even at the height of the first oil crisis our national output never failed to increase as is happening now, and never in 20 years has the purchasing power of our national output fallen significantly by 2½ to 3 per cent as it is doing this year.</P>
    <P>Why are the Government not providing the necessary boost to the economy?  Why is there no policy of stimulating demand and output?  The answer is that the Government cannot take that action because they have so mismanaged the economy that they have not the capacity to do so.  There are no reserves and no capacity left to influence events.  The Government threw away their capacity.  They recklessly overheated a rapidly expanding economy in 1977 by borrowing an extra £300 million which achieved no acceleration in growth.  The increase of output in 1978 was at the same level as in 1977, which was around 5 per cent. <Col N="1860" /> This extra borrowing boosted imports, especially imports of consumer goods ready for use.  The volume of increase in these imports rose by one-third more in 1978 than in 1977, boosting the share of these imports to an unprecedented figure of almost 18 per cent.  The Taoiseach in his speech reverted again to his cloud cuckoo land approach to most of the problems and talked of the active campaign of import substitution.  This Government have undertaken no active campaign of import substitution.  They have created the conditions where rapid growth in imports of consumer goods is on a scale that has endangered, threatened and in many cases destroyed Irish firms which had hitherto survived in the home market despite free trade. This was the predictable effect of the 1977 manifesto, the main benefits of which accrued and were bound to accrue, given the openness of our economy, to industries in other countries selling to this market.</P>
    <P>Having used up all available resources, including the maximum borrowing tolerance, at a time when a boost to the economy was not needed in 1977, when growth was already at a rate of 5 per cent, almost three times that of our neighbours, the Government now find themselves still borrowing the equivalent of 12 per cent of national output, when one discounts the temporary revenue windfalls arising from the Post Office strike last year and money brought forward into this year from last year, and they are under strong pressure to cut this borrowing.  With the resultant external payments deficit of £750 million threatening the longer-term stability of our currency, the Government are being forced to cut back spending.  Severe as those cuts have been, they have, on the one hand, been insufficient to reduce the external payments deficit and, on the other hand, have not been on a scale adequate to leave enough credit for the private sector, industry, services and farms, or&mdash;and this may now be even more important&mdash;adequate to reduce pressure on interest rates.  We must be clear about this.  Irish interest rates are no longer determined in London.  They <Col N="1861" /> are autonomous.  Within our stringent exchange control cordon, with an independent Irish pound, they are decided simply by the supply of credit and the demand for it here in Ireland.  The Government, by absorbing so much credit have forced up interest rates to record levels and in the process are bankrupting most of the private sector.</P>
    <P>We saw this process in a particularly acute form in the budget itself.  The budget had the immediate effect of that large-scale selling of Government securities which within 24 hours had pushed up market interest rates by 1 per cent.  It is only part of a process: we saw it in action highlighted by the fact that it happened to that extent in a single day as a direct result of the budget but the process has gone on over a period of time as a result of the cumulative effect of the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in a curious way tries to take the credit for this.  He talks about the stability of the Irish pound which he ascribes to the sound management of the economy.  He knows as well as I do&mdash;if not, he should not be sitting where he is &mdash; that the reason why the Irish pound is at present maintaining its value well is because of a very heavy short&mdash;term inflow arising from the extraordinary level of our interest rates which are so much higher than interest rates anywhere else that money is coming into this country with a view to getting a benefit from them over a period of months on the calculation&mdash;which I think is correct&mdash;that the value of the Irish pound will maintain itself in the short-term and that therefore there is no immediate risk in such a short-term investment.  But that is not sound management, to force up interest rates in order to get an inflow of hot money to this country, maintaining the value of our pound artificially, hot money which can flow out again as rapidly as it flows in and which, if and when we reach the point where the continuance of the Government's failure to tackle our basic economic problems threatens the value of our currency, will flow out again.  There one has a situation <Col N="1862" /> made more difficult and dangerous by Government policy.  We do not want hot money coming in the short-term, the outflow of which at a critical point in the future when the reality of our situation and the Government's failure to tackle it and solve the problems could lead to uncertainty about the value of the pound and when the outflow of that money could turn that uncertainty into something much more serious.</P>
    <P>Our policy in Government was the reverse of Fianna Fáil's.  Regardless of the political pressures of an impending general election we refused to over-heat the economy.  We refused to use up in 1977, when growth was rapid and inflation declining, the financial resources which we knew would be needed in 1978 to hold down inflation at the 7½-8 per cent level to which we believed our policies were reducing it.  That was validated by events.  Later, probably in 1979, we guessed we would need these resources to stimulate the continued expansion of the economy when the boom which we had engineered in 1977 might begin to flag.  Our discussions in Government about the 1977 budget centered on this issue: by how much could and should we stimulate the economy, bearing in mind that in 1978 the decline in the rate of inflation would come to a halt and that external pressures would be starting to push up our rate of inflation again and that we would need a lot of money in order, at that stage, to hold down the rate of inflation, by subsidies and by avoiding tax increases that would otherwise be necessary, in such a way as to give every incentive to the trade unions to accept a modest level of pay increases that would itself contribute to a long-term and continuing low rate of inflation? It was after serious debates on this issue, in the context of the knowledge that we would face an election within the next year and that the decisions we were taking could be fatal to our capacity to retain in the short term the confidence of our people and it was on that basis we took the decision not to spend the money then and to hold it back.  If you like, it was a political gamble.  We gambled with our political <Col N="1863" /> future for the benefit of the country. Fianna Fáil gambled with the country for the sake of their political future.  That is the difference between us, fundamental as it is, that will decide the people's attitude to these two parties in the next election.</P>
    <P>The contrast between the skill and economic management by which we secured a favourable outcome in 1977-78 and held back resources to maintain the situation in 1978-9 is in glaring and total contrast to the irresponsibility of Fianna Fáil in their manifesto politics which destroyed our prosperity and growth, trebled our inflation and has now led to an accelerating increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>Having got into the situation where they have created the crisis and at the same time thrown away the means of resolving it, the Government have now very little leeway.  They can of course make things worse &mdash; and probably will &mdash; by pre-empting the vast bulk of available credit for their own extravagance leaving the private sector with inadequate credit at prohibitive interest rates.</P>
    <P>Given the mess into which they have got the economy no tactics are open to them that will not do some damage. They have simply deprived themselves of the means of cutting inflation and stimulating growth.  They are needlessly making things worse by the misdirected emphasis of their present policies.  A prominent businessman recently remarked to me, &ldquo;The illusion of the Taoiseach's economic competence has been shattered in an unbelievably short period of months.&rdquo;.  If there were some in the business community at least who six months ago thought he could undo the damage done by the Government of which he had been a member between 1977 and 1979 &mdash; a spending member one might say&mdash;they are very few in number now.  The blunder of a budget which tackled no problem and solved no difficulty but gratuitously increased inflation above the 20 per cent level and forced up interest rates by cutting availability of credit to the private sector <Col N="1864" /> is now patently obvious to all, even to those who had been among the Taoiseach's greatest admirers.</P>
    <P>What has galled people in this situation is the contrived prominence given to the Taoiseach's fiddling while our economy burns.  The naïveté of the belief that public relations exercises and daily photographs in the papers can excise the reality of our economic crisis from peoples minds is shattering.  Nobody in politics in Ireland has ever before shown such unveiled contempt for our people's intelligence or such an arrogant conviction that all of them can be fooled all the time.  The exercise casts more doubts on the Taoiseach's intelligence than on that of the people who, to be fair to them, have neither elected him nor are likely to elect him to office.</P>
    <P>The dash to the airport to welcome home Ministers who had brought back the smallest price increase Irish farmers have seen since we entered the EEC combined with a present to our much wealthier neighbour of £8 million or £9 million a year of the taxpayers' money could have appeared as a clever coup only to someone living totally divorced from the reality of people's lives and opinions. Does the Taoiseach seriously think that farmers do not know that in the two years 1978-80 their incomes have fallen in real terms by almost one-third and are now down to a level well below that of 1972, the year before we entered the EEC?</P>
    <P>Does he really think that the loss in two years of all that had been won for Irish farmers between 1971 and 1978 would be unnoticed by those affected or that a 4 to 5 per cent farm price increase, in a year when the cost of living for farmers as well as for everybody else had risen by 20 per cent, would be acclaimed as a victory by anyone in the farm sector?  Of course, we all recognise that in the prevailing conditions it would not have been easy to avoid this depressing outcome.  But surely the stupidity of crowing about this thoroughly unsatisfactory result, however difficult it may have been to avoid, must have struck him.  Apparently not.  One can <Col N="1865" /> only speculate that such an egregious blunder was accounted for by panic at the publication of the <i>Magill</i> magazine with its sordid revelations.  That, at any rate, is the interpretation that most people, public and the media, seem to have put on this episode.</P>
    <P>What is the Taoiseach's strategy faced with the present crisis?  The country is entitled to be told what he proposes to do in the face of economic decline, the collapse of investment, a 20 per cent inflation rate, unemployment rising by 4,200 and businesses collapsing throughout the state.  To have failed to give any substantial indication of his intentions in this debate, to have left the people in ignorance of whether he even grasps the gravity of the crisis over which he is presiding, is unacceptable to this House and to those whom we in this House represent.</P>
    <P>There is a way out of our difficulties but it cannot be found so long as the Government continue to pretend, as the Taoiseach has done in his speech, with the single exception of his reference to redundancies, that there is no crisis, that there are no financial problems, that inflation will, as he suggests, just go away. The truth is that from well before this Government came to power, from when they first devised their plan to secure the support of the electorate by promises of lavish expenditure to be financed by massive borrowing, they have failed to face reality.  Even when they first conceived their plan in the first half of 1976, Fianna Fáil's programme was wrong-headed and dangerous.  All that can be said in favour of it at that time is that in the first half of 1976 it at last diagnosed correctly the problems we then faced &mdash; an economy, with spare capacity following the first oil crisis, which needed to be spurred into expansion. When the election came a year later this had all changed.  Our carefully judged policies had achieved rapid growth as well as falling inflation, declining borrowing and unemployment.  Yet, blindly, Fianna Fáil in their manifesto and, after the election in their policies, <Col N="1866" /> proceeded to implement a plan, devised over a year earlier, which at any time would have been reckless and dangerous, but which by late 1977 was essentially mis-directed &mdash; directed towards a problem which was already being solved.</P>
    <P>Neither then nor since have Fianna Fáil ever been able to get out of the rut into which their policy stance had fallen four years ago.  They kept on with their policies of spending borrowed money when this had become precisely the wrong thing to do.  When this precipitated a crisis they refused to face it, pretending there was no problem. Now they have no longer the means to pursue this policy they lack the flexibility, the courage or the sense of realism to cut their losses and to try to re-cover the ground lost.  The opportunity for such a revision of policies that might have been provided and that many thought would have been provided by the change of leadership was muffed and missed.  Under the new Taoiseach we have drifted further into crisis, with prices artificially pushed higher than before by tax increases and by unemployment rising &mdash; at least his predecessor kept it falling &mdash; with national output in decline, although he inherited from Deputy Lynch an economy which at least still has some spark of life and forward movement about it.</P>
    <P>The courage and skill that were needed to start the necessarily long drawn out process of getting our economy on course again were absent where they were needed.  A budget that could, however painfully, have cut public expenditure sufficiently to reduce Government borrowing and allow the private sector room to breathe &mdash; allow it the oxygen of credit on reasonable terms which it needs in order not to suffocate &mdash; turned out to be opportunistic and shortsighted, unrelated to our economic needs, pushing us more deeply into crisis.  This opportunity lost will not easily be recovered.  For any action taken now, this autumn or next January, will have to be that much more stringent <Col N="1867" /> and more damaging in the short run than if it had been taken in time when the Taoiseach had the chance.  We gave him that chance by agreeing, despite public cricicism, without demur, to a long Christmas adjournment so that he could prepare the measures necessary.</P>
    <P>Now that the Taoiseach has the breathing space of another adjournment &mdash; longer even than that which he enjoyed at the outset of his period in office &mdash; until mid-October, I have little hope that any better use will be made of it or that, even now belatedly, he will apply his mind seriously to our economic problems.  All the signs are that he will go on drifting, content to offer an illusion of government, expanding almost indefinitely his team of illusionists and conjurors, while the country falls into deeper difficulties.</P>
    <P>An example of the frivolity of his approach, of his cynicism and contempt for our people, has been the performance here of the majority of his fresh nominees for office.  There have been several honourable exceptions, but for the most part those whom he has rewarded for services&mdash;we know what the services were&mdash;with State powers, offices and private secretaries, have shown a previously unattained level of incompetence.  No previous Taoiseach has ever allowed public office to fall so low or has made so many Irish men and women from all parties so ashamed of many of their governors.  Never was £500,000 of the taxpayer's money worse spent nor has any previous administration evoked such repeated protests from public servants about the intrusion of party political influence into areas that have hitherto been protected from its less desirable manifestations.</P>
    <P>We have heard from public officials of political influence being used to keep law enforcement away from areas where it might embarrass party supporters, of prosecutions being quashed by political intervention, of the customs preventive service as well as the Garda being interfered with, even where their members have been assaulted, and of this coming from Government level and not just <Col N="1868" /> from party supporters.  Moreover, when we in this House have sought to raise these allegations of grave abuses, every effort has been made to intimidate us into not doing our duty by hints that files exist in relation to members of the Opposition, allegations which when probed turned out to relate to matters very different from the grave ones that threatened to undermine the public service, or allegations which, as in an instance involving myself, turned out to be nothing but bluff.</P>
    <P>In six short months this administration have already gone a long way towards debasing the standards of public life in Ireland.  Nor has this been confined to the area within the direct control of the Government.  This last six months has also seen a sustained effort to undermine the role of RTE as a public servant holding a mirror up to politics, warts and all.  Fear now stalks the corridors of Montrose, although intimidation has apparently not reached the point where the Taoiseach feels he can safely allow himself to be tamely interviewed by our national television and radio service.  He has been willing to face a brief interview for Radio na Gaeltachta and to honour the BBC with the favour of his services on the&mdash;correct as it turned out to be&mdash; calculation that while its interviewer would perhaps raise the awkward issue of the Taoiseach's activities ten years ago, he would not press him on the details of that affair.</P>
    <P>A Prime Minister who is afraid to face an interview on his own State public radio and television service until he has first cowed that institution into submission, does his country and himself little credit.  None of us should be in public life or remain there unless we are prepared to answer for our acts in public office. We may not like having to do so.  There is none among us who will not feel uncomfortable at times in the face of probing questions, but if we cannot face the heat we should not be in the kitchen. Most recently we have had to face a situation in which very serious allegations had been made against the Taoiseach, allegedly on the basis of <Col N="1869" /> papers left by a public servant who saved this State from a criminal conspiracy ten years ago.  Among these allegations are several that were not the subject of charges ten years ago but which raise fresh issues.</P>

    <P>The events of the past six months have raised questions about our system of government and about public communications, questions that will have to be faced by the next administration.  It is clear now that safeguards against political abuse of our governmental <Col N="1872" /> system are inadequate.  They will have to be reinforced and they will be reinforced. While considerable thought will have to be given to how there can be built in safeguards that will prevent a recurrence of abuses as and when the Government may change again at a later stage, certain needs are clear already.</P>
    <P>First, the Garda must be shielded against political interference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the introduction of a police authority.  In this context I might add that the argument by the Minister for Justice against this proposal, that is, that it exists only in Britain and that there it derives essentially from the existence of a multiplicity of police forces, is quite unconvincing. While sharing with Deputy Kelly his concern about the extent to which in so many areas, where the practice of other countries may offer us better headlines, we continue to ape British practice, this does not mean that where the British have a good idea &mdash; and that is the case occasionally &mdash; we should reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of this police authority and their method of appointment are matters for consideration but the main aim must be to safeguard the force and to safeguard law and order against political interference, just as we, in the National Coalition, safeguarded the new office of Director of Public Prosecutions by making it an offence to attempt to influence him not to prosecute.  In government, I shall not rest until we have created a situation in which every garda and every preventative officer will be confident that not only is he safe from political interference in upholding the law but that if he is subjected to such pressure from any source &mdash; Government or Opposition &mdash; and reports the fact, he can be assured that this will redound to his credit and will secure for him a favourable notation on his file that will help his career rather than to have the present situation of fearing that if he resist or report attempts to interfere with him in upholding the law, his prospects in his career may be prejudiced.  We shall banish fear from the minds of these <Col N="1873" /> men and women and replace it with a conviction that courage in carrying out their duty will be rewarded and not punished.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I shall make it my duty to devise a method of securing RTE against arbitrary party political interference designed to weaken or water down their public affairs programmes, commentaries and interviews, regardless of what criticism they may level at the Government of the day.  I recognise the difficulties of achieving this and I accept that there must be checks against the use of this medium to advocate violence and against an abuse of power by the staff of such an influential organisation but these checks must be separated from the political system in some effective way. The board must be appointed by some mechanism which prevents them from being the tool of party policy which can be the case by reason of the present system of appointment.</P>
    <P>It is sad that these should be the kinds of issues we have to face in this House when so many other matters require attention. But these are the issues which this administration have raised by their actions since coming under the leadership of the Taoiseach.  Wherever I go I find that people are preoccupied with these issues, that they are concerned about what seems to them a blatant attempt to take over the machinery of the State for private political purposes. These fears are to be found among many honourable supporters of Fianna Fáil as well as of other parties. Perhaps they are more acute in such quarters where the character of the present Government is understood most clearly but these fears are found, too, among many without party allegiance. They are fears that find relatively very little reflection in the media since people in the media are bound tightly by laws of libel.  However, this is and will remain a free Parliament, a place in which we have the duty of reflecting the preoccupations of the people with what they regard as dangerous trends in government. I have tried to do so with restraint <Col N="1874" /> while, I hope, reflecting accurately those very widely expressed fears and concerns.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters that must be mentioned in a debate of this kind.  I could not fail to comment on the abysmal lack of interest of this Government in law reform and in securing the rights of weaker groups in the community, of children and of women, against whom our laws still discriminate. The Government have not only failed to introduce reforms in these areas but they have blocked reforming legislation that anybody else has attempted to bring forward.  Examples of this have been their attitude to the Bill designed to abolish the concept of criminal conversation which was introduced in this House by Fine Gael and the Bill to reform the law on rape which was introduced in the Seanad by Senator Hussey.</P>
    <P>One might have thought that a government who had tied their hands so far as reforms involving additional public expenditure is concerned would at least try to compensate for this by introducing reforms which do not impose obligations on the Exchequer but this has not happened.  For three years this House has been dealing with budgetary measures and with routine Bills which do not effect any significant changes in our law.  The Government seem so unsure of themselves that they appear to fear that serious measures which would evoke serious debate might leave them at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Opposition and that, consequently, the safest course is for them not to do anything.  They may find when they next face the electorate that they have been mistaken.  The electorate will want a better account of the stewardship of the Government both in economic terms and in terms of reform than the Government now seem likely to be able to give.</P>
    <P>There are many groups in the community who are utterly frustrated by the lack of progress in the area of reforms that are overdue and by the Government's evident lack of interest, and even their contempt for such activity.  These <Col N="1875" /> groups are looking to this party to give a lead in this area and they shall not be disappointed.  In government we shall cut some of the red tape and stir up the inertia that has been allowed to settle on this subject.  If necessary, we shall consider the kind of solution mentioned by the Incorporated Law Society, that is, the commissioning of distinguished lawyers who are experts in particular fields to consult with interested parties and to draft legislation which the Government could then evaluate and which with modifications if necessary, would be judged to be appropriate.  This legislation could then be presented to the Dáil without delay to be dealt with, as that article proposes, by special committees of the House, that most useful device of which we make so little use.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another area which the Government have neglected and for which during the past three years they have shown something approaching contempt. I refer to the protection of our environment. The record is deplorable in relation to the preservation of our archaeological and architectural heritage and in relation to the protection of our water supplies.  A new Fine Gael Government would give to these areas a priority which up to now they have not enjoyed.  We shall make it our business that no more of our heritage disappears before the ravages of developers, whether private or public.</P>
    <P>We shall work to create conditions under which, as is now the case with such parts of Dublin as Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square, as much as possible of our architectural heritage is preserved by private people out of their own resources, without there being any burden imposed on the State.  If necessary, we shall modify the tax code to cover difficult cases where families are burdened with the maintenance of great houses which the nation requires should be retained and handed on to future generations and where inaction by the State could lead to irretrievable losses and there have been irretrievable losses down through the years.  Legislation would be introduced also to protect <Col N="1876" /> archaeological sites adequately and the delicate task of providing for archaeological excavation of urban sites uncovered in the process of development in a manner that would not inhibit desirable and in some cases necessary urban renewal would be tackled on the basis of experience gained elsewhere and of advice that we would seek from other countries that have overcome this problem successfully.</P>
    <P>But conservation must extend to many areas.  We cannot allow our rivers and lakes and the seas around us to be polluted to the point where aquatic life is extinguished, amenities destroyed and health endangered.</P>
    <P>The problem of the divided responsibility in this area between local authorities, the Department of Agriculture dealing with pollution by agriculture, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism dealing with industrial pollution, and other agencies such as An Foras Forbartha, An Foras Talúntais and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, must be tackled.  We cannot continue with laws unenforced because, for example, approved sites do not exist for the dumping of toxic waste of which, according to the Director of An Foras Forbartha, no less than 20,000 tons is produced annually. We cannot risk our people's lives by permitting a situation to be continued in which recently children found a drum of highly toxic Methanol lying in the open, or a whole river was polluted by a lorry driver dumping toxic waste into a ditch near a tributary.  Neither can we permit farmers and creameries to destroy amenities which their own children and neighbours as well as the rest of our people should be entitled to enjoy.  Enforcement of standards in this area must be undertaken immediately even where this may be unpopular with affected individuals.</P>
    <P>They are areas which we should be tackling and which we can tackle even during an economic crisis.  They would be tackled if we had a Government with the capacity to apply their minds to these issues, not a Government solely <Col N="1877" /> concerned with aspects of public relations. The Government should have the intelligence to see that it would be good public relations to do some of these things, that it might have some effect, even belatedly, on the reputation of the Government.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are ready to provide a Government that will tackle the economic situation with a realism and confidence generated by our success during the period 1975 to 1977 and who will embark on a programme of reform of the kind needed to make this society worthy of and acceptable to the new generation.  We shall govern in the interests of the whole people but with particular concern, particular priority, for the needs of the new generation who deserve better of their seniors in politics than they have been getting in recent times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before starting on the major consideration for the House and the country, the economy, I should like to deal with a question raised by Deputy FitzGerald when you, Sir, saw fit to rule him out of order.  I should like to make my own position clear in regard to that matter.  First of all, I should like to put on the record of the House my belief that the whole purpose of parliamentary privilege is to allow Members to raise matters in the House which they could not raise outside without being subject to the laws of libel.  That is a very great privilege indeed which carries with it a correspondingly great responsibility. This is a very fundamental issue when we are talking about the whole principle and concept of justice as we know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some aspects of events of ten years ago which can be pursued legitimately, in my opinion, but I should like to make one thing clear.  As far as I am concerned the charge of conspiracy to import arms into Ireland was dealt with by the courts; the present Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, was charged with that offence and was acquitted, and although we in this House have the right strictly speaking it is not a <Col N="1878" /> right we would be proper in exercising if we were to try to have a re-trial of Deputy Charles J. Haughey on that issue. The Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, in my opinion, has precisely the same right, no less and no more, than any other citizen and it is fundamental to the whole concept of justice here that if a person is charged and acquitted of that charge, <i>Magill</i>, RTE or any of our morning or evening newspapers have not the right to hold a re-trial of those proceedings, and though strictly speaking Members of the House could indulge in what could be described as a re-trial of a charge on which a man has been acquitted, I believe that in attempting to do that they would be undermining one of the democratic institutions that we all genuinely and sincerely on this side seek to protect.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of those events, the question of the missing £100,000, the possibility of perjury having been permitted, and there are side aspects that I regard as being legitimate to pursue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Rule away.  I had finished.  I will speak on the main issue before us, the economy.  This debate takes place three years almost to the day <Col N="1879" /> on which Fianna Fáil attained office and it is the 15th Adjournment Debate to which I have contributed as a Member of the House, and to set the background against which I will speak I will quote from the Official Dáil Report for 5 July 1977, Volume 300.  The then Taoiseach, nominating his Government, said:</P>
      <P>The Government's priorities have been fully set out in our manifesto which we published the day after the dissolution of the 20th Dáil.  We got a strong endorsement from the people to implement our policies.  The fact that we had an unprecedented majority will certainly not make us complacent. We intend to undertake our task with urgency and determination.</P>
      <P>The Irish electorate, as always, have proved themselves to be most discerning and discriminating.  They have rejected the Coalition Government. The same Irish electorate will be equally discriminating at the next general election if this Government do not create the real economic progress and the improved quality of life our people are entitled to expect.</P>
      <P>That was the then Leader of the Government when they had been elected on the basis of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  Though there have been attempts inside and outside the House to dissociate the present Taoiseach from the content of and commitment to that manifesto, there is on public record not only his commitment but his enthusiasm for that manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a situation not long ago during the course of a discussion on the manifesto where in the absence of the Taoiseach, who will not subject himself to being interviewed or questioned on any subject, a recording was played of one of the interviews he gave during the 1977 election in which he was more than enthusiastic and confident on the correctness of the policies set out in that manifesto.  The Taoiseach and some Ministers and Members of his parliamentary party have, during Question Time, debates and discussions, at all times tried to hark back to the 1977 crisis and compare the present situation <Col N="1880" /> with that situation.  They have tried to imply that the oil crisis which caused economic upheaval throughout the western world is exactly the same as what we are experiencing now and that these difficulties are mainly the result of outside external influences over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>Of course that is not the position, because the difficulties we have now are far more serious and deep-seated than those which were successfully faced in 1977.  There was only one sector of the economy in difficulty in 1975.  Combined with that the proper economic policies were pursued in the face of those difficulties which successfully brought us out of them by the time we left office in 1977.  The policies that have been pursued by this Government, and which they continue to pursue, are putting us deeper into the economic difficulties we would face in normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>While everyone may be fed up hearing the extent of the wide-ranging difficulties we face and the fact that they are across the board, it is important that they should be put on the record of the House at this time.  If one takes inflation it is running somewhat over 20 per cent. While some predictions have been made that unemployment will be 100,000 by next winter &mdash; I have heard other political commentators saying 105,000 &mdash; it gives me no joy to confidently predict that by next winter unemployment will be running between 115,000 and 120,000.  The main contributing factor to that rise in unemployment can be attributed to the policies pursued by the Government over the last two-and-a-half to three years.  Our growth, which was averaging about 6 per cent over the years, is now, by the most optimistic predictions, at a level of half to 1 per cent this year.  The balance of payments deficit is £730 million. Our gross investment is down by 6 per cent and our borrowing requirements are £900 million, of which exactly half is taken up by Exchequer borrowing. Private consumption is minus 2 per cent.  Those realities are not given by Fine Gael, or Labour or by someone with a political axe to grind; they are the <Col N="1881" /> true economic realities today, the true economic predictions facing us not only in the current year but also into next year at least.  They are given by the Central Bank, ESRI, OECD and I could quote a number of the other reputable international and national organisations for them.</P>
    <P>I said that in 1977 industry was in difficulty. It is not only industry that is in difficulty now after three years of Fianna Fáil mismanagement.  Industry is in severe difficulty.  Agriculture is facing severe difficulty and has gone through a bad year, which was acknowledged by the Taoiseach.  Our tourist industry has been almost decimated, and the main contributing factor has not been external but the budgetary policies pursued by the government.  If one goes to any part of Ireland which depends largely on tourism for its livelihood one will be told not of tens or hundreds but of thousands of bed-nights being lost due to the Government's budgetary proposals and economic management.  We have practically priced ourselves out of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach when speaking this morning spent most of his time, and understandably so, trying to rally his backbenchers, who obviously either did not face up to or realise the extent of the economic problems facing us.  It was as if he were addressing an Ard Fheis or a chapel gate meeting, not only in his delivery of the speech but in his whole attitude.  Sitting here I noted that when the Taoiseach was speaking &mdash; his presentation, as usual, impeccable, the voice rising at the proper times particularly when he spoke about youth, sporting events and all the little children running around the place, although they will probably be running somewhere around England, America or Australia if he pursues the type of policy he has been pursuing &mdash; he was mainly concerned with what seems to have been the whole purpose of the exercise this morning, to put some backbone into the Fianna Fáil Members of this House in facing the wrath of their constituents <Col N="1882" /> over the long hot summer.  In certain passages where he reached high pitch on the tremendous prospects ahead of us the Taoiseach turned around and addressed himself directly to his own backbenchers, because the flak which they must be getting in every constituency and feeding back to the Taoiseach must have made him decide &mdash; and correctly so &mdash; that if he did not put some backbone into them they might turn the wrath they are getting from their constituents on him.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was elected a considerable number of people from all parties, including his own, told me that I had been highly critical of the Taoiseach on his appointment in my reference to several aspects of his performance in public life which led me to believe that he was unsuitable for that office.  They told me that while they agreed with me they thought he could possibly deliver as far as our economy was concerned and that on that basis they were prepared to give him a chance.  That bubble has been burst in a short space of time because it is clear that the Taoiseach is incapable of tackling the economic difficulties which face us at this time.  The Taoiseach used the word &ldquo;recession&rdquo; this morning and referred to the price of oil and to the effect that is having on our economy.  We are all aware that the price of oil is affecting our economy and all economies throughout the western world, but to try to put the full blame, or the major portion of it, for the decline in our economic prospects on the price of oil is to attempt to mislead the people of the country.</P>
    <P>As far as inflation is concerned the increase in the price of oil accounts for approximately 2 or 3 per cent.  The Taoiseach in this House told us that the effect as far as inflation is concerned by reason of the budget proposals would be 4.8 per cent, considerably more than that of the price of oil.  We have had cut-backs exercised by the Taoiseach and his Government in almost every conceivable area.  We have had cut-backs affecting education, housing, social welfare, health, roads and many other aspects of our national life.</P>
    <P>I should now like to mention a short <Col N="1883" /> reference, understandably so, in the Taoiseach's speech to Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important debate in the last session was that on Northern Ireland at the end of last month.  Because it took place so recently, I shall not now go over the same ground as I covered in opening that debate.  I do wish, however, to reiterate my view that the situation in Northern Ireland is the major issue in our country today.  Our aim is the unity of all the people of Ireland in peace and harmony and the establishment of that aim is our first political priority.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, at his first press conference &mdash; it is memorable because there have not been too many of them since &mdash; after being elected leader of Fianna Fáil and as Taoiseach designate, claimed that that was the first political priority of his party and his Government.</P>

To say the least of it, he was masterly in his manipulation of the media.  Never has so much been written about a man who said so little as in the case of the Taoiseach.

      <P>There is a 28-page speech here by the Taoiseach.  Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that there is any concrete proposal in any one of the 28 pages to deal with any of the difficulties in the economic sphere that this country finds itself in?  Is there any one concrete suggestion contained in the whole speech?  This has been the pattern since you attained the office you now hold.  You pick an occasion like this where you have a set speech, carefully considered, gone over by you and your civil servants for days previously, delivered in the House and subject to no query, no answer, no accountability. You are in fact, and up to now effectively, abdicating your responsibility as Taoiseach of this country and not living up to the responsibility which you are, to say the least, so anxious to assume.</P>

      <P>I will get back to the Taoiseach's speech and try to analyse it a little more clearly.  On Northern Ireland, for the first time since the foundation of the State we have a Taoiseach who has suggested, to put it at its mildest, that a solution to the Northern Ireland problem and the unity of this country could be pursued on the basis of a two-nation approach.  In the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; interview which the Taoiseach gave he said that there could <Col N="1889" /> be two sets of laws in the social legislative sphere, one for this part of Ireland and another for Northern Ireland.  He was talking in relation to such questions as divorce and contraception. What the Taoiseach was saying in effect was that if one was a Catholic in Northern Ireland of course one could have divorce and contraceptives if one wanted them; it would be a matter for one's own conscience.  But if one was a member of the minority in this part over which the Taoiseach has jurisdiction and, although no religious barrier regarding either divorce or the use of contraceptives exists, one could not have them.  How can the Taoiseach possibly reconcile that with his party's long-term aspiration for the unity of the Irish people?  The Taoiseach has been asked that in this House before by way of Parliamentary Question and he has refused to answer or to clarify that statement made by him on the television programme, &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo;.  One of the things that I think would make it necessary for the Taoiseach to clarify that statement is the fact that he gave it to the BBC and that in this part of the country only approximately one-third of our people can receive BBC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, very definitely not. Not only did the Taoiseach not clarify it, but his main endeavour was not to clarify it.  His main endeavour was to evade it, as he has evaded most other matters of importance since he attained the office which he now holds.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his speech, refers to industrial development and the work of the IDA.  Would he clarify what to me appears to be a contradiction.  I quote from the Taoiseach's speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospects for industrial development this year, bearing in <Col N="1890" /> mind the international growth climate, are good.  Output growth, manufacturing at 5 per cent is expected to be the highest in the European community. At least 25,000 new manufacturing jobs will be created this year and job improvements under the IDA are expected to be about 30,000, In fact, job improvements negotiated for the first five months of this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>of this year, mind you</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;are 13,800 representing the best ever January-May performance by the IDA.</P>
    <P>That, clearly, is meant to convey that the work of the IDA is booming and that the prospects of attracting industry here and of job creation here are extremely good indeed.  Could the Taoiseach reconcile that statement with the following facts?  I have here two questions submitted by Deputy Barry Desmond to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism which were answered yesterday by way of written reply.  One question was to ask the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism the amount of land purchased by the Industrial Development Authority for industrial purposes in each of the years 1976 to 1979 inclusive and in 1980 to date.  The answer, given yesterday, was:</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the land purchased by them in each of the years 1976 to 1979 and in the first five months of 1980 was as follows: 1976&mdash;541 acres; 1977&mdash;1,427 acres; 1978&mdash;702 acres; 1979&mdash; 1,147 acres; January to May 1980&mdash; 65 acres.</P>
    <P>That is one answer, rather difficult to reconcile with the Taoiseach's prospect for the performance of the IDA.</P>
    <P>The other question was to ask the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism the amount of money expended by the Industrial Development Authority in the purchase of lands for industrial purposes in the County Dublin area in each of the years 1976 to 1979 inclusive and in the first five months of 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the amounts of money expended by them on the purchase of land in Dublin city and county in each of the years 1976 to 1979 and in the first five months of 1980, together with details of the amounts of land purchased, were as follows: 1976, £315,010 &mdash; 16.54 acres; 1977, £4,618,187 &mdash; 302.6 acres; 1978, £6,017,500 &mdash; 310.26 acres; 1979, £6,613,144 &mdash; 313.11 acres.  The first five months of 1980 &mdash; nil, and under the other heading, nil.</P>
    <P>How can the Taoiseach reconcile this incredible industrial development job creation by the IDA in the light of those facts, given by one of his own senior Ministers in this House yesterday?  The difficulties of this country will not be solved by trying to mislead the people as to what the facts really are and just how broke this Government is.  It is broke mainly &mdash; not entirely, but mainly &mdash; because of its own irresponsible approach towards the national interest. All the difficulties that other countries are facing are compounded in ours for the following reasons: For purely party political purposes, the party of which the Taoiseach was a senior Member and is now Leader put forward to the Irish electorate, in 1977, a manifesto which was politically advantageous to his party and was disastrous for the economy and the future of the Irish People.  That could possibly be acceptable from a group of young, idealistic, inexperienced men but the men who framed that manifesto, who went out and sold that manifesto to the people of this country in 1977 were men who like the Taoiseach had had years of experience in Government offices.  The Taoiseach had been Minister for Finance, Minister for Justice, and had held several Ministerial posts.  The Minister's other colleagues immediately before the transition in 1973 had held senior ministerial posts.  They knew the implications of the policies they were putting forward.  They knew the economic consequences to this country of pursuing those policies, but because <Col N="1892" /> they were so desperate to get back into power, the real interest of the country and its people were a secondary consideration indeed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach achieved his purpose. The Irish people did believe him at the time.  Now however there is a clear realisation of what the Taoiseach has done and, how irresponsible his approach has been and he has no effective answer.</P>
    <P>He has no effective answer because the belief and the expectation generated around this House and in some sections of the country in November-December of last year, when he was bidding for and then attained the office of Taoiseach, were very high indeed.  All the people who engage in certain activities were riding very high.  The get-rich-quick brigade saw quite clearly that with the change in leadership of Fianna Fáil the gravy train would roll again as far as they were concerned, and to some extent it did roll again and is still rolling for them.  But the Taoiseach's political philosophy, his approach to economic and social affairs are, to say the very least, detrimental to the vast majority of our people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has at all times pursued a policy under which he has transferred resources &mdash; sometimes to a large and other times to a smaller extent &mdash; from the less well off people in Irish society to the better off.  Indeed the whole machinery of State in this country is geared to ensuring that those people with the get-rich-quick mentality &mdash; the land speculators, the shady kind of business operator &mdash; are the type of people who are being and will continue to be facilitated by this Government until the next time the people of this country have an opportunity of putting Fianna Fáil where they belong &mdash; most of them out of public life altogether and the remainder at least over to this side of the House.</P>
    <P>There are three aspects to our economy.  The Taoiseach talked about Fianna Fail's commitment to the agricultural sector and went on to give <Col N="1893" /> certain guarantees to that sector by way of Government proposals.  I should like to site the position of the agricultural sector under Fianna Fáil Government.  I do not propose to quote a Member of the Labour Party or anyone engaged in public life, not even a member of any political party as far as I know but somebody who is acknowledged as being an authority in the agricultural field, Professor Séamus Sheehy of University College, Dublin, who, speaking at a seminar on Saturday last, made the following comment, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday last, June 23:</P>
    <P>The extent of fall in incomes was not yet fully realised.  Having regard to inflation running at 20 per cent this year and probably at 15 per cent next year, farmers were taking a cut in their real incomes of up to one per cent a month.  That was more than they suffered in any period since the Second World War.</P>
    <P>That is from a Professor of UCD who is widely acknowledged as being an authority in the agricultural sector. When the farmers and farming orgainsations read the Taoiseach's commitment to the farming community in his speech this morning it will be seen for what it is, a further widening of the Taoiseach's options should he decide that he had better go to the country sooner rather than later.  The only thing at present exercising the Taoiseach's mind and which will continue to exercise his mind will be the real first priority as far as he is concerned, which is whether he should go now or should hold on in the certain knowledge that as bad as is the present economic situation all the clear indications are that it will get worse.  Under the Constitution the Taoiseach has two years in which he can retain office with the majority he has, providing of course that the real divisions, and I mean real divisions, within his party can be contained and that there is not an internal &mdash; now the Taoiseach should not point the finger.  Let us hear from him.</P>

Normally I would not give a curse what difficulties the Taoiseach or the Fianna Fáil Party had to cope with.  But it becomes a matter of considerable importance when that division within Fianna Fáil occupies the time almost exclusively of the Taoiseach and all of his senior Ministers.

      <P>I welcome an opportunity to participate in this debate.  Having listened to the chief spokesmen of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party I am more convinced than ever before that they are preoccupied with one problem, that is, to devise ways and means of getting rid of one man, Ireland's Taoiseach.  They are completely obsessed with that problem and may be using it as a smokescreen to convey to the public that they have some alternative. I do not know whether they have an alternative but I am convinced that they have not policies.  If they had such policies they would not have spent over two hours lambasting our Taoiseach.  He <Col N="1897" /> has the right of audience and the right to defend himself and I have no doubt that he will do so whenever the opportunity comes his way.  The only tribute paid to our Taoiseach by any Member of the Fine Gael or the Labour Party was on a recent radio programme when Deputy Desmond said that the Taoiseach was a very clever man.  Apparently the present leader of the Fine Gael Party does not think that he possesses any brains, has any political skills or ability whatever.  I am not surprised that the leader of the Labour Party is indulging in foolish and useless tactics.  The people will be the final arbiters and the Taoiseach would be foolish to take the advice of Deputy Cluskey and go to the country.  He has a mandate to carry on the work of government, despite the fact that we are in the midst of a deep economic recession.</P>
      <P>We are not alone in our recession difficulties. Every country in the world has difficulties at present and the Fianna Fáil Party cannot be blamed in any way for this recession.  No member of our party wishes this recession on the Irish people and our Taoiseach was not in any way responsible for it.  The onus is on all political parties to act responsibly and to ensure that every effort is made to right our economic difficulties so that our country may continue on the path of real progress.  There have been previous recessions and the Coalition Government experienced difficulties.  However, they were faced by a responsible Opposition.  Today this Government are faced by an irresponsible Opposition and we must not lose sight of this fact. The situation was slightly easier for the Coalition Government because they knew that Fianna Fáil were more concerned for the welfare of the people than for their own advancement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to succeed in our efforts to have maximum expansion this year and in future years the Government must have the fullest support and co-operation of all responsible people and organisations.  Our situation is no different to that of any other European country or any democracy in the world. America is going through a recession in the same way as European countries and we must realise that we cannot escape. We must face up to the enormous problems which occur from day to day. I am satisfied that the Taoiseach and the Government will do everything possible, both individually and collectively, to enable us to ride out the storms of recessions which are evident at present.</P>
      <P>This problem has been caused not by internal factors but by factors beyond our control, particularly the high cost of oil imports.  Throughout the years we have become more and more dependent on oil as the economy has expanded.  An oil crisis 30 years ago would not have caused the same problems because we were not then so dependent on the use of oil.  Today all our mechanically propelled vehicles and our industries are dependent on oil and the great majority of our homes are heated by oil.  Our demand for this product grew as our economy expanded and the same has happened in every advanced country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation today cannot be compared with the situation during any other economic recession and it is different from that which prevailed during the recession in the latter years of the Coalition Government.  They got the support of responsible political parties and it was easier for them to ride the economic storms of the time.  Unfortunately Fine Gael and Labour have only one thing in common, they are obsessed with hatred of the Taoiseach.  I am satisfied that we have an excellent Taoiseach, a man who possesses all the abilities and skills to lead us through the difficult years ahead. The Taoiseach is the most capable <Col N="1899" /> person to lead us through the recession. If Fine Gael and Labour wish to demonstrate their allegiance to Ireland or to demonstrate that they are national political organisations it is time for them to become responsible and to act in a responsible manner but they are not capable of being responsible.</P>
    <P>However, the people will decide that in their own good time.  The Opposition are using the situation to cover their lack of policies.  The Labour Party seem to have lost sight of any effective policy. They are obsessed with their personal hatred of the Taoiseach and with legislation calling for divorce.  That is the only contribution of the Labour Party to political life in the last six months.  They have nothing else.  They have no worthwhile alternatives.  They know well that talk of divorce is very much alien to the vast majority of people.  We still have a Catholic and Christian society and may God keep us that way for many a year to come and may He protect us from the wrath and evils of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>During his speech the Taoiseach dealt with the problems of the CAP.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Taoiseach in his efforts to maintain the strength of the CAP.  We seem to have forgotten the enormous contribution that the CAP has made to the Irish nation.  It guaranteed our farmers free and easy access to the vast continental markets and not only that but it guarantees higher prices and these higher prices made a major contribution to our economic development in recent years.  We must express a certain amount of anxiety when we see the socialists throughout Europe endeavouring to tamper with the CAP.  The CAP has helped to strengthen our economy and I fully support the Government in their concern for the future of it.  Any additional moneys earned by the agricultural sector filter right through the economy and benefit the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had not joined the EEC the <Col N="1900" /> thousands of jobs we talk of today could not have been created because the incomes derived from our exports would have been greatly diminished.  I was delighted when the Taoiseach raised that important issue here this morning.  We all realise that the agricultural and associated industries are going through a difficult period but they are not alone. Every other agricultural community in the EEC is faced with a similar problem. It is not the first time this has happened. It happened in 1974 and in 1975.  During those chaotic days the farming community could not dispose of their calves. Some of them were sold for two pints of Guinness and others were sold for as low as 50p.  The situation is not so bad today, thanks to the fact that we have a Government committed to serving the needs of all sections, a Government determined to serve the needs of the agricultural community.  It would be of great concern if agricultural incomes were to diminish this year.  I do not believe they will but what worries me is that farm costs seem to increase dramatically all the time.  That is the greatest problem facing the agricultural sector.  Whenever farm price increases are granted farm costs absorb the increases, again reducing farm incomes.</P>
    <P>We had very successful years in agriculture during 1977, 1978 and a portion of 1979 although 1979 was not as good a year as desired.  I am convinced that agriculture is back on the road to increased production and that farm incomes will be more stable in the coming years because of guaranteed markets. That is very important.  We all realise that no industry can expand if it does not enjoy guaranteed markets.  That is one thing that our access to the EEC has guaranteed for the majority of Irish people. I fully support the Taoiseach and the Government in their determination to preserve the CAP.</P>
    <P>The Government have been criticised for our entry into the EMS.  We have had many advantages from our entry into the EMS and few people seem to realise that we have one of the most stable currencies in the Nine.  People <Col N="1901" /> tend to base their arguments on the strength of sterling and they do not realise that our currency is very stable in the EMS and that if our punt reached parity with sterling our exports would be in serious difficulty and thousands of jobs would be placed in jeopardy.</P>

      <P>The principal developments with regard to the provision of equipment and personnel in relation to the general sectors covered by the reports referred to by the Deputy are as follows:</P>
      <P>Oceanography: One senior scientist has been appointed in the Department of Oceanography, UCG.</P>
      <P>Environment: Three scientists have been appointed to the Benthic Research Group, UCG.</P>
      <P>Botany: One scientist specialising in marine macro-algae has been appointed to the staff of the Department of Botany, UCG.  Culture ponds are being provided under a NBST research grant project.</P>
      <P>Fisheries: The staff of the Fisheries Research Centre has been strengthened by the appointment of three scientists.  A new laboratory has been provided at Abbotstown, Co. Dublin.  Two scientists have been added to the Research Development Staff of BIM and extensive additions in facilities and equipment have been made to the Fisheries Training School at Greencastle.</P>
      <P>Mariculture: The Science and Technical staff in the Shellfish Research Laboratory at Carna have been significantly strengthened.  Ponds, greenhouses and analytical equipment have been provided.  A large number of scientific and technical personnel are now employed by Beirtreach Teoranta and a shellfish hatchery has been constructed. An additional scientist has been appointed by the Salmon Research Trust.  Three mariculture site survey and monitoring officers have been recruited and are deployed on a regional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offshore petroleum and ocean engineering: Six to eight technical personnel are employed in the Ocean Services <Col N="1904" /> Division of IIRS and equipment has been procured for monitoring the performance of offshore structures.  An additional scientist and technician are employed at the Department of Civil Engineering, UCC, and a small wave tank has been constructed to facilitate performance assessment of marine structures.</P>
    <P>Shiptime: One minor multi-user oceanographic vessel has been purchased and equipped.  The acquisition of an intermediate research vessel is in hands.</P>
    <P>Naval Service: With regard to the Naval Service, in recent years all its available resources have been required for the fisheries protection task.  The work of the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference may now be drawing to a close with the possible result that we may have a large marine Economic Zone to be protected.  Against this background, the future role of the Naval Service will have to be considered.  It is likely, therefore, that for the immediately foreseeable future, the role of the Naval Service in science and technology work will be limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The phraseology of this question is, of course, taken from the pre-election manifesto and the question has to be interpreted in the light of the assertion made by the Deputy, in the brief debate on Friday, 13 June on my Department's Estimates, to the effect that no action had been taken in this area.</P>
      <P>I gave a very detailed reply to a similar question from Deputy O'Brien on 13 December 1977 columns 1210 to 1213 of the Official Report &mdash; and I do not think it either necessary or appropriate to repeat that reply now as it is on the record of the House.  I would like to add, however, three brief points:</P>
      <P>First: I have already announced that a new Courts Bill will be introduced very shortly which will have significant benefits in making less formalised procedures available to many litigants in the area of family law;</P>
      <P>Secondly: I have already announced that there has been and continues to be substantial expansion in the welfare officer service attached to the courts;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly: It should not be necessary at this stage to point out that the Minister for Justice never was, and is not now, the Minister responsible for the introduction of legislation relating to child offenders <Col N="1912" />&mdash; despite which fact parliamentary questions continue to be addressed to me based on the contrary assumption.</P>
    <P>Subject to what I have just said, I am not at present in a position to make any further statement, and additional proposals or plans in the area covered by the question, in so far as they come within my area of responsibility, will be announced in the normal way when I am in a position to announce them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A preliminary question arises as to whether in fact legislation is needed to give effect to the convention and, in so far as the convention covers matters coming within my areas of responsibility, I am not convinced that legislation is necessary.</P>
      <P>If legislation is unnecessary, I think it would be undesirable to introduce it purely for the sake of meeting some possible argument that it was in fact necessary, because any legislation in this field would not only be extremely complex but would be liable to give rise to difficult problems of interpretation and administration. Without going into detailed legal argument, which I think would be both inappropriate and unhelpful, I would like to make it clear that it is not a situation where one can simply adopt the phraseology of the convention and leave it at that.  The legislation, if legislation were necessary, could cause problems and raise issues far removed from anything that could reasonably have been in the minds of the farmers of the convention.</P>
      <P>The matter has been under review in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office but the complexity of the matter is such that, should it ultimately be decided that legislation is necessary, I could not, as a matter of priorities, hold out any realistic prospect of legislation in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware that the Department of Foreign Affairs are of the opinion that the convention cannot be ratified without there being legislation but I am letting the Deputy know of the difficulty which exists. The Department of Justice advise me that legislation is not necessary in this case.  This impasse has existed for a number of years.  I understand that efforts were made to untangle this knot in <Col N="1915" /> 1973 and again as recently as 13 February 1979, but there is a difference of opinion between the two Departments on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the view of the Department of Foreign Affairs has been consistently that this matter requires legislation and that the position is simply that the Department of Justice are dragging their feet on it and have been doing so for a long number of years to the detriment of this country internationally?  Has the time not come for a Government decision one way or another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald is correct in saying that the Department of Foreign Affairs have been consistent in their view with regard to the necessity for legislation but the Department of Justice are consistent also in their view that legislation is not necessary.  From recent discussions and negotiations that we had with the Attorney-General's office, I believe that the Attorney-General is of the opinion also that the right is on the side of the Department of Justice.  I can tell both Deputies that I, too, should be happy if this matter could be dealt with speedily and finalised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that because of an internal professional dispute among civil servants who <Col N="1916" /> are not accountable to the public, this country stands unique among a minority of countries in the UN as not having ratified the convention in question? Either the Government are running the country or they are not running it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy dismisses the interpretation of legal argument merely as disagreement between civil servants, he is being unfair not only to himself but to the civil servants.  There appears to be two views in this instance. One view is that legislation is necessary and the other is that legislation is not necessary.  Unfortunately, this situation has dragged on for a long time. However, as I have said, if legislation is necessary I would not regard it as a priority because of there being so many other things to do.  But because the matter in question has dragged on for so long we should all be happy that it would be resolved.  It is not a question merely of civil servants not agreeing.  It is a question of legal interpretation.</P>

At that time the Department of Foreign Affairs were informed by the Department of Justice that in their view the convention, subject if necessary to consulting the Attorney-General, could be ratified without legislation.  This view has been repeated several times since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the negotiation machinery available to staff in the prison service is adequate to deal with any reasonable grievance the staff may have from time to time.  The staff associations have in the past shown a willingness to use the accepted negotiation machinery and I have no reason to doubt that they will continue to use it.</P>
      <P>A long-standing problem in the prison service has been the uncertainty about the preparedness of staff to work overtime in sufficient numbers to maintain staffing levels, especially during prisoners' evening recreation period after 5 p.m.  This matter was dealt with at length in reply to a question on 21 May 1980.  Discussions are taking place with the Prison Officers' Association about the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in recent years, indeed in recent months, there have been a number of incidents which have resulted in prisoners being deprived of the privileges to which they are normally entitled and that this situation arises from the industrial unrest <Col N="1919" /> among sensible, level-headed and rational prison officers who are apparently frustrated by the existing machinery for dealing with their complaints?

      <P>The Deputy appears not to have a clear picture of the situation. I would assure him and the House that the association in question and the Department of Justice are making progress on this matter that is satisfactory to both sides.  I do not accept what the Deputy has said, that there were a number of incidents when prisoners were denied privileges.  That is not so.  I agree there is a problem.  Rostering duties have been difficult to sort out and I am sure the Deputy will be glad to hear that we have had a number of meetings under existing machinery, which is working well, which is seen to be working well and which has been accepted by both sides.  I am glad to say that significant progress is being made.</P>

Does he accept that in the last four months prisoners were locked up without recreational facilities, apparently because staff were not available or if they were available they were unable to proceed with their duties in the normal way due to industrial unrest?  I am putting it to the Minister that that occurred on at least two occasions.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the problem of staffing prisons is an exceptionally difficult one.  There have been difficult times in the prison service and there have been difficult situations in recent times.  I do not think anybody would want a situation in which prisoners would not have their evening <Col N="1920" /> recreation, particularly in summer, from 5 o'clock onwards.  It would lead to an immediate heightening of tension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was the type of locking up suggested by the Deputy it would lead to very serious problems, because if tension heightens, as it would, we would be running the risk of having our prisons unmanageable in a matter of 24 hours.  I recognise that as does anybody who knows anything about the prison system.  Part of the problem was the hold-up in recruitment of staff.  The target for this year is 400 of which 350 will be the net gain because there will be a wastage of 50.  This will bring our staff up to 1,500, which is a big improvement. With the improvement in staff and with present discussions going on with the association about a new rostering structure. I am satisfied everything possible is being done to keep our prisons manageable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has satisfied himself with the present operation of barring orders; if he will give stronger powers to the Garda in the enforcement of such orders; if he is aware of widespread concern regarding the present weakness of such orders due to the lack of enforcement by the Garda and the inevitable delays involved in the necessity to issue a second summons in respect of a breach of orders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the House on 14 June 1978, in reply to a previous parliamentary question (col. 1093) I was aware at that time that difficulties could arise in the enforcement of barring orders in certain cases.  I also said then that it did not follow that amending legislation was either necessary <Col N="1923" /> or appropriate, that other approaches to the problem might be preferable and that I was having the matter examined.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, an instruction was issued by the Garda Commissioner drawing the attention of all members of the force to the penalties for a breach of a barring order and directing that any complaint of a breach of a barring order should be attended to by the Garda, who may themselves institute proceedings in respect of that offence.  The instruction also drew attention to the circumstances in which arrest without warrant may be made in such cases.</P>
      <P>Additionally, a meeting was held earlier this year between representatives of the Garda Síochána and various interested groups to discuss the problems involved.</P>
      <P>The indications are that the position has since improved: in particular, no complaints have been received at Garda Headquarters since the date &mdash; 9 January last &mdash; of the meeting that I have mentioned. It may be too soon to say that the problem has been dealt with.  I should perhaps make it clear that the solution frequently advocated, namely the provision of powers of arrest without warrant, would not necessarily improve the situation &mdash; arrested people would normally get bail &mdash; and it could, in certain circumstances, make it worse.  On the other hand it could, on balance, prove to be the better approach.  There are arguments for and against and I shall be keeping the matter under review in the light of experience gained as to how the current instructions work out. As I have said, the Garda have received no complaints since their last discussion with interested groups, as early as last January.</P>

I am told there was also telephone and radio communication with Dalkey Garda Station.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the Garda communications at the scene of the crash were satisfactory. There was one small difficulty in that the railway embankment was 30 feet high and it was not possible to communicate with the communications centre in Dublin Castle directly from the railway tunnel.

However, the proportion of serving sergeants in this category to the total number of serving sergeants at various dates, for example, at the beginning of each year, is not readily available.</P>
      <P>In the period since January 1970 the members promoted on the basis indicated constituted 13.9 per cent of all promotions to the rank of sergeant.  So far this year eight out of a total of 49 were promoted on this basis.</P>

      <P>Before lunch I spoke of the advantages and disadvantages of Ireland entering the European Monetary System.  While we are on the credit issue, I would appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and members of the Government to ensure that no company and no individual suffers because of the credit restrictions which are in force at present. Only this morning information was made available to me that officers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation were actually issuing threats to farmers who are unable to make their loan repayments. That is a very serious situation and the Minister for Finance will have to take issue with the officers of the ACC about it.  This has never happened before.  They are going around now and issuing threats.  I know of a case in my own county of Westmeath where a farmer has had problems with animal disease. Only yesterday an officer from the ACC came to him and told him he would have to seize his stock if he did not make his repayments.  This is a very serious situation and it is something that is beyond the farmer's control.  In normal circumstances he would have been in a position to make his loan repayments and there would be no problem.  That is only one case.  There may be thousands more.  I am sure the ACC are going beyond their bounds in issuing threats of that nature to those people.  Something must be done to ensure that there is no recurrence of this tactic which is new on the agricultural scene.  I understand that even the banks are reluctant to go that far in their efforts to try to get farmers to make their repayments.  I would mention that the commercial banks and the ACC were themselves responsible for the indiscriminate issue of capital.  They went around in person asking people to avail of their credit facilities.  They got many farmers into debt and they will have to accept their share of the blame if there are credit restrictions or if farmers are in financial difficulties, or indeed if small businesses are in financial difficulties because the farming community is not alone in this issue.  I hope that matter will be taken care of and that there will be no <Col N="2006" /> further threats to the farming community.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael leader and the Labour leader spoke this morning about security in the Border areas and about security in general.  If security is an issue with the British authorities and with some of the Northern Unionists the blame must be laid where it belongs and that is with the British Government and those people who want the continuation of the Border. If they want the continuation of the Border between North and South they should be prepared to pay for it.  The Irish taxpayers are hard pressed at present and they cannot afford to pay.  We are spending millions of pounds of taxpayers' money today to exercise a maximum amount of security.  If the British people and the Orangemen in particular want greater security, they should go to Mrs. Thatcher and ask her to spend more of the money she saved in the EEC to introduce greater security measures along the Border.</P>

      <P>On their side, not on this side.  If the members of the IRA have such easy access to this side of the Border there is no one to blame, because I am informed that security there is very lax.  It is no use for Ian Paisley to have rallies along the Border and talk about security when the blame must be laid fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the British Government.  They are the people who will decide sooner or later whether they are going to continue with the Border or not.  If they want security measures they will have to ask the British taxpayers to pay for them, because the Irish taxpayers can not afford to pay any more.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in his speech mentioned the efforts made to increase our exports as a means of improving our balance of payments situation. This is something which I wholeheartedly support.  We need to improve our marketing arrangements wherever possible. I wish to pay a tribute to the various agencies who have done a wonderful job <Col N="2009" /> over the years in regard to the marketing of our agricultural produce and of our manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>Bord Báinne have been very much to the fore in the field of marketing.  They have travelled to the ends of the earth in their efforts to secure additional markets for our agricultural products and must be highly commended.  However, they will have to intensify their efforts if we are to avoid building up the butter mountains and milk lakes which we hear so much about.  The board have done a wonderful job.  Any support which they may require to improve marketing arrangements throughout the world should be forthcoming in future years.</P>
      <P>With regard to our beef exports, we must have an alternative to intervention, which is not a solution to the problem of beef surpluses.  We must have better marketing facilities in preference to intervention. Intervention is only the lazy man's way out and is just a means for our beef factories here to dispose of their surplus without making any positive efforts whatsoever to improve marketing arrangements throughout the world.</P>

I avail of this opportunity to appeal to the trade union movement to exercise greater responsibility in the control of their individual members who are responsible for such turmoil and strife throughout the country at present. They should take strong action against those people who cause wildcat strikes, doing untold damage not only to the economy but in many cases, to the weaker section of the community as well.  Something will have to be done to ensure that we have no more unofficial strikes here because they will wreck the economy.  Otherwise we will see the day when we cannot continue <Col N="2010" /> any longer as an industrial nation.  I would hope that commonsense and goodwill will prevail and that we shall have an end to these wildcat strikes to which we have become so accustomed in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael leader said this morning that the present Government were doing nothing for the protection of the environment.  We need not go beyond this city to see the neglect of the environment by a city council which is completely composed of Fine Gael and Labour people.  They are responsible for the activities of the city council which looks after the services in our capital city and the blame must be laid on their shoulders.</P>

      <P>A debate of this type traditionally is an opportunity to review the performance of the Government of the day.  It is time that we took stock of what has been done and what is being proposed by the Government to improve our social and economic situation. Deputy Keegan, who is now leaving the House, has surprised me in the simplicity of the solutions he has offered for the enormous difficulties which now confront our people.  He has blamed the banks for the problem of the farmers.  He has blamed the present Dublin Corporation, for what is happening to the environment. He knows, as we all do, that the reasons go much deeper than that and, indeed, many of them must be laid at the door of Deputy Keegan and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>A three year span in Government is regarded as being a reasonable time to hold a Government responsible for their policies, their activities or inactivities, as the case may be.  The assertion of the Taoiseach this morning that the nation is performing well expresses to me a frightening indifference and a frightening failure on the part of the Government to realise the actual position and admit frankly without scaremongering, that there is a very serious economic problem confronting us now.  It has been said by Members of the Fianna Fáil Party that any kind of severe criticism of the Government is looked upon, as I said before, as somewhat less than patriotic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must at least be prepared to admit that there are problems because unless we do we cannot even begin to seek solutions to them.  At present the Government seem to be more concerned with off-loading the reasons for the problems on to the energy crisis than anything else.  They have repeatedly said that <Col N="2012" /> current economic difficulties are solely the result of the price of oil.  Deputy Keegan said that the reason we were able to solve the energy crisis in 1973-74 was a co-operative Opposition that acted responsibly.  Perhaps I could refresh the Deputy's memory and that of his colleagues by quoting from volume 291, column 2311 of the Official Report, a statement made by Deputy Haughey, now the Taoiseach, on 1 July 1976 referring to the then Government when he said:</P>
    <P>It is no longer possible for either the Government or their apologists to claim that any particular failing is a result of the situation they inherited or the outcome of policies for which they are not responsible.  They have had ample time to manage our affairs as they saw fit and to implement their own strategies.</P>
    <P>That indicates that the &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; Opposition, in the person of Deputy Haughey, did not admit or take cognisance of the difficulties of an energy crisis in 1973, 1974 and 1975.</P>
    <P>The position is that the Government are not prepared to accept what everybody knows, that the state of the economy now is disastrous.  The country is in a shambles.  That is the reality.  We have the ESRI, the Central Bank, the Confederation of Irish Industries, and the Irish Exporters Association, all independent agencies with no political axe to grind all coming to the same conclusions. That is no accident.  Do the Government accept what these agencies give as their considered opinion of the present state of the economy?</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago the ESRI predicted that we were facing a 20 per cent inflation rate and an unemployment figure in excess of 100,000.  These two predictions have not been refuted.  Indeed, the figure given by the ESRI for inflation was borne out only last week when we had the enormous increase amounting to 20.2 per cent for the year ending mid-May 1980.  And there is even a worse trend which can be seen for the quarter ending in mid-May which tells us that <Col N="2013" /> the inflation rate is running at 7.4 per cent for the quarter.  At a time when the average EMS inflation rate is in the region of 10 per cent this is something the country cannot afford.  Yet, we had this whistling-past-the-graveyard attitude by the Taoiseach this morning assuring the nation that everything would work out all right if left in his hands.  That is not tackling the problems and the malaise in our midst at the moment.  The Taoiseach and his colleagues know that. This Government, which gave categorical assurances in writing that they would ensure single figure inflation within a short time of assuming office, now have a 20.2 per cent inflation rate.</P>
    <P>In the same volume of the Official Report, at column 2315 on 1 July 1976, Deputy Haughey referred to the ESRI report of that time and said:  The institute suggests that the rate of inflation this year will exceed 18 per cent.  That surely is a prediction which must cause the deepest and greatest anxiety to the Government and to our economic planners.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say at column 2318:</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be axiomatic that a national economic plan, based on the realities of our situation, presenting some attainable targets is a <i>sine qua non</i> of our situation.</P>
    <P>That came from the man who is now Taoiseach and has the reins in his hands to do what he proposed in 1976, but we find him as Taoiseach in 1980 telling us that we have been performing very well in difficult circumstances when we all know that the reverse is true.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report of 5 June this year did not put a tooth on what they thought of the economy.  They say in the very first sentence of the report:</P>
    <P>Ireland is facing a serious balance-of-payments problem.  The deficit on current accounts was estimated at £740 million last year, equivalent to 10 per cent of GNP, a proportion exceeded only once before, in the early 1950s.  Relative to GNP, the deficit <Col N="2014" /> was also very high by international standards, being more than twice as large as that recorded in any other EEC country.</P>
    <P>This is from an agency which has no axe to grind and which should be taken cognisance of if we are serious about our problems.</P>
    <P>On an occasion like this one would have expected from the man who proposed this in 1976 some plan, or at least a promise of a plan, to overcome our difficulties.  Instead we get, as we did from Deputy Keegan, what I regard as nothing more than pathetic pleading for cooperation and consideration of the problems by the public generally.  If the general public saw that the Government were prepared to assert themselves and propose remedial measures to eradicate the malaise in the economy I think they would get that cooperation, but in the absence of that kind of leadership and that kind of grasping-the-nettle approach by the Government, I fear&mdash;and I regret to say this&mdash;that the kind of cooperation necessary to solve our problems will not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry in repeated statements and in commentaries have made their case requesting and latterly appealing for some form of recognition of their difficulties.  Ample warnings have been issued by them of stocking problems because of very high interest rates.  We are told there is now a reduction in orders and the confederation gave irrefutable evidence of this only three weeks ago.  In a survey carried out in a number of firms 87 per cent said that their order books had contracted.</P>
    <P>The question of growth rate was mentioned today by the Taoiseach.  The ERSI have spoken on this and mentioned a growth rate of 1.25 per cent this year.  The Central Bank feel that this 1¼ per cent is even too optimistic and feel that we will not even reach that.  This is the scenario which we now face.  One request of many which was persistently pursued by industry was an undertaking that the Government would underwrite the exchange risk in foreign borrowing, but this has not been done.  Three weeks <Col N="2015" /> ago during the debate on his Estimate the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism said that he had under consideration a scheme which would be selffinancing. The Taoiseach said today that this is still being looked into.  This matter is being looked into for a number of months now.  While this is happening the country is suffering a haemorrhage in job loses and lost orders on the international export markets.  This is the one thing which might inspire these people to have more confidence in themselves, to seek capital abroad at a reasonable rate underwritten by a Government to whom they look and on whom they depend. The Government's indifference to them and to their pleadings is nothing short of appalling in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The result of all this, despite the assertions of the Ministers and their Taoiseach, is that we have a very serious trend in unemployment at the moment. Over the past five months we had an average of 2,000 job losses per month. The most recent figures available indicate that for the month of May job losses reached 3,900.  Two weeks ago, in reply to a question of mine in the House, I was told that systematic short-time working for the month of April reached 3,058.  The systematic short-time working for the first four months of this year matched with the same period in 1979 has doubled and, in fact, has more than doubled for the month of April.  There were 1,400 odd in April 1979 and 3,058 in April this year.</P>
    <P>Last week, in reply to a question by me in relation to the job creation prospects resulting from the transfer of 3 per cent of the expenditure of consumers to Irish products, I was told that this particular campaign, which was set on a three year target, has not yet been completed and that the Minister was not in a position to give me exact details.  We must recall that in the manifesto the three year campaign of Buy Irish was to produce 10,000 extra jobs.  After some supplementary questioning by me last week the Minister, with some reluctance, admitted that as of now, with two and a half years of the three year period elapsed, <Col N="2016" /> the number of jobs which could be put down to a transfer of consumer expenditure to Irish produce amounted to in the region of 1,300.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying the efforts of the Irish Goods Council, who are doing a very fine job.  This year they received less than 1 per cent increase in their grant-in-aid over 1979.  This is in a year where a 20 per cent plus inflation rate is raging. If that is the way this particular agency, which have been given the onerous task of producing this campaign and ensuring its effectiveness, are to be treated, how can anybody expect the degree of success which might be expected if they were given sufficient money to carry out this job?  So much for job creation.</P>
    <P>This is a very sad day for me because I discovered that in my town a major industry have gone on a three day week. This was a nationally known industry, part of a multi-national company on whose shoulders we pinned our prospects for the future in the textile industry. This company, because of the international recession and because of mismanagement at home, are now forced into putting their employees on systematic short time.  I have also been told that this morning a receiver moved into a factory in my town where 250 people are employed.  Will this be a feature of the industrial scene for the rest of this year and possibly 1981?</P>
    <P>We are still awaiting a frank admission by the Government that there are problems.  People are not put on systematic short time and receivers do not walk into premises just to pass the time.  There are very grave reasons for this kind of thing happening.  Yet we are told that with the co-operation of all concerned we will ride out the storm. That kind of indifferent approach is not good enough.</P>
    <P>On the farming side, there is a total lack of confidence among farmers many of whom supported Fianna Fáil in 1977 on foot of the promises made but which were not honoured.  If we look at the figures for the index on farm incomes and if we take 1971 as a base of 100 we find that the position in the intervening <Col N="2017" /> years has been as follows: 1972, 130; 1973, 149; 1974, 117; 1975, 139; 1976, 133; 1977, 161; 1978, 169; 1979, 141, and that for 1980 the figure will be betbeen 121 and 125.  These figures have been issued by the ESRI and by the Central Bank.  They indicate that since 1978 there has been a reduction of almost one-third in farmers' incomes.  In this sort of situation, how can farmers have confidence? Last week a farmer told me that he was getting as much for bullocks four years ago as he is getting for them today. This is the situation despite the extent to which feedstuffs and other inputs have gone out of control in terms of prices.</P>
    <P>Despite this, Deputy Keegan in a puerile and simplistic fashion blames the banks for the problems being experienced by the farmers.  The banks may be at fault in many respects but I do not think that we can blame then totally for the problems of the farmers.</P>
    <P>The assurance given by Fianna Fáil in respect of farmers' tax has gone by the board.  Last year there was some fancy footwork so far as the imposition of a 2 per cent tax on produce was concerned while this year the capacity of Government Ministers to dance is nothing less. Only yesterday in the Seanad the Minister for Finance, when under pressure, would not give an assurance that the resource tax would be discontinued at the end of this year but less than 24 hours later the Taoiseach gave an assurance in this House that this tax was only a passing phase and would be abolished by the end of 1980.  One would like to know who is responsible for various aspects of government in this Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, oil prices are responsible for some of our economic problems. From what has been said one would think that this factor was totally responsible for everything that is befalling our economy.  In this regard I shall quote two sets of figures to indicate the comparison between the impact of oil prices in 1973 and 1974 and in 1979 and 1980. These are figures that were quoted by the Central Bank in their review.  In 1973 <Col N="2018" /> oil accounted for 5.9 per cent of our total imports bill.  In 1974 that figure more than doubled, increasing to 12.8 per cent while in 1979 it was 10.8 per cent and in 1980, according to predictions based on the past five months, the figure is likely to be in the region of 13.6 to 14 per cent. Anybody having regard to this situation must realise that in 1973 and in 1974 the impact of oil prices was much greater than is the case today.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil rode back to power on foot of an assurance to curb prices.  They assured a gullible electorate in 1977 that they would at least restructure the National Prices Commission.  They told us there was no need for escalating prices and that the National Coalition were responsible for the then increasing prices to the extent that they had not exercised control in this area and that they had put a junior Minister in charge of prices.  Fianna Fáil told us also that they would appoint a senior Minister to oversee the workings of the NPC.  They went so far as to tell us that they would amend the accounting system of the ESB with a view to reducing their increased costs. However, we find that so far as the ESB are concerned price increases between 1977 and June of this year have amounted to 46.9 per cent.  Every housewife finds that each day when she goes shopping the situation in regard to prices is a far cry from the Fianna Fáil manifesto basket that was peddled around the country in every supermarket during the election campaign of 1977.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed dismally in this area of prices.  They have failed also to live up to their responsibility both to farmers and to fishermen and they have failed to realise the importance of industry, a sector that is pleading today for some recognition of their difficulties. Yet the Government are asking for co-operation, for moderation and for a recognition of international trading conditions and so on.  There is no initiative forthcoming from the very one source that might produce some solution that would alleviate some of the pressures on parts of our economy that are experiencing very difficult times and which will <Col N="2019" /> not survive in this situation indefinitely without some help from the Government.</P>
    <P>The agricultural and industrial sectors will suffer irreparable damage that will take years to rectify unless there is what most people regard as a reasonable attempt to rectify the situation.  I appreciate that there are difficulties internationally but if there was any recognition by the Government of the difficulties being experienced by people and if there were some back-up initiative to ease the pressure, I should be very happy.  That is not forthcoming, and as soon as the electorate get a chance I hope they will give their answer.  The sooner the electorate are given that chance the better for us here and for the people of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rapid escalation in energy prices during the past year is pushing the world economy deeper into recession. Uncertainties about the security of future oil supplies, which are underlined by unsettled political conditions in the Middle East, have affected business confidence worldwide so that the investment decisions which might have mitigated the effects of the recession are not being taken.  This is a serious situation.  Not only does it affect our competitiveness and the market outlets for existing Irish industry but obviously it will be that much more difficult to maintain an adequate level of job creation through the attraction of new business enterprise.</P>
      <P>These are problems which have to be grappled with now and they present a major challenge to our self-discipline as a nation.  Beyond the present difficulties, the deteriorating world energy situation casts a very long shadow.  In the years ahead difficulties are likely to occur which call for current planning if our economic posture is to be adapted to these fundamental changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the current economic difficulties worldwide call for a disciplined reaction from us.  Indeed, in the short to medium term, self-discipline and self-reliance must be the major weapons <Col N="2020" /> in the defence of our economic viability. One of the major factors aggravating the climate between the oil-producing nations and the consumers is that the latter are making a very poor job of convincing the producers that their oil is overpriced.</P>
    <P>We have on the one hand a group of nations, many of which until recently have been seriously underdeveloped, who possess a non-renewable resource for which the world is clamouring.  They see the opportunity to exploit their present good fortune but they also see a large proportion of their apparent increased income being swallowed up by the effects of inflation on the goods and services which they wish to obtain to develop their economies.  It is true that the increased oil prices are themselves adding impetus to the inflationary spiral, but the producing countries will say, with some justice, that the main difficulty is the reluctance of consuming countries to accept that standards of living based on abundant, cheap energy must be reappraised.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous international efforts to develop a uniform policy among the consuming nations which might convince the producers that a point of genuine consumer resistance to increasing prices has been reached. The fact that this evidence of consumer resistance is with us in the form of an involuntary contraction in world economic activity is a measure of the lack of success in developing more positive ways of dealing with the crisis by international means.  I believe it is not realistic to look for nice, tidy solutions at international level.  It is clearly a waste of time to bemoan the fact that one bloc of countries has created the difficulties and that another bloc has failed to solve them.  We would be far better advised&mdash;and indeed there is no practical alternative&mdash;if we looked to ourselves to see what we can do to counter these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Very recently I had an opportunity to outline to the House, in the course of presenting a Supplementary Estimate for my Department, my analysis of the major <Col N="2021" /> elements which should form our response to the new energy situation.  I indicated a number of areas where plans were being developed to bring about major, long-term changes in our energy posture.  It is clear that major adaptations require considerable time to bear fruit.</P>
    <P>For instance, construction has already commenced on a coal burning electricity generating station which reflects an important change of emphasis in energy policy but this plant will not be delivering electricity to the grid until about 1985.  Similarly, even if in the near future we can secure compliance with the technical and economic pre-conditions for a major extension of the natural gas grid, the practical effects of this largescale diversification project would not be felt until about mid-decade also.  The new programmes on which we have embarked to expand turf production, to assess and make use of low-grade coal reserves and to exploit new alternative energy systems all have extended lead times before benefits in terms of new energy supplies can be experienced.</P>
    <P>The areas in which we can make an immediate response to the economic difficulties represented by higher energy costs may be more limited, but they are not by any means insignificant.  Recently, when I was emphasising that production of turf by individuals or groups for use next winter could be a worthwhile contribution, I was asked whether it was not a short-sighted reaction to the present situation to encourage the more rapid depletion of an important indigenous fuel.  My response was that we are faced with immediate difficulties which are having a serious impact on our balance of payments and on living costs for everybody.  Increased energy costs are going to be a permanent feature and we must make permanent adaptations to meet them.  In that period of adjustment it makes good economic sense to expand production of indigenous&mdash;admittedly non-renewable&mdash; fuels to help us absorb the sudden pressures with which the economy is faced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2022" /> We might ask ourselves what would be the solution if we could conjure up the ideal answer to the present energy problems.  The ideal solution would be the availability of an energy source which was indigenous, immediately available and of minimal cost.  There is, in fact, such a solution to hand.  The conventional way of describing it is conservation. It is indigenous.  If we can generate the same amount of economic activity with nine tonnes of imported oil as we have formerly achieved with ten tonnes then this has about the same effact in terms of economic activity achieved on our balance of payments as if we produced the additional tonne of oil here.</P>
    <P>Much of the enhanced energy value which we can obtain from conservation is immediately available.  Some schemes which involve significant investment or adaptation of plant and so on may take time but there is a great deal we can do to save energy today, this coming weekend or next week.  We can do this by exercising a little care and thought; by looking to energy-saving possibilities in our homes, at our workplaces and by being a bit more selective in our use of transport.</P>
    <P>Conservation is the equivalent of energy available at minimal cost.  In many cases it costs nothing at all&mdash;it is simply a question of switching off, turning down a thermostat a degree or two or foregoing the use of a car for some trivial purpose.  Even where money must be invested in energy conservation the cost can in most instances be fully justified even on the more stringent economic grounds.  For instance, the insulation of homes or other buildings can result in the costs being recovered in as short a period as a couple of years arising from the savings on fuel bills.  Attention to the fuel efficiency of boilers and other industrial plant will normally repay any additional costs involved even more quickly.</P>
    <P>These are obvious areas where self-discipline and self-reliance can help to cushion the effects of rising energy costs. They may indeed be obvious but we are <Col N="2023" /> all to blame for not giving these possibilities the attention which they deserve.  I am at present in the process of establishing a campaign to increase awareness of the importance of energy conservation and I plan to maintain this effort for most of the present year.  There can be considerable scope for debate about what the potential for energy savings might be.  A 10 per cent overall saving as compared with the quantity of energy we might otherwise have used would be a highly satisfactory result and I would regard something less than that as being very acceptable.  But, in fact, there can be no absolute guarantee at all about the results.  I say this because it is important to realise that success or failure in any energy conservation depends on a conscious decision by individuals, families, firms and other groups of people to do something about the unnecessary use of fuels, which brings us back to the concepts of awareness and of self-discipline to which I referred at the outset.</P>
    <P>This concept of a disciplined reaction has as much relevance at national level as it has for the individual if we relate the position to the national economy as a whole.  The great bulk of the factors which have increased the cost of energy have not arisen within our own economy.  They have been imposed from outside.  If we are to live with these increased costs we must redouble our determination not to add any additional self-imposed burden to our own backs by insisting on measures which will further increase costs and reduce the competitiveness of the goods and services which we export.  No one can deny that energy is costly at present.  But the most expensive energy is the energy which one has not got and we must continue to import the oil and bear the consequential costs necessary to maintain essential economic activities.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of domestic prices for fuel and energy.  The control of prices is not within my Ministerial responsibility but the cost of energy supplies and the inter-relationship between supply and prices are matters <Col N="2024" /> which are of very considerable concern to me.  There is no doubt that increased energy costs are bearing heavily on everybody in the community whether in their private capacity or in business.  It is a very natural and human reaction to say &ldquo;not again&rdquo; when the price of some essential fuel responds to another rise in external energy markets.</P>
    <P>The first point we must bear in mind is that, since we import about 80 per cent of our energy needs, there is an inescapable and close link between the movement of prices on international markets and the price we pay to our local fuel supplier.  Even if we were very much less dependent on imported fuels our home prices would still have to follow international markets.  We can see this clearly in Britain where the price of North Sea oil continues to occupy a high position in the international price tables and where domestic natural gas, which is distributed by a national utility on the basis of long-standing, favourable contracts with offshore operators, is being adjusted up towards general energy cost levels.  The boost to an economy which can come from an abundance of indigenous energy supplies is, of course, very significant in present circumstances but, at the level of the individual consumer of energy, the international market price is what finally determines the amount he or she must pay.</P>
    <P>I recognise the basis, but do not accept the philosophy, of the argument that conservation of fuels should be achieved predominantly by a price mechanism.  This may be orthodox economic logic but an indiscriminate pursuit of such a policy would carry a special penalty for the people who can least afford to pay.  Nevertheless it has to be accepted that energy must be realistically priced so that the costs to the individual or firm reflect the enhanced international value of the commodity concerned.  This applies to domestically produced fuels&mdash;such wholly indigenous fuels as peat and natural gas&mdash;as well as to largely import-based fuels like electricity. If prices are not realistic then there are certain undesirable side effects. The incentive towards economy in the <Col N="2025" /> use of fuels will be weakened and, particularly in the case of native fuels such as turf, a run will develop on relatively cheap fuels resulting in shortages and supply problems.</P>
    <P>There is therefore no practical alternative to an acceptance of realistically priced energy as a continuing factor in private and business life.  But excessive pricing of essential fuels is a totally different matter.  In this regard a very close scrutiny is maintained over the pricing policy of the fuel supply boards under my control.  Indeed, many people in these organisations and some independent commentators will say that pricing policy is too restrictive and that these bodies should have greater freedom to follow the general trend of energy markets.  This view has a certain validity and here we must adopt a medium line. Pricing policy for State fuel supply companies should certainly not be so restrictive as to result in the continuous accumulation of deficits and an overdependence on borrowing to fund essential development.</P>
    <P>I make these comments on fuel prices mainly to state the argument for a balanced approach.  We would all be naive in the extreme to think that domestic Irish prices can by some mechanism be insulated from international market trends over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable coverage by the news media within the past few days of a report on our offshore prospects.  There is always a tendency for euphoria to creep in when optimistic comments are made on this subject and the reaction to the recent report was no exception.</P>
    <P>Of course the prospect that we may become an oil-producing country is an exciting one and of course such a development would have quite fundamental implications for us in economic and energy terms.  There are, however, a few points I should like to emphasise and, to be fair, these would appear to have been brought out in the report in question.  The most basic point <Col N="2026" /> is that the conclusions drawn so far have been based on one exploration well. There is no doubt that people who have expertise and experience in the oil exploration business can draw certain inferences from quite limited exploration results.  However, the practical position is that further drilling must be completed and the results evaluated before definite conclusions can be drawn.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, even if the deposit dealt with in this report was confirmed to be of commercial proportions, it would probably be of moderate size and the period for which production from the deposit could be maintained would be fairly limited.  I would not, at this stage, regard this point as being a major constraint on further planning.  If we have commercial development of oil then I believe that this would provide a new impetus for exploration which could well give rise to further discoveries which would come on stream in the coming decades.  The point I make, though, is that taking the possibilities of this particular prospect on its own, as presented in the report, the production would in a time sense be quite limited.</P>
    <P>Emphasis was also placed in the report on the need for production technology to catch up with the kind of conditions which exist in the Porcupine Basin.  I have never had any doubt about the ability of technology to solve the production problems involved.  A great deal of research has been in progress in recent years and as a result there are a number of possible production systems which could be developed to the practical stage provided an appropriate deposit of potentially economic importance is confirmed.  It must be borne in mind that new systems tend to be costly to develop to full potential.  Teething troubles are inevitable and it would be only prudent to take a fairly conservative view about the period of time which could elapse between confirmation of a commercial discovery in deep waters and the date on which the first oil would be landed.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that I have made these comments not because I believe we <Col N="2027" /> should be pessimistic about our offshore prospects.  My main concern is the danger that understandable enthusiasm about future prospects would distract our attention from the immediate problems which we have to face in the energy sector.  If we are fortunate enough to confirm that commercially exploitable oil exists in our offshore we will be faced with a new economic challenge.  Experience elsewhere has shown that success or failure will largely depend on the extent to which we can plan effectively and maintain a sense of responsibility and proportion in pursuing these plans.  An essential pre-condition to success would be that we had maintained our industrial and commercial competitiveness reasonably intact by adjusting in a disciplined way to the changed international energy situation which is not simply a prospect but a reality here and now.</P>
    <P>Now at the time when drilling is beginning again this year out on the Porcupine and with surveys being carried out on the Goban Spur, it is inevitable that there will be speculation about the extent of our deposits.  As Minister for Energy and as a member of the Government I cannot indulge in speculation.  I can only go on hard established facts.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not sound a warning that euphoria about oil arising from this kind of speculation could be dangerous.  It could generate expectations which as yet, at any rate, we are not entitled to entertain.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I would dearly like to have the privilege of announcing a major oil find and there is not a Deputy in this House, irrespective of party, who would not like to hear that announcement.  But it would be monumental foolishness for us to base our plans and our hopes on an oil bonanza until the extent of the deposits is thoroughly established.  If we were to take any other attitude we would be exposing ourselves to the risk of a cruel joke of fate.</P>
    <P>We must therefore press ahead with the policies which I outlined in detail in the course of my introduction to the Supplementary Estimate for my Department <Col N="2028" /> recently.  If it is confirmed that we will have commercial production of oil in a few years' time then the long-term outlook for the development of our economy and for a period of sustained national development will have improved dramatically.  In the meantime we must cope with high energy costs and the risks inherent in our present vulnerable supply situation.  We must concentrate our immediate attention on these problems and everyone will agree that this task is formidable.</P>
    <P>I have listened in this and earlier debates to references from the other side of the House to our election manifesto and criticisms of various aspects of it. The theme and substance of that criticism could be put together in one short phrase, although it is not the way it was put but this is what it amounts to: the manifesto was too ambitious.  That is an easy criticism to make but it is a superficial one.  I am confident it will not be the verdict of the historians when the time comes to pass judgment on it.  The people who in July 1977 gave a mandate to implement that manifesto did so because they wanted to see a determined effort to solve the chronic economic and social problems that were holding us back.  The manifesto showed how these problems could and should be dealt with. That was in stark contrast to the attitude of the National Coalition Government of that time.  They had a hopeless and fatalistic attitude towards solving those problems.</P>
    <P>I am proud to have been associated with that manifesto and I am proud especially of the manner in which the manifesto identified one of the central problems, that of unemployment, and then set out to show how we should tackle it.  We put more people to work than any Government in the history of the State.  I am very proud of that and I have every right to be.  Those who oppose the manifesto promises have tried to suggest that the jobs we created were all in the public sector and were simply a burden on what they would call the productive taxpayer.  Of course we created many jobs in the public sector, <Col N="2029" /> all of them necessary jobs like the extra teachers and the additional gardai, but we generated many more jobs and the great majority of them were in the private sector.  The only regret I have about the manifesto is that one of the expressed conditions in it for full success in achieving the targets set out therein was the call clearly spelt out in the manifesto but not accepted, for moderation in income increases.  If there had been a wiser and wider response to that call we would have done even better in regard to job creation.</P>
    <P>Of course we have had to deal with the oil crisis which followed the upheaval in Iran.  That was bound to have very severe effects, but I can fairly claim that our approach has been quite different from that of the National Coalition when they were faced with the oil crisis of the early seventies.  It will be remembered that in Government they used to tell us, as the former Minister for Finance did, of the Irish economy in such circumstances being like a cork on the ocean being tossed around and that there was nothing we could do about it.  That was not our attitude in Opposition.  It is not our attitude in Government when faced with a very serious international situation.  The Government are not throwing up their hands when in power or saying that we cannot do anything about it.  We are realistically pointing to the things we cannot do anything about but we subscribe to the doctrine that the more difficult things which are outside our control are, the greater the obligation on us to take steps on what is within our control.</P>
    <P>That is in sharp contrast to those on the benches opposite who are at present engaged in such sharp criticism of the Government and of the manifesto.  I heard Deputy FitzGerald this morning saying once more what he and his colleagues have frequently said and what they would like people to believe: that in implementing the manifesto we squandered the nation's resources and that there are no resources to deal with the present problem.  I deny that and I ask: <Col N="2030" /> did we squander resources in putting young people to work and creating all the jobs we did?  If that is not what they are talking about, what do they suggest we should have done?  Should we not have taken the rates off houses?  Do they feel we should put those rates back on again?  What are they suggesting?  We got the economy moving to the extent that we can face, with difficulty but with confidence, the very serious problems now lying ahead for us and for all the world economies.</P>
    <P>That we can face them with confidence is due to the fact that the Fianna Fáil manifesto was accepted by the people and was implemented to the extent that it was possible for us to implement it.  That was conditioned by nonacceptance of some of the conditions but, to the extent that it was implemented, it has vastly strengthened our economy and given us a base and a strength to resist and deal with the serious problems now facing us and, in due course, to go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, within the time allotted to me, try to make the points I have to make.  I have no intention of replying to the Minister but I am amazed at the confidence he has expressed in tackling our problems.  I listened this morning to the Taoiseach and now I have been listening to the Minister for Energy and I have not found, in either of their contributions, any explanation of how they are going to tackle our problems because they are very serious indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the agricultural scene, it is apparent to neutral observers that the incomes of farmers are in serious decline. This is something that the Government should tackle by providing correctives even outside the EEC.  We may say that we are tied to what we can do within the EEC but other governments have done certain things to improve the conditions of their farmers when they felt that it was necessary.  I want to refer to a paper by Professor Sheehy of Dublin University, a well known agricultural expert, in which he says that the extent of the fall in income <Col N="2031" /> comes of the farming community is not yet fully realised and that, having regard to inflation running at over 20 per cent this year and probably at 15 per cent next year, farmers will be taking a cut in real incomes of up to 1 per cent per month which was more than they suffered in any period since the second world war.  Professor Sheehy also warned in his paper that the demonstrations of farmers would make the demonstrations of the sixties look like a Sunday afternoon walk.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the promises given to the farmers by Fianna Fáil in areas where they have full control. One of those areas is in land structure. Up to 1,000 small farmers are marching outside this gate today in protest against the land structure because the promise made by Fianna Fáil has not been fulfilled.  In my constituency and all over this country there are land speculators buying up agricultural land while these people have uneconomic holdings and are unable to make a decent living.  The former Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture gave a promise about land structure.  He promised legislation before the end of last year.  Now the present Minister has brought out a new White Paper to throw the whole thing back into the melting pot of discussion.  If that is not reneging on the promise I do not know what is and I challenge the Minister for Agriculture to deny that.  It is just an effort to get out of delivering on this promise.</P>
    <P>Another promise made in the manifesto was that we would process all our own food.  One of the biggest disgraces here is that we, in a country whose biggest asset is the three or four feet of soil on the surface of the earth, are importing nearly all our vegetables. We are importing potatoes from Cyprus, vegetables from Holland and other countries all over Europe.  I challenge the Minister for Agriculture to show us any area where we have increased the processing of our food.  The Minister for Agriculture should be ashamed to stand up and say he is responsible for that section. I could talk all night about Fianna <Col N="2032" /> Fáil's failure in the agricultural sector but I want to say a few words in other areas.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about prices.  Fianna Fáil gave specific promises that the rate of inflation this year would be 5 per cent. But housewives and others are staggering under the daily increase in prices in shops throughout the country.  During the last election campaign the then leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Lynch, came to my constituency and, on being asked by a certain lady what he thought of the price of an article she had picked up in a super-market which he visited, he said that if he were put in government he would do something about it.  He certainly did.  He took off part of the food subsidies almost immediately after going in and added 10p to the price of the article in question.  Fianna Fáil are over on that side of the House because they carried out a complete con job on the electorate.  Anybody who can think will agree that that kind of con business went on throughout the country.  They went out to our farming community and told them quietly at their doors: &ldquo;You will have to pay no income tax.  We will settle that one.  Fine Gael have let you down&rdquo;. That did not affect my party so much, but that is what people have been saying to the farmers in my constituency.  We know what happened and I do not need to waste time on that subject.</P>
    <P>To return to prices, everyone&mdash; whether they be housewives or anyone else&mdash;knows that the way prices have been increasing over the last three years under a Fianna Fáil Government borders on the ridiculous.  What amazes me is that unfortunate people paying mortgages on houses were told in this House by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs that one of the reasons why we were going into the EMS was to reduce interest rates, that we would then be able to get money at the same interest rate as Germany&mdash;8 or 9 per cent.  We know what happened. The interest rate went through the roof. That is how we can rely on the words of Ministers here in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> I turn to county council finances.  Fair play to Fianna Fáil, they did remove the rates from private houses, but it is common knowledge that one cannot take taxation away without replacing it by something else.  I am not saying that it was not right to take rates away&mdash;they were an unfair system of taxation&mdash;but they were taken away irresponsibly, without any effort to replace them. Anyone on a local authority, whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour knows the state of local authority finances.  The roads have fallen into deterioration, particularly in the country areas.  Any fairminded man on any county council, of whatever party, knows that the reason for that is lack of Government finance. There is no finance to be got from the Government practically anywhere.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of local authority areas, there have been no new housing starts in this year of 1980.  I am speaking of local authority housing.  The local authorities are still waiting for a Government allocation to build new houses.  In my local authority in Kildare, and in nearly every local authority, no money has been provided for new housing starts this year.  There is no money to maintain the houses that are built and repairs are not being done.  No materials are being purchased to repair these houses and safeguard our housing stock.</P>
    <P>Despite the promises in the manifesto that it would be maintained and improved we know what happened to the house improvements grant, how it was completely withdrawn.  That is how much we can rely on Fianna Fáil.  The people must know that very well.  With all the talk about tax improvements and tax concessions, disappointment is now raging about the new tax certificates, some of which have been arriving.  The workers are disappointed at what has happened there.</P>
    <P>Whether it is a deliberate action by the Government or not, unfortunate people who because of illness have to be on social welfare wait up to 12 weeks, on average, before they get any return from that Department, which appears to be <Col N="2034" /> dead and buried.  When people approach us we, as public representatives, cannot get through by telephone.  We are suspicious that the telephone has been taken off the hook.  We know that six to 12 weeks is the period that people must wait before they get their first payment from that Department.  Our telephone system has broken down as anyone who tries to use it will realise.</P>
    <P>These were the areas where Fianna Fáil were going to set us marching.  I remember what we had to listen to during the election campaign three years ago.  It is fair to say that three years is the average life of an Irish Government and whatever a Government is going to do they had better do it in this period. We are now in one of the greatest economic crises that this country has seen.  Factories and other places of employment are in a redundancy situation all over the country, and some in receivership.  This is because of the high rate of interest, even if these people can borrow money, because of the credit squeeze.  Industries are producing machinery for the agricultural sector and none is being sold because farmers have no money.  They cannot receive credit from banks and if they do receive it, the rate of interest is ridiculous.  We were promised when we joined the EMS that the first effect would be to reduce the rate of interest.  I am afraid that the ordinary person here does not seriously realise our dreadful economic mess at the moment.  They will realise it before long.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the area of employment. We were told, prior to the 1977 election, that there would be full employment in 1982.  Deputy O'Donoghue is now a redundant Minister himself.  He is one of these fellows who lost out in this whole economic mess.  Be that as it may, he repeated in this House that he would stand judged if we had not progressed to full employment by 1982.  We know that we are going the other way now, backwards.  All the experts say&mdash;and I do not hear anyone in the Government denying it&mdash;that by the end of the year we will have 100,000 unemployed, <Col N="2035" /> almost 10 per cent of our working population.  If that is what he meant by full employment.  I do not wonder that he is redundant.</P>
    <P>Anyone connected in any way with a health board or a health authority knows that the services being provided by these authorities are on the verge of collapse. There is no money to look after the poorest people in the most needy areas under the health boards.  We know that they are deliberately holding up the giving of those rights to people because of financial strain.  I can give an individual case where an old age pensioner's medical card came up for review.  It has still not been replaced after three months of wrangling with local health officers.  I was told privately that the reason for this is that the health boards have been ordered to work within a budget within which it is not possible to work.  That is the kind of service, and yet the Taoiseach says we are doing well.  We are doing well but the standard of living is reducing daily.  Yet we are asked not to look for wage increases.  The people being encouraged with tax concessions to export and the people being encouraged to set up industries here, which eventually go to the receiver and not a penny of that money goes into the economy, are not being asked to tighten their belts; only the industrial workers are being asked to reduce their standard of living, because this is the only way this country can survive.  It is about time the workers &ldquo;copped on&rdquo; to these sectional appeals where one section is being asked to tighten their belts and there is no reference to the huge profits of land speculators and so on.</P>
    <P>In a Bill here last week we were told that it would be totally unjust and unconstitutional to control the price of building land.  If that philosophy is brought to its final conclusion it would be wrong to control the price of anything.  Land speculators are buying and selling land with every change in relation to the designation of land, but nobody thinks of the unfortunate person who is trying to buy a house.  The price of a house during the reign of Fianna <Col N="2036" /> Fáil has more than doubled and this is mainly due to the increasing price of land.  Yet we are told that it would be wrong to control the price of land.  If that is a Government with a social conscience I would not like to be associated with that type of social conscience.  It would be right to control the price of land and keep it at its use value except where it is designated for housing where there could be a small increase for compensation. This would ensure that people will be able to provide the basic necessity of a house over their heads.</P>
    <P>The record of this Government does not stand up to scrutiny.  I find it hard to understand how the Taoiseach, with all the information available to him, can be so out of touch with reality as to say that we are doing well.  I invite the Taoiseach to try his hand in the country and he will get his answer.  Our people need employment and a decent standard of living and they ask only that goods and services be available to them at a reasonable cost. Fianna Fáil have reneged on what they promised in their manifesto.  The Tánaiste told us a few moments ago that the manifesto outlined the proper way to do things and that it faced up to a problem which was not faced up to by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The effect of the oil crisis has been completely exaggerated.  There have been cut-backs in relation to teachers, schools, hospitals and so on.  Today I received a letter from a parish priest who is chairman of a school board asking me to use my influence to persuade the Minister to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Education so that they could maintain schools. This priest indicated that they got an increase of 24 per cent this year but that teachers' incomes took up 23 per cent of that.  That only left 1 per cent to run the whole show with an inflation rate of over 20 per cent.  Fianna Fáil said that this was not a bad budget.  It is easy to bring in a good budget if one is not providing the services.  Fianna Fáil have not provided services in local authorities, health, social welfare, agriculture, the environment or anywhere else.  They are <Col N="2037" /> not giving the services that people enjoyed even last year.  The services have been cut back.  Every civil servant and every county manager involved in these services knows that that is true.</P>

      <P>I spent a lot of time in the House listening to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Deputy FitzGerald, the leader of Fine Gael and Deputy Cluskey, the leader of the Labour Party.  Having listened to their speeches and knowing there are people outside who are interested in this debate, I can only say that it bodes ill for democracy if one takes at their face value the contributions of Deputy <Col N="2038" /> FitzGerald and Deputy Cluskey.  Both of them indulged in personal abuse of the Taoiseach but neither of them put forward a single constructive idea which if adopted by the Government might lead to improvement in the people's standard of living.  I shall not, although I am tempted to do so, attempt to reply with equal vehemence and vituperation as that would be a waste of time.  These two Deputies became almost paranoid in their endeavours to discredit the Taoiseach.  I am not a psychiatrist but, as a politician, I can analyse their contributions and see the reasons behind them.  I am not a disciple of Freud but it is very interesting to find that both Deputies see in the Taoiseach a man more able than they are, who is far beyond them as a politician and a leader. They cannot match his approach to the country's problems and cannot match his performance in the House, and so they try to bring him down by abuse that is almost vulgar.</P>
      <P>This is a pity.  I have heard both of them do better on other occasions.  They should not let their frustration colour their outlook so much that we get from them not a contribution to the adjournment debate but merely a flow of words with a jaundiced look on them.  If they want to serve their own cause and serve the people they should discuss the problems of the country in a responsible way and drop the personal attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody denies that the world is going through a difficult time or that it is the duty of a Government to protect especially the weaker sections of the community at such a time.  The Government in its budget this year sought to distribute the national wealth on an equitable basis.  They got their priorities right and considered first the weaker section, the old age pensioners and blind pensioners, the widows, the orphans and others who must be given help by the State.  Increases in pensions were given on a scale never before seen in this country. There are difficulties at present but I am very confident in and very proud of the Government and the party of which I am a member because their first priority <Col N="2039" /> in the budget was the weaker section.  I am not complacent or thinking that the weaker sections got enough but they got some insulation against the suffering they would have endured in the present world situation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should raise their sights and get out of the rut they get into when they try to substitute vulgar abuse for the policy of a party.  I hope that perhaps somebody more eloquent than I am will be able to bring them to some sense of realism so that they will make contributions here of which they can be proud afterwards.  I do not think the contributions from the Opposition so far today will ever be a source of pride to them.</P>
    <P>We have a problem in industrial relations, as we have always had.  In the first quarter of the year things had improved very much.  I have been a member of a trade union, the second largest in the country, all my working life and since becoming a full-time politician I can see many problems from both sides.  I do not always blame the trade unions or the strikers.  I have even seen unofficial strikers justified.  I do not suggest employers are always perfect.  I know instances to the contrary where management caused strikes.  However, we must not think in a narrow, sectional way but remember that we are citizens of a young, free country striving to build up its economy so that all citizens can enjoy a fruitful life with a standard of living as high as possible.</P>
    <P>I suggest to anybody involved in industrial strikes that we must think on a broader basis and ensure that any action we take to improve our position will not be at the expanse of perhaps a lower paid worker.  Without naming any particular strike or conflict going on at present, I have one in mind where it would mean that the strikers by their action would make it harder for workers on a lower scale of pay.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulties of trade unions. I have seen the efforts of the Trade Union Congress trying valiantly to end some of the more damaging strikes.  I appeal to those involved in strikes to <Col N="2040" /> remember that nobody ever wins a strike.  When the men or women go back to their jobs they have lost so much that it takes a long time to make up for it. The strike nowadays, especially in present circumstances, is not what I believe it was when I was young.  There was a time when workers, especially in Dublin, had to fight the bosses, some of whom were very unjust.  As a disciple of Larkin I read of his efforts in the 1913 strike.  In later years I knew him and what he stood for.  I knew his burning concern and how he strove to uplift the workers. Today most strikes are in the public sector where there are no private capitalists. We have strikes going on in semi-State industries where the employers are the ordinary citizens and where all that is wrung from these bodies is wrung partly from taxation imposed on these citizens. Surely it behoves everybody employed in a semi-State concern to realise that they are not fighting private capitalists but fighting the ordinary people to obtain what they want.  I have seen in this city long queues of people waiting for social welfare payments because there was a postal strike.  Those people did not cause the strike, but they suffered.  As a trade unionist I appeal to my fellow trade unionists who are contemplating strike action or who are on strike to be guided for the sake of the people by the Congress of Trade Unions and to back the congress in their efforts to bring about a better atmosphere in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Government do not interfere in strikes because we have got the Labour Court, the Congress of Trade Unions, the trade union movement and employers' associations.  We in this very small society should be able to find the means to have proper negotiations.  In order to build up our economy we should look on the strike weapon as the very last thing that will be used, because too much suffering has been caused by strikes.  I know that those on strike suffer, but I believe that by improving their standards and by sticking to the negotiating table they can help to avoid strikes.  I believe the time has now come when the trade unions will have to insist on management being efficient.  I know <Col N="2041" /> there have been cases where management were not efficient and when the unions fought inefficient management we all paid for it.  The trade unions must tell management that they want efficient management.</P>
    <P>The Government have legislation for the election of worker directors in many of our State industries.  One of our most successful semi-State concerns have about four worker directors on each of their boards.  Those people are doing very well.  The workers in the concern are well paid.  It is a long time since they had a strike because the men from the shop floor are showing that they are as competent as the professional directors in perfecting a unit which can operate successfully in the commercial world. Several semi-State industries have worker directors on their boards.  Those worker directors, together with the professional directors, have been able to show what their combined brains can do.  Trade unionists should look at this and see that the strike weapon is becoming outmoded.  Workers can improve their conditions by going to the table with their employers and working out proper policies for the improvement of the firm concerned as well as for everybody else.  If this is not done more innocent people will suffer.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the Minister for Labour for his unremitting attention to industrial problems.  He has been involved all the time in trying to solve those problems.  I have been engaged in unofficial strikes.  When people say that we should ban unofficial strikes I believe they really mean that the strike weapon should never be abused.  It has been blatantly abused in recent years.  There is something wrong when workers have to take unofficial strike action.  The worker is justly responsible, or else the management have not been listening.  I have seen the whole structure of industry change considerably over the years.  Our society is changing as the State creates more and more semi-State industries.  There is no use now talking about bad capitalists, because a lot of them have disappeared. <Col N="2042" /> We have semi-State companies run by the people.  I hope that more and more semi-State bodies will have worker participation on the boards.</P>
    <P>This year, when we realise the problems the economy is facing, we should have the trade union movement play a full part in building up our economy so that, to quote the economists, we make a bigger national cake and so that there is more of it for each one of us.  If some of the strikes we have had recently are to be extended to other areas it means there will be more suffering for all concerned, our national image will be damaged and outside investors will not be so keen to come here. Whatever weight my words have I hope that they cause people to think and that the trade unions, instead of insisting on strikes, will ensure that management is efficient.  The trade unions are very often blamed for strikes.  This may be correct in some cases but I have also seen inefficient management being the cause of strikes.</P>
    <P>There are faults on both sides and we must eradicate them.  If we do not eradicate them, further suffering will be caused to people who can least bear it.  If we want to build a Christian society we must look to those lofty ideals.  One would like to have a magic wand to change things, but when we have not it must be unremitting toil.  The last speaker from the Labour Party benches said that when a Land Bill was introduced to control the price of land it got no support from this side of the House.  It did not get any support from the Fine Gael benches either.  I pay the Labour Party tribute for being sincere about the Bill.  They wanted to do something about the price of land.  I believe that, far from solving the price of land or the housing problem, the Bill would have caused greater problems.  It would have put more barriers in the way of providing a supply of developed land than anything else I know of.  That is why we rejected it.  I believe that some of the people responsible for the Bill realise that it was far from being a weapon to increase the purchase of land at proper prices and allow more houses to be built. <Col N="2043" /> Anybody interested in the housing problem knows that one of the biggest barriers to a speedy solution is the fact that there is not enough serviced land.  I do not believe the present system of land purchase is ideal.  I have no time whatever for the people who make vast profits from the sale of land.  They can often be immoral.</P>
    <P>I realise that the housing problem is a great one.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments down through the years have provided local authorities with moneys for the creation of land banks. Dublin Corporation, for instance, have built up a reserve of land.  This policy of land reserves has been very successful in terms of housing output which, though not as good as we would wish it to be, resulted in the housing in Dublin city alone of somewhere between 60,000 and 70,000 families during the past 30 or 40 years.  That is not a bad achievement for a city of our size.  While not wishing to minimise the problem of the numbers on the housing list, I would point out that the foresight of Fianna Fáil in relation to housing legislation has enabled us to reduce very considerably the housing problem.</P>
    <P>Again, as a result of the foresight of the Government we are now witnessing the rebuilding of the inner city.  Even the construction of one house in this area is a costly business but despite that consideration, I defend such development. This capital city of ours must be redeveloped.  There must be more inner city building in an effort to stop the sub-urban sprawl.  Economists tell us that it is bad economics to use arable land for building purposes and that we should be able to develop the inner city area so that people might live there with practically all the amenities they would enjoy in the suburbs.  Obviously, if a family, especially a family in the lower-paid bracket, move from the city centre to the suburbs, they suffer a loss in income by reason of having to pay additional bus fares to and from work.  The inner city authority have been given £1 million by the Government, not merely for the building of houses but for the provision <Col N="2044" /> of amenities.  The development that is taking place in the inner city area is an example of what I would regard as real social progress even if I am not satisfied with the rate of that progress.  I am of the opinion that we could step up the housing drive by various means but to do so would require effort on the part of all of us&mdash;Government, trade unions and employers.</P>
    <P>When we are discussing the national understanding we speak of the social partners.  In a country as small as ours we must all be social partners.  I do not believe that we have very many wealthy people but there are many people who are not enjoying the standard of living that they should be enjoying.  However, Fianna Fáil have always set the headlines and shown courage in taking unpopular decisions to impose taxation. We have always looked after the weaker sections first.  That is why the Government were so generous this year in the budget in so far as the weaker sections were concerned.  No other Government have ever given them increases of the same magnitude.  Next year we hope to be able to give even more.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the medical card system.  Perhaps there was wrangling in this regard in some cases but if that happened it was not due to any policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>There are many people who need further help, whether in the form of increased pensions, of better housing or something else but we can only effect these improvements if our economy is so geared as to create the wealth that is necessary.  Obviously, it is not possible to distribute wealth if we do not have wealth.  This takes me back to my old theme of trade unions and employers getting together and realising that such groups as old age pensioners, widows and those on blind pensions are people with very little muscle in terms of making a case for improvement.  Such people are not in a position to go on strike.  The responsibility for them rests with all of us.</P>
    <P>Regarding strikes generally, any man taking strike action should ask himself first what effect the strike will have on <Col N="2045" /> his fellow worker.  I believe in the free enterprise system but that system must be so organised and so governed as to ensure that the weaker sections are protected.  The Government are criticised for situations that are outside their control.  This happens particularly in relation to oil prices.  We must face up to the situation that since OPEC are the countries who have the oil, they are in the position of setting the prices for that commodity.  Recompense for increases in oil prices can be made only at the expense of the less well off who are not in a position to fight back.  Regardless of which political party any of us happens to support, we should regard our society as one unit but made up of very many groups, some of whom are very weak and to that extent we should endeavour to create as much wealth as possible in order to be able to help those most in need.</P>
    <P>The Government are setting a headline in terms of social concern.  They have indicated their policy in this regard. I am convinced that after we have given an account of our stewardship we will be returned to power at the next general election with a big majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sad occasion for all of us, regardless of whether we represent Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour because none of us likes to see our little country in a bad situation economically.  Unfortunately, our economy has never been worse than it is now.  It is interesting to note that each speaker here today has referred to inflation and to the cost of living.  During the past few years it has been very obvious that our country has been beset by evils of all kinds.  Does anybody, even in Fianna Fáil, deny that the cost of living has been spiralling, that inflation has been increasing by leaps and bounds, that the economy is deteriorating, that unemployment is increasing and has now reached almost 100,000, that the purchasing power of our £ has been reducing rapidly?  There is serious concern in industry.  Law and order has broken down completely and it is now <Col N="2046" /> not safe for any Irish citizen to walk abroad.</P>
      <P>In this situation the people of Ireland are crying out for leadership, for a Government they can respect and have confidence in.  Fianna Fáil have forfeited the mandate they received three years ago.  They have been too busy trying to grapple with their own political differences to do anything about the economy.  More than three years ago, when they were in Opposition, on any occasion when I stood outside the barrier in this House or sat in the Seanad I heard Fianna Fáil crying out about prices.  Then they introduced the famous manifesto.  I was delighted to see that manifesto because it contains a record of what they would have the people believe they would do for the country. On page 10 of the manifesto it is stated:</P>
      <P>Government policy must be directed towards discouraging increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control or influence.  This policy has been absent in the last four years.</P>
      <P>They were to exercise control over prices.  What did they do to the food subsidies? I am not surprised there are not any Fianna Fáil Deputies over there today. They would need to have neck to be there.  I am not casting a reflection on Deputy Connolly, the Minister of State. It is his job to be there.  In Opposition he was a great critic of our prices policy and I am sure he feels sick today listening to my comments on the prices explosion we have had since 1977.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil said they regarded price control as necessary, yet they have not done anything to combat the underlying causes of inflation.  During our time in Government, whenever we took up a newspaper we read of Fianna Fáil criticism of our prices policy.  We had Deputy Lynch in Opposition running to the Government accompanied by Deputy Mrs. Lemass.  They had been on a shopping spree and they told us the cost of the shopping basket.  Today they would not get what would fit in a pill box for the same price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> Fianna Fáil have not made any effort to control prices.  The value of increases in social welfare benefits has been eroded before it reaches the hands of beneficiaries.  The old and the poor are experiencing the most difficult period in history because never in the history of the State were the unfortunate underprivileged people so neglected by a Government.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to local government. In their manifesto Fianna Fáil promised to introduce a new scheme for house improvement grants.  The manifesto stated that Fianna Fáil recognised the importance of encouraging people to remain in rural Ireland and would provide adequate funds for effective local improvement and amenity schemes.  Last year, however, they abolished all grants for house improvements and none of us can take lightly what they have done to local improvement schemes.  People who are not in a position to buy new houses cannot get grants and parents of married couples who let them stay in their homes cannot get grants or loans for extensions.</P>
    <P>In Fine Gael and Labour we have been talking about the dreadful condition of our main and county roads.  In my county the roads have never been so bad and I have said the time must come when money will be found to improve the roads which are deteriorating rapidly.  I am a layman and I am giving a layman's opinion of our roads, but in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 5 May 1980 there is a quotation from a member of the County and City Engineers Association:</P>
    <P>The cost of maintaining, strengthening and developing our road network has increased by an average of 25 per cent over the past few years, but local authorities' revenue which goes towards road upkeep has been limited to an increase of between 10 and 11 per cent in 1980, for the third successive year.  This meant that the extent of the repair work has fallen steadily in the past few years and was now about one-third the already inadequate level of <Col N="2048" /> 1977, said the Association.  The engineers say that the signs of these neglected areas show in the increasing incidence of potholes, surface cracking and the deformation of the carriageway of major and minor roads. Each of these troubles stem from the inability of many of our roads to bear the weight of modern traffic and the severe winter of the past two years.</P>
    <P>That tells us the position and how serious it is.  People driving cars find themselves in great danger in rural Ireland.  They do not know what kind of manhole or pothole they will run into.  In a short time the Government will be placed in the position where they will have no choice but to find money for the roads.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about agriculture.  A lot has been said about it today and anything that is worth saying once is worth saying twice. Agriculture, a very important industry, is going through a very difficult period.  In 1976 there was what was known as an employment relief scheme which was £17.  It was of little good to any farmer and under the Coalition it was abolished.  I remember being in the Seanad at that time listening to some people who are now Ministers of State crying crocodile tears because that happened.  They said that farmers could not survive and that it would be a terrible handicap on the farming community.  How things change.  Now we have rates which, in my own county, have gone up by 300 per cent.  On top of that there is no credit available to farmers.  Anyone who tried to develop his farm and borrowed money from the bank is now in the position that he is not able to get the grant due to him.</P>
    <P>I have been approached on a number of occasions by farmers who really need their grant money.  I was in touch with Agriculture House.  Lately I made representations about three farmers and got three very nice acknowledgments back telling me that the grants had now gone for payment.  In my innocence I believed that the payments would be <Col N="2049" /> forthcoming in five or six days.  I informed the farmers that their money would be paid in a week.  Three weeks elapsed and I had communications from the unfortunate people who were frustrated because of a lack of money.  I again got in touch with the Department and a very nice, courteous civil servant came on the phone and informed me that I had misinterpreted the letter and said it only meant that the grant was approved for payment.  I asked what time would elapse between that and actual payment and was told it could take three months.  I asked why that happens and was told it was due to shortage of staff, a backlog and the fact that no overtime was allowed.  When we are talking about unemployment we must surely see that people are employed where work is available. It is a frightful situation where farmers must wait for £12,000 or £14,000 and all they have when they come to see one are letters and more letters from bank managers asking why they did not keep their promise and pay back their money.  These are decent people who never in their lives knew anything about being in debt or who had never broken their word to a bank manager.  Now they find themselves in a most embarrassing position where they cannot face up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about housing and I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Moore, speaking about it.  Housing is in a bad way.  In my county some schemes are not approved with the Department.  What really cripples people about to get married is that a loan of £12,000 is not enough because there is no hope of building a house for that sum.  There is no way they can get money and even if they could there are no bridging loans available.  As a result many people in the process of building have to stop because of lack of funds.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Energy and Deputy Moore speak with confidence as if they had never left Dublin, read a newspaper or had any branches down the country to tell them what was happening.  There <Col N="2050" /> were very few rural Deputies over there today.  It must be very depressing for them and it is no joy for me to speak like this.  As a constituency representative and worker close to the grass roots I find that I am redundant because there is no money in the kitty to meet what people are entitled to have, people who built houses and heard so much about the £1,000 grant.  We make representations and receive acknowledgment after acknowledgment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is a man to whom I have written.  I get a nice letter from him and I even get one from him when I do not write to him.  When I write to his Department I get a letter from him: &ldquo;Dear Deputy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dear Willie&rdquo;&ldquo;The matter is being investigated&rdquo;. That is no good to me.  I must tell the people that there is no money.  I am right to say that.  The Government said it in 1977 when there was no truth in it.  If I am not telling the truth now, the Minister of State will have an opportunity when replying to say so.  I will give him six names and if he can pay them in a fortnight I will stand up here and apologise.</P>
    <P>I have been to O'Connell Bridge House and it is in a shambles.  I went there on one occasion and could not get inside the door.  On another occasion when I telephoned the Department I was told that I had better ring the following Monday because they were moving house.  Where would one encounter such happenings in a Government Department?  That is outrageous and the Minister of State present is aware of the facts.  There is little use telling us that there were 40,000 applications.  Those qualified for grants should get them.  I do not see why public representatives should have to carry the can because of the inefficiency of the Government or the lack of money.  People are slow to believe that there is no money because they were told three years ago that there was plenty of money and the only trouble with our economy then was because we did not have good Government.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there is no money available.  The cost of the average <Col N="2051" /> house has gone to £25,000 compared with £12,500 in 1976 and £14,400 in 1977.  I can recall the National Coalition Government being criticised because the loan limit was £4,500 but at that time houses were costing £7,000.  Those anxious to purchase houses had to find £2,500 but bridging loans were available.  The situation is different now if one has to approach a bank manager. Last week I accompanied an unfortunate constituent to meet a bank manager but the bank manager became so frustrated when I called that I expected he would call for the gardaí at any moment.  He felt we should have been aware that money was not available.  He looked at me as if I had deceived my friend but I did not realise the situation was so bad.  I hate to say such unpleasant things but they must be made public.  This morning the Táòiseach spoke about moderation in wage demands and said that people were not approaching this matter in a responsible way.  The Taoiseach also told us we were not an island in isolation.  It is a pity that something similar to that was not stated in 1977 when we were being told that inflation was of our own making with a small amount of it being imported due to the price of oil.  The Tánaiste made reference to the situation that existed in 1976 and quoted what Deputy Richie Ryan, as Minister for Finance, said in that year.  He reminded us that Deputy Ryan had said our economy was like a cork floating on the ocean, but the cork is not floating now.</P>
    <P>Many nice things were said about the condition of the country, but we were never worse off.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach referred to Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Cluskey and said that they were jealous of the Taoiseach because they could not match him.  When one examines the economy one can see that there is no need to match the Taoiseach.  Deputy Moore was critical of our approach and I invite him to ignore us but to keep looking behind him.  That is the greatest danger.  The country is close to bankruptcy because we cannot pay our <Col N="2052" /> way.  Tourism was never worse; empty rooms.  The knock at the door is not that of a guest but of the VAT man.  How could tourists be encouraged to come here with the price of petrol?  We have priced ourselves out of existence. However, we are told that we are doing well.  If one was not living here one would get the impression, having listened to the Taoiseach today, that he was the greatest thing since the sliced pan, but those living in rural Ireland in particular are well aware of the position in relation to prices.</P>
    <P>When in power we heard a lot about strikes.  Deputy Fitzgerald, now Minister, for Labour, had a lot to say then.  When strikes occurred he jumped up, beat the benches and asked what the Minister for Labour and the Labour Party were doing. Now we have become accustomed to strikes.  We have had so many of them that we are not inclined to realise the effect they are having on our economy. We have often heard statements about law and order.  However, law and order has gone.  At one time violence only occurred in cities but now it has extended throughout the country.  One is not safe walking in a street in any big town.  The gardaí are afraid to tackle the people involved. The gangsters have taken over. We were criticised and asked what we were doing about violence, but those who took over the country to solve such problems have run away from them.</P>
    <P>The situation was never worse.  Unemployment, something we heard a lot about when in Government, is close to the 100,000 mark.  It is nothing new to me that so many people are out of work under a Fianna Fáil Government.  Between 1971 and 1972 the number of people unemployed was roughly 17,000. That occurred at a time when we did not have to cope with any international crises or economic recession.  That unemployment occurred at a time when the country was going well.  Of course, Fianna Fáil never solved unemployment problems; it was the emigrant ship that solved it for them.  The Government should tell us that they realise that the economy was never worse.  At the first opportunity they should move, because <Col N="2053" /> the country will get worse.  The Government should go to the country and, if they get the mandate they abused in 1977, they are entitled to return, but at present they are on borrowed time.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Brien for his colourful contribution.  The part I heard was more remarkable for its colour than its accuracy, and in the circumstances I shall start with a point I intended to finish on, to refer to the export situation so far this year.  It is a pity that Deputy O'Brien will be deprived of the opportunity of hearing the figures because of his departure from the Chamber but he would find them interesting. I read in a newspaper the other day that the May figures had been announced and that there was a big drop in exports resulting in a serious situation.</P>
      <P>The CTT target for exports for this country for this year is £4.2 billion.  If that were to be achieved on target the figure for the end of May should have been £1.579 billion and in fact the figure for our exports at that time was £1.625 billion, the target having been exceeded in times of considerable difficulty which could not have been foreseen in many cases at the end of last year so far by £46 million, and appearing likely to remain at that very healthy level.  This is one of the best criteria by which the basic health of the economy can be judged even at a time of considerable difficulty like this.  Those who shout in the way they do, do a considerable disservice although in many cases I suppose they have to because it is part of their job and I am not blaming people like Deputy O'Brien.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with some aspects of industry and the problems which they face at present. Notwithstanding the problems, it is interesting to see that they can achieve such growth in output, in employment, in exports, and in manufacturing investment in all of which the increases this year are likely again to be among the best in Europe, if not the best, as they have been in most of these areas for the past two years.</P>
      <P>At present there is increasing evidence that the growth of Irish manufacturing industry has slowed down and that many firms are beginning a period of arrested growth or lesser growth than they have been used to over the last number of years and in some cases there is actual retrenchment.  Seasonally adjusted unemployment has increased by a few thousand over the past two months but the increase in unemployment should be viewed in the context of an increase in population and an increased labour force and we find that the percentage in fact is apparently continuing to drop.  A number of factors are contributing to this situation.  The international trading climate is exceptionally poor.  The United States economy is currently in recession. Unemployment in the United Kingdom is now at a post-war peak of over 1.5 million and negative growth is expected in the United Kingdom this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic outlook for the EEC as a whole was described, following a recent meeting of the European Council, as extremely difficult.  At the same time there is evidence pointing to a significant loss of competitiveness of Irish manufacturing industry.  Costs, especially wage costs, are increasing at a faster rate than in other EEC countries.  A further contributing factor in many cases is the impact of expensive domestic credit.  Since 1977 there has been a general upward movement in interest rates in Europe and the United States.  During the last six months the rise has been particularly rapid and rates have reached historically high levels in many countries.  These rates appear to be quite firm at present with one exception; in the United States <Col N="2055" /> there has been, during the last two months, a very sharp fall in the key prime rate reflecting a sharply reduced demand for loans there as the US economy moves deeper into recession. This fall, however, has not been manifested yet in other countries.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland interest rates have reached their highest level since the push for industrial investment began.  These high rates reflect economic forces both within the domestic economy and external to it.  International trends play a very significant role in determining interest rates here.  In an economy with a high volume of external financial transactions it is difficult to create a significant differential between interest rates here and those abroad without inducing some external capital flows.  Domestically the supply of credit to the private sector can be regulated by the Central Bank but the Central Bank cannot similarly regulate the demand for credit.  It must call upon interest rates, the price of credit, to balance these forces.  If the bank were to do otherwise there would be downward pressure on our external reserves and the integrity of our currency would be in danger.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the adverse impact of high interest rates on industrial output and employment. A number of mechanisms already exist to protect companies against these high rates including grant-aided leasing, section 84 lending and the Industrial Credit Company EIB facility for small industry.  For some time now, however, the Government have also been urging industry to borrow at least part of their loan requirements abroad in order to offset the high cost of domestic borrowing.  In Germany, for example, the cost of funds for a 12 month deutchmark loan is approximately 8.5 per cent.  When all commissions and lending margins are included the total net cost to an Irish company should be about 13 per cent while our membership of the European Monetary System ensures that the exchange risk inherent in such a loan is lessened.  The Central Bank to date has enhanced the attractiveness <Col N="2056" /> of such borrowing by considering it to be outside its credit guidelines. The total amount of such foreign borrowing during the guideline year to February 1980 was £129 million, most of which went to the manufacturing sector. During the last four months the volume has increased more rapidly. Most of this borrowing has been done by larger export oriented companies used to trading overseas.</P>
    <P>In the case of small and medium sized companies and largely domestic market oriented companies some of the mechanisms I have mentioned are not applicable and it is more difficult for such firms to gain access to foreign borrowing. Also these firms tend to be reluctant to borrow abroad since, understandably, there has been little tradition of this kind of borrowing in the past and consequently a lack of expertise and skill in operating in foreign exchange markets.  Given the magnitude of the differential in interest rates between Ireland and some other EMS countries and the present problems of the smaller and medium sized Irish companies, the Government feel there is a need for an additional mechanism to provide these companies with access to funds, particularly for working capital, at rates comparable with those enjoyed by competitors abroad.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the Government have devised a new scheme to achieve this aim.  It is intended that the Industrial Credit Company will borrow £50 million in deutchmarks for lending to Irish industry at an interest rate of approximately 13 to 13½ per cent.  Several features of the scheme will be different from the existing ICC EIB facility for small industry fixed asset requirements. The maximum loans available will be £250,000 or 50 per cent of the applicant's working capital requirements, whichever is the lower.  Some details of the scheme remain to be finalised and I expect that the Minister for Finance and the Industrial Credit Company will be in a position to announce full details within a few days.</P>
    <P>Among the many benefits both tangible and intangible that I expect the new <Col N="2057" /> scheme will have are the fact that first it will reduce the competitive disadvantage under which Irish domestic firms are operating <i>vis-á-vis</i> their EMS competitors. Second, it will give an incentive to Irish firms to increase investment or to maintain existing levels of output and employment at a time of difficult market conditions due to falling demand and high inflation.  Third, it should have a significant psychological effect on industry by translating theoretical benefits of EMS membership into reality.  Fourth, I expect that it will create close contact between Irish industry and European commerce and thereby encourage firms in understanding and assessing the risks involved in foreign currency borrowing.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the considerable assistance towards job maintenance and job creation which this scheme will afford, we have also to remain competitive on costs in order to secure orders and to maintain jobs.  Basically this means that our wage increases this year must be in line with those in other EEC countries.  In the final analysis the forces of international competition will determine whether Irish products are competitive on costs.  If they are not then a decline in employment will inevitably follow.</P>
    <P>Such a decline would have disastrous consequences both social and economic for this country.  Let no one be in any doubt about this, given the rapidly growing numbers of young people in our total population.  For the European Community as a whole the numbers of young people coming onto the labour market will decrease slowly in the mid-eighties while our numbers will continue to increase. At present Ireland is the only country in western Europe where more than half of the population is under the age of 25.</P>
    <P>These young people are conscious of being better educated than their forebearers and they are aware of the opportunities that should be open to them in this country.  They are the first generation of Irishmen and women not to be dominated by the national question. <Col N="2058" /> They take Irish independence for granted and see a wider role for themselves and for Ireland in Europe. Membership of the EEC and of the European Monetary System and the break with sterling are seen as a sign that the country can stand on its own feet with the rest of them.  It is clear that, for us, solving the unemployment problem, as it is called, cannot be viewed as a once and for all challenge that must be met within the next five to ten years. We face an exceptionally rapid rate of increase in the working age population, not just for years but, indeed, for decades ahead.  These people must be provided with an opportunity to make their contribution to building a better future for this country.</P>
    <P>This year, between 50,000 and 60,000 young people will leave our educational system.  If we fail to provide jobs for a high proportion of them, the consequences will be serious for all of us.  In the past, emigration has provided a safety valve for this kind of situation, particularly for the less well qualified sections of our labour force.  We can no longer fall back on this solution, as other countries are not in a position to provide job opportnities on a large scale for our surplus labour.  Besides, this solution is an admission of defeat and the country is all the poorer for the loss of its greatest resource.  The alternative to emigration, if we cannot provide jobs, is an unacceptably high unemployment rate, an increasing tax burden on those already employed, a demoralised younger generation and substantially increased social unrest.</P>
    <P>I believe that the key issue now facing our society is how this rapid and sustained growth of the potential labour force can be absorbed into employment. Simple logic tells us that this can only come about if the rate of growth of output is maintained at a very high level, while simultaneously the link between the growth of output and employment is strengthened.  This means that we must create viable productive jobs at a rate and on a scale never achieved here before, if we are to create the conditions <Col N="2059" /> in which we can attain full employment, at the same time as maintaining a rising standard of living.  The essence of our problem at the moment is that we are not creating enough wealth to do either.</P>
    <P>Growth in our wealth depends on our ability, through our manpower and our other resources, to turn raw materials into goods and services that are demanded at home and overseas.  The value added through this process is the source of the wages which pay for the needs of the work force and their families and of the taxes that fund Government programmes and thus determine the community's standard of living.  It also provides the surpluses or profits for private and public enterprise to maintain the capital stock and to finance the further growth of value added in future.</P>
    <P>In a small and open economy such as ours, this value adding process has, for the most part, to be carried out in direct competition with foreign producers.  This means that we cannot tolerate the creation of non-productive jobs, simply for the sake of creating employment.  Artificially created jobs by the State means simply that we, as a nation, become less productive and less competitive.  These nominal jobs must be paid for either by increased taxation or by an increase in State borrowing.  We must reject the illusion that the State, in some sense, can create new short-term jobs at the stroke of a pen.  These so-called jobs cost money.  They have to be paid for by the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental law of economics that in the long run it is impossible, without disastrous consequences, to take more out of the economy in wages, taxes and profits than is put into it by the production of goods and services.  This basic value added principle needs to be more widely communicated and understood by each individual in our community and we must give as high a priority to the creation of value added as we do to its distribution.  It takes actual productive projects to create long-term self-sustaining jobs and growth.  This means that we must go out and identify <Col N="2060" /> new markets, develop new products and produce them competitively.  In an increasingly tough international climate, opportunities are not necessarily going to be easy to come by.  Achieving jobs and output targets of the scale needed will not be a matter of a few grandiose gestures.  It will require a sustained effort with small projects as well as large, and a wide range of industries where Ireland is able to establish and maintain a competitive edge.</P>
    <P>The key requirement is enterprise.  Enterprise of all kinds will have an important contribution to make.  Foreign enterprise will continue to be a vital source of new investment and jobs.  Public enterprise, either alone or with the private sector, has a contribution to make. However, domestic private enterprise will have to take the leading role, through both the expansion of existing business and the creation of new business.  In this context, the role of government is to create the conditions in which enterprise, both public and private, can flourish.  So far as public enterprise is concerned, it is sometimes suggested to us that it is the solution to many of the problems which I spoke about and that in some cases it is almost exclusively the solution.</P>
    <P>I have said before, but I think it is worth repeating, that we have had some unhappy experiences in manufacturing industry in the public sector in recent years, experiences which dilute one's enthusiasm for that as a major avenue along which we could achieve our goals. While some of these public, semi-State companies have not been successful, others have.  One should acknowledge that fact.  In very contemporary terms, one of these companies whose success should be acknowledged in this respect is Aer Lingus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One looks at its position today, which is an unhappy one. The opportunities, for example, in ancilliary activities in Aer Lingus are enormous&mdash;not the least of which is servicing for many other air lines.  One could <Col N="2061" /> have fore seen a situation where perhaps another 1,000 jobs could have been created on that side alone.  I wonder what the position is today and whether any public corporation would be prepared prudently to undertake the kind of risks which now appear to be involved in areas such as that.</P>
      <P>I would like to come back, however, to the question of how the Government can seek to create conditions in which enterprise of all kinds, particularly private enterprise&mdash;which I see as the main thrust of our economic progress here, both in the past and in the future&mdash;can be helped to flourish in the ways in which Government can give assistance.  In setting out the Government's actions to accelerate and facilitate job creation in the manufacturing sector, the picture certainly would not be complete without a re-statement by me of the benefits to industry of the new 10 per cent corporation tax rate which will apply for 20 years from 1 January 1981.  As the House knows, the Bill was passed in the Seanad yesterday and becomes law today or tomorrow. The primary objective of the 10 per cent corporation tax scheme is to accelerate the pace and rate of investment by Irish and overseas promoters of manufacturing projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only through continuing investment in modernisation that industry can provide the jobs we need.  As the new scheme will apply to home as well as export sales it is a positive inducement to firms whose business is largely based on the home market to proceed with their investment plans which will in the longer term reap their own rewards.  There is the added advantage that accelerated capital allowances will continue to be available under the new scheme.  The continuation of these incentives means that the pay back period of capital investments generally by industry will be substantially reduced and the risks associated with such investments greatly minimised.  Because the new scheme will improve the return on owners' funds, it enhances the capacity of companies to <Col N="2062" /> grow both in size and in asset value. This scheme is designed to encourage the retention of profits, not their distribution. In turn, the economy will benefit from increased investment, improved efficiency and productivity and higher job creation.  There is a pressing need for many firms in the labour intensive and more traditional sector to modernise and adapt.  The new tax incentive will assist these firms to get on with the job of replacing outmoded plant and machinery so that their continued survival and future growth may be assured.</P>
    <P>The longer term advantages of the new scheme for manufacturing companies selling on the home market are also very substantial.  These will include significant increases in after tax earnings, an improved cash flow and liquidity position and the consequent strengthening of their financial base which will enable them, by means of their own resources and by borrowings, to extend and grow at a much faster rate without additional financial exposure.  The new tax scheme is also designed to provide a positive stimulant to new domestic investment aimed at import substitution on the home market.  As the incentive will not differentiate as between home and export sales it will have the effect of promoting greater linkage between what had been until now wholly export orientated enterprise and the existing domestic manufacturers.</P>
    <P>These developments will in turn lead to the creation of a more balanced and integrated industrial structure.  The 10 per cent incentive will also act as an effective spur to domestic companies to expand and diversify their export business.  The new scheme will also prove to be a very attractive incentive to foreign investors as we will have one of the lowest rates of tax on manufacturing profits in the industrial world.  This together with the other inducements in our industrial promotion package will ensure that Ireland continues to be a prime location for overseas investment.</P>
    <P>There was a net gain of nearly 9,000 jobs in manufacturing industry for 1979. The significance of this tremendous advance <Col N="2063" /> can best be judged not alone by the fact that it was the most favourable outcome for ten years but also against the outturn in other EEC countries, where there was a decline of 1 per cent overall in manufacturing employment.  It is also very heartening that this was achieved despite a deterioration in the domestic and international environment. In 1979 the manufacturing sector had to cope with the industrial disruption in our postal, tele communications, electricity and banking services.  In addition there was a worldwide slow down in economic growth, which was largely brought about by the massive rise in oil prices and the curtailment of supplies.  The growth in labour costs this year will be a crucial factor in determining the rate of future industrial growth and job creation. It is in our vital interests to ensure that unrealistic pay increases do not add to the other serious difficulties facing industry by making our unit labour costs substantially out of line with our overseas competitors.</P>
    <P>Even against a somewhat gloomy background the IDA are confident that they can achieve 30,000 job approvals in 1980.  Job approvals for the first five months of 1980 totalled almost 14,000, which is the best achievement to date in this field.  More importantly, there could be a rise and there is likely to be a rise, in spite of all the difficulties, of about 4,500 people in the overall numbers employed in manufacturing industry this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to a net gain in employment, manufacturing investment is expected to continue to grow by about 12 per cent.  This is in strong contrast to the disinvestment or static investment which characterises most of the developed world.  Manufacturing output is projected to expand by up to 5 per cent, a performance which, if achieved, will place us near the top of the league of industrialised countries in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person connected with business here, whether as an owner, a manager, a <Col N="2064" /> worker or a trade unionist, must be aware that we are at the centre of a period of great difficulty.  The world's oil dependent economies have been hammered by enormous increases in the price of oil and the major markets of the world are in a slump.  The money markets are unstable and exchange rates and interest rates are volatile and unpredictable. Ahead we have the prospect of further increases of energy costs.  For our open and energy importing economy many of these world uncertainties and problems are inescapable in their impact and in their implications.  They present great challenges that can be overcome by virtue of sensible approaches by all the social partners involved in the success of our industries.  It is certain that we also have within ourselves a capacity to destroy our own efforts.</P>
    <P>I would need another half an hour to sing that theme, so I will leave it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that I was in the House to hear the Minister speak, as I find myself in agreement with much of his analysis.  I could not help thinking, listening to his state of the nation speech, albeit in the field for which he has explicit responsibility, that, using the terminology of British political commentators in relation to their Conservative Party, the Minister must undoubtedly at this stage qualify for the title of leader of the &ldquo;wets&rdquo; in the Irish Cabinet, if one accepts that division within the British Tory Cabinet over monetarists and Kings Inns economists or politicians.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that we are confronted with the political reality of a generation of Irish people who for the first time are not dominated by the national question.  This is totally at variance with the leader of the Minister's party, who wishes to dominate this generation yet again with the national question.  The Labour Party fully agree with the Minister's analysis that solving the unemployment problem is the key issue facing us, that linking the <Col N="2065" /> growth of output and the cost of GNP with the rate of absorption on unemployment is the key issue.  It is extraordinary that the Minister, having so accurately analysed the situation, should state that he is placing his faith in domestic private enterprise taking the leading role, believing that somehow or other an economy in which private enterprise takes the leading role will achieve full employment.</P>
      <P>It is in the nature of capitalism that no capitalist country has solved the problem of unemployment.  Capitalism never set out to solve that problem.  Capitalism has done many other things.  As an economic system it has created untold wealth; it has produced new technology and so on.  Indeed, there is no more fulsome praise for capitalism than that contained in the comments of Karl Marx.  If we are looking to capitalism or to domestic private enterprise to give it the green version, to solve unemployment, we will look in vain.  It has not done so in the past and is not geared to do so in the future.  Yet the Minister, a man of considerable ability demanding the respect of many in the House, insisting that domestic private enterprise must take the leading role is to continue with an illogical position or a position that refuses to look at all the facts if solving unemployment is the key issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a role for the private sector but also for the public sector in the industrial area; and to that area the Minister says that because of some unhappy experience with individual State companies he is not convinced of the correctness of that position. If we were to apply here the logic of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the criteria which he chooses to apply to the public sector in the private sector we would have lost faith in it years ago, because at this very moment the liquidators are overworked with companies going bankrupt and failing in the open, private enterprise system.  The classical theory that first year economic students in our universities are taught is that this does not cost the Exchequer any money because these <Col N="2066" /> are individuals taking risks with their own money.  But post-1929 that is no longer true because they are using AnCo training grants and IDA advance factories and God knows what else to achieve the private enterprise growth to which he referred.</P>
    <P>A small, open economy like ours cannot aspire to managing capitalism and the crisis within capitalism internationally and pretend that outside forces do not exist.  We can, in so far as we are capable, attempt to control our market and economy, but this Government have consistently refused to try to do so.  We have had three years&mdash;it is virtually three years, just short of 5 July&mdash;of this administration and its responsibility extends back to 16 June and 5 July when it was voted into office in this House.  Let us not try to pretend, as Senator Mary Harney tried to do on radio, that there was a change of Government in 1979.  There was a palace revolution but not a change of Government. This administration have had three years in office.  The manifesto, which must now take its place beside <i>Hansel and Gretel, The Famous Five</i> and other such children's stories, makes incredible reading.  I shall not embarass the Minister of State by quoting from it.  It had one virtue and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development expanded and developed that virtue.  It attempted to develop a planning cycle, attempted with a certain naivete but with undoubted sincerity, certainly on the part of that Minister and the leader of the &ldquo;Wets&rdquo; and the other members of the Cabinet, to get some organisation of the planning cycle and the planning process in our mixed economy.  Since the palace revolution that has been abandoned and there is not even the pretext now of economic or indicative planning that there was prior to 1979.  Indeed the last document that came from the previous regime was uncremoniously discarded when it was published last January.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism speaks about the performance&mdash;the undoubted performance in many areas&mdash;of the manufacturing sector and makes no reference to any other <Col N="2067" /> area of the economy.  He talked about no other economic plan and yet puts all the responsibility&mdash;he ended his speech on this&mdash;on working people to show restraint and bear the brunt of this problem without anything being offered to working people in return.  The only area of our economy that needs to be planned or controlled is that of the wages of ordinary workers.  There is no suggestion of controlling profits or the allocation of credit or finance.  The Government have consistently refused to take on that control.  There is no suggestion that cost elements might be controlled.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in a written reply to Deputy Barry Desmond, indicated horrendous figures for the cost of acquisition of land for industrial development in County Dublin in the last two years, figures that ran to £4 million or £6 million, speculative costs that disappered into the pockets of private individuals who will not be subject to wealth tax or perhaps to any capital gains tax.  This House has refused to accept an effort to deal with that component of cost by introducing a fairly reasonable and well worked out measure, if I may say so, that would control the cost of all development land, not just residential or housing land.</P>
    <P>There is need, if we seek seriously to make this institution relevant to the hundreds of thousands of young people outside the barriers of either Kildare Street or Merrion Street&mdash;and it is not easy within the framework of a democratic, open system&mdash;to make what is happening here and what happens at the polling booths every four or five years meaningful.  To make it work there is need to begin seriously to plan the economy both economically and socially.  There was an attempt to do so but it is now abandoned and with its abandonment there is absolutely no proposals from the present Government. The bunkum mentality demonstrated in the last three or four days would be farcical if it were not so damaging to the real prospects of people outside the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2068" /> So far as the Labour Party are concerned there is need for the Government in recognition of their inability to control capitalism either internationally or domestically to realise that in trying to make a mixed economy work they must move much further to the Left than it has previously wanted to move.  I believe that a step would be made if the Government took the following measures. Within the Cabinet there are individuals who have the administrative experience and skill to implement these measures. There must be more control of banks and major financial institutions.  Our entry into the EMS and the separation of Irish currency from British sterling makes that proposal very simple and feasible.  The Government have yet to act on it, but they have made a start.  They must go much further down the road in relation to credit guidelines and access to credit.  There are still numerous loopholes through the 18 per cent ceiling and the 13 per cent ceiling of which the Government and the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism are aware.  If we do not control our own resources in terms of credit we cannot begin to create the new wealth to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>The second area in which the Government must move is in establishing clear, planning guidelines for the private sector. There should be planning agreements for certain sections of the private sector either by category of products or by sub-sector or by particular industries. Food processing is an obvious example. In my own constituency we witnessed a crisis in relation to food processing.  On one hand we are exporting cattle on the hoof because of marginally better prices in different parts of the European market and, on the other hand, meat factory workers are threatened with redundancy. I do not believe the private sector would be averse to such planning agreements. They are getting enough money in grants and support from the State.  The only private thing now about the private sector is profit and control of profit and little else.  With the kind of funding now going into the private sector, which is a net <Col N="2069" /> beneficiary of capital and current account, receipts from the Exchequer, the least we should be able to get back from that sector is planning agreements.  Some of the grants should be conditional on those agreements.  They must be parallel to any planning agreement.</P>
    <P>My third point is that there should be a form of industrial democracy conditional on the private sector not getting the tax-payers' money.  Why should the community at large accede to the requests of the board of directors of private concerns for a grant for this, an improvement of that road or guarantees of foreign borrowing if the private sector are not prepared to share responsibility for the allocation of those funds with their own work force?  Many workers throughout the country do not have access to the books of the company in which they work.  There is no right to know and no public information legislation that would enable employees to see what the position is.  Is it any wonder that with inflation rates as they are, that they seek within the laws of the jungle that capitalism has conditioned them to be brought up in, to maximise their position irrespective of the implications or the impact on others?  The Government have been dramatically conservative in their failure to continue the initiative taken by the former Minister for Labour&mdash;it was a beginning of a process &mdash;in relation to worker participation in the State sector.</P>
    <P>My fourth point is developing the public sector.  I am not talking here about another agency to foster the Irish language or about another agency in the non-productive area or some such addendum to the civil service.  I am talking about the creation of industrial employment in the public sector.  Aer Lingus is the model I have in mind.  Executives and management in the public sector have demonstrated quite clearly that they have the motivation, the capability, the expertise and the skill to achieve the sort of growth and development in job security which only the State sector can provide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2070" /> The Minister in his address was quite interesting about public sector employment and was very sceptical about artificially created jobs.  The House has been treated with contempt in relation to artificially created jobs to the extent that five new Ministers of State were created. I say that in the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Labour.  If ever there were artificially created jobs which undoubtedly are non-productive they are those.  The biggest problem they had for the first week was trying to find out what the new Ministers of State would do never mind talking about whether they could do the work.  One of the things the new Ministers of State have done is to take the flak from their Ministers, which might be considered fairly productive.  The clean hands of the Minister of State in the House in relation to the industrial mess makes it a little bit more difficult to have a go at him than the silent Minister for Labour who has virtually disappeared out of the House, to say nothing of the Minister for the Environment. Those people are now shadows on the screen rather than people who should carry the can for something for which they have Cabinet responsibility.</P>
    <P>My last point is that we have got to do something about creating an equitable taxation base.  The old refuge in a commission, whose first task is not to report too soon and certainly not before the next election, will not satisfy the hundreds of thousands of workers who marched in unprecedented fashion in every major city and town in the country.</P>
    <P>My five points, which are the basis of an economic plan, are control of finance houses, steering and directing of finance funds into the productive area, planning guidelines for the private sector, a substantial development of industrial jobs in the public sector by the establishment of a national development corporation, the introduction of industrial democracy in both the private and public sectors to give workers the right to know and the right to have a say in how the profits which they have helped to create can be reinvested, an equitable taxation system <Col N="2071" /> for everybody irrespective of what they do and a new deal between urban and rural workers in relation to food processing here so that the work of small farmers in isolated areas can have added value put to it in the towns and cities throughout the country and retain the benefit of rural produce for urban workers and, consequently, for rural workers.  There is absolutely no evidence that any of this has even been contemplated by the Government despite some of the noises made in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>
    <P>Economic planning on its own is not enough.  The late Seán Lemass responded to the pressure of the Labour Party in the 1965 general election by changing the name of the then Economic Institute into the Economic and Social Institute for Research, the ESRI as it is now called.  As far as I remember the Third Programme for Economic Expansion was titled the Programme for Economic and Social Expansion.  <i>The Irish Times</i> complimented the late Seán Lemass for talking about the need to move to the left.  The only thing he ever did was to recognise the need but he did not move very far.  That recognition was there in a way that is regrettably absent from this particular Fianna Fáil Government.  An economic plan is feasible and is not in itself a panacea.  The last 20 years have seen no country possessing a panacea for the ills that confront the globe but we can do better than what we are doing at the moment and we can learn from the lessons of the past.</P>
    <P>We have a new and totally transformed population.  There has got to be social planning to cater for the reality of that new phenomenon.  There are two areas which require particular and immediate attention as this Dáil gets up at the end of its third year and will obviously not come back until late October or, if the evidence of not coming back until last February is to be taken as setting an example, we might not even come back before Christmas.  That might suit some of the lawyers in the House or me but it will not suit the people we represent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> I believe there are two major areas which this democratic assembly must respond to if it is to be taken seriously by the new population which daily walks past the security barriers on Kildare Street and Merrion Street and wonders what kind of 19th century nonsense frequently goes on here.  I believe it is absolutely essential, in order to get any kind of physical and urban social planning into the country, to grasp the nettle of control of development land, land on the periphery of our towns and cities and inner city land which is up for redevelopment out of the open market system and bring to it the same measure of control in our mixed economy which we have successfully done with education and medicine.  Nobody in this House seriously suggests that people should have access to medicine purely on the size of their cheque books.  Nobody in the House seriously suggests that people should have access to education or to health purely on the size of their cheque books.</P>
    <P>The struggle to get that consensus view and opinion was not waged by the Conservatives or by the green Tories.  It was notched up as a victory for the trade union and labour movement throughout the entire world but particularly in Europe.  The same struggle and principle apply now to the question of monitoring the price of development land which must be taken out of the open developer-speculator market.  This can be done without the confiscation of property or without the denial of property rights for the individual.  All that would be involved would be to deny the speculators profits and property rights.  Who in this House will stand up and say seriously that he represents that interest?  Is there anybody in Fianna Fáil or in Fine Gael for that matter who wishes to say that he represents that interest and that, consequently, he is prepared to vote against the Bill?  Anyone who might be prepared to defend that interest must be prepared also to go before the public at the next election in the knowledge of having defended the speculator interest.  If we do not take land into ownership in a way that will allow it to be retained for the <Col N="2073" /> community the added value which the community itself creates, we are putting an enormous price on the reconstruction in the inner city area and on the new construction in the peripheral areas of urban Ireland.  And it is into urban Ireland that the new population will settle. We have enormous problems ranging from drug abuse to the lack of social and educational facilities which in many ways are caused by the complacent nature of our urban environment.  As I have said on numerous occasions in the past, we are building into the bricks and mortar of rural Ireland a social injustice which will be very difficult to eradicate unless we take action now.</P>
    <P>What is curious about the measure in question is that it is the one area over which the Arabs do not have control, the one area in which we are absolutely sovereign.  We alone can control that process.  There are not international pressures of any kind that are determining what we do in that area yet we seem to be reluctant to take the action that is necessary.</P>
    <P>Another issue that is very real and pressing is the question of divorce, of martial breakdown or of family relations, depending on which way one wants to phrase the matter.  For a variety of reasons, associated largely with the changing nature of Irish society&mdash;we are the ones who are changing: there is not any alien philosophy being imposed on us but we are changing the way in which we live, the way in which we work and we are open to new ideas&mdash;there has been brought about a change in the relative position of man to woman and of parents to children with the consequence that marriages which in the past had broken down irretrievably and which were suffered in silence or in anguish by both the parents and the children because of there not being any alternative either socially or legally but for that situation to continue will not be tolerated any longer by either the young or the not so young.</P>
    <P>On the issue of divorce, the decision as to whether the relevant Article of the <Col N="2074" /> Constitution should be changed will be taken by the sovereign people outside this House, but surely we have the courage to put that question to them. Surely even those people who are convinced that, in either social or in moral terms or in both divorce is the wrong choice, are sufficiently democratic to be prepared to allow the question to be put before the people by way of referendum, or do they not trust the Irish people? This Dáil should at least accept the reality of broken marriages and of the anguish and of the suffering that such situations cause.  In terms of the social planning that I outlined earlier should we not at least set the objective that before we go to the ballot box again we will give the people of this State the opportunity individually of making the choice as to whether we should respond to what I perceive as being a change in society?</P>
    <P>It would be easy for me to criticise the Government for failing to deliver on various promises, but generally I try not so succumb to that sort of temptation. There are alternatives to the way in which we organise our society.  There are ways of organising society that are different from the traditional ways, and there are solutions that we can design if we have the courage to face up to the problems as they are analysed.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to have been in the House when the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism was speaking, because I considered much of what he had to say to have been both relevant and pertinent.  I agree that the primary task facing the country is the creation of work to meet both existing and future needs, but we begin to disagree to the extent that I do not believe any longer that traditional private capitalism has the capacity or the will in the context of our Irish open economy to create sufficient wealth.  That system has not succeeded in the past when we were a protected country and there is not any indication to suggest that private enterprise, given the main role that the Minister would wish it to assume, would have success in this regard in the future.  That is the viewpoint, both ideologically and <Col N="2075" /> politically, of the Labour Party.  If that viewpoint is accepted we must move, in the words of Sean Lemass, to the left. We must create a productive role for the public sector and a clear framework within which the private sector can go on to achieve their role within the overall framework of our economy.</P>
    <P>But if we continue to rely on traditional capitalism to solve what the Minister describes as the key question, that is, the provision of full employment, I would suggest simply that we have regard to the most successful capitalist country in the world and ask ourselves if they have solved their problem of unemployment or, more important, let anyone of us go to the ghettos of New York or to the slums of the southern States of America and ask a Puerto Rican or a poor black if they are employed fully in what is the richest and most successful capitalist country in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach this morning made a point which struck me as being particularly relevant to the current condition of the nation.  He said that in the national interest there must be found ways of improving industrial relations. The Taoiseach did not say that the situation in this regard was a national blight, but I would go so far as to say that this is the case.  However, there are other areas with which I should like to deal.  It is not my intention to beat the economic drum.  That has been beaten long and hard throughout the debate so far.  In most instances it has been beaten effectively.  Instead, it is my intention to deal with two items which have been of considerable concern to me as a public representative in the recent past.  These are two matters which from my personal perception I consider are not being treated with the sense of urgency they demand&mdash;our attitude to road traffic deaths, the whole question of road safety and our attitude to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my humble contribution I will deal first with road traffic deaths.  It is in the general national interest to tackle the problems of road safety, pollution, and a number of other associated matters, but the time available to me is short and <Col N="2076" /> consequently I must encapsulate what I have to say in a reference to road traffic deaths and injuries.  The generation to which we belong properly look back in horror at the complacency with which our forebeares used their children as chimney sweeps, at how our people were hanged for sheep stealing, at how women were used as beasts of burden in the mines.  Future generations will look back with the same horror at this generation's indifference to deaths on our road, at our complacency and incomprehension of what is a social blight.  If the pattern of present road deaths continues for another generation there will scarcely be a family who will not have contributed some member to the continuing slaughter.</P>
    <P>Daily we hear cries of horror and indignation from all quarters about killings in the North-East of the island.  Of course we express indignation at the dreadful murders, the terrible maimings and bombings, by whomever they are committed, and of course one side or other of the political divide, depending on their prejudices, express condemnation. Very responsible people express condemnation, and it is possible to do so.  The nation suffered the psychological trauma of deaths during the frightful Civil War.  One should produce figures to back up one's arguments, and figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 deaths from politically motivated violence in the North have totalled 2,037.  Deaths during the dreadful Civil War in the early twenties were about 4,000.  From 1968 to 1978 road deaths in the Twenty-Six Counties numbered 6,173, and in the same period in the Six Counties the figure was 3,228. Again, referring to the part of Ireland over which we have jurisdiction, the number of people injured from 1968 to 1978 was 103,183.  Last year more than 600 people died on the roads in the southern part of Ireland.  Taking the period to which I referred in an all-Ireland context, we are talking about more than 10,000 people dying on the roads.  Death knows no boundaries, political or otherwise</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> Some remedies have been proposed. For example, when the Miníster for the Environment reduced the level of alcohol in the bloodstream for the breathalyser test it helped to reduce the number of deaths on the roads last year by 29 compared with 1978.  Of course that is not much consolation for the fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, the families of which members in one way or another have been hurt.</P>
    <P>But deaths and injuries on our roads are continuing.  I suggest as a matter of urgency that some or all of the oil companies who operate here might consider coming together to make a concerted sustained contribution by way of a road safety campaign.  We are living in a democracy.  I am not criticising the oil companies for the large profits they make, we can only urge them, not force them to do this.  It appears to me they have a social obligation to the country in which they are operating.  Of course we want their oil, of course we must pay their price, of course we want to keep our cars on the road, but I suggest that they have a social obligation in this respect to the countries in which they operate.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I do not offer this suggestion as a criticism but as a plea&mdash;I am not carping or criticising.  These multinational companies have huge resources, financial and technological, and if they got down to organising a road safety campaign as a matter of urgency it might help to resolve the national blight I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>Future generations, we hope, will cure what we have been unable to cure.  They will look back in horror at the legacy we have left them, the crosses by the roadside, the maimed and the injured.  A major effort should be made now in the schools to educate our young people that it is not either fashionable or clever to get into a fast car and drive stupidly and dangerously on our roads.  There seems to be some kind of masochism about driving fast.  It is stupid and dangerous and our young people will not thank us if we do not organise a campaign <Col N="2078" /> of indoctrination against the idea of driving recklessly to the danger of others.  It is neither fashionable nor clever.</P>
    <P>I should like to take an abstract from our statistics for 1976 and give a breakdown of Twenty-six County road fatalities: 53 people were killed by pedal cyclists; 70 people died in accidents involving mopeds, motor-scooters and motor cycles.  Car deaths were 423 in 1976.  In the same year 5,056 car drivers were injured.  In regard to public service vehicles, large, there were 15 fatalities. In regard to goods vehicles deaths amounted to 104 and tractor deaths amounted to 19.  In regard to other motor vehicles there were seven deaths, other non-motor vehicles five and not stated two.  We have the dreadful figure of 698 deaths in that year.  There seems to be an almost social acceptability of deaths on the roads.  Comparing death by way of motor car accident with death by the barrel of a gun we express horror on one side and regret and less than horror on the other.  There is a sense of fatalism, inevitability, that it is going to happen anyway.  Of course it is not going to happen.  We will have to stop it and I believe now is the time to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not intend going into the realms of how we should go about that.  I have offered a number of solutions.  I have put forward a number of ideas which I hope will be taken up and will not be done on a once-off basis but rather on a sustained and concerted one.  If somebody is told something once they may or may not take it in.  On the second time round it may begin to impinge on whatever lobes are necessary to accumulate knowledge, but at the third and fourth attempt the message finally gets through.  That repetition is necessary.  I do not believe in a horror campaign, quite the contrary, but I do believe in a campaign to expose the horror, because such it is.  It is a national scandal, no more or less.</P>
    <P>I know the argument will be advanced that we have reduced the alcohol content in the blood in relation to the breathalyser test.  We must now ask <Col N="2079" /> ourselves do we need to reduce it further?  Is it necessary to examine the fines and penalties in relation to drunken driving?  I do not want to sound pure about this, nor do I want to sound moralistic about it, because that simply is not my style.  I hope I sound realistic and logical about it.  For example, perhaps we should examine whether we should have week-end community work camps for drink and driving offences. Those are some of the options we shall have to examine very shortly if the graph about which I am speaking does not drop very considerably.</P>
    <P>I am speaking about a minority on the roads, a group of undisciplined louts, impatient, lacking in self-discipline, self-control. How many times have Members of this House pulled up at traffic lights and, before the lights have changed to green, a citizen behind starts blowing his horn?  That is impatience, lack of discipline, immaturity; it is stupid and unnecessary because it is seconds only before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then, that driver should behave himself.  In my view he is lacking in self-discipline.  He is not thinking of other people.  He is thinking only of his rush.  I did not set out to preach the gospel according to Saint David or anything like that; far be it from me. These are the realities and I believe something will have to be done about them.  This is a minority enforcing their will on the majority.  I believe that the majority of road users are decent citizens.  Indeed I am certain also that a lot of the drivers I am criticising are decent people out of their cars.  Some sort of schizophrenia seems to take over when a person gets behind the wheel of a car because that person may be quite decent out of his car.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had to discipline myself in that regard.  There was a time when I became very impatient being stuck in traffic.  But then I disciplined myself because I realised none of us is indispensable.  I used to turn on the radio and wait until the traffic got moving, sometimes taking five to ten minutes particularly in the city.  Probably I have been in some of the worst traffic jams in the world, in Lagos in Nigeria.  In fact I think I was in a five hour traffic jam in Lagos.  I was coming from a conference and was not in a hurry and it was a rather interesting experience to be in a foreign country in those circumstances. Nevertheless I would not like to be caught in a five-hour traffic jam in the heart of Dublin, although things are moving in that direction.  I am sorry to deviate but there are certain days in the city of Dublin when traffic conditions become intolerable, when the roads are chock-a-block, particularly in wet weather, with a consequent increase in crashes of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>I believe it is undemocratic for this minority to force their will on the majority. It is not right for these people to put other people's lives at stake.  Neither is it right for them to put their own lives at stake but, if they do, that is their entitlement. What I object to is that by putting their own lives at stake they may kill others.  Of course we do not want to see people killing themselves.  I believe we live in a great country and that the solutions to these problems lie in our hands.  We must not pretend that they do not exist.  Perhaps the more we speak about it the more the public will be educated to an awareness of these facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second leg of my contribution I want to deal with our attitude to environmental vandalism.  In the recent past the Minister for the Environment has been making a special effort and, in my view, has been doing a good job in relation to protecting the environment.  But there still remain weak areas, and none weaker than the situation which occurred recently <Col N="2081" /> in the Funcheon River in County Cork which was poisoned by a lethal does of chromium.  This appears to have been caused by a particular individual's thoughtlessness.  I appreciate that this case may be <i>sub judice</i> and I do not want to go into it in detail because that individual is entitled to the protection of the law also.  But the environment is as much entitled to the protection of the law as he is.  The environment does not belong to any single individual: It belongs to the nation as a whole.  It belongs to this and future generations and it behaves us, as the present generation, to protect it for the future.</P>
    <P>If this pollutant had been poured into the Blackwater in the area of Fermoy the consequences would have been unimaginable because I understand that the good people of that town take their water from that river.  Thank God it did not happen.  These incidents could be prevented if people would stop and think about the consequences of their actions. I am completely satisfied that the person or persons who performed this act of vandalism would not do it again if they reflected on the consequences.  I am a fisherman myself and I know that it will take these rivers many years to recover from the effects of this pollution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Power, recently visited County Mayo and I had the good fortune some weeks afterwards to be in the area of Lough Mask.  This is one of the most magnificent lakes in the country and I have a question on the Order Paper asking the Minister to designate Lough Mask as a wildlife preserve.  The local people appreciate that the lake does not belong to them but to all of us and they would act as custodians and trustees for the rest of the nation.  They are good people who realise their responsibilities. I do not expect the Minister to read my contribution but perhaps some of his civil servants would take note of my plea in the Official Report and urge him to designate Lough Mask as a wildlife preserve.</P>
    <P>Only a short time ago I made my own <Col N="2082" /> small contribution to ensuring that there would not be pollution there when some outside influences attempted to build chalets on the shores of this beautiful lake.  Thankfully that intrusion was resisted but no doubt they will come again as they always do.  For the time being that particular hurdle has been successfully crossed and the application regarding the chalets has very properly been rejected.</P>
    <P>Lough Ennel was until recently a dead lake but it is now back to full health, thanks to public awareness and pressure. Lough Sheelin is, however, in a different situation.  I realise that in speaking about the environment one has to balance the rights of people such as farmers who have an entitlement to make a living against the rights of others to enjoy a lake and its facilities.  Lough Sheelin is probably one of the most historic trout lakes in the country, although Corrib anglers might argue that point.  It is a beautiful lake which was almost destroyed by pig effluent.  I have met and talked there with people of all political persuasions.  There is no doubt that they are good people but they have a responsibility to ensure that pig slurry is not allowed to flow into the rivers and onwards to Lough Sheelin.  The consequence of this is to increase the growth of algae in the lake and reduce the supply of oxygen, thus causing the death of many thousands of fish.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is aware of the problem and I have no doubt that the Minister for the Environment will do something about it very quickly.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with the matter of litter.  Dublin Corporation spent £7 million last year on the disposal of refuse and litter.  People ask what tourists will think about our litter problem but I want to know what we ourselves think about it.  Recently I passed through O'Connell Street and the amount of litter there was indescribable.  The solution to the problem will not be found in the appointment of litter wardens.  I do not believe the corporation should have to sweep the streets; keeping them litter-free is a matter for people in general.  Who has not seen a person throwing an empty <Col N="2083" /> cigarette packet through the window of a car or throw an ice cream wrapper on the street?  People of all ages throw litter on the streets and leave it to someone else to deal with the problem they create. There is a lack of self-discipline in our character and sometimes I am as guilty as most, although not in regard to litter. In my own constituency of Dun Laoghaire I can see the problem of litter in George's Street.  The problem is not confined to O'Connell Street; it is nationwide.  It shows a total lack of awareness and respect for the areas in which other people live and a haphazard attitude to public hygiene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a pleasure to listen to Deputy Andrews but his speech was more low key than I would have expected. He raised matters which I felt could have been dealt with on another occasion and I should have liked to hear him speak about the economy and national issues.  I found myself very much in agreement with him on the subject of death on the roads.  As a father of a young family and as a public representative who listens to the complaints and shares the sorrows of families who have lost loved ones in traffic accidents, I must say that I believe many traffic accidents are due to late night dancing which takes place in virtually every town and village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I speak to young people about this they say that dances are over at 2 a.m. and that when the older generation were going they were over at 3 o'clock and in their grandparents day it was 6 o'clock.  There is no point in lecturing the young generation about midnight dancing. However there is one big difference and it is that they have available to them fast moving cars.  They are living in an era where there is excitement and motor car racing.  There is also the drink aspect involved.  That is not to say that all young people killed in road accidents are drunk.  In many cases they are total abstainers.  I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without following through on what Deputy Andrews was talking about and questioning the attitude of authority in allowing licences for midnight <Col N="2084" /> dancing where drink is available in the full knowledge that when young people come out of these places of enjoyment they get into cars and engage in dare-deviling and driving too fast.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely a parish in Ireland where someone has not been killed in a family in circumstances I am outlining.  I do not know what the moral thinking of authority is which grants midnight extensions and does not provide adequate Garda patrols to control the area afterwards. Like other Deputies I travel through and outside my constituency late at night and my life is in my hands and my heart is in my mouth when I approach places where I know there is midnight dancing.  It is not a question of one's own safety or the safety of one's car or how one drives it but of the other person.  We will have to think this out and I ask the Government to take serious note of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>If there is need for midnight extensions and that extension includes the serving of alcohol there is an equal obligation on the authority to ensure that persons coming out of such places of recreation, fun making and pleasure do not get into a car while they are drunk.  I have ample evidence of people walking out of such dances getting into cars and speeding off, tearing off tyres as they leave the place where the car was parked.  The whole thing is suicidal and it is wrong for authority to close their eyes to it.  I am not one for taking away young people's pleasures but I should like to say as sincerely as possible and with the utmost responsibility that it is totally wrong to grant late night extensions and then close one's eyes to what happens afterwards.  The adult population are often wakened out of their slumber by the noise of people hooting horns, revving engines, wait for the crash and think: &ldquo;well, they got past that corner&rdquo;. It is time the Government took note of this.</P>
    <P>This Government were elected in 1977 on promises contained in an election address known as the Fianna Fáil General Election 1977 Manifesto <i>Action Plan for National Reconstruction.</i>  It <Col N="2085" /> makes very interesting reading to go through the different pages now, particularly as a Donegal Deputy, when I read about what they have to say on posts and telegraphs.  It is almost impossible for someone from the county to make contact with the rest of the State, Northern Ireland or the outside world.</P>
    <P>Last week I had the experience of spending two days trying to contact North Donegal, from 3 o'clock on Wednesday until 7 o'clock on Thursday, but I could not get through.  I tried the operators to re-route my calls through the north of Ireland and they told me that this was not possible despite the fact that, on occasion, I could talk one or two of them into doing that.  If there are technical difficulties about contacting Donegal on certain occasions such as broken lines or mechanical or technical failures alternative arrangements should be made.  It is almost impossible for anyone to make a call to County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Last year this was so diabolically bad that as public representative, at least hoping to be responsible in my public attitude, I told the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that I would not pay my telephone bill until such time as a proper service was made available in County Donegal.  They must have forgotten about me because I have not, received an account from them since.  I have not paid it and I do not intend to pay it until such time as a proper service is provided.</P>
    <P>They can cut off my telephone if they like.  The Minister for communications is going to work a miracle in the next four years.  He will provide automatic telephones and one will be able to ring any part of the world in four years' time. In the meantime it takes about six days to get a letter to County Donegal and it takes 20 minutes at the best of times to get a Dublin operator to make a phone call to County Donegal.  The service is now so bad that I have no confidence in posting a letter in Dublin today to have it delivered in Donegal on Friday morning. What I have to do is to take the letters home with me and post them locally to <Col N="2086" /> make sure they are delivered the following morning.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when I came into this House.  It was under a Fianna Fáil Government but we have had Fianna Fáil Governments and Fianna Fáil Governments.  In 1961 when I came to the Dáil I could have posted a letter and as long as I had done so before 8 p.m. in Dublin it would be delivered to any part of Donegal the following morning.  Now it takes four or five days.  I am glad the Minister has come into the House because I have a question on the Order Paper asking him to explain the reason why we could not contact Letterkenny telephone or telephone numbers in North Donegal for two days last week.  I hope the explanation stands up to examination.</P>
    <P>The Government promised many things under the heading of health.  I do not wish to bore the House by quoting from the <i>Action Plan for National Reconstruction</i> but at a health board meeting last week the CEO told members that he would not be able to continue to provide the services he was expected to provide on the budget given to him.  He said he had been told to cut back £1 million.  With great effort by him and his staff he achieved that but now, with inflation at 20.4 per cent, he will now have to look at his figures again to see if he can cut back another £1.2 million.  The Department of Health have told the health board that supplementary payments will not be made to the board with the result that wards or hospitals will be closed.  That is a very serious situation.  I am not an alarmist but I am anxious to convey to the House information given to me at the health board meeting last week.  I am sure the same situation exists in other health board regions.</P>
    <P>Before Fianna Fáil came to power they scrutinised the agricultural industry and told the people what was wrong with it under the National Coalition.  They made certain promises which were read out by other spokesmen today and it would be a boring exercise for me to <Col N="2087" /> repeat them.  Agriculture has taken such a hammering under Fianna Fáil that many farmers who overstretched themselves because they had found confidence in themselves and in the industry are in trouble.  Those farmers felt confident that they would be able to meet any financial commitment they might enter into and many bank managers advanced large sums to such farmers to re-invest in their holdings or to purchase adjacent land.  Many of those farmers now find themselves in the situation of having to face banks that want the money back and having to cope with a reduction in profits.  Those profits increases under the National Coalition and had improved in the last two or three years but now have disappeared.  Many farmers now find themselves in dire financial straits.</P>
    <P>Farmers living in Border areas must cope with another problem.  I am speaking of farmers of all denominations and political beliefs.  I am referring to those with accounts in banks north of the Border.  That was a normal and reasonable thing down the years.  My family, going back to my great grandfather, from 1880 to 1900, had a bank account in a branch in Strabane.  The Harte family have been dealing in that bank ever since.  I would have continued to have my account there but for the fact that I moved residence to another town. That was a normal thing just like it is normal for people in Kerry to cross the border to work in a bank in Cork, or for people in Limerick to move to Clare, or for people in Tipperary to deal in Cork or Limerick.  It was usual for people living in Donegal to have an account in banks in Tyrone, Derry or Fermanagh. The same thing must also apply to people living in Leitrim, Monaghan, Cavan and Louth.  However, when the Government took us into the EMS one of the conditions was that all people living in the State must move their accounts back from banks outside the State.</P>
    <P>Many farmers in my constituency with substantial overdrafts in banks in County Tyrone or other parts of the North of Ireland were told that they <Col N="2088" /> would have to settle their accounts in the North of Ireland and move to a branch in the Republic.  They were advised to talk to a bank manager in the Republic. Many of those farmers were lucky enough to act immediately and did not lose out but those who did not&mdash;most farmers had other important things to do and did not attach a lot of importance to the bank their cheque was issued on&mdash;when forced to do so found themselves in a very difficult situation. They had to tell bank managers in Donegal that they had overdraft accommodation of £100,000&mdash;many of them had accommodation in excess of that amount&mdash;in County Tyrone and were anxious to transfer money to settle that account.  In many cases they were told by bank managers that they could not do so because it would take £110,000 to settle the account of £100,000.  It was easy to explain that this was only a paper transaction although the customer would be paying interest on £110,000 instead of £100,000.  Many farmers found themselves trapped in this corner.</P>
    <P>After some negotiation farmers were told that as the Government had restricted credit the banks were not in a position to advance £110,000 to settle overdraft accommodation in the North. They were told that they could obtain only £100,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs smiles as if he is of the opinion that I am not telling the truth and that I am overplaying this matter.  I am not and there is nothing isolated about this.  I am aware of one farmer who had overdraft accommodation of £240,000 a very extensive farmer who was developing his farm and employing many people, who had to transfer his account from Tyrone to Donegal.  That transfer would cost £30,000.  That came about because of the actions of a party who talk about the unity of Ireland.  They interfered with the God-given right of Donegal people to have their bank account in Tyrone or Derry.  It is similar to people in Mayo having their bank account in Sligo town or people like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs crossing <Col N="2089" /> the Shannon at Athlone to have his account in a town in County Galway. They are the God-given rights of Irish people but that was not thought of by the Government when we were entering the EMS.  Nobody referred to the fact that there could be difficulties between North and South on this issue.</P>
    <P>Many farmers and business people find it impossible to increase their overdraft accommodation in a Donegal bank to discharge the overdraft in a North of Ireland bank.  Those people still have their accounts outside the jurisdiction. The other great deal the Government meted out for agriculture in Donegal was to remove the employment allowance and to increase the rates on agricultural holdings.  Many farmers now find that they are paying double or three times the amount of rates that they had been paying under the National Coalition. I am not in favour of allowing farmers to earn excessive amounts of money and to get off without paying their way.  But the position is far from that.  The position now is that many farmers are finding it very difficult to meet their commitments.  If farmers did have a glorious few years in the seventies, let all of us remember&mdash;and I was brought up on a farm&mdash;that the farming community are the backbone of this country, that many farmers work long hours and do hard work on the farms to support their wives and families and that very often the labour is not that well paid.</P>
    <P>The Government will undoubtedly tell us the amount of money they are spending on roads.  I would venture to say that County Donegal must be noted for having the worst roads in all of Ireland&mdash;and I am talking about 32 counties.  If one falls in behind a large vehicle heading to Killybegs or Burtonport to collect fish or take goods in that direction, there is no possibility of overtaking it.  I wonder how the drivers of these vehicles are able to negotiate the roads.  The potholes are so bad that I am surprised that many more serious accidents are not happening.</P>
    <P>The cut-back on the expenditure in <Col N="2090" /> County Donegal for roads and environmental schemes and so on has caused the redundancy of 110 people.  Those people have been sacked by Donegal County Council because of a deliberate decision by this Government to cut back on moneys.  Many people think that it is only 110 people, but there are 110 families involved and those families now have to find some other way of surviving. It is an appalling situation when the Government refuse to allow the county councils to adjust their rates to provide the services that the councillors know should be provided and then refuse to give them money so that they can provide the services&mdash;and if the services cannot be provided then men have to be paid off.  A few weeks ago I raised the question of this redundancy.  One of the most disgusting aspects of it is that the Government agreed to wage increases to people in the employment of the Donegal County Council, that is, the salary and wage earners, white collar workers and road workers or labourers.  These increases were justified and in line with the criminal inflation which is rampant in the country at the moment.  But the Government did not provide the money to pay those increases, so Donegal County Council were saddled with the option of not paying the increases or paying off the people at the end of the line, and that is what has happened.  It is detestable that in a modern society other people must be sacked in order to pay people increases.  When this was discussed at the county council meetings all parties were sympathetic to the point of view I am putting forward.  In fairness to them their hands are tied.  The responsibility for this rests fairly and squarely on the Government, who overspent when they came into power to try to meet the election promises.  But now the honeymoon must be paid for.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the people in the Republic will tolerate this much longer, but we are on a slide to disaster unless the Government face their responsibilities to distribute wealth in a fair and equitable manner, unless they realise that the money made by the very wealthy in society is not for their personal  <Col N="2091" /> use but for the use of the society in which we live and must be distributed so that the rich do not get any richer and the poor do not get any poorer.  This the Government have failed to do.  Their election promises were giveaways.  Many of the poor people when they found that they did not have to pay rates on their homes thought that this was not a bad Government and that they would vote for it.  So they did not have to pay their £15 or £25 or £35 a year depending on the amount to be paid and they were very grateful to the Government for relieving them of this terrible burden.  But the fact is that the owners of very big houses, many paying £1,000 a year, were benefiting much more than the person living in the county council cottage. These were rich people who did not object to paying, did not feel any great difficulty in meeting this demand and were willing to make their contribution. But in the lust to get back into power this Government made so many promises that fooled so many people that the people I have just spoken about, the people who found it difficult to pay the rates, were so grateful to be rid of the burden that they never realised that this concession was balanced in favour of the rich. Everything the Government have done since shows that they are a rich man's government.</P>
    <P>There are people unemployed in County Donegal.  We have no money to build houses there.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, came to Donegal last week to open factories and he has a protest outside his office today.  Deputy O'Malley says that we have so many factories in Donegal now that people are coming from Northern Ireland to work in them. But he never mentioned the high unemployment in Inishowen where the rate of unemployment is probably the highest in the EEC.  There was not one mention of the people living in Inishowen.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude in the few minutes I have left by taking the Government's point on Irish unity.  Fianna Fáil told us that Eamon de Valera would unite the country.  After 25 years that record played out and it is not a very encouraging <Col N="2092" /> thing to look back over the speeches that Mr. de Valera made in the early days of Fianna Fáil.  Then we were told that Seán Lemass would do it, and in a way he had a better vision of Irish unity than the founder member of Fianna Fáil. But he did not do it.  Then, of course, it was the turn of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, and it would be unfair of me to judge him in the same way as Eamon de Valera or Seán Leamass. Deputy Lynch took over at a time when it was difficult to unite Irish people.  But he did not succeed.  Now we are being told that the man who is going to unite the Irish people is Deputy Haughey.  The amusing thing about all this&mdash;and any Deputy who wants to take the time off to do it should do some research and he will see the point I am making&mdash;is that the speeches of Eamon de Valera, the speeches of Seán Lemass and the speeches of Deputy Jack Lynch are identical with the speeches which Deputy Haughey is making at the moment. There is no difference other than the place, the time and, I suppose, the atmosphere. The words are virtually the same.  He has made no effort to unite Ireland.</P>
    <P>Their policies have been totally contradictory of a desire for unity.  The case which damns the Government most is the EMS, which has made Irish money foreign currency in the North of Ireland. In connection with the Department of Education and Irish unity, if a young person living in a Border area opts to go to a school in the North of Ireland he or she forfeits the right to third level education because nobody in the Department of Education, particularly the Minister, has the vision to set a leaving certificate examination that would allow any child from the Republic doing secondary school education in the North of Ireland an opportunity to sit for the leaving certificate examination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let us talk about the things that matter.  Pie in the sky and dreaming about a united Ireland have produced nothing.  Whatever chance Eamon de Valera, or Seán Lemass had or Deputy Jack Lynch had of uniting Ireland, I say with regret that Deputy Haughey has a terrible disadvantage. It is no secret that one million people North of the Border will never trust him, even if he had it 110 per cent right.  He will never be trusted because one of the robberies that took place today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that it is often frustrating to have to listen to some of the debates in this House.  It is never worse than when one is subjected to the prophets of doom and gloom that one has to listen to on occasions like this.  On the occasion of adjournment debates it is expected that every effort will be made to embarrass the Government and because of that, I cannot forgive a lot of the drivel that we have been subjected to here for the past while.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Reynolds, will be speaking tomorrow in the House, I presume on matters concerned with his Department of Communication which covers Posts and Telegraphs and Transport and I have no intention of pre-empting anything that he may say. Since I became Minister of State at the Department of Transport I have had an amazing advantage in having been very closely associated with the Minister for Transport in all matters concerning the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give some personal reactions <Col N="2094" /> on transport matters as they have occurred to me since taking office.  As we all know, transport accounts for about 16½ per cent of gross national product, net of taxation and also for about 11 per cent of household expenditure in this country.  Consequently, it is of major importance to us all, whether corporate bodies or family units.  It is a trueism to say that transport is essential for the wellbeing of the economy.  Everybody realises this.  For that reason we at this time have to be concerned with new transport measures and the taking of very important decisions as far as transport matters are concerned.</P>
    <P>The role of transport in regional development cannot be overlooked or over-emphasised.  As a public representative from the west of Ireland, Deputy Harte will fully appreciate that it is absolutely essential that the Department of Transport functions well in giving people in the far-flung reaches of this country the best possible transport system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the buses in Donegal could run on time, the Government would be given full marks for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be achieved in economic circumstances.  Provision of these services is costly but society has accepted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We would give two cheers, not three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Society has accepted, by and large, that it is necessary to support the transport system and there is a continuing support as far as the Government and the Department are concerned to maintain and develop these services to give a better service to all concerned in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem in our urban centres is evident to all of us and has been growing a pace for some time.  With that in mind, the Government set up the Transport Consultative Commission to look, first of all, into the major traffic congestion in Dublin city.  It is indicative of the regard that the Minister for Transport and the <Col N="2095" /> Government have in dealing with this very important problem that within a fortnight of the commission making their recommendations, the Minister for Transport, in line with the recommendations, has taken the initiative to set up the task force which will make available interim measures to bring about a speedy solution to the transport congestion situation in the inner city and indeed, in the Dublin centre generally.</P>
    <P>There are enormous costs as far as investment is concerned in transport infrastructure. Because this matter was dealt with recently in the Dáil, it is not necessary for me to deal with the enormous amounts of money needed to bring about a solution in this regard.  Suffice it to say that the Government are conscious of this and have taken the initiative there as well in providing the necessary finance for the electrification of the Howth railway line.  This is going on apace.  All moneys that are required to bring it on stream in the appointed time will be made available by the Government.</P>
    <P>The commission's report was confined, of course, to an investigation of urban passenger transport in the Dublin area, but they felt in their recommendations that many of the measures they advised could be applied to other large urban areas and city centres.  In this regard it might be well for interested parties in, say, Cork, Limerick and Galway, to apply themselves to the study of the commission's report.  I am sure they would find therein all the measures deemed necessary to improve the traffic situations in their own towns.</P>
    <P>I will go so far as to say that there has been no worth-while transport debate in this House since I took office.  The Minister and I were very disappointed at the recent debate when the Estimate for the Department of Transport was being taken.  Indeed, in that debate the Opposition Deputies were somewhat at a loss to make a good case as far as transport was concerned.  They had little idea about what they would like to do on transport matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of the current parliamentary questions from some Opposition Deputies showed a dichotomy of approach in regard to transport services, whether surface transport or aviation. It is understandable why Deputies should require information about fares as far as Aer Lingus and CIE are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but one certain spokesman on the Opposition benches does not seem yet to have his mind made up as to whether he wants cheap fares with consequent uneconomic service to be provided by Aer Lingus or whether he wants to reduce Aer Lingus losses, for example on the North Atlantic route, which of course is not consistent with a cheap fares policy.  We would regard it as important if the main Opposition party would make up their mind once and for all just what their transport policy is and what line of approach they are going to take, without going hither and thither as they are at present.</P>
      <P>They also have this great double-think on CIE.  The Government are more than conscious of the Financial burden on the Exchequer which the CIE deficit represents and because of their consciousness in this regard they are taking the necessary steps to see if something can be done about it.  This is indicative of the way this Government have been operating the past three years.</P>

      <P>There are two areas that must be considered, the international forces at play in the world and the domestic tensions we have at this time. In relation to international forces, that is concerned mostly with the increase in the oil import bill.  When one considers that between 1978 and 1980 the import bill for oil and oil products rose from £333 million to something in the region of £800 million, it is not too difficult to understand that in an open economy like ours this puts a heavy strain on the economy.  This has made a significant contribution to our external deficit.  That is agreed by all.</P>

      <P>It must be agreed that this Government have taken all available steps to deal with the matter.  We considered this question of energy and resources so important that the Taoiseach on assuming office immediately created a Minister for Energy who has been very active on the ground. Anybody who has even a casual look at the daily papers will realise this.  It can also be fairly stated that very keen arrangements have been made to guarantee our supplies as much as possible. We all look forward to a day in the not too distant future when we will be able to announce an oil find off my coastline.  That will be a proud day for Fianna Fáil and we will be able to handle that as well.  In a more serious tone, I hope that when that oil find comes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputies can rest assured that the Fianna Fáil Government have their priorities right.  They will use the benefits that accrue from such a find to benefit the living standards and to help to develop the infrastructures so that our standard of living will be maintained long after the find has been registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some pretty heavy <Col N="2100" /> weather as far as wage increases are concerned and that could be regarded as the domestic tension that I referred to earlier.  There is always an aspiration for living standards to be raised but unfortunately people want living standards to be raised in excess of the capacity of the economy.  When there is greater productivity it is only right and proper that the producers should be allowed to achieve a higher level of income and thereby a higher standard of living.  But the position at the moment is that there is a demand for a rapid improvement which is not being paid for by increased productivity and unfortunately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I never said I was here, I just said that I was here for the Taoiseach's speech.  I paid studious attention to everything that was said subsequent to my departure.  The two efforts were concentrated in the main on a personal attack on the Taoiseach.  This is not new.  The pattern of action in this regard is now virtually an everyday occurrence here.  This has been the pattern <Col N="2102" /> since the Taoiseach assumed office last December.  There has been a concerted attack on his personal integrity, on his ability to hold office and even on his right to be elected Taoiseach at all.  One would have expected more from the sanctimonious craw-thumpers of the opposite side, who like to portray themselves as all things bright and beautiful, the defenders of the rights of individuals, the paragons of virtue, and who see the mote in every one else's eye but fail to see the beam in their own.  They seem to regard success as something to be ashamed of and something that does not befit a person in public life.</P>

I ask myself why are they doing these things.  Why are they continuing in there valley of political darkness?

I know from experience that there are certain points which seem to touch a raw nerve and I am sorry if I have to deal with some of those subjects.

      <P>Very well, Minister, you are going to answer that tomorrow but I should like just a moment to suggest that those in glass houses should not be throwing rocks about.  I say &ldquo;rocks&rdquo; deliberately.  When it comes to political interference little stones might be better in the hands of the Opposition than rocks.  Acute embarrassment is probably being felt on Deputy Harte's Front Bench at this time over little incidents that might be happening in the west of <Col N="2105" /> Ireland.  I have no doubt that certain words in a local newspaper in the recent past will make prescribed reading for some of the good people on that side of the House before the week is out.  If the impact of some of these written words were known then I think Deputy FitzGerald would have restrained himself or further, might have refrained from making any reference whatever to political interference.</P>

      <P>I have had enough of the insults to my Leader and if it gives anybody in the Opposition any satisfaction to know that their continued attacks on the Taoiseach have drawn forth one to give them battle, so be it, but from this day forward while they continue this personal attack on the honour and integrity of that good man they will have to deal with some of us who will come in and stand in the trenches beside him.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil record for the past few years has been, to say the least of it, impeccable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the Fianna Fáil record over the last six months is the one that would seem to be most in question today.  I suppose it was regarded as our first political problem and I suppose it is the political problem nearest the heart of Deputy Harte also, finding a lasting solution to the problem of the six north-eastern counties.  I think it could be fairly said that more has been attempted in the past six months by way of political initiative than even the most optimistic could have hoped for.  It must be admitted that the Taoiseach has elevated the problem in political terms to the very highest level.  Contrast this high-powered and sensitive approach of Fianna Fáil at this time with the muddy thinking during the Coalition days.  Witness the strategy of the Fianna Fáil Government on the national and international scene.  This, coupled with the Taoiseach's Ard Fheis statement, his opening speech in the Northern Ireland debate here recently, and his &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; interview has placed on public record, beyond yea or nay, Fianna Fáil's policy and aspirations on behalf of the Irish people as regards Irish unity.</P>
      <P>We are confident that the Taoiseach has the full support of the majority of the people of this country and that he has the dedication and courage to bring about a happy solution in peace and harmony for all who live in this island. Deputy FitzGerald boasts about what he did for Northern Ireland when he was in office.  I think the most eloquent assessment of his efforts came from one of his own former colleagues in Government, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, who admitted that Deputy FitzGerald had done nothing at all.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has taken a further step in a practical way of helping to improve relations between the community in the Six Counties and the Border counties. I have been honoured in being appointed by him to give special consideration to cross-Border activity and development.  For the benefit of Deputy Harte and anybody else who is interested I am making at this time a fairly detailed study of all the projects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept that.  Why does the Deputy continue to interrupt me?  Is this hurtful to him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair must again remind Deputy Harte that he is not entitled to interrupt.  The Minister has about four minutes left to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These reports are being studied in some depth by me and the House and Deputy Harte may rest assured that there will be positive action on the ground as regards these developments. It is my intention to be available at all times for those who are interested in discussing these matters with me.  I intend to visit the area quite often during the recess and discuss these projects in person on the ground.</P>
      <P>Our first economic aim, as stated by the Taoiseach on many occasions, is industrial relations and industrial peace.  It is fair to say that there is an angry population outside and they are not satisfied that things are well as far as industrial relations are concerned.  This is against the background of continued efforts on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government to bring about industrial peace this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe any strike situation can have a lasting benefit for any section of the community.  It does not have advantages for individuals, unions, employers or for the economy.  Any small, short-term advantages individuals get are quickly dissipated.  When one asks a person who has been on strike for a considerable length of time if the strike has brought any benefits to him or her the answer is always no.  I believe the unions would like to see an end to this kind of situation as well, because the funds they must make available as far as strikes and strike situations are concerned, could be much more fruitfully utilised in providing training sessions and providing their members with better facilities.  The employers have to meet deadlines.  They would like to safeguard their investments and they would like to develop a <Col N="2108" /> stronger reputation as far as meeting deadlines is concerned.  Strikes are certainly not in their best interests.</P>
    <P>The economy suffers most of all.  We have suffered a lot in our international reputation.  We have suffered as well as far as international investment is concerned. Something is basically wrong when unions do not speak on behalf of their members, when arrangements freely negotiated cannot be implemented because of the intransigence of minority groups.  The structures are already there and they were formulated after years of effort on behalf of the unions, the employers and the Government in a concerted effort, painfully on occasions.  How can we cast aside those structures now without inviting anarchy?  If the procedures need changing, if unions think they need changing, if employers and the Government think they need changing, let us have the changes in consultation with all the partners.  Once the necessary changes have been brought about surely it is reasonable to expect that negotiations taking place under those procedures should be binding on all concerned rather than having a situation of stop-go like we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Department I am responsible for have problems in this regard.  Despite the repeated efforts of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Labour we have not yet reached a satisfactory solution.  I would like to join with the Minister for Transport in once again appealing to those people, in the national interest, their own interest, the interest of their unions and in the interest of the community at large, in these trying times, when investment is so essential, when tourist development is so essential and when we need the resources they are denying us, to reconsider their stand and come back to the consultation table where I can assure them they will be welcomed and where a fair and honourable deal can be worked out to suit everybody.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of aspects of industry and agriculture I would have liked to deal with especially as far as small industries <Col N="2109" /> are concerned because I believe, despite the fact that there have been major advances in the work of the IDA in attracting new investment and new industry into the country, that there is one area&mdash;I believe the Fianna Fáil Government are conscious of this area&mdash;where major advances could be made in job creation at this time, that is in the area of small industry.</P>
    <P>There has been a very positive approach to this.  The Taoiseach today gave an assurance of assistance, technical and every other way, to those interested in developing, in extending existing small industries or establishing new ones.  This is an area which we should, as a responsible Government, preach hard and often to everybody concerned, where the winds of inflation and the winds of foreign investment do not always hurt as much as they do in the larger capital-orientated industries.  We can provide lasting job opportunities by furthering the small industries programme. I would like to express the wish that further help and resources will be made available in this regard.  I can only put on record in the minute left to me the thanks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A vote of congratulations should be passed to the Minister for Agriculture for the efforts he has made on behalf of agriculture in the short time he has held office and for his efforts in maintaining the CAP, which has been of enormous <Col N="2110" /> benefit to the farmers in general and, in particular, his great efforts on behalf of the western farmers in bringing back a package in the last few weeks, which has been sought by many Governments over the years and could only be achieved under the reign of Deputy Charles J.

      <P>These backbenchers, towards the end of last year manipulated by various means the election of the new Taoiseach who, in the previous two years, had been in charge of the Department of Health during which time he had created for himself the image of a saviour or of a messiah.  Indeed, all he did then was to project his own image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The then Minister for Health had convinced these backbenchers that if they elected him as Leader of their party he would lead them to victory in the next general election.  At one fell swoop after his election as Taoiseach he abolished the Department of Economic Planning and Development and sacked the Minister concerned.  In addition the new Taoiseach turned his back on the idea of job creation and publicly dissociated himself from the Fianna Fáil manifesto by regarding it as a complete and utter failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I detected a rather sharp conflict between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Energy when the latter associated himself closely with the manifesto and said that more people have been put to work in the past three years than has ever before been the case since the foundation of the State.  He maintained that the implementation of the manifesto was needed urgently to resolve chronic economic and social ills in our society and that any criticism of this gospel was only superficial.  The Minister must be living in cloud cuckooland.  It would be worth his while to go down the country and to talk with housewives, with workers, with farmers and with young people.  Surely he does <Col N="2113" /> not believe that there is not a serious crisis in our economy.  As we approach the end of the first half of 1980 we have an unemployment figure of 95,000 which is rising rapidly.  In addition there are 50,000 school leavers completing the leaving certificate examination this week who, as confirmed by experts at national level, have very little prospect of work in the near future.</P>
    <P>Was this the sort of situation that led to the sacking of Deputy O'Donoghue from his ministry?  I recall that in one of his major statements to the House he committed himself to the objective of full employment by 1982.  He spoke also of an inflation rate of 5 per cent but that is another matter.  When one considers the employment problem in conjunction with an inflation rate of 20 per cent which is increasing rapidly each year without any effort being made to control it, one realises how serious the situation is.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question last week we ascertained that the £ of 1979 is worth 84 pence today.  That in itself is a clear indication of the very serious increase in the cost of living and the effect this is having on our way of life in terms of take-home pay.</P>
    <P>I might add that in the period since December last the economic situation has worsened considerably.  This observation was confirmed recently when we were told that we may expect a trade deficit this year of £750 million.  That represents an increase in deficit of the order of £170 million on last year when we were told that we would have to curtail our borrowing and live within our means and also that there would have to be a cut-back so far as the enormous deficit of 1979 was concerned.  Instead, there is a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>There are closedowns every other day so far as industry is concerned.  I am not in any way a pessimist but one has only to read the newspapers to realise how bad the situation is.  Only today there is news of the threatened loss of 1,000 jobs.  There are redundancies and job losses and despite the best efforts of the IDA, whom I commend for the very <Col N="2114" /> good work they have done down through the years, there will be a net job loss situation this year.  This is a very unfortunate situation in a country that has a young and increasing population.</P>
    <P>It is very sad for somebody who has worked in a job for many years to be told that he is not wanted any longer. When a man loses his job his entire family are affected.  It is very difficult for somebody who has reached middle age and who is made redundant to find another job.  Unfortunately, the situation in many employments is that people who have reached the age of 40 are not wanted any longer.</P>
    <P>It is a crazy situation that we should be building new industrial bases when our traditional industries are going to the wall and when people who have given, perhaps, 30 years service lose their jobs. We welcome new industries but the closure of existing ones is very sad.  This is the sort of situation that is creating industrial unease.  There seems not to be any light at the end of the tunnel.  The traditional industries that have survived so far seem destined to go to the wall in the years ahead.  Perhaps this is because of the unfortunate situation in the EEC and because of world trade but it is something we must live with.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport complimented the Minister for Agriculture on the package that he brought back from Brussels some weeks ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the return of the Minister there was a press conference arranged to cover the Taoiseach's welcome home at Dublin Airport for the Minister.  We all saw this event on our television screens. However, I am well aware of what the farmers in my area at least were thinking about that package in the weeks that followed.  It was not very well packed for a start and what it contained was not very valuable.  It involved a 5 per cent increase at a time when there is an inflation rate of 20 per cent.  Farmers are intelligent <Col N="2115" /> people.  It is not easy to fool them.  It is difficult to think of any reason for a press conference on the occasion of the Minister's return from Brussels.  Indeed, it is difficult to think of any reason for emphasising the package concerned.</P>
      <P>Before leaving for Dublin last evening I talked with farmers at the local mart in Nenagh and they told me that in one week there was a net loss in respect of cattle of £20 per head.  This is part of the package, the situation in which small farmers have to live.  Costs are rising daily and profits are falling.  Many people believe that the milk and honey days of the EEC, the big profits, are over unless the Government take steps to alleviate the sufferings of small farmers: many of them will be forced from the land, perhaps in the way envisaged by Commissioner Mansholt when he said small farmers in Ireland would be leaving the land in thousands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Promises, more promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a promise.  It is on stream at the moment and it will be very effective.  Of course there is not a direct ratio between a 5 per cent increase in farm prices and a 20 per cent inflation increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of the west will tell the Minister in due course all about the 5 per cent increase on the back of a 20 per cent inflation rate.  I should like to go a little further into agriculture and talk about the Government's land policy, what I will call the promised land policy.  Since 1977 I had been listening to Deputy Gibbons, and for the last 25 years to previous Ministers about this land policy.  Now we are being told that instead of a land policy we will get a White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention of a White Paper has a fearful effect on me because it means a delay of 10 or 15 years before anything is done.  Deputy Gibbons in the last <Col N="2116" /> Government, or the new Government, or perhaps I should call them the pre-Christmas Government, gave a commitment to produce a land policy.  I presume the commitment was given with Cabinet approval, the Cabinet with collective responsibility, and I presume that when Deputy Gibbons left, many Cabinet members would still be in favour of a land policy.  I cannot therefore see any reason for this step backwards, five or six years.  In agriculture as in the industrial sector there is grave unrest, particularly among small farmers, and anyone who was outside the gates of Leinster House today would have seen smallholders from all over Ireland raising their voices in impatience at the neglect of their needs and the needs of their families for land to make their holdings viable.</P>
    <P>I know hundreds of such farmers in my constituency who need land urgently and at the same time I know of substantial holdings in the area which for some time have been on the stocks for division, but not a thing has been done.  I refer in particular to three estates, one of 1,300 acres, which would be of great benefit to the many smallholders who need land, which would help to keep many of them on the land.  I am afraid of the consequences if this delay goes on, if this unease is allowed to creep in among the smallholders, the backbone of our agriculture.  I am not happy about the way in which acquisition and division of land are being proceeded with.  The people who will read the record of what I am saying will know what I am talking about.  They are losing their patience and there may be more than marches&mdash;that is what I am afraid of.</P>
    <P>The public sector is not any different from the private sector.  This year has been bad for the public sector.  The Central Bank has asked in its report for further substantial cuts in the public sector in areas of most concern to the under-privileged, the poor, the people in need of housing, and the children, responsibilities of the Departments of Social Welfare, the Environment, Education and Health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> I am a member of a health board and there has been a cut of £1½ million in the Mid-West region, and this affects essential services.  We have been told to make do with what we have&mdash;a holding operation. There have been serious cuts in capital programmes, buildings, x-ray units and orthopaedic clinics.  Work urgently needed has been postponed. The health board, ably assisted by action committees, have made a case for a full maternity unit in the county but they have been told there is not any money for expansion of their services.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a vocational educational committee for many years and I know there is a serious crisis in that sector of our educational services.  I am proud of the contributions made by the vocational schools, the CEO's, teachers and the VEC to the economy of the area.  We have placed many boys and girls in good employment.  But this year the situation is so grave that I am wondering if we will have the chalk, the pens and paper for the pupils in September when the new school year opens.</P>
    <P>I am a member of two boards of management, and this year the financial allocations to run the schools, to maintain the services, have been cut by 50 per cent.  This makes the job of running the schools nearly impossible for teachers and headmasters.  It is a sad day for Ireland when a Government who in their manifesto showed so much concern for young people have made it nearly impossible for those associated with vocational schools to carry on.  Of course the effect will fall ultimately on our children.</P>
    <P>The same crisis situation exists in the primary sector.  I have been asked by many school managers to air specially the serious financial cut backs they have been asked to bear in regard to <i>per capita</i> grants and allocations for buildings and construction work in the primary schools for which they are responsible.  Surely this deserves immediate attention from the Minister for Education?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> In the social welfare field I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Moore, emphasise Government concern for the under-privileged.  He referred to the increases granted them in the budget. While at the time they appeared to be worth while, in the intervening four months the serious escalation in the cost of living has practically nullified them. Indeed the differential rents scheme recently announced from the Custom House has hit the less-well-off and has caused serious reaction throughout the country at local authority level.  People who are unable to get jobs through no fault of their own, people with families, who are disabled, sick, find that that scheme has been altered.  Rather than their rent being assessed on 50 per cent of their social welfare benefit&mdash;which is little enough bearing in mind the present high cost of living&mdash;it is now assessed on their full social welfare benefit.  I have described it as a new version of Robin Hood, rather than robbing the rich to give to the poor it is a case of robbing the poor to give to the rich.  It is something the Minister for the Environment and the Government should seriously reconsider.  There may not be a substantial number involved but those being subjected to this hardship are the less-well-off in our society.  If 1,000 people only are affected&mdash;and that is a conservative guess&mdash;that system should not work to their detriment.</P>
    <P>Again dealing with people in receipt of social welfare I might refer to the vicious fuel variation clause implemented by the ESB in their accounts which constitutes a frightful imposition on people who are unable to meet these costs.  I have seen instances of a normal bill of between £8 to £10 being doubled as a result of that fuel variation element.  Irrespective of what side of the House we are on, if we have a social conscience in respect of the less-well-off that fuel variation cost should be subsidised by the Government to offset its drastic effects on the incomes of these people and their way of life.  This is something that should be considered both by the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Energy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The panacea for all our ills as far as the Labour Party is concerned are subsidies here, there and everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a terrible imposition on people with low incomes occasioned by this fuel variation clause in electricity accounts.  That is a fact of life we have got to live with. Something should be done about it.  I feel very strongly about it.  It should be a matter of concern to all of us.</P>
      <P>I should like now to move on to the Department of the Environment.  In this area very many people are affected by cut-backs in allocations this year. County managers were appointed years ago under the 1941 Act.  These people were appointed to manage.  Unfortunately because they are being hamstrung by financial restrictions at Custom House level these people, who are concerned about and know the needs of people in their areas, can no longer manage or perform their duties properly. At present we have a situation reaching crisis point at local authority level in regard to roads, housing, sanitary services and employment.  We are all aware of the present state of our roads. Somebody has called them a series of potholes around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to housing I know that in my area in March we received £500,000 for the building of houses in North Tipperary, at a stage when we were committed already to a figure of £800,000. The ultimate effect will be that the county manager may invite tenders, examine contracts from now until the end of the year but no houses will be built in my area&mdash;and I presume that is the picture across the country&mdash;unless and until the Minister makes further allocations for house building.  The same stringency applies to the sanitary services.  Moneys are not available.  Because of that dire financial situation in my area there are now 33 men about to be laid off in North Tipperary County Council.  Indeed this situation will deteriorate further because the roads situation and the moneys allocated to them will worsen when we will be faced with further unemployment in the public sector at local authority <Col N="2120" /> level.  There was a grave mistake made in February with the cancellation of the home improvement grants.  That scheme created employment, and helped people improve their housing.</P>
    <P>On the industrial front I believe that if we are to survive this recession industrial peace is absolutely essential.  I mentioned one aspect of industrial unrest in the House last week on the Estimate for the Department of Labour.  That was the fact that Labour Court decisions take so long to emanate from Dublin.  Many months may elapse between the hearing of a case and the issue of its findings and recommendations.  Nothing is more annoying to a worker with a genuine grievance than having to wait six months for its resolution.  I recommended to the Minister for Labour last week that further consideration be given to decentralisation of the Labour Court and the conciliation services because all matters nationwide cannot be resolved in Dublin. I recommended the establishment of regional offices as part of an early warning system for the avoidance of industrial unrest.  Such should be recommended to the Government with a view to creating an atmosphere in which industrial peace would permeate our society once again, putting our economy on its feet.  I hope the Minister for Labour will consider that suggestion of mine and establish in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick Labour Court offices, thereby decentralising the Labour Court and resulting in industrial peace throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall commence where most politicians do now when addressing themselves to economic matters, that is, in the international arena. There have been many warnings and comments emanating from EEC summit meetings, from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and all the other international financial institutions regarding the present international situation.  Here I should like to refer to some personal experiences.  I had an opportunity of visiting Iraq with an all-party group at the end of 1979.  Iraq is a country endowed with oil reserves, <Col N="2121" /> natural gas, minerals and, in the northern part of the country, a developing agricultural economy.  During that visit we were afforded a real insight into how another part of the world is planning and developing.  This morning the Taoiseach referred specifically to the recycling of petrodollars.  Fundamentally that is the course ahead for this country. We must adopt a completely new and aggressive approach to exports.  We have a number of Government agencies, structured and financed from this House in order to assist in the promotion of exports.</P>
      <P>The visit of the all-party committee to Iraq showed us that there is a lot more we can do and a great potential for Ireland.  It has been said time and again that there has been a vast shift in financial resources to the oil-producing countries and we must now endeavour to get some of those funds back into our economy.  We must adopt a new and aggressive approach.  Indirectly quite an amount of Government spending is going towards promotions, but the people who have taken on themselves this pioneering role find on returning to this country that they do not get support from semi-State organisations or from public and private companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We found that the Scandanavian countries, particularly Finland, have been extremely active and aggressive in selling their products, especially technical, and educational expertise. When we looked at these new projects we felt that we could have undertaken these tasks equally well.  However, we came to the conclusion that it is very difficult to get a number of people in industry to accept the necessity to be aggressive and undertake projects and contracts in that part of the world.  It is sad that we are not making the most of the opportunities which arise.  Iraq was one of the first countries to do a State-to-State energy deal with our new national corporation.  The people we met expressed a great desire to trade with Ireland and there is tremendous potential for our exports.  This is the one clear and <Col N="2122" /> positive path we can follow to ensure continuity of economic growth.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the international economic situation is grave and it is a lot more difficult in other developed countries than at present in Ireland.  We cannot, however, allow the prophets of gloom to get recognition.  We must work our way out of the difficult international situation.  The fact that we are a small country has certain advantages in some areas.  I would urge our companies to give due recognition to the opportunities being opened up by a number of our semi-State trade promotional organisations and to endeavour to brief their work force on the potential, conditioning them to have a willingness to go abroad and promote exports even though it sometimes involves long spells away from home.  There are many outlets for the excellent products we are capable of producing.</P>
    <P>The one capacity which they do not have in the area about which I have been speaking is the capacity to produce food. That is our great national resource but we have not as yet developed in the processing sector a product in a consumable shape or form.  We are still far too willing, particularly in the meat sector, to allow exports in a form which does not give the greatest return.  I would ask semi-State organisations to develop a much more comprehensive programme of awareness here.  The people concerned are familiar with the potential and endeavour to take advantage of opportunities they see at first hand.  They provide grants to bring abroad personnel from companies which might have export potential.  During that trade mission the CTT group constantly made the comment that many of our companies with potential for exports do not follow through.  At this time of retrenchment in the home market and in the British and European markets, we must look further afield and take on a pioneering role which in the missionary sense has been so much a part of our history.  We must adopt this new approach in order to get the maximum number of petrodollars to pay for the tremendous increase in the <Col N="2123" /> price of our oil imports.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies have had the opportunity to look at the operations of a number of prominent State-sponsored companies such as Aer Lingus, ACC, Bord na Móna and the Irish Sugar Company. Today we met representatives of NET.  In regard to Aer Lingus, we visited the airport about six weeks ago and met a number of personnel involved in the flying side of operations as well as others on the maintenance side.  The difficulties facing Aer Lingus are of particular concern to every community-minded individual. The company are going through a period of disruption when they can least afford it and when it is most undesirable.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand the attitude of some of the members of the NEETU.  As somebody from the engineering industry who has served an engineering apprenticeship and who was a member of that union and is still closely associated with it, I cannot understand the new aggressive approach which seems to have crept in.  It is not desirable and will not be sustained.  People who have had a tremendous opportunity to advance themselves in an educational and technical area funded in the main by the State should not now hold to ransome this great semi-State organisation which has done more to promote the name of Ireland than all the other promotions we have undertaken abroad.  Now in the middle of the peak season we find that the company are again in difficulty and it is not all that long since they last had major difficulties. They seem to have the capacity to carry on even in the face of great difficulties and appear to be succeeding in maintaining the operation of flights.  This strike went to a vote and I spoke recently to one of the employees in the company who had voted in favour of strike.  He could not justify the attitude of mind which prevailed.  They have made a case that protracted negotiations have gone on and that they have fallen behind in the <i>status quo</i> situation in the company. They probably have and it may be that <Col N="2124" /> they have a just case, but the strike weapon should be the last way of dealing with a difficulty.</P>
    <P>I will not embark on any kind of union bashing because I do not believe it is necessary.  It is incorrect and there has been far too much of it over the past five or ten years.  It has become a usual way of explaining a lot of major difficulties in labour relations.  I cannot accept the attitude that at a peak time in the year technical people who know their own abilities and importance should try to create a difficulty in that semi-State company.  Hopefully these people will not have to learn the very expensive, harsh and cruel lesson of today's world that they will only in due course damage their own potential and that of their colleagues.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we are anxiously awaiting the development of £25 million Aer Lingus investment to create 600 jobs of a complex, technical nature.  This may be affected and many other areas may be affected by the situation which exists at present which is not acceptable. I urge the people concerned to show a gesture, and management likewise, and decide, without resolving the detail, to return to work and put a time limit on resolving the differences.  They should show goodwill all around in this time of difficulty internationally and reverse the decision to bring back Irish technical personnel who are doing excellent work abroad promoting the name of Ireland and the aspects of that company and its facilities, and not take them away from the very lucrative contracts that company hold because of their ability.</P>
    <P>We must find a new way forward in industrial relations.  In the Taoiseach's address to the nation shortly after taking up office, he asked for a decade of endeavour.  Let the eighties be the decade of endeavour.  Let us find a new way of resolving difficulties and introduce a new flexibility.  The improvement is already there.  The man-hours lost in the first quarter of this year is a tremendous improvement on the previous year but it is not good enough.  Every time we have one difficulty in the strike situation it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> We had an explanation today from some of the senior executives of NET who said that for five weeks at the Marino Point plant they had a strike which cost £5 million, £1 million per week on a plant where the personnel involved know quite well that the overspend is tremendous.  The previous administration allocated funds to commence that development and this Government took up the very expensive tab to complete it, one of the largest single investments made in this country. Yet again technical personnel, because of demarcation lines, decided to have a strike.  That was the net cost of it.</P>
    <P>In looking at the whole area of industrial relations I cannot understand why there has to be demarcation between employer and employee.  We hear a lot about taxation, PAYE, employers and employees.  Having visited the educational facility available to management, the IMI, and the educational facilities available to trade union members, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions facility, one cannot understand they are not all under one roof and not educated and working together for the benefit of the country.  There is a tremendous need for a new dawning in the whole area of labour relations.  I urge employers and employees to decide now that they will adopt new approaches and attitudes particularly in a time of economic difficulty.</P>
    <P>We know there are major difficulties in certain companies and, as the Taoiseach pointed out this morning, major achievements in job creation and job approvals this year.  There is tremendous progress on one side but unfortunately bad news is spoken about a lot more than whatever progress might be made. It is a major cause for concern.  In the area of industrial relations, the commission have been far too slow in reporting. We assumed they would have come forward a lot sooner with imaginative proposals.  There is need for change. There is a tremendous fragmentation in the union structure.  Perhaps there is not a united approach on the employer side. <Col N="2126" /> The Taoiseach, in his nationwide address, pointed out that a lot of the difficulties probably stemmed from management.  That is an area not often highlighted.  I know the NESC some months ago produced a report which highlighted difficulties in management regarding personnel relationships and so on.  Unless we work together to resolve these difficulties they will continue and will not be to the advantage of the community.</P>
    <P>If one from this side of the House is calling for a constructive and positive approach from employers and employees one would assume that politicians might show some example.  Unfortunately that example was not forthcoming in the House today.  One had limited, negative personal attacks on a man holding the highest, most demanding office in the land at the head of the Government.  It has become a feature of the two Opposition parties since the Taoiseach took office.  The Irish people have tremendous respect and regard for the office of Taoiseach and they know that who-ever holds that office is their representative and under the democratic process they decide at elections who will head the Government.  During our term in opposition we had economic difficulty with the last Government.  There were international difficulties and difficulties here at home all accumulating in job losses, high finances and so on.  From the far side of the House during that period the Fianna Fáil Party put forward an alternative economic strategy to that of the then Coalition Government.  It was constructive and positive opposition.  As yet we have not seen any such suggestions or ideas.  We had a press conference the other day in which Fine Gael blandly announced there should be cuts in Government spending.  They were very short on the implementation, methods and effects.  They criticised but did not put up any alternative set of proposals.  I do not propose to dwell very long on criticising the Opposition as it is not forward looking.  It is negative and not accepted by fairminded people in the community.  We must at this stage, as politicians, point the way forward and <Col N="2127" /> show leadership.  That is already coming through very decisively from this side of the House under the new Taoiseach. Already there have been major steps forward in our relationships regarding the Northern Ireland problem.  It is the major economic difficulty and, therefore, politically it deserves the attention of the Taoiseach and the members of the Government responsible.  It is getting that attention and, hopefully, we are making some progress.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to my constituency, Government spending in it and developments and progress in the western part of county Dublin.  We hear a lot about cuts in Government spending but I am pleased to see that under the Government there is a great awareness by the respective Ministers of the needs to cater for our young people.  In the area of education there is a recognition of the need to continually invest in education.  The Taoiseach this morning referred to the tremendous potential we have in our young population.  We are investing in the region of £10 million in post-primary schools in my constituency and more investment is planned.  Recently there was a presentation to all Members representing the northern part of County Dublin by the National Institute of Higher Education in recognition of the tremendous investment there.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications sector is another area of tremendous importance. Development is taking place in that area and the Government accept, and realise, that they must continue to invest in those necessary key services.  I should also like to point out that Dublin County Council was granted a 19 per cent increase in real terms in the funds provided by the Minister for the Environment for the improvement of the infrastructure. We should not get carried away by the global comments about cutbacks. Selective restrictions on Government spending are necessary and will continue to be necessary but we must not forget the other progress that is being made.  In my constituency the IDA invested £15 million in job creation.  I am pleased to say that unemployment and <Col N="2128" /> job losses are not major difficulties in my constituency.  I am aware that those difficulties exist in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of energy, its potential and the need for restraint and productive use of energy.  The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies visited Bord na Móna some time ago and we got an idea of the tremendous potential of that fuel.  We were briefed on the investment by the Minister for Energy and on Government policy generally in that area.  There has been a complete shift of emphasis, a new awareness of the potential of the sources of energy we have.  It is crucial and vital that we should maximise those excellent resources.  It is good forward planning to leave the nuclear option to one side for the present.  The capital requirement, coupled with the technical difficulties that may be experienced, would not warrant or justify that type of investment on behalf of a country of our size.</P>
    <P>This Dáil term could be summed up by stating that tremendous progress has been made.  Tremendous difficulties have been experienced and difficulties will continue to arise.  Some of the rishest countries in the world are experiencing difficulties.  We cannot be isolated or insulated from the harsh realities of EEC policies and difficulties or American difficulties. We must realise now that we will experience more difficulties but we must approach them in a positive and constructive manner.  I hope we will do that and, as a united party, we will be in a position to deal with the challenges ahead.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach, in the course of his discussions with the executives of semi-State bodies, indicated the need to purchase Irish equipment and materials and, for those in the export sector, to promote the potential available.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably optimistic about our potential.  There are many young people looking to us to create a good future for them.  That is our challenge and it is also one of the rare expanding resources we have which many other countries are short of.  That is why we are attracting some of the largest international projects. <Col N="2129" /> I look forward to the remainder of 1980 as a period of consolidation when there will be a recognition by all concerned that we must find a better way of going forward.  The national understanding and the need for single figure increases is the major economic requirement needed to ensure continued development.</P>

      <P>On the third anniversary of the Fianna Fáil victory we are sliding even deeper into a summer of economic gloom and doom.  The manifesto of 1977 raised the expectations of Irish people to an unprecedented level and is having serious repercussions on our economy and our political system.  Young people, who were promised a lot in the manifesto thought the goods would be produced. Now that they have not been produced they are becoming very cynical about the whole political system, and I do not blame them.  What we at least expect in Irish politics is sincerity.  What young people most desire is sincerity and leadership.  They are not getting that. Therefore, I believe our democracy is being placed in jeopardy.  That is a sad day for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2130" /> In the Fianna Fáil prescription for recovery, contained in the manifesto, we were told that they would campaign to raise employment and output and to lower costs and prices.  On both counts Fianna Fáil have failed dramatically. Unemployment at present stands at a registered figure of 97,400.  The right to work is a basic human right but it is denied to 97,400 people at present and it will probably be denied to an increased number before the end of the year.  Projected figures show that unemployment will reach 105,000 by the end of the year. When Fianna Fáil took office in 1977 they promised us full employment within five years.  Deputy Martin O'Donoghue told us that to create employment they would, if necessary, get people to dig the pot holes and fill them again.  We now have unemployment and the potholes are an utter disgrace throughout the country, as all Members are aware.  That is disastrous for the country because we will be faced once again with the problem of emigration to England and America.  Young people, through pressure, will be forced to leave the country.  Looking back on our history we can see that when young people went to England and America they found employment but at present there is not any door open in those countries for employment. What do they do?  They become outcasts in society because the nation to which they belong cannot provide them with the jobs that they need and have a right to.</P>
    <P>I said here in my maiden speech last January that the young people this year would suffer severe job losses because then there was a cut-back in the youth experience programme, in the temporary employment programme and in the temporary maintenance scheme.  It was obvious then too that there would be closures of factories and this would lead to heavy redundancies.  I asked the Taoiseach that day could he or could he not provide the jobs.  I could have answered the question myself.  It was obvious that he could not.  This year we are faced now, in June, with 50,000 young <Col N="2131" /> people entering the work force.  Where are they going to get jobs?  They find themselves in a catch 22 situation.  They cannot get a job because they have not got the experience and they cannot get experience because they have not got a job.  Surely this is not justice.</P>
    <P>In relation to rising prices this is the biggest joke of all because when the Coalition were in power they were bashed day in and day out with rising prices.  They could not control them. They admitted it.  Justin Keating took the brunt of the brush and as a result he lost his seat.  But I am sure he is quite happy because he did a fantastic job. Deputy O'Malley came out daily in criticism of the then Minister for prices, Deputy Justin Keating.  Now we have Mr. O'Malley sitting over there as Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and arrogantly signing daily applications for increased prices.  But the worst increase of all is in basic foodstuffs. The price of bread, milk and butter has gone out of all proportion.  This hits hardest at the less well off and at the elderly.  The elderly in our society are getting a raw deal from the likes of us.  I grant that in the budget there was a 25 per cent increase in all social welfare payments.  It seemed nice but with inflation now running at 20 per cent what good is it?  What good is a 5 per cent increase with the price of electricity jumping every other day and the price of coal jumping every second day?  What can they expect?  Surely they are entitled to a fire and a little bit of heat after giving their lives to the service of the nation. This morning the Taoiseach said, as he says in every speech, that he is committed to the underprivileged in our society. It is grand to say it; lip service is grand. But how committed is he?  How committed are Fianna Fáil to eliminating these injustices.  There was only one thing the Taoiseach did which was not constructive; it was destructive, as far as I saw it to the less well off in our society.  In the budget he reduced the funds for the combat poverty scheme by 25 per cent.  Did he do anything else to relieve the plight <Col N="2132" /> of the underprivileged in our society? Not since I came into the Dáil anyway. Surely he could set up a bureau to combat loneliness.  Loneliness is one of the greater problems in our society but it is a sad fact of life that the social welfare class have not got the political muscle and they have not got the political voice needed to express their opinions and I can assure the Taoiseach that if they had they would not be in the plight they are in today.</P>
    <P>I have been through the education system recently and I can appreciate how rotten the system is.  But even in the manifesto Fianna Fáil promised a few things to the people involved in the education system.  They said that they would set out in a white paper the lines for future educational development in Ireland.  That white paper has been promised and re-promised and now it is supposed to come in September.  But like all promises, is this just another hoodwinking session?  To the Minister for Education I would like to say that if he is bringing out a white paper on education there are lots of constructive things to which he could open his mind. There is no doubt but that our education system is too academically orientated. The exam pressure that 50,000 people had to endure this year was uncalled for, especially when they have no hope whatsoever of getting a job.  What is it all for? I would also suggest to the Minister that perhaps he should do away with the points system and gear the educational system towards the masses.  Only 17 per cent of secondary school children enter higher education but the whole system of education is geared towards this 17 per cent.  There are many areas which could be developed in education.  However, I will admit that if we were to do all the things we would like to do in education we could spend the money of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister did promise to the national school sector that he would reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools as a top priority particularly in disadvantaged areas.  Three years later the Minister has only to come down to Fermoy and I will show him at least 10 classrooms <Col N="2133" /> with still over 40 pupils per teacher.  This is the sad reality.  The Minister also said he would guarantee funds to voluntary schools in the post-primary sector generally.  Why then was I, just three weeks ago, called to a meeting of secondary voluntary Catholic schools which were very upset and disappointed because they were not getting adequate capitation grants.  Surely this is a failure.  Surely the people who are running schools voluntarily deserve cooperation from the Minister.  But this does not seem to be happening.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing, as a young person I can see the plight of the young people daily.  The bridging finances which they are paying for are crippling them and will cripple them forever more.  Surely the Taoiseach could intervene and do something for the thousands of young people who will have this on their minds for the rest of their lives.  If bridging finance was not running at 18 per cent there would be some chance for these people.  Why not take the young people alone and give them some reduction in interest rates for the purpose of building houses.</P>
    <P>To come back to the manifesto, of course, that £1,000 grant which was promised to first-time house purchasers is a joke.  It was not stated in the manifesto that the people who applied for this grant would have to wait from six months to three years to get it and pay for bridging loans on top of it.  Every week I am up here I ring the Department of the Environment to see what is happening to the £1,000 grant for some young couple.  I would not do it except that I know the young people are in dire need of the money and the money is not being paid out.  Surely the £1,000 that they are entitled to would not be any great loss to the Department but it would mean a lot to the young people who are waiting for it.  Another serious inadequacy in our county council loan system is that people under 21 are not entitled to get a county council loan.  At 18 people are entitled to a vote; they are entitled to become a member of the Government of <Col N="2134" /> the country; they are entitled to get married.  But they are not considered mature enough to get a loan even though they can repay it.  This is an injustice in our system and it will have to be rectified in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In the six months I have been here the area I am most disappointed with, and the area of greatest failure of the Government, is the area of law reform. Granted, economically speaking, we are in hard times but surely it would not cost much to reform the law?  Everybody except, sadly, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government, is concerned these days with law reform.  Deputy Keating's Bill on criminal conversation introduced in the Dáil last February was turned down because Fianna Fáil have too much of a majority, which is bad for this country.  Why would the Government not accept this Bill?  The Minister said then that the Law Reform Commission would produce a report.  We are waiting since 1978 for that report which has not come yet.  The people who suffer under this criminal conversation legislation must bear the brunt.  It does not matter if we have a three and a half months' summer Recess&mdash;these people must continue to suffer</P>
    <P>Again in the Seanad the week before last, Senator Hussey's Bill on rape was rejected by the Government who said that they would produce a Bill on rape. They said, 14 months ago, in the Seanad that they would do this as an urgent matter and we are still waiting.  I am informing the Minister for Justice in time, in case he feels that he has not been notified, that Young Fine Gael are at present mounting a campaign to abolish the legal status of illegitimacy.  It is seven months under way now and we have received numerous signatures throughout the length and breadth of Ireland including many young people. We shall be putting the Bill before the Dáil in autumn, so the Minister cannot say that he has not heard about it.  I trust the Minister will not say something ridiculous like &ldquo;We shall do it in a few months' time, or a year's time, or three or four years' time&rdquo;.  What we are trying, <Col N="2135" /> as young people, to do is to remove injustice in our society.  Leaving the law as it is is not doing that.  This legislation on criminal conversation, rape or illegitimacy might not affect any of us in this House, but we represent the views of the people.  That is our role as Dáil Deputies.  We do not represent ourselves. The Minister for Justice must be a little more concerned about those less fortunate than himself.</P>
    <P>We are facing a three-and-a-half months' long summer Recess.  In a sense I look forward to it and in another sense I dread to think what this country will be like in three and a half months' time, We had a long Christmas recess and the only result, as far as I could see, was a brief five-minute appearance of the Taoiseach on television delivering a speech telling all of us to tighten our belts, that industrial unrest was costing the country a lot of money.  We all know this.  The Taoiseach quoted figures for the first quarter of this year and Deputy Lawlor quoted some a few minutes ago for the first quarter of this year.  But they never quoted the figures for the second quarter, and there are four quarters in every year.</P>
    <P>It would be over-optimistic to expect industrial peace this year.  Coming after the long summer recess, I hope we shall get the leadership which we are looking for.  I felt that an open-minded Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach would lead this country.  He was entitled to, but the miracle worker has failed to perform and this is the general feeling of the public. Where are the goods?  What has happened to this country?  Is the farmer, the fisherman, the housewife satisfied?  I can tell you certainly that young people are not satisfied.  The only people satisfied are a few capitalists.  The social conscience of our people is not satisfied. Deputy Lawlor suggested a few constructive ideas.  Surely, as a Member of the Government party he can infiltrate his ideas into the policies of the Government?</P>
    <P>Agriculture is going through a very bad period, the worst I can remember in its history.  The confidence of the big <Col N="2136" /> farmer, the small farmer, or the in-between farmer is completely lacking. They are losing out financially and, literally, the bank managers are at their backdoors day and night, at least down in East Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>The farm modernisation plan which the Fianna Fáil manifesto promised to implement was implemented, but they never told the farmer that he would have to wait from six months to three years before receiving this grant and would have to pay interest on a bridging loan of 7 per cent on amounts ranging from £2,000 to £10,000.  What good is the farm modernisation grant of 40 per cent on land improvement, or 20 per cent on farm buildings?  The grant is eroded before the farmer receives it.  This is serious because many young farmers have expanded their business over the past few years but find themselves with the bank manager continually at their backdoor.</P>
      <P>It was a great PRO exercise for the Taoiseach to greet at Dublin Airport the Minister for Agriculture on his way back from Brussels with a 4 per cent increase in farm prices.  Irish farmers are receiving European prices but paying Irish costs.  We all know that the costs of agriculture have gone up by approximately 20 per cent in the last year. What good then is an increase of 4 per cent?</P>
      <P>I also feel great sympathy for the farmer with a PLV of between £40 and £60.  The average farmer has a wife and, perhaps, two children, which means that four are living out of that farm.  He has 40 acres of land and is paying £480 in rates.  After paying those rates on £4,000 his profits are marginal.  The PAYE man, on the other hand, on £4,000 salary is paying £280 in tax.  I am all in favour of a just and equitable system of taxation, which we are approaching but have not quite reached yet, but the poor farmer with 40 acres of land should not suffer at the hands of the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Lawlor said, the food processing industry is not half explored. Ireland could produce much more intensive industry in this area.  We have the goods, why not make use of them? There is a reluctance on somebody's part&mdash;and I take it that it must be on the Government's part&mdash;to be involved in this industry and to try to bring back some stability and confidence to the whole agricultural industry.  The Government have failed dramatically as regards agriculture, as regards the housewives, as regards the fishermen and as regards the worker.  The Government have failed most of the young people of this country.  If the Government go to the country in two year's time or in six months' time they should be a little more honest and should not try to hoodwink the people.  That will not work again, but if it does we will never again have a democracy.</P>

      <P>All the speeches today put the emphasis almost entirely on jobs.  Listening to the Opposition speakers one would think that they could cure all ills.  The hard reality is that every economy is facing the same problem. Every other economy dependent on oil is facing massive price increases.  On my way to Dublin in 1973 I could get enough petrol for £1.50.  Now it costs £10 for the same amount of petrol.  In these circumstances this is a time for real dedication and a commitment not just from the workers but from employers and politicians.  We must try to maintain our present work force.  This Government can be proud of their record since 1977 in the field of industrial development and in the field of job creation for our youth.  It is obvious throughout the <Col N="2138" /> country how well the money was spent in relation to job creation.</P>

      <P>Bad roads are part of the price we have to pay for progress. The bad weather we had over a number of years, particularly during the winter of 1979, did a lot of damage to the surface of our roads.  The fact remains that in County Monaghan we are getting an allocation this year which is four times greater than what we got in 1976 under the National Coalition Government. Comparisons can be drawn right across the board.</P>
      <P>Emphasis must be put on job creation. We could increase job production in the processing of agricultural products.  We should concentrate on agricultural based industries to generate employment.  At present we are importing massive quantities of agricultural machinery.  A lot of that is due to the grant aids available for group water schemes and so on, especially in the 12 western counties where there was a 30 per cent grant for the purchase of machinery.  This resulted in massive importation.  We should take a hard look at this area because most of the machinery imported could be manufactured here.  We have the workers and the skills and we should use them wisely.  More emphasis should be put on vocational education and training to ensure that we have a work force to work in that type of development.</P>
      <P>We will have to take a hard look at the overall development of agriculture. Over the last few years people have opted for milk production, beef production and grain production.  The returns from specialising in one particular line mean that farmers have stopped producing potatoes, grass seed, vegetables and so on.  We are now importing large quantities of grass seed, for which there is a big demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton is raising tonight the question of egg production.  In Monaghan this question requires urgent consideration.  Many farmers have spent massive amounts of money in developing egg production and pig production. These commodities are not now being produced by the small farmers but are being produced by large units.  After a lot of hard work these people find a great <Col N="2140" /> weakness in the marketing of these products.  Pig meat and eggs are not marketed as are our dairy products.</P>

    <Title>Estimates, 1980. - Adjournment Debate: Low-Cost Egg Imports.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to have to raise this matter at such a late hour at considerable inconvenience to the Chair and to the staff of the House.  I would not do so if it were not a matter of considerable importance.</P>
      <P>The position is that the level of imports of eggs to Ireland has risen dramatically.  In 1978 we imported approximately £350,000 worth of eggs; in 1979 this increased to almost £3 million, an eight-fold increase in value in the amount of eggs being imported.  This trend has continued in 1980.  In the first two months of 1980 the increase in value terms in imported eggs was 854 per cent higher than the amount imported in January and February of the previous year.  This has had dramatic effects on the industry here.  The number of layers decreased by 25 per cent in one year from 1978 to 1979 and this decline is continuing.  This is of considerable importance when one realises that there are 2,000 jobs at stake in our egg industry. If the growth in imports continues nothing is more certain than that those 2,000 jobs will be lost for good.  Already one quarter of the entire egg market here has been taken over by imports, and if the present rate of increase continues it will not be long before 50 per cent or perhaps a higher proportion of our egg market is taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most worrying fact is that many of the imported eggs are being marketed under brand names which appear to indicate origin in the South.  The name of the distributor with a southern Irish address appears on the package and an innocent purchaser would assume they were of southern Irish origin.  Only when <Col N="2141" /> one examines the code on the package can one know that these eggs are entirely imported so far as every aspect of added value is concerned.  If the first digit is 8 then the eggs originated in this State. If the first digit is 9 as is often the case with eggs marketed by companies and some co-ops in the south, that indicates that those egges are UK eggs.  This is happening on a very wide scale, and I believe our consumers are being deceived by the labels used in marketing these eggs and that there is a case for action to be taken to prevent this deception continuing under the Consumer Information Act.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture to take this matter up with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism so as to prevent this deception of the consumer.</P>
    <P>These imports are taking place because the eggs are being exported at less than the cost of production.  The purpose is to eliminate Irish egg producers so that in two or three years time when that purpose is accomplished the importing companies&mdash;in one case a very large multi-national firm with tentacles all over the western world&mdash;will be able to dominate the southern Irish market and charge whatever price it likes.  This is a classic tactic to eliminate a weak industry&mdash;to sell below cost for a limited period and once sufficient damage has been done to eliminate the competition you can then come in with your monopoly.</P>
    <P>The case of imports below costs is clearly a defiance of the principles laid down in the Treaty of Rome and in particular of Article 85 of the Treaty concerning fair competition.  I have no doubt that importing eggs below cost is unfair competition within the meaning of the Treaty.  Has the Minister taken up this matter with the Commission?  Has he lodged a formal complaint with the Commission with a view to action being taken?  Is he prepared to initiate a legal case in the court which decides on cases of breach of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome?  If the Minister has not done <Col N="2142" /> any of these things I charge him with failing to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I raised this question in the House two months ago and at that stage the only answer I could elicit was that the Minister was investigating the matter.  I was forced two months later to repeat the question.  This time he admitted there was something wrong, but that was only as a result of the previous prodding by myself and others.  On 4 June in reply to Question No. 31 the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>From the information available it seems clear that some importers of eggs are engaged in below-cost selling. The courses of action open to me to counter this situation are being examined.</P>
    <P>I raise the matter this evening to discover what is being done.  What are the courses of action that are being examined? Has the examination been completed in any case and has any action being taken?  On past performance I am not in any sense confident that action is being taken.</P>
    <P>One of the obvious ways of dealing with this matter under existing law is to refer the case of below cost selling, which is an aspect of unfair competition, to the Restrictive Practices Commission established under Irish law to deal with such cases.  I referred this matter to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices two months ago.  When I made enquiries recently I discovered to my surprise that I was the first person to have referred it to him apart from the National Egg Producers Co-Op which had been in touch with him before me.  I was particularly surprised that at no stage until I approached the Examiner of Restrictive Practices had the Department of Agriculture made any approach to the body charged specifically with the duty of investigating instances of unfair competition. This indicates evidence of dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister and the Department in not availing of all existing statutory powers to protect egg producers here, most important amongst them perhaps being the powers of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> Further evidence of the unfairness of the present spate of imports from Northern Ireland particularly is the fact that subsidies are available in Northern Ireland which are not available here.  To the best of my knowledge the egg industry in Northern Ireland has received substantial financial assistance from the UK Government.  As a result it has built itself up to a very strong situation in the market, a situation which has not obtained in the case of egg producers in the Republic.  Giving of national aid to a commodity such as eggs which are governed by Common Agricultural Policy is prohibited under EEC law and should have ceased in any part of the nine member states of the Community.  I challenge the Minister with responsibility to vindicate or deny the statements I am about to make, that in defiance of EEC rules the UK Government are continuing to give subsidies to egg producers in Northern Ireland.  I am reliably informed that a subsidy of 8.4p per dozen was given originally in Northern Ireland to egg producers there on the grounds that feed costs more in Northern Ireland than on what they describe as the mainland of the United Kingdom, and another subsidy is given to them in relation to eggs to cover the cost of sea transport between Northern Ireland and England, Scotland or Wales.</P>
    <P>I understand that it was thought by those concerned with this matter in the European Commission that the subsidies to Northern Ireland egg producers had ceased.  However, the information which I have obtained today suggests that in defiance of EEC rules these subsidies, which are entirely artificial State aid and contrary to the directives of the European Commission in this matter, are continued in Northern Ireland.  Not only are they importing eggs to this State at below cost but they are being substantially assisted in doing so by their Government.  This adds a further grievance on top of the one which exists already.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of proving the existence of below cost importation.  It is essential that dockets be obtained concerning <Col N="2144" /> the cost at which eggs are being sold and the cost at which they are being produced.  I am informed that our inspectorate governing the importation of eggs are insufficiently staffed at the moment to obtain all the information necessary to make a convincing case to the European Commission in this matter. Is the Minister of State satisfied that adequate inspectorate staff exist to obtain all of the information which is necessary to prove the case for the curtailment of those exports?  I believe it can be shown to the satisfaction of the authorities here that the UK authorities are engaging in illegal practices in subsidising egg production in Northern Ireland, which enables the producers there to gain a foothold in our market by means of below cost selling, which is unfair competition.  If already a breach of the rules is taking place in Northern Ireland our Government would be entitled, if not in legal terms certainly in moral terms, to also break the law and stop those imports taking place, even though this might technically constitute a breach of the Treaty of Rome if those imports are, by virtue of the State aid they are receiving, an incident of defiance of existing practices, which are laid down under the Treaty and by the various rules made under it by the European Commission, that State aid, which should not be given, is actually being given.  Our Government would be justified in taking retaliatory action to stop such imports.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to prove beyond doubt that such State aid is being given in Northern Ireland, but the Department should be in a position to satisfy themselves about this.  They should take whatever action is necessary to stop this situation developing.  If it continues for much longer I am convinced that there will be substantial redundancies in the egg industry here.  If that happens I do not believe the situation can be repaired, because the market will be penetrated once and for all, contacts and contracts will have been entered into and we will never be able to retrieve the situation which now exists.</P>
    <P>The case of the importation of eggs is <Col N="2145" /> only one incident of an alarming growth in the importation of food to our market. I believe this is the case in relation to vegetables, potatoes, poultry and meat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously a dangerous situation in relation to the importation of eggs.  I remind the Minister of State that his party promised in their election manifesto to establish a domestic food marketing council, whose concern would be the development of our market for Irish food producers.  It was said that this council would have a large staff of domestic economy instructors. That promise was made three years ago but nothing has happened to fulfil that specific promise made in black and white by the Government.  We are now seeing how serious this situation is as far as eggs are concerned.  It is only one instance of many.  If ever there was a time to adhere to the promise they made in relation to the establishment of such a council it is now.  I applaud them for thinking of the idea, which was a good one.  It was one of the best aspects of their manifesto but, unfortunately, it has not been implemented.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, with particular reference to the penetration of our market by imported eggs, to give a commitment that he will implement the establishment of this domestic marketing council.  That may take some time and, therefore, I believe the most urgent thing for the Minister to do is to take action to stop the continued importation of below cost eggs into our market, which is putting 2,000 jobs at risk.  If the Minister cannot get satisfaction from the EEC immediately, rather than next month or next year, he must show, in view of the evidence I have cited&mdash;I am not aware of any denial of this&mdash;or unfair competition, take immediate action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the egg industry here is under intense pressure. For a long time the major threat <Col N="2146" /> has been illegal imports from Northern Ireland.  Smuggling is a particularly difficult problem to resolve but every effort is being made to contain and eliminate it. Allegations about the low cost selling of eggs from Northern Ireland have been made.  Firm evidence is required if these allegations are to be proved.  At my invitation certain evidence has been produced by the National Egg Producers' Co-op.  This information, however, on its own is insufficient.</P>
      <P>I did get some further information. Since then, with the help of the Revenue Commissioners, my officials have been assembling and sifting additional data. The available evidence points to below cost selling on the part of some importers. In considering what action to take various factors have to be taken into account.  Recent developments on the Irish market cannot be viewed in isolation.  Since 1970 there has been a steady contraction in our laying flock, which now stands at about three million birds compared with 4.6 million birds ten years ago.  While increased productivity contributes to this contraction the decline in egg consumption has also been an important factor.  The decline in egg consumption is continuing and contributes to the current problem facing our egg industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that Ireland was not alone in experiencing difficulties in the egg trade over the last year or so.  Throughout the EEC 1979 was a crucial year for egg producers. There was an oversupply situation on the Community market and as member states tried to dispose of surplus supplies there was an increase in intra-Community trade.  The Northern Ireland egg industry, which exports 70 per cent of its production, was faced with increased competition on its traditional market, the UK mainland.  As a result of this the Northern Ireland producers increased their exports to our market and these exports accounted for 20 per cent of sales here during the latter part of 1979.  Free trade is a fundamental principle of the EEC and we cannot object to the increased volume of eggs imported <Col N="2147" /> from Northern Ireland so long as competition is fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a moment.  The low-cost selling of these imported eggs can be regarded as a direct consequence of the oversupply situation within the EEC.  However, I share Deputy Bruton's concern on this matter because the practice in question aggravates the problems confronting our egg industry.  In these circumstances I have lodged a formal complaint on the matter with the EEC Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>There are no discriminations practised against married women in the deciding of their claims for unemployment benefit.  Each claim is decided on its merits by a statutorily appointed deciding officer or appeals officer in the light of the relevant legislative conditions for entitlement and the particular circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislative conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit and other benefits will require certain amendments to comply with the EEC Directive of 19 December 1978 for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply of 24 April 1980, it is my intention to have the necessary measures for full compliance with the directive taken well in advance of the <Col N="1952" /> time-scale of six years which it lays down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is discrimination against young people in the social welfare system.  There are some differences in the conditions applying to young people which arise from the necessity to take account of their particular needs and circumstances as persons who have only recently entered the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>These young people are credited with a national insurance record for periods prior to the commencement of their employment which enables them to qualify for benefits such as unemployment benefit and disability benefit from an earlier date than they otherwise would.</P>
      <P>Special conditions also apply to persons under 23 years of age who claim dental or optical benefit.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, true that young people between the age of 16 and 18 years who have no dependants receive a lower rate of disability benefit or unemployment benefit than those over 18.  However, as people within this age group will rarely have reached their full earnings potential and would normally be paying a low pay-related social insurance contribution, I do not consider that this provision is unreasonable and I have no plans to alter it at present.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the value of the eel fisheries of the Erne catchment. Following the construction of the hydroelectric dam at Ballyshannon in 1950 provision was made for the installation of elver passes so as to safeguard these eel fisheries.  The elver passes did not operate very successfully and since 1959 arrangements have been made for the transplanting of elvers from below the dam to other waters within the catchment. These transplantings have been of benefit mostly to Northern Ireland fishermen operating on Upper and Lower Lough Erne but a proportion of the elvers migrate to the smaller lakes in <Col N="1955" /> the upper reaches of the system within the Republic.  The latter waters have now been identified as being highly suitable for eel production and have been selected for restocking as soon as possible.</P>

In addition, in the case of Córas Iompair Éireann and Aer Lingus, in accordance with the terms of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, it is expected that, following elections held under regulations to be made by the Minister for Labour, worker directors will be available in November 1980 for appointment to the boards of these companies.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he will state in relation to reform of the public service the progress made to date in his Department; and his further plans in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main recommendations of the Public Services Organisation Review Group, which reported in 1969, was that there should be a separation of policy and execution in Government Departments.  The review group recommended that the aireacht, which would be the central core of the Department grouped around the Minister, would have responsibility for policy formulation and general direction and control <Col N="1964" /> and that executive units would execute policy.</P>
      <P>A high proportion of the executive activity in the areas for which I have responsibility is discharged by State-sponsored bodies and harbour authorities.  Most of the executive functions undertaken by the Department are of a technical or regulatory nature and are discharged by units which are largely self contained.  The Department was, therefore, already structured on aireacht-executive unit lines to a large extent. Staff support units for planning, finance, personnel and organisation assist senior management in the formulation and review of policies.  In addition a Management Advisory Committee advises the Secretary of the Department in evaluation of alternative policy options and in the formulation of proposals for submission to me.</P>
      <P>An executive office embracing the technical aviation services of the Department has been established.  This office incorporates the executive functions formerly discharged by the five technical aviation services in the Department and has a large degree of independence in its day-to-day operations.  Because of the specialised nature of its activities, the Meteorological Service also has a large degree of independence in its day-to-day operations and for many years has operated largely as an Executive Office.</P>
      <P>Personnel development aspects inherent in the reform of the public service are receiving on-going attention in my Department.</P>
      <P>Consideration will be given in due course to the question of the establishment of an executive office in the marine area of the Department.  The effectiveness of the aireacht and executive areas of the Department will continue to be kept under review and further improvements will be made as necessary in the light of experience.</P>

      <P>Arrangements of the kind referred to by the Deputy are clearly matters which fall within the day-to-day management and competence of the boards of State bodies concerned.

Ten of these were against licensees and nine were against customers.  None of the summonses was withdrawn but three were not served within the required period and expired. The reason for this was that further Garda investigations in the cases had not been completed.  In all three cases new summonses were issued and they have since been served.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the provisions of section 29 of the Finance Bill, 1980, which was passed by Dáil Éireann on 12 June 1980.  Section 29 provides that where a wife owns farm land in her own right and either occupies it herself to the exclusion of her husband or lets it to a third party at a commercial rent, that farm land will not be deemed to be occupied by her husband.  Accordingly, farm land so owned or occupied by the husband and the wife will be treated separately and not combined for the purposes of either income tax or resource tax.  If the case mentioned by the Deputy falls into this category, liability either to income tax or to resource tax will not arise since the rateable valuation of the farm land owned or occupied by each spouse is less than £40.</P>
      <P>If, however, the two parcels of land are owned or occupied jointly, each spouse would be regarded as occupying farm land exceeding the £40 threshold for income tax purposes.  Income tax would then be charged in respect of the farming profits accruing to each spouse.</P>
      <P>If the combined rateable valuations are £70 or more, a liability to resource tax on the combined figure will follow, subject to marginal relief if this is £79 or less.</P>

      <P>The superannuation of officers employed in psychiatric hospitals is governed by the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts, 1956 and 1980, and can, depending on options exercised by the officer in the past, be affected by other enactments including the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945-1961, and by the Superannuation Revision Scheme, 1977. Under the legislation the determination of superannuation awards is a matter for the employing authority in the first instance, officers aggrieved by the failure of an authority to make an award or by the amount of such award having a right of appeal to me.</P>

      <P>On 28 April 1980 I was notified by the companies under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, of their intention to dismiss 48 of their work force of 76.  The reasons indicated for the dismissals were losses which had reached substantial proportions in 1979 and industrial relations problems which they had been unable to resolve and which had aggravated the scale of the losses.</P>
      <P>Prior to giving me notice under the Act, the company on 8 April 1980 suspended the clerical staff who were engaged in unofficial industrial action. On 2 May 1980, at the request of the company and the trade union concerned&mdash;which had made the dispute official following the action against the clerical staff&mdash;a conciliation conference was held under the chairmanship of an industrial relations officer of the Labour Court to discuss the question of redundancy and severance terms.  It was not found possible to reach a mutually acceptable solution and in the absence of agreement from both parties the matter could not be referred to the Labour Court proper for investigation.  There has not been any indication from both sides that a further conciliation conference would be helpful as yet.</P>
      <P>I understand that appeals in respect of 31 employees of the company are at present before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  These appeals have been made under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 1979 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  The hearing of these appeals commenced on Friday, 20 June 1980 and will be continued on Wednesday, 25 June 1980.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit on 15 June 1979 in respect of an accident at work on 29 March 1979.  Following inquiries regarding the circumstances of the accident it has been established that the incapacity was caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.  He is accordingly entitled to injury benefit for the period of incapacity up to the expiration of 26 weeks from the date of the accident and to disability benefit thereafter.</P>
      <P>He had however already been paid disability benefit since April 1979 on an interim basis pending the determination of his entitlement to injury benefit.  Payment of this benefit, together with pay-related benefit, was issued regularly on the receipt of medical evidence up to 18 June 1980, the date of the latest medical certificate received.  A cheque in payment of arrears of injury benefit less the amount of disability benefit already paid issued to him on 24 June 1980.</P>
      <P>As regards medical care the claimant stated on his injury benefit claim form that he wished to claim the cost of medical expenses.  An explanatory leaflet on the medical care scheme and a claim form were issued to him.  On receipt of the completed claim form his entitlement to the cost of medical care will be determined and he will be notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>The commencement of the audit depends not only on the availability of the books of accounts but also on the availability of draft accounts and the necessary supporting schedules. Draft accounts and schedules in relation to the 1978 accounts of Bord Iascaigh Mhara were made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General in September 1979.  The final accounts were agreed with the board's officers on 4 December 1979.  Accounts signed by the board were received by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 18 December 1979.</P>

      <P>In general the facilities available at the three State airports for persons using wheelchairs are satisfactory and include ramps and automatic doors.  Interior lifts are also available except at Cork Airport but it is hoped to remedy this situation as soon as possible. The main CIE public buildings are also accessible to persons using wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>I understand that some difficulties arise in relation to the car ferry terminals at Dublin and Cork which do not have ramps.  Persons using wheelchairs are lifted with their wheelchairs up the stairs in each location by B and I staff, wheeled onto the car ferries and lifted, if necessary, to the cabin accommodation. Alternative access to the B and I vessels can be gained through the car deck where there is a lift available for the use of disabled passengers.  Provision for a ramp has been made in the new car ferry terminal which is being constructed at Cork and I am asking the Dublin Port and Docks board to examine the situation at Dublin to see whether improved access can be provided.</P>
