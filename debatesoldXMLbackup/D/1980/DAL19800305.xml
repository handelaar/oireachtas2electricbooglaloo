      <P>The background to the budget was one of inflation gone mad, a credit squeeze and a cut-back in various sectors of Government spending, particularly in relation to local <Col N="1300" /> authorities.  Fianna Fáil when dealing with local authorities remind me of the farmer who after spending two-and-a-half years drinking in the pub blames his workmen when he goes broke.  Yesterday we heard the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry blaming the Kildare county manager for not being able to manage in spite of the restrictions imposed on him. I have not always agreed with the manager but I have always found him to be efficient.  If he told the truth I am sure he would be telling us that he will find it impossible to manage on the increase allowed in the estimate for that county.</P>
      <P>Prior to the budget we were informed that the Estimate for the Department of Health would be seriously cut back.  We are now aware that there will be fewer hospitals but all the gimmicks and programmes for helping people to give up smoking and keep fit will continue. Those programmes have been in operation for some time and are not a substitute for a proper health policy.  It appears that patients in certain hospitals have been receiving inferior treatment because of overcrowding and a shortage of nurses.  We were promised a number of health centres in my constituency but because of the cutbacks they will not be provided this year.  The new guidelines for medical cards, which are linked to the CPI, will also mean that fewer people will qualify for those cards.  Those guidelines should be reviewed at least monthly.  Since the new guidelines were announced in January there has been a serious increase in the cost of food.  The price of a loaf of bread was increased by 5p.  I should like to remind the Government that under the previous administration those guidelines were reviewed in the middle of the year.</P>

      <P>It is farcical to think that the guidelines introduced in January will apply for one year because we all know that inflation will reach 20 per cent at the end of 1980.  Due to Government action we can expect all commodities to increase in price.  It is hard to expect hauliers who must use diesel and petrol to distribute goods to carry the cost of the increase in the cost of those commodities.  Consequently, the consumer must suffer.</P>
      <P>There was also a serious cut-back in the Estimate for the Department of Education although that was not mentioned in the budget.  In my view that will mean fewer schools being built and those who are expecting prefabs to be replaced will have to wait a while longer.  There will be no improvement for those who must attend class in overcrowded classrooms.  In my view boards of management will be at their wits end trying to get money to run schools and heat them.  We can expect a return to the system that operated many years ago when parents were asked to contribute to the cost of running schools.  We have been told that secondary education is free but I have no doubt that parents of children attending those schools will have to contribute to the cost of running them.  The school bus service which has proved of great benefit to those who live a long distance from school will also suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other increases and cut-backs in services will not come to light for some time, such as the increase in the cost of transport and postal and telephone charges.  The budget also attacks <Col N="1302" /> the younger generation in that the Minister has decided to increase the tax on discos.  Those organisations, such as the political parties, who collect funds through local dances will also be hit by that tax.  The unfortunate part about that tax is that disco-going is the only alternative our young people have to going to the public house or attending dances in hotels where drink is available.  The young people are being driven back to those places.  The hotels will be able to afford to pay the tax but rural organisations, and branches of political parties, will find it difficult to meet that tax.</P>
    <P>There was also a cut-back in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture which will mean a reduction in services for farmers.  At this stage I should like to refer to a document issued by Fianna Fáil election workers in Kildare in 1977. At that time Fianna Fáil were galloping to power behind Jack Lynch.  I wonder what policies would be produced today. According to that document the people of Kildare who must use their cars to get to work, were badly treated by the Coalition. They were told that Fianna Fáil would remove road tax and would offer motorists a better deal.  Those who must use cars to get to work are aware of what that better deal has meant to them. The document described certain people in the National Coalition who increased the tax on petrol as Arabs, but I should like to know the description for those in Fianna Fáil who were responsible for the increase of 22p last week.  We have heard remarks about the increase of 15p imposed by the Coalition Government. Deputies have stated that the Coalition imposed a greater percentage increase, but percentage increases do not mean much to motorists who are asked to pay an extra 22p per gallon.  If Fianna Fáil maintained that the imposition of an extra 15p per gallon on petrol was the act of an Arab, they should have removed that increase when they came to power.</P>
    <P>The document produced in Kildare also states that under Fianna Fáil more schools would be built in the county, more teachers appointed and the pupil-teacher ratio would be reduced.  The cutbacks <Col N="1303" /> in the Estimate for the Department of Education have meant that those promises will not be fulfilled.  The people of Kildare do not remember those promises because they did not take them to heart.  They also promised more gardai on the beat.  I should now like to come to the gem of all promises.  The document told the people of Kildare that under Fianna Fáil there would be a high investment in services and roads to restart development.  We are all aware that we are the laughing stock of the country because of the condition of the roads in that county.  At one time we could boast the best roads in the country. We are all aware of the competition that is in progress to find out what part of the county has the biggest potholes. We are a laughing-stock on television and radio.  The potholes in Kildare are so big a Fianna Fáil TD suggested holding a convention in one of them.  So much for the high investment in services and roads promised by Fianna Fáil to the people of Kildare when they were looking for votes.  That is the background we much consider when we are discussing the budget.</P>
    <P>I welcome the necessary increases given under this budget.  I do not intend to criticise any of them because they are reasonably good but there are social welfare areas which Fianna Fáil neglected through the years.  When Lloyd George, or whoever was responsible, introduced the old age pension in 1905 the qualifying age was 70 years.  When Fianna Fáil left office in 1973 it was still 70 years.  That was progress.  During the term of the Coalition Government the qualifying age for the old age pension was progressively reduced for four years and it was 66 years when they left office. This is the third Fianna Fáil budget and they have not yet reduced that age.  In all European countries, except Ireland, the qualifying age is 65 years.  Fianna Fáil deliberately neglected this area because the Coalition set the headlines in it when they were in office.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil rightly claim that they passed the legislation which made the pay-related scheme possible, it was <Col N="1304" /> the National Coalition who implemented it.  We are still waiting for the promised pension scheme and for any form of social welfare benefits for the self-employed. In my constituency there are several self-employed people who are only getting a week's wage out of their businesses.  If they get sick they can be in very serious financial trouble.  Over the years we have been told that social welfare benefit and a pension scheme, to which they would contribute, would be introduced, but so far no move has been made by Fianna Fáil.  In my view they do not have any right to be proud of the progress they made in the social welfare area.  I am a little disappointed that progress is not being made in regard to social welfare contributions for the self-employed and there is no credit to Fianna Fáil in saying that.  Perhaps that scheme has been shelved, like many other schemes at county council level, until more money is available.</P>
    <P>The people have a right to expect health services.  At present nobody seems to know who is entitled to hospitalisation under the health scheme, and that includes health board officials.  Some people say anybody under £7,000 is entitled to free hospitalisation and others say people are entitled to free beds, but they have to pay consultants and surgeons and they can reclaim that money from the Government.  I do not understand the system myself.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Health on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone earning up to £7,000 a year is entitled to total free hospitalisation, including consultants' fees.  A person earning over £7,000 a year is entitled to free stay in hospital but pays consultants' fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there something about the consultants not operating that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position is that people earning between £5,500 and £7,000 pay consultants' fees and get a refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for explaining the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1305" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the Minister for Health write to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Health board officials are not carrying out that scheme. They are telling people earning over £5,500 a year that they will have to pay their hospital bills.  They are also refusing to give free benefits under the maternity scheme.  Perhaps they are trying to save money.</P>
      <P>The free fuel scheme is being administered by the health boards for the Department.  In Kildare we had a scheme dating back to the time the county council operated it which allowed a supplementary benefit of £1 a week to old age pensioners living alone.  This continued at a reduced rate under the health board.  Now it is being removed because £1.50 for fuel is being provided.  This is a Victorian attitude and I would like to hear that it has not the approval of the Department.  This penny pinching affects a section of society least able to bear it.  No matter what the Taoiseach or the Minister says people do not understand the scheme.</P>
      <P>To sum up, the imposition of 20p on a gallon of petrol and diesel oil will have repercussions and will cause serious inflation over the next six or 12 months. The impact of the 2p increase on petrol and the corresponding increase on diesel and other oils has not yet been felt, but the two increases will have a serious effect on the cost of living.  They will lead to unrest among the workers and will make it very difficult to achieve the implementation of a second national wage agreement.</P>
      <P>I am happy about the social welfare increases but I had expected that some of the extensions in social welfare benefits we had hoped for would be implemented. For example, an extension of the scheme to include the self-employed is vitally necessary because, as I said, some of these people are barely getting a week's wage out of their businesses and are unable to provide for the time when they might have long periods of illness, including hospitalisation and loss of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> This budget is undesirable from the point of view that it will increase the cost of living substantially and that it will create unemployment in many fields because of credit squeezes.  I know many small firms that have been rendered unable to carry stocks because of the credit squeeze and because of the new higher taxation, all necessary because of the Government's squandermania in the last two-and-a-half years, from which the Taoiseach is now trying to dissociate himself as far as possible. The Minister for the Environment is now here and I should like to draw to his attention the restrictions on local authorities because of the lack of Government financing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget which the Minister for Finance introduced last week is specifically directed towards clear objectives which will contribute to economic development and social justice.  It is designed to bring order and balance into our public finances, to divert a significant share of the national income to the less well-off section of our community, and to promote work and enterprise by a substantial reduction in the disincentive impact of personal taxation.</P>
      <P>As a community we must work our way out of our present difficulties.  This budget, because it is fair and can be seen to be fair, creates the right climate for the universal effort needed throughout the community to enable us to succeed in doing that.  It reflects the determination of the Government to set about their economic, social and political tasks in a planned, consistent and energetic manner.</P>
      <P>Whatever other criticisms may be levelled against the budget, I believe it must be admitted that it is positive in its approach and that it faces up to our current problems.  Individual Deputies may have doubts about the particular approach to some particular situation but they must, I believe, agree that we have moved in on the problem areas with the clear intention of dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> In settling the budget proposals, the Minister for Finance had to face a number of demanding requirements, some of which tended to pull in different directions. His task was to endeavour to reconcile these conflicting elements and to fit them into an overall coherent strategy.</P>
    <P>This was a formidable task.  The combination of factors confronting the Minister for Finance this year was perhaps the most difficult that any Minister has had to face in this country in modern times.  In these circumstances, the budget he presented represents a major achievement in fiscal and economic management.</P>
    <P>The Minister had to frame a budget which would start the process of getting the public finances back into a reasonable balance; would not be deflationary in its impact; would in securing the degree of retrenchment needed in public expenditure do so without detriment to investment, growth and employment; would very positively and in a practical way protect the position of the poorer sections of our community from the effects of inflation; and would make our tax system more equitable by substantially reducing the burden of direct taxation on the great majority of employed pensions.  I believe that we have succeeded in meeting this difficult combination of objectives.</P>
    <P>During the past year our public finances had got seriously out of line, due to a combination of external inflationary pressures, a deteriorating world economy, an insistent demand at home for better services and higher incomes and some specific but, we hope, non-recurring setbacks.</P>
    <P>These elements combined to raise Exchequer borrowing to a level which cannot be sustained without doing permanent damage to the economy and to our currency.  Exchequer borrowing as a proportion of GNP over recent years has been as follows: 1975, 16.3 per cent; 1976, 11.2 per cent; 1977, 10.2 per cent; 1978, 12.8 per cent; 1979, 13.7 per cent. As a result of all this the national debt at the end of 1979 was £6.300 million, <Col N="1308" /> which is equivalent to about 86 per cent of gross national product in that year. The cost of servicing this debt is £666 million which is more than the annual Exchequer investment expenditure just three years ago.</P>
    <P>Some of this borrowing was for excellent purposes but some of it was used simply to meet the deficits on our current budgets.  We have now had deficit budgeting for more than ten years.  In the past five years alone, borrowing to meet these deficits has come to almost £1.6 billion.</P>
    <P>A budget deficit can be a perfectly legitimate piece of economic management to meet a particular economic situation.  In our circumstances, however, nobody can argue that it is wise to continue to engage in deficit budgeting year after year when these deficits are contributing to our inflation and to our balance of payments difficulties.</P>
    <P>It should be clearly understood that budget deficits are not just a matter for the year in which they occur.  They do not disappear.  They remain permanently in our national accounts, in the form of the taxation needed to finance them.</P>
    <P>A principal aim of this budget was to start the process of reducing the annual budget deficit as the most important contribution we can make to keeping the limit of overall borrowing at an acceptable level.  There can be no argument about this being the right thing to do. This year we are bringing the budget deficit down from £520 million to £340 million, from 7.1 per cent to 4.1 per cent of GNP.  In the difficult circumstances of this year this represents a major achievement and a significant advance along the right road.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments will require continuing attention.  Two new factors of very considerable significance have arisen in recent times.  One is the dramatic and unprecedented increase in the price of the oil we must import.  The second is our membership of the EMS and the consequent break of the traditional link with sterling.</P>
    <P>As an open developing economy we <Col N="1309" /> cannot have a restrictive doctrinaire approach to our balance of payments. Because we must import the machinery and equipment needed for agricultural and industrial development and the raw materials necessary for both agriculture and industry, we have to take a more flexible line than that open to more selfcontained economies.  The achievement of a simple text-book balance is not for us an end in itself.</P>
    <P>The lines along which our policy should be treated are reasonably clear. The deficit for 1979 was too high and the fall of £277 million in our external reserves is a cause of anxiety.  Our policy and action must be directed towards reducing our deficit on external account, protecting the level of import cover provided by our external reserves and ensuring a stable exchange rate for the Irish pound within the European Monetary System.  The tax increases announced in the budget will directly contribute to reducing our total import bill by their disincentive effect on the purchase of major items like oil, motor cars and consumer durables.  The reduction in Exchequer borrowing and in the deficit of the current budget will also make a major contribution.  Further measures towards improving our general balance of trade will receive increasing attention throughout the year.  For instance, undoubtedly more can be achieved in the field of energy conservation, more can be achieved in the area of import substitution and certainly more can be achieved by a more determined effort in finding and exploiting new markets.</P>
    <P>We have to achieve an improvement in our trade balance against a difficult world background.  The general world outlook is far from encouraging and the January trade figures suggest that there is no automatic improvement of a cyclical nature taking place as yet.  The encouraging feature of the deficit in that month&mdash;a significant increase in imports of materials for further production&mdash;is matched by a significant increase also in the import of consumer goods.  There were worthwhile increases in agricultural <Col N="1310" /> and industrial exports but the whole picture continues to be dominated by the higher cost of oil imports.</P>
    <P>Growth in our largest single market, the United Kingdom, is forecast not to rise this year, not to remain static but to fall by an amount of 2 per cent.  Recession, mild or otherwise, is also expected in the United States.  Growth in the EEC was forecast some time ago to be 2 per cent in 1980.  It is now recognised that that suggestion of a 2 per cent growth was perhaps more than optimistic.</P>
    <P>I know the Government have widespread support and goodwill for the high priority they give to good industrial relations.  While direct responsibility for industrial relations rests with the social partners, the Government have their responsibility, too, and intend to continue their efforts to ensure the best possible structures to facilitate the straightening out of difficulties.  As an employer the Government will continue to improve their record and ensure that their employees can share along with the rest of the community the fruits of economic progress.  Claims, grievances, anomalies, all of these must be dealt with in a manner that will avoid disruption of services and particularly the disruption of essential services which have a major impact on the welfare and convenience of the general public.</P>
    <P>We are taking measures to support industrial peace because industrial peace can contribute greatly to another major objective not only of Government but of employers, workers and indeed of every man, woman and child in Ireland today. That objective, of course, is full employment. Our commitment to the objective of full employment is total and constant. The changes in the taxation system are designed with this in mind.  They are intended to ensure that effort is rewarded, that incentives operate for work, risk and investment and that expansion is soundly based on individual skill and commitment.</P>
    <P>Employment must be soundly based in sectors producing goods or providing services within the capacity of the country <Col N="1311" /> to pay for them.  The important thing is to build up the productive capacity of our economy and the infrastructure we need to operate on a competitive basis with the rest of the world.  These types of activities create jobs that are durable and lasting.  The term job creation has come to mean different things to different people. Unfortunately, for some it has the undesirable overtones of permanent subsidisation or artificial support.</P>
    <P>As part of a policy to stimulate recovery from a recession, or as part of an attack on youth unemployment, there may be a useful role for temporary measures of subsidisation or support. However, if these measures are unduly prolonged or are extended wastefully they become self-defeating.  There is no real advantage in simply adding persons on to the public payroll, particularly if the expenditure has to be financed by borrowing.  Often money taken in that way means only that the new employment takes the place of other employment, when there is in fact no net increase in the numbers at work.  Our overriding principle is the provision, directly or through incentives, of viable and permanent work for all those who require it.</P>
    <P>The budget itself and the volume of the Public Capital Programme are designed specifically and directly to that end.  Expenditure on the programme this year will be £1,154 million, an increase of over £150 million on last year's outturn.</P>
    <P>We have increased by 22 per cent the allocation for the Industrial Development Authority.  We have increased by 28 per cent the amount provided for telecommunications development and we have increased by 44 per cent the investment programme of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about the state of our roads.  I think most of us would agree that these are justified.  We recognise that, following the severe winter of 1978-79 and the wet weather of recent months, there has been an exceptional deterioration in road surfaces.  The Minister for the Environment is arranging that there will be a much greater <Col N="1312" /> emphasis on essential repair work while, at the same time, carrying forward vigorously the programme of development of our national roads.  The Minister will be dealing further with this matter in his contribution later in this debate.  The capital allocation for road construction and improvement works has been increased by over 45 per cent in two years.</P>
    <P>Although our emphasis is on infrastructural and productive investment there will also be a continuing high level of social investment.  Housing will receive an extra £23 million in 1980, bringing the total to £183 million.  This is additional to the hundreds of millions which will flow in the normal course through the banks, building societies and insurance companies in this year and which we intend to facilitate.  Investment in schools and hospitals will be about £77 million.  Of course, a great deal of that goes into building and construction work.</P>
    <P>I want to say clearly and emphatically now that, despite the unwarranted element of criticism from some quarters, these allocations for productive, infrastructural and social investment are sufficient to maintain existing services at satisfactory levels.  There will not be any disruptions, closures or anything of that sort.  Indeed we have handled the Public Capital Programme this year with great care.  We have gone through it in detail, item by item.  We have endeavoured to maintain the total within an acceptable limit while at the same time ensuring that, in each case, adequate resources are provided to enable us to carry on as we are, and that social and economic progress is maintained.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal for a commonsense approach by the different interest groups affected by the capital expenditure allocations in this budget.  I am asking for responsibility all round.  If some particular project, eminently desirable though it may be, cannot begin this year, that need not be the end of the story. There is no need for the project to be abandoned entirely.  Is it unreasonable for the Government to ask that some particular project or projects, which cannot <Col N="1313" /> be accommodated within the limits proposed for this year, be postponed until next year?</P>
    <P>Institutions, agencies, groups and organisations must now play their part in settling priorities and in arranging their programmes of activity so that the allocations put forward in the budget and in the Public Capital Programme for the different areas can be adhered to. What is needed in our circumstances is an endeavour to achieve our economic and social objectives more skilfully and effectively.  In many areas we need better administration and better direction rather than more expenditure. Programmes must be aligned directly on their targets and all duplication and overlapping must be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing us in this area of public capital expenditure is a stimulating one.  The constraints required by good financial management must be adhered to.  At the same time capital needed to promote social and economic development must be raised economically and expended effectively. This budget lays down the guidelines and we must now proceed within those guidelines to secure the best possible social and economic results.  That is, in our view, the right way to provide employment, viable, permanent employment based on investment and growth.</P>
    <P>There is a technological revolution taking place within Ireland today.  This means that if we are to attain the level and quality of employment we want we will need a well-educated and adaptable work force.  This, in turn, requires an effective manpower policy.  Industrial sectors experience difficulties from time to time in filling vacancies, especially for skilled workers and in particular parts of the country.  A significant increase in job creation can be achieved by more training, more flexibility in work practices and a better matching of job requirements to job expectations.  We intend to develop these programmes and in particular to concentrate on improving this matching process through the educational system and National Manpower Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> Taxation must not only contribute towards the creation of a climate where employment and investment can flourish but must be seen to be fair in its impact. The Government have responded in the budget wisely, generously and comprehensively to the dissatisfaction with the level of taxation imposed on the PAYE sector.  We have made this budget a landmark on the road to achieving equity in taxation.  The tax concessions, which will cost £220 million in a full year, are the greatest single effort ever made by any Government in this country to deal with inequity in the income tax system.</P>
    <P>Our approach has been to raise the tax exemption limits so that more lowincome people are exempt and to widen the income bands so that most taxpayers will pay tax at lower rates.  Single persons with taxable incomes of less than £1,700 and married persons with less than £3,400 will now be totally exempt from income tax.  The incomes at which higher rates of tax are paid have been significantly raised.  Some 180,000 persons who would have paid tax at rates above 35 per cent will now pay it at a maximum of 35 per cent.  There is no doubt but that the introduction of income splitting for married taxpayers is the feature of the budget which will be looked upon by many as the most significant change in income taxation for many years.</P>
    <P>This of course goes further than the recent Supreme Court judgment which related only to married couples with two incomes.  The effect of the budget proposal is that all married persons with the same income will pay the same tax whether they have one or two incomes. This represents a major improvement in the status of women in Irish society.</P>
    <P>The Government have also shown their understanding of the needs of families suffering special disabilities and handicaps.  To help with the problems and additional expenses which must be borne by families with an incapacitated child, spouse, parent or blind person, we have doubled the allowances in an effort to attempt to redress the disadvantage <Col N="1315" /> and social imbalance in favour of such families.  The exclusion of 8,000 elderly persons from income tax is another example of our concern for those on low and fixed incomes.</P>
    <P>Self-employed persons also could, heretofore, pay their tax in two instalments, one in September and the second in the following January whereas the employee on PAYE paid as he or she earned. We think it only fair and equitable that the self-employed person should be brought into line with the PAYE taxpayer by paying his or her tax in a current year by October of that year.</P>
    <P>While this budget is a landmark in moving towards taxation equity, we have much yet to do before we can be satisfied that our taxation system is fair and equitable.  We must also seek to have a taxation system which stimulates enterprise and initiative while being at a level necessary to support our public expenditure on economic and social development that we require.  We propose to proceed immediately now with the establishment of a far-reaching Commission on Taxation in pursuit of our objective of providing ourselves as a community with a modern streamlined equitable system of taxation.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly the package of measures for the taxation of farmers has been the subject of some comment from the farming organisations.  I want at the outset to reject any suggestion that the proposals put forward by the Minister for Finance in the budget represent some sudden change or some new departure. The package now introduced is exactly the one that was put forward by the Government last year except that there are important improvements from the farmers' point of view.  Perhaps the most important of these is the guarantee that the lower limit of £40 will be retained for at least three years.  That is a factor of considerable importance to the ordinary member of the farming community.  One of the understandable complaints and worries a farmer has is that the system will be constantly changing and that he cannot make any long-term specific plan.  There is also the allowance made in <Col N="1316" /> the accounts for capital expenditure on farm improvements and developments.</P>
    <P>To devise a system of taxation for farming profits which will on the one hand ensure that farmers contribute in a fair and equitable manner to the general cost of running the country while at the same time not acting as a disincentive to growth and investment is a very difficult, complex task.  We do not pretend that the package contained in this budget is perfect.  In particular, we look on the resource tax as a short-term expedient. The accounts system is being extended to all farmers with a valuation of £40 or over.  It is not expected that this system will be fully effective this year.  It is not likely to bring in an amount of tax which will be proportionate to the earnings of the farmers covered.  Accordingly, it was necessary to go ahead with this resource tax element for larger farmers for this year to ensure that pending the full implementation of the accounts system, a contribution of this nature could be replied upon.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that it is not our intention that this resource tax should be a permanent feature of the system.  When the outcome of the application of the accounts system to all farmers with a valuation of £40 or over is available to us and when the adequacy of the returns can be assessed on the basis of the actual amount of tax paid by farmers this year, the resource tax part of the package can and will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I would certainly consider also that the devising of a fair and rational system of taxation for farm profits would be a task to which the new income tax commission might well turn their attention. Farming leaders should now finally come to terms with the situation.  They cannot continue to say that the farming community are prepared to pay their fair share of taxation and then proceed to reject every proposal put forward to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>In times of rising prices there is a special responsibility on the Government to take care of those in the community who have to exist on low incomes and those who, because of some disability or <Col N="1317" /> disadvantage, need special protection.  In settling the provisions of this budget, the Government set out clearly and specifically to improve the general circumstances of the lower income and the disadvantaged sectors of our community and we achieved that by a number of different but related measures.</P>
    <P>The most obvious measure, of course, is the substantial across the board increase in all social welfare rates.  This increase of 25 per cent in long-term and 20 per cent in short-term rates represents a major move to improve the position of this section of the community.  Even in the present difficult economic and financial situation, we were not deflected from discharging our responsibility in this very clear cut, substantial manner.</P>
    <P>We have also decided to retain the food subsidies.  These are very costly items and they are not entirely satisfactory&mdash; and I think everybody admits this&mdash;as an instrument of social policy. They are not selective.  We decided, nevertheless, that in the present circumstances they should be retained because of the effect their removal would have on lower income families, in particular.</P>
    <P>Another major improvement on the social side of this budget is the substantial increase in children's allowances. These allowances have a particular impact where low income families are concerned. We are making a significant contribution towards easing the burden of these families in present circumstances by the substantial increases we are granting from £3.50 a month for the first child to £4.50 and from £5.50 to £7 for each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>I believe that this budget has the distinctive stamp of our caring social philosophy.  It has been accepted with relief and gratitude by a wide section of the community.  I want also to suggest that our critics, both inside and outside this House, might have been gracious enough to acknowledge our achievement in the social welfare sphere.</P>

      <P>It is instructive for us, in the Government, to observe the approach to this budget by Opposition parties and by commentators outside the House, many of whom are not renowned for their favourable attitude towards us. One gets the impression that they have searched around feverishly in peripheral areas for grounds on which to attack the budget.  So many areas of this budget itself are so clearly sound and beneficial and right that they have had to leave them strictly alone.  The welfare provisions for instance are ignored.  The major move towards tax equity and, in particular, the improvement in the status of women as taxpayers, the reduction in the current deficit, the adequate provision for capital expenditure for industrial, commercial and agricultural development&mdash;all these things have been wisely ignored.  Criticism has been based on what Opposition speakers or commentators forecast as their version of future developments, rather than what is actually in the budget itself.</P>
      <P>The clearest commendation that we on this side of the House can find for this budget is the fact that it is not being attacked on the basis of what it actually contains.  The attack has had to be confined, in so far as it has existed at all, to some hypothetical developments which are envisaged.  There has been, in fact, by the Opposition, a great tilting at windmills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald's contribution, for example, is one instance of this.  First, he says that a test of a budget is whether it increases incentives, and in that I agree with him.  We cannot expect people to work or invest if half or more of the reward they obtain is taken by the State. In fact, I remember seeing it quite specifically stated somewhere some years ago that the reason why a particular large company chose not to locate here was the high rates of personal taxation then obtaining for managers and executives. These high rates have continued.  Before the budget, a person here could be paying 60 per cent of every extra pound he earned at a level of income a great deal less than half that at which he would pay <Col N="1319" /> 60 per cent if he lived, for instance, in the United Kingdom.  The comparison with other countries is even more adverse. Disincentives or rates of taxation like that have a detrimental effect on the will to work, to invest, to expand or to create employment.</P>
    <P>It is when Deputy FitzGerald seeks to suggest that concessions on the higher tax rates are at the expense of the less well off that I must take issue with him.  He conveniently forgets the 75,000 persons in the lower tax bracket who have been excluded from income tax altogether by this budget; the further 8,000 elderly persons who have also been excluded; the income splitting which will benefit virtually every family paying tax; the widening of the tax bands at every point in the scale; the 180,000 people who will have their highest marginal rate reduced to 35 per cent; the increases of 25 per cent and 20 per cent in the rates of welfare payments.  He, I am afraid, is compelled to forget and to ignore all these aspects of the budget in order to produce some case that this is not a budget for the less well off and for the lower income sector of our community.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald also conjures up his own particular version of the cost of living.  His argument seems to be that, some time later on this year, the cost of living index, by his calculations, will go up by six points.  He went on, in a nimble piece of semantics, to talk about an inflation rate of 20 per cent to 22 per cent as if this were already with us.  I must point out that there is no statistical basis whatsoever for a prognostication of that sort. What we do know, however, as a matter of fact and as a matter of record, is that under the Coalition Government, of which Deputy FitzGerald was a member, inflation went to more than 24 per cent.  What we do know, also, is that, on the basis of the official procedure used by the Central Statistics Office, the impact of the tax changes on prices at mid-May 1980 will be less than 4 per cent.  Of course, what happens to prices after mid-May will depend critically on future import price increases and on a number of other factors, some of which are under <Col N="1320" /> our control and many of which, unfortunately, are not.</P>
    <P>We are in an inflationary situation and it is a cause for grave concern.  It is in large measure a reflection, unfortunately, of the difficult economic conditions prevailing throughout the Western world.  The annual rate of inflation in Great Britain, for instance, in 1980 is variously estimated to be between 15 per cent and 18 per cent.  In the United States, it is well into double figures.  In considering this aspect of our economic and fiscal situation, it should be borne in mind that excessive Government expenditure, particularly Government expenditure leading to current budget deficits, is one of the greatest of all domestic sources of inflation.  In so far as this budget is concerned, because it takes a very considerable degree of corrective action in that particular area, its overall effect must be counter-inflationary and Deputies should have the good grace and the commonsense to admit that impact of the budget in that way.</P>
    <P>This budget marks the first step in a programme designed to achieve economic and social progress, based on strong public finances and firm management of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is not our intention just to make the different changes outlined in this budget and leave matters at that, We see the management of the economy as a continuing day-to-day responsibility.  The budget proposals represent the strategy and the principal measures necessary to give effect to that strategy.</P>
    <P>As the year unfolds, developments will be watched and assessed.  We shall maintain our supervision over the economy during the year because we regard this as a dangerous, difficult and crucial year from the point of view of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The effects of our budgetary measures will be monitored and supervised.  Any corrective or supplementary measures which may become necessary in any particular area will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>A national budget must of necessity be overall and global in its approach.  Its impact may have undue or excessive <Col N="1321" /> repercussions in some particular areas. This is inevitable where there are major policy changes affecting the national economy as a whole.  It is a responsibility of Government as part of their continuing management of the nation's affairs to watch out for undesirable developments of this sort and be ready to respond to them.  Ministers will seek to monitor their particular areas of responsibility from this point of view.  Social and economic management requires constant and sensitive attention to problem areas and to unforeseen developments.  We will avoid anything in the nature of heavyhanded blunt instrument approach.</P>
    <P>I said in my recent Ard-Fheis speech that we believe in government being for the people.  This budget is for the people. It is for the old age pensioner, the widow, the unemployed.  It is for the taxpayer, particularly for those taxpayers who are parents of families.  It is a budget for the people by a Government who are for the people.  It is a sound budget.  In its approach to the economy it is responsible and balanced.  We have set out to provide a sound financial basis on which economic growth and development can be maintained.</P>
    <P>It is a fair budget.  It makes a very positive contribution to equity and justice in our society.  We have set out to improve the situation of the disadvantaged in our society for whom we have a special rsponsibility.  We have taken a major step towards equity in the field of personal taxation.  I have no hesitation whatever in recommending this budget to the House and to the country.</P>
    <P>We have set a clear course for the economic ship.  We have prudently trimmed her sails.  We intend to keep her head into the wind and sail safely and steadily through these troubled seas, until calmer and better times arrive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss Barry Miss Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that my maiden speech in the Dáil will have to be more than a little critical of the Government. Many people are only now realising that the income tax reliefs granted on budget day were in fact not as generous as it <Col N="1322" /> seemed they were.  It is only for the single person or the married couple earning over £10,000 that any significant increase operates.  These reliefs in the main came about only because of the Supreme Court decision.  I believe that it is the Cork Murphys and not the Haughey administration that should be thanked and deserve praise.  Persons whose incomes are under £6,000&mdash;and those are in the great majority&mdash;will get very little relief.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that inflation this year will run between 20 and 22 per cent.  That means that many workers will see their present income eaten away by higher prices, higher health charges and higher social welfare contributions.  I honestly believe that the Government are playing a game of cowboys and indians&mdash;the indians did the marching and the chiefs got a big slice of the cake.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach is here to listen to my next point which is about young people because I fail to understand his lack of understanding about youth despite the fact that we have the fastest growing young population in Europe.  Young people were not worthy of consideration by an arrogant Government. The Government fail to realise that the young people are in fact their most valuable resource and I think it is my duty and responsibility to point out to the Government that we are not second class citizens.  At the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, the Taoiseach, and I quote from his speech there, said:</P>
      <P>We see the energy, idealism, enthusiasm and creativity of our youth as our hope for the future.  To equip them for their own future the Government will award a high priority to our youth problems and programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for words.  I sincerely hope that nobody, not even the young people within Fianna Fáil, are no naive and gullible as to take him at his word.  The following Wednesday massive cut-backs were announced in the work experience programme, in the temporary youth employment scheme and in the employment maintenance scheme.  Absolutely no effort <Col N="1323" /> was made in the budget to rectify this injustice.</P>
    <P>The right to work is a basic human right.  The Taoiseach has just said that job creation means different things for different people.  The simple question is: can you or can you not provide jobs for the people?  The seriousness of the situation is already evident in my constituency of North-East Cork where there are 400 people at present on the employment exchange in February, the highest figure for many years.  Also, the Seafield Gentex factory in Youghal is in danger of closure.  If this were to happen it would be a sad day for the people of Youghal.  I make this public appeal to the board of Seafield Gentex and to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism to ensure that this factory does not close down and lead to the loss of 120 jobs.</P>
    <P>I must give credit where credit is due. In the manifesto there was a commitment to full employment but I wonder now where the Fianna Fáil Manifesto stands as regards the promise of full employment. We were led to believe that this was their top priority.</P>
    <P>In the field of education there has also been a reversal of policy.  The country is facing massive cut-backs in capital investment in education.  The effects of this Government policy will be felt for years to come.  We all know that our present system of education is antiquated and unsatisfactory.  We should be thinking in terms of massive investment in education, not cut-backs.  The whole concept of free education is placed in jeopardy by these serious cut-backs.  Brother Declan Duffy of the Secreteriat of Catholic Secondary Schools has indicated that the very existence of our secondary schools is threatened by the failure to increase capitation grants.  I quote what Brother Duffy said in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 28 February 1980:</P>
    <P>We really feel that we have no option at this stage but to go to the Taoiseach and put it to him that we be allowed to levy every pupil in the schools to the amount of £50.</P>
    <P>If this occurs we will say good-bye to <Col N="1324" /> free education and instead of moving forward this rich man's budget will have thrown aside one of the most forward-looking pieces of legislation of the last decades.  In doing this the Government are not only going to dishonour the memory of the late Donogh O'Malley but will cast serious doubt on their commitment to youth and social justice.  I, as a national teacher, am only too well aware of the problems facing primary schools.  Of course Fianna Fáil did promise in that famous manifesto to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  We know how they have failed in that promise and it was a very simple one.</P>
    <P>There are things ignored in the budget which we have to talk about when we are discussing the budget.  The only thing the Government did for education was to put a 5 per cent increase on VAT.  This applies to school books, copy books, biros and pencils.  This will hit the poorer sections of the community hardest.</P>
    <P>The budget gives very handsomely to the rich and ignores the growing poverty in the country.  Why did the Minister for Finance cut the funds available to the Combat Poverty Committee by 24 per cent?  I was bitterly disappointed by that decision.  Sister Stanislaus in the <i>Sunday Journal</i> of 2 March said:</P>
    <P>The harsh treatment will result in the Committee being unable to fund a range of well-established voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>So much for social justice in this country. We are all striving, irrespective of party, for a caring society but when the example does not come from the top what can one expect?  It is only now, like most sections of the community, that farmers are coming to realise how harshly they were treated in the budget.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to withdraw immediately the resource tax before he is called on to do so by the law or the wrath of the farmers.</P>

      <P>There are no prophets of doom and gloom on the Fianna Fáil benches at the moment.  The case has been stated and the Fianna Fáil package to start us on the road towards progress in the eighties is incorporated in the Financial Statement of 27 February. Who would have thought just a month ago that the Government could bring in such a package to deal with our problems at this time?  Our difficulties have been stated and our resolve to deal with them is written in every single page of the Budget Statement.  The good example has been given by the Government.  If the same sense of determination and dedication to duty is evident in every walk of life our present living standards will be maintained and will be improved further by a caring Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no predictions or crystal ball gazing in the Financial Statement. The budget is just a straightforward statement that our difficulties will be overcome by good, sound economic <Col N="1327" /> policies.  There is a projection in the Budget Statement that if the revenue and expenditure work out as planned our balance of payments deficit will be reduced, our economic advance will be safeguarded, our pound will be secured and our national reserves will be restored to what they were.</P>
    <P>The Public Capital Programme is a realistic and well programmed policy.  Investment for future growth should be our first priority.  Anybody will realise that the increase of 15 per cent in the capital budget programme ensures continued growth and gives continued financial aid in the areas which will lead directly or indirectly to the productive capacity of the economy and to the development of our national infrastructure.  I am glad to support the Taoiseach in his sentiments in that regard this morning.</P>
    <P>The increase in the capital programme in respect of energy runs from £100 million to £144 million this year.  We are giving the capacity to the ESB further to improve their generating capacity to serve the needs of industry and all consumers.  New users of electricity have to pay increased costs in relation to first supply.  I have always felt that there should be a straightforward levy right across the country.  It is strange to me that one can see a person in a northern area who can get a supply of electricity for less than £100 initially.  Urban dwellers have the advantage of this facility and rural dwellers have not.  If they are a certain distance away from the supply of electricity they often have to pay more than £1,000 to have their houses connected.  I hope that in the not too distant future it may be possible to have this matter resolved so that all will pay an equal levy irrespective of where they live.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to see that in the £144 million provision for energy new finance will be made available to Bord na Móna to improve on the development of our bogs.  There are many areas where there are hundreds of thousands of acres of undeveloped bog and the only reason they are in that state is because access is <Col N="1328" /> difficult.  Some of this could be useful in providing improved access to this natural resource.  If that were done I am convinced we could have a significant reduction in our balance of payments so far as the purchase of fuel is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a huge increase in industrial promotion under the capital programme. This is a commitment by the Government to see to it that our industrial promotion and the securing of new jobs is maintained.  This would be the major responsibility of the IDA.  The target to be achieved is 13,000 new jobs each year.  It has to be admitted that in the past few years Fianna Fáil have to their credit the creation of unprecedented numbers of new jobs.</P>

    <P>This year special attention is to be given to telecommunications.  There is an increased allocation from £78 million to £100 million.  I do not have to tell this House that there is a great and grave need to have the matter of telecommunications attended to at this time. Telephone development, to a large extent, brings with it increased productivity, increased orders, and certainly it decreases any frustration for those who have to live by the telephone system. There is a big drive on and I am pleased to be able to thank the Minister for Communications for giving this area his wholehearted attention.  Indeed, in my native County Mayo we are at present negotiating the making available of a fully automatic exchange for the whole county to be located in Castlebar with a subsidiary automatic exchange in Belmullet, the contract documents for which are to be signed this very week. <Col N="1329" /> This is the kind of commitment to development that this Government have traditionally had.</P>

      <P>What are the Government going to do about the 24 hour service in Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government believe that telephone development is an absolute essential of industrial promotion and for the future of this country.  The Government are to be congratulated for putting so much of their resources into this area at this time.  The benefits will be seen by whatever government are in power over the next generations.</P>
      <P>I agree it is essential that we should have restraint in some areas.  The Taoiseach has been most forthcoming so far as this is concerned.  There is no question about it but money incomes will not be allowed to rise further than productivity will allow.  We have a system here whereby, if one can make a good case by way of productivity deals or re-structural deals, one is entitled to get more money.  It is agreed by all now that we can only get increases in real money incomes when we have earned them, and that will be the policy of this Government in the forseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has to be a ceiling on public expenditure both at central and at local level.  This cannot be exceeded no matter what the drawbacks are, even if the purchasing power of the pound has to decline.  It is absolutely essential in our present situation that the ceiling on expenditure be curtailed.  That might be unpopular with anybody who has to serve either at national or local level.  But it will provide a breathing space for the Government and enable them to tackle the fundamental problems.  This is an essential part of the Fianna Fáil policy at this time: a strict and realistic budgeting programme, coupled with the national will to implement that, will have the desired effect.  We must maintain our balance in the economy and avoid serious inflation.  This cannot be achieved unless monetary policy is right. <Col N="1330" /> This was gone into this morning by the Taoiseach.  I believe the steps being taken by the Government, even if they might bite a little hard on occasions, are essential in the present economic situation.</P>
    <P>The big problem we have all had to live with in the past six months has been domestic control on credit. This has made things difficult for certain individuals, but is it not significant that after a certain length of time, even with that control, we have learned to adjust ourselves and to be better off for it?</P>
    <P>We must maintain as well the external value of our currency.  This was made easier by going into the EMS.  We should take every advantage available to us under the EMS.  We must take the advantage now so that we can call upon the stronger currencies we are now aligned with to give us any help we might need in overcoming our difficulties.</P>
    <P>It will be agreed by all that monetary policy alone cannot be relied upon. There is more to it than that.  Direct action has to be taken by the Government. That is imperative at this time and the Government have taken it.  It was referred to again this morning by the Taoiseach when he talked about incomes policy.  There is a need for restraint on incomes.  What will it achieve for us?  It will improve our competitiveness at home and abroad.  It will raise our industrial profits.  It will encourage investment and increase job creation potential. Restraint on Government administrative expenditure is the order of the day in this budget.  We are not shirking our responsibility. The Government are determined to give a lead in this and show their faith in that they believe certain restraints are necessary at this time.</P>
    <P>There is a need for and there will be a critical examination of all activities in the public sector.  There will have to be a substantial reduction in the percentage of GNP absorbed by the public sector. Public expenditure has been rising too rapidly over the past number of years.  It has been rising more rapidly than the GNP.  Public service remuneration has increased threefold even in the one <Col N="1331" /> period from 1972 to 1976 alone, and it has risen significantly faster than that in the last number of years.  There has to be a curtailment in that regard if we are to proceed to the economic development we all hope for.  Perhaps there are ways of dealing with that.  I should like to recommend one that perhaps has not yet been mentioned in this debate.  There is always a temptation to do things by direct State activity.  That has been the policy and the tradition of Governments down through the years, but I believe that some public works should be put out to competitive tender and this would transfer the employment from the public to the private sector.  This is needed.  It would require a break with tradition but we would have beneficial consequences and it is worth considering.</P>
    <P>I am pleased indeed to note in the recent past that the Minister for Communications would seem to agree with me at least in part so far as this is concerned. He feels there should be more scope for the private sector in transport matters, that they should be considered as possibly providing certain limited facilities in the transport sector.  I believe this is under active investigation at the moment.  It might well be one of the major ways in which new job development potential could be created in the foreseeable future.  I feel that this might very well be extended to communications. Other countries in the past and in the present have allowed commercial development of their telephone systems. It has worked successfully not just in the US but in many other countries throughout the world.  Some of the private commercial companies that have responsibility for dealing with this type of development are the bluest of the blue chips.</P>
    <P>There might be a way whereby some element of private development might enhance the tele-communications system and give a much-needed fillip so far as job creation is concerned.  This could be considered also so far as local authority works are concerned.  This may be regarded as a hobby horse of mine but I believe that major local authority works <Col N="1332" /> could be more cheaply and quickly brought to fruition if they were put up for tender by private enterprise.  There would be no job loss so far as local authorities were concerned.  With the increased productivity in the new schemes there would be increased demand for maintenance of the works.  The local authorities should examine now all their major development works to see if a better deal could be got by having jobs put up to public tender in the private sector. It has always been agreed that in a progressive society the greater part of community wealth should be generated by the private sector.  By tradition that sector is less wasteful of resources than public bodies.  Consequently, in an effort to get the best value for our money we should consider very carefully all aspects of future development so far as the public sector is concerned.</P>
    <P>This budget, in common with budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil since they returned to office in 1977, is asking the private sector to develop to its full potential. Private companies cannot be pillaged by the State as is suggested by some Opposition speakers when they talk about wealth tax and other taxes to be imposed on development so far as native Irish industry is concerned.  Such crippling taxes cannot serve the national interest.  Expansion and replacement come from a company's own resources and if it is stripped of those resources by inequitable taxation there will be no expansion and no replacement of assets. Instead, there will be a decline in profits, there will be stagnation, redundancies, unemployment and at the end there will be financial debt.  This has happened during the years because of severe restraints imposed on native companies. They are entitled to the same privileges and incentives as foreign investors.  We might have less activity on the part of Fóir Teoranta if there was a more enlightened policy with regard to taxation of company profits.  They are absolutely essential when we talk about diversification, reinvestment and redeployment of capital.</P>
    <P>The IDA have done a magnificent job <Col N="1333" /> in attracting industries here.  The Government have recognised that they have played a major role in bringing to this country much-needed foreign investment and industrialisation.  They need the support of the Government and they need extra money.  It is a pity they have to be in a race at this time to keep up with job losses in industries that are going by the wayside.  If we could remove job losses from existing industries it would be possible to reach the target of 30,000 new jobs each year and to go further.  It would be possible to reach the situation of full employment in the 1980s.  That is still the aim of the Government.  The IDA should move into other areas in a smaller way so far as the west of Ireland is concerned and I shall deal with that matter later.</P>
    <P>This is a budget of reality.  That is a fair assessment of the whole package.  A major aspect is the discretionary price increases.  The consumer decides by his own spending pattern how much indirect tax he will pay in any week.  If he and his family wish to live frugally he can avoid indirect tax almost completely.  Consumers&mdash;and this affects housewives in particular&mdash;will be able to spend what they can afford.  Budgeting the household finances will be an easier exercise. The essentials of life are unchanged. The Government accept that prices are increasing and, consequently, they did not remove food subsidies. Once again, family saving and financial planning will have a real meaning for the family.  In this way Fianna Fáil have lived up to their traditional policy of protecting the weaker sections of the community and also protecting the family unit.</P>
    <P>There have been increases in the price of drink and cigarettes and there has been the traditional reaction.  In the days following the budget there has been a call for abstention from drink and cigarettes but we know that in a few weeks the consumption of alcohol will be back to where it was originally.  It has been a feature of Irish life in the past years, that irrespective of what increases <Col N="1334" /> are imposed on cigarettes and drink the level of spending does not seem to change.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Government would be very pleased if the budget-bashing ritual had the effect of causing a decrease in the consumption of alcohol and of smoking. The benefits by way of a decrease in absenteeism, of increased productivity on the factory floor and less expenditure on health financing would far outweigh the revenue from these so-called necessities of life.  I am not talking as a kill-joy; I am talking as one who &ldquo;bends the elbow&rdquo; a little now and then.  I do not smoke very much now and I can appreciate that these items are not necessities of life.  There is a saying in my part of the country which I am sure Deputy Harte will appreciate.  It is to the effect that people do not care how high the price of drink goes as long as it does not go scarce.  So far as I am concerned, people are entitled to drink and to smoke despite the fact that it has been proved beyond doubt that it has a detrimental effect on health, but they are also entitled to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to drink and cigarettes.  If they do this they will benefit themselves and their families and they can use their money on other much needed items. They will also benefit the nation from the point of view of health and there will be a consequent decrease in the huge demands on the health services.</P>
    <P>Much has been made about the increase in the price of petrol.  I am mentioning all the increases because I do not want anyone to say afterwards that I mentioned only the good aspects of the budget and did not refer to the increases. Despite protestations to the contrary, the increase in the price of petrol will have a conserving effect so far as the use of energy resources is concerned.  People will consciously decide whether their journey is necessary or frivolous.  Of course they are entitled to use their car for a scenic drive in the country but they must accept the fact that they must pay for it.  It might also bring about what is long overdue in rural Ireland, car sharing in going to employment in built-up areas. It is not unusual in some of the plants operating in the west of Ireland to see <Col N="1335" /> rows and rows of cars parked in the car park.  Sometimes three, four or five cars have come from the one village each with one occupant.  Car sharing would improve community relations for the people in rural Ireland and if it did nothing more than give a fillip to community activities it would go a long way to improving the situation in rural areas. It might mean an increase and improvement in local entertainment.  This may sound incidental, but there has been a decline in that kind of thing in rural Ireland over the past number of years, perhaps because of the greater mobility of people and if there is a decrease in that, that is all the better.  We will see new, improved community relationships and activities which would be for the betterment of the people generally.  Also every gallon of petrol spared will mean one gallon less to be imported.  If we could get a situation of not having to import any oil, then all our economic ills would be set aside.  In that regard I am hopeful that the black gold will be found off the west coast of Ireland and in particular off the coast of Mayo.  Then it will provide us with a further infrastructure to develop our job potential in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>Who can suggest that it is right and proper that there be a total expenditure of some £800 million to feed the fuel demands of 3.5 million people?  Surely there is something incongruous in that kind of figure.  It is time to tackle this matter once and for all.  If this budget proposal goes any way to relieve some part of that situation it will have done a service to the nation in more than one way.  There has been wastage of fuel by motorists in the past.  It is common on Sunday morning in my parish to see people taking their car from a house half a mile away to their place of worship and on occasion having to drive 200 yards beyond the place of worship to park the car.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Harte gets a chance to ask a question, I must admit <i>mea culpa</i> on many occasions and I am <Col N="1336" /> probably one of the greatest offenders in that regard.  But I have taken this to heart and if time is still available to me I will be delighted to accommodate Deputy Harte by getting some little exercise on Sunday morning from now on and I hope the Deputy will take the good advice also.  Motorists have wasted petrol, and the benefits of more careful use must be announced.  Apart altogether from the health of the individuals who are driving, people would have more disposable income and there would be less congestion on our roads, fewer frustrations in queues, certainly when one is unfortunate enough to take one's car to the city for a few days, fewer disruptions in business, a reduced balance of payments and less dependence on outside sources for the necessities of life.  These are worthwhile. If any measures taken by the Government can improve the situation as far as these things are concerned, I do not see why we should have so much shouting and roaring about the increase.  I accept that it is substantial, but it is no more substantial than those which we had to suffer continually under the Opposition during the four years that they were in power.</P>

      <P>The question of taxation was dealt with by the Minister for Finance, and again this morning by the Taoiseach, pretty extensively, and I am not going to dwell too long on it.  When the Taoiseach stated not too long ago that we should be ambitious in our approach to taxation in general and equity in taxation particularly, nobody&mdash;and I dare say I can include Deputy Harte in that&mdash;ever dreamed that the Minister for <Col N="1338" /> Finance would in one giant step go 90 per cent of the way to bringing justice into taxation.  It is remarkable that in this budget debate Opposition Deputies have steered clear of this section of the financial statement.  Why have they not the courage, decency and grace to state openly that this is a major advance, that the people accept it as a major advance and that it has gone almost the full way in bringing about equity once and for all into the taxation system?  This budget has been imaginative as far as taxation is concerned.  Who would have thought that full income splitting would have been removed in one day's work?  I accept that this was a long-standing injustice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Never did the fine bunch of withering violets on the far side think that they would want such a dose of Bio to get over that aspect of the budget as happened here last week.  The commission on taxation that has been promised will, I presume, go further and when their report is forthcoming the Fianna Fáil Government will not be found wanting in going the full distance to bring total justice and equity into the taxation system in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some increase in taxation as far as the farmers are concerned. I do not want to reiterate what the Taoiseach said this morning, but it is fair comment that the farming organisations have been asking for one thing one month and then certain sections of their supporters and members have been asking for something different.  Maybe it was intended that going on two or three different roads at the one time would deflect the Government somehow from their stated intentions.  This has not <Col N="1339" /> proved to be the case.  It was stated last year that accounts would be the fairest way of dealing with everybody who had to pay tax in this country and who was not on PAYE.  That is the fairest way to do it.  One does not pay tax if one does not have a profit.  A predetermined yield is not expected from the farmers on this occasion.  Many business people do not have this simplified accounts system which can be used by the farming community, and if it brings in a little extra yield the farmers cannot be aggrieved by it.  I hope the farming organisations will accept this package and will accept that the commission will deal with all the outstanding matters in the not too distant future.  Most of the people in my constituency do not have to pay a resource tax.  However, that is quite a small sum of money and when the benefits derived from the existing tax structure are made available next year it will be reviewed, as the Taoiseach promised.  The fact that the £40 valuation levels will stay for at least three years is a great asset as it affords the farming community an opportunity to plan for the next three years and to know their liability as far as tax is concerned.  I expect that the farming community will accept this and that we will not have disruptions in that area during this year.</P>
    <P>Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle say how long I have left?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxation policy as enunciated in the Financial Statement took account of the poorer areas.  In County Mayo, for example, we have 36,206 farmers with under £20 valuations; we have 1,552 farmers, with between £20 and £33 valuations; we have 227 farmers with valuations between £33 and £40 and we have 314 farmers with valuations over £40.  Our rates are roughly £17.40 in the £.  Deputies will agree that we have very small valuations. The rates on agricultural land here bring in £544,000, which is 7.7 per cent of the total receipts that come to Mayo County Council.  The number of extra farmers <Col N="1340" /> brought into the tax net by the provisions in this budget will be 212 and most of them will be in the sliding scale area between £40 and £50 valuations. However, £688,410 or 9.75 per cent of the total revenue to the county is paid by ratepayers other than farmers.  The small business men in Mayo pay a lot more than the farming community in rates.  The Government pay £3,910,000, or 55 per cent of the total amount of money needed to run the county for a year, and that is from the agricultural grant to the county of £7,062,410.  The farmers in County Mayo will not be hard-pressed by the new provisions.  I know that areas with better land, with over £70 valuations, will have to pay an increase in their share of taxation but it is a continuation of the policy of a caring and sharing Government that Fianna Fáil have not placed an extra great burden on the small farmers in the west. They appreciate it and thank the Government for their efforts.  When one considers that the 212 new farmers who will be brought into the tax net will have the advantage of being able to write off the rates they might have to pay against any possibility of income tax, one can see that it is a very small amount of money indeed.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance mentioned the question of a mobile advisory service in relation to taxation there was some derision here.  We in County Mayo are not tax dodgers and we welcome this service.  Many people have considerable difficulties in dealing with their tax returns and they need advice.  It is a great step forward in making this service available to farmers in their local areas.  I hope that the Minister will make that service available for quite long periods in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on their employment policies for the west. We had a big increase in employment between 1970 and 1980, of 150 per cent. The figures went up from 2,583 to 6,570 in that period and we are grateful for it. There was an increase in population, as shown in the last census, of 4.1 per cent in Mayo and that is the first increase <Col N="1341" /> since the Famine, since 1840.  This is very significant in more ways than one. We retained our natural increase and we also came to a situation where for the first time we got some net immigration into the county in the last few years.  This was achieved by a Government who recognised that there had been a drain on the youth here for 100 years.  We wish to keep going that way.</P>
    <P>We have not failed our youth in that area.  The Fianna Fáil Government were conscious of their obligation to provide employment in such places as Mayo and we have now reached a situation where we are providing jobs for the young people coming from our second and third level institutions.  This increase in our population could not have come about in an area that was traditionally denuded of its population by emigration and migration unless Government policy had taken the initiative and set about industrialising the west.  I am grateful for the advances the IDA made in the production of advance factories in my constituency.  Two new advance factories, measuring 24,000 square feet each, were authorised for Castlebar, one factory measuring 5,000 square feet was authorised for Westport, there is one in Louisburgh, one in Keel, one in Kiltimagh and one in Claremorris.  All this illustrates a firm commitment to continue the progress achieved over the last few years.  As soon as the cluster unit at Castlebar, which comprised six individual units and totalled an area of 10,000 square feet, was promoted, we found clients for it. There will be small engineering type industries there that will provide electrical components to meet the demands of industries in the area.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in some quarters that Mayo has done very well and that the emphasis might be shifted to other areas.  However, my reason for contributing to this debate is to let the IDA and anybody else involved in industrial promotion know that we need continued growth to cater for the 1,500 young people coming on to the labour market each year from our second level educational <Col N="1342" /> institutions.  All those new factories that have been established in the county in the past ten years have been staffed by young people.  When industries are staffed by young people the same people continue in that employment for a very long time, but this means that there are not job opportunities for young people coming on to the labour market each year.  That is why it is absolutely essential that we continue with the programme of advance factories, with advance recruitment and with the selection of suitable industries for the area. We need new industries if we are to prevent emigration from starting again.  It would not be to the credit of any Government that it should become necessary for emigration to begin again from County Mayo.  For the first time in the county we can look around us and see the urban areas developing and the population growing.  The credit for this trend must go to Fianna Fáil.  My constituents are happy with the job creation programme and with Government activity in this field.</P>
    <P>Apart from the major industries there is a great need in our county to develop small industries.  Our county development team are very active and effective in promoting the county as a suitable location for the smaller type of industry. We send teams of people to Britain, to the US and to other places in an effort to help the IDA in attracting small industrialists to Mayo.  Because the county is very large&mdash;the third largest in the country&mdash;and because its population is fairly well dispersed, it is suited ideally to the smaller type of industry.  However, one of the disadvantages that faces our people in their efforts to promote the county in this way is that it is not always possible to offer suitable sites in our smaller towns.  Therefore, there is a need for suitably serviced sites with full planning permission before the industry hunters go about their business.  It is difficult to expect somebody to agree to come to the county to set up an industry on a mere promise that when he gets here the sites will be made available.  That is why there is a great need for small advance units, units of about 2,000 square feet, <Col N="1343" /> and the developing agency for those units should be the county development team.  Funds should be made available from the special regional development fund to this local team in order to enable them to acquire small sites in the rural areas and in the smaller conurbations.  I trust that the IDA will take note of my remarks and will make money available to the development team in order to allow them to proceed on the lines I have outlined.</P>
    <P>In this budget there has been much emphasis placed on the capital programme and on the need for improved infrastructures throughout the country.  There was special reference this morning to roads and that is an aspect to which I should like to make special reference so far as the west is concerned. On the question of transport generally there is need for another airport in the Mayo area.  I understand that both Sligo and Waterford have got the go ahead in regard to airports.  A feasibility study is being carried out in respect of Mayo in this regard.  I trust that the outcome will be satisfactory because another airport is essential if our industrial, agricultural and fishing operations are to continue to develop during the next few years.  In addition, the provision of another airport would generate a new tourism drive.  I am not taking from Deputy Harte's county when I say that the whole of the west of Ireland is perhaps the last noncommercialised tourist area in western Europe.  Given the proper development facilities, it could be a big factor in improving our balance of payments situation. Last year three million pilgrims visited the Marian Shrine at Knock.  It is not my wish to take from Deputy Morley's remarks in this regard but we are confident that this type of influx will be a continuing business.  Can any other county boast of so many people coming to a location within the county during last year?  Admittedly, last year was extraordinary in this regard, but it is accepted that in excess of one million pilgrims will visit the area from now on.</P>

      <P>In addition to facilitating the development of our industrial programme provision of an airport would go a long way to increasing our potential in that regard.  It would service also our offshore exploration.  It is accepted generally now that the most likely place for an oil find is off the Porcupine Bank.  The provision of an airport would service also our fishery development. Deputy Harte's countymen visit the shores of Mayo and fill their boats with Mayo fish and to that extent he might very well support the provision of this extra facility which would assist those fishermen in having the catches delivered to the markets.</P>

      <P>There was reference this morning to the need for new education institutions in order to provide the expertise and the development necessary to service our industries.  The Government might consider this a suitable time to provide a third level educational institution in Mayo.  We need a regional technical college and we need also an AnCO training centre.  Those 1,500 students <Col N="1345" /> who leave second level education each year must go either to Sligo or to Galway if they wish to pursue third level education.  Though the Buchanan Report may be dead, the memory of it lingers in so far as some of the ideas put forward in respect of centralisation are concerned. I am thinking especially of Mayo. Why should we not have a regional college?  In the county there are 22 secondary schools, 14 vocational schools and one community school with a total enrolment for all institutions of 9,012.  I shall quote from figures from other counties in this respect.  In Carlow there are 3,078 second level students. The figure for Kerry is 9,199, for Donegal it is 6,691, for Galway it is 14,698, for Westmeath it is 5,683, for Louth the figure is 6,829, for Waterford it is 4,901, for Sligo the figure is 4,409, while for Limerick the figure is 12,496. There are 656 young people from our county attending university while 284 are attending other third level institutions. Having regard to these figures we are entitled to a third level education institution.</P>

      <P>We need to be able to provide the technological training that will be necessary for our young people to have for the industries that we will be developing in the future.  According to the Tussing Report there will be required 30,000 new spaces before 1986 in this particular type of education.  Surely County Mayo rates as one of the primary places in which to provide such an institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy suggest that it be located at Castlebar or at Ballina?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>For a very good reason I would suggest Castlebar.  There is the infrastructure there to cope with such an institution.  Geographically, it would be the ideal location, being in the centre of the county and having a hinterland <Col N="1346" /> which caters for about 65,000 people in a total population of 414,000.</P>
      <P>The weaker sections of the community have always been a prime concern of Fianna Fáil and this budget, more than anything that has gone before, indicates clearly the right of those weaker sections to share in the general prosperity of the community as a whole.  These people must be protected against the impact of economic developments. The budget displays a practical commitment to cushioning the needy against rising prices and greater inflationary tendencies.  Because we have a caring and sharing Government we have reached a situation where, by another fell swoop, the Minister for Finance has gone a very long way to making life easier for the needy.  The Government have been generous this year and our generosity so far as the weaker sections are concerned has been well received by the public generally.</P>
      <P>There is some concern regarding abuse in respect of some of the schemes administered by the State but there is a general anxiety to root out those who would seem to abuse these schemes so that more money may be made available for those in genuine need.</P>
      <P>This budget has gone a long way in settling down the community, in settling down the PAYE workers.  There is guaranteed increased moneys for the areas that are most in need and the budget has gone a long way also to increasing the standard of living for those in receipt of social welfare payments.  In these circumstances the Government must be congratulated.  As the Taoiseach said this morning, if the Opposition had a little commonsense and were gracious enough to accept the fact that a major improvement had been effected and that a real start had been made in our endeavours for the eighties the country would have a better chance of attaining the goal that had been set for this decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to the Taoiseach's contribution this morning and I think that <Col N="1347" /> we can come unambiguously to only one conclusion in relation to that contribution, that is that the Taoiseach is a very much more worried man than we had thought he was before he made that speech.</P>
      <P>It is obvious now that it is a prime characteristic of this Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, as it was of his immediate predecessor, that he is far more worried by the people behind him than by those in front of him.  I have been puzzling for some days about two immediate reactions to the budget speech of the Minister for Finance.  One of these reactions has been on the part of Fianna Fáil Deputies who have come to me and also I understand to other Opposition Deputies in the corridors and have asked us what we think of the budget.  This is a fairly unusual way for Fianna Fáil Deputies to support their Minister for Finance.  The obvious difference is that at best they are confused and that at worst they are seriously worried about the implications of the budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the way these Deputies spoke to Deputy Horgan was &ldquo;What do you think of that, Deputy Horgan?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the immediate sense for their own political futures and, if they are longer sighted, for the national interest.  There is another aspect of reaction to the budget which puzzles me and that is that for the first time in five years the Taoiseach of the day did not come into the House on the morning after the budget speech to defend the provisions of that budget.  I know that the Taoiseach intervened the previous evening on the question of the tax on petrol but it is not unusual for a Taoiseach to intervene briefly on Financial Resolutions.  However, it has been unknown during the past five years for a Taoiseach deliberately to back away from a confrontation with the Opposition about the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear now that the reason that the Taoiseach was keeping his powder dry was that he was apprehensive about the political and economical impact of the budget and that he was waiting to see what way the wind was blowing before coming in to defend it.</P>
      <P>In addition, the first two Fianna Fáil speakers on the budget were the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, both of whom were promoted to their positions by the Taoiseach from the backbenches.  I have nothing against those two men personally.  They made the best of a bad job in their contributions but it is totally reasonable to ask where was the shadow cabinet on this occasion, the cabinet headed by the Tánaiste?  Why have there not been contributions to this debate from the second eleven?  The answers are clear.  The budget is not one which fits in very well with some of the priorities that some of these men might have preferred to see being given a greater place.  I should hope to make this more clear in a moment. Apparently what has happened in the seven days since the budget was introduced is that the chill winds of reaction have begun to whistle around the ears of Fianna Fáil backbenchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil backbenchers, conduits in this as ever, have passed on these messages to their Taoiseach and leader who, obviously upset by the fact that his budget was not going down as well as he thought it would, decided that the time had come finally to come in and stiffen the troops.  That is what we saw here this morning, an exercise in stiffening the morale of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  I believe it was an empty exercise and I do not believe it will have the effect he intended, because the applause <Col N="1349" /> from the Fianna Fáil benches was very muted indeed.</P>
    <P>There is one significant aspect of this morning's speech to which I feel we can legitimately call the attention of the public and that is the Taoiseach's virtually total abandonment of one of the progressive measures in the Minister's budget speech&mdash;there are one or two of these and I will refer to them as I go along&mdash;that is, the resource tax on land. Listening to the Taoiseach today one would never think that this proposal was only a week old.  The chill winds of reaction, especially from the better off section of the farming community who virtually alone would have been asked to bear this resource tax, have been enough to send the Taoiseach and this Government scuttling for shelter.  This week old infant, this mewling, barely adequate resource tax, has now been despatched in an act of political infanticide that can barely have been parallelled in recent years.</P>
    <P>In it worthwhile recalling that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, reviewing the proposal to impose just such a resource tax of £3.50 per £ of RV on farmers of over £70 rateable valuation, described it as modest indeed and looked forward to the time when it would form the basis for an adequate system of capital taxation affecting the really wealthy agricultural landowners and producers.  We have been told in this House by the Taoiseach that the tax concerned, instead of being part of a shift towards equity in the taxation system, has suddenly been demoted to the role of a short-term expedient. Those were the words the Taoiseach used.</P>
    <P>I suppose we were wrong in the first place ever to take, with any seriousness, the idea that a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach would introduce a worthwhile resource tax and would keep it there until it really started to bite.  If we had any fantasies in that direction they must surely have been dispelled by the unmistakable signalling of the Taoiseach to the farming interests, and not to the small farmers who would not have had to pay this resource tax <Col N="1350" /> anyway, but to the large farmers, the farmers he is afraid will transfer their political allegiance to other parties, that the resource tax is now up for grabs and if they come a little towards him he will go a long way towards them.  This climb down from the resource tax is contemptible in present circumstances, all the more so in the circumstances of the present budget.</P>
    <P>We also have to remember that there are other aspects of this budget's approach to taxation which deserve comment and especially in relation to farming. We now have a commitment from the Government not just to auction off the resource tax at the first opportunity but&mdash;and I do not think the significance of this has been fully appreciated&mdash;to peg at £40 RV, for three years, the level above which farmers have to supply accounts for taxation purposes.  Two things might be said about that.  First, there is no such commitment in relation to any of the tax concessions for the PAYE sector announced in the same budget. Secondly, whatever else happens in the next three years, we know an election will happen.  Here was another example of signalling by the Minister for Finance and the Government to the farming community that in at least this important respect no more will be asked of them in the next three years than is asked this year.</P>
    <P>The Leader of Fine Gael in an otherwise very interesting speech made one statement which I found rather odd, when he described this budget as lacking strategy.  I do not see anything else in it except strategy.  It is a strategy designed to buy off powerful interest groups in society and, as a result, to achieve electoral success.  That is the beginning, the middle and the end of this budget.  There is nothing ignoble in seeking electoral success, but sometimes the price can be too high.  When we look at the concessions in this budget we have to ask ourselves not just what they are but where is the money coming from to finance them, and why are they being made in the first place.</P>
    <P>One final point that might be made in <Col N="1351" /> relation to farming taxation is this: historically it is true that since the introduction of farmer taxation by the National Coalition Government&mdash;to listen to Government speakers one would think they were the only people ever to have taxed farmers&mdash;it has consistently happened that the projected revenue from farmer taxation has been over-estimated and the projected revenue from PAYE and other forms of income taxation has been under-estimated.  We have to look at the proposals on farm taxation in this budget in that light in particular, and especially we have to look at the now virtual abandonment of the resource tax in the same light.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Taoiseach's speech I would like to turn to.  He argued that because so many of the concessions in this budget were so popular commentators in this House and outside had to confine their criticisms to articulating some prognostications which had no statistical basis in fact.  Of course prognostications have no statistical basis but one man's prognostication is as good as another. The prognosticators on this side of the House have a right to be considered as well as the Taoiseach and it is interesting to note that the Taoiseach did not give us any prognostications of his own.</P>
    <P>In passing I might add that I dislike the term &ldquo;concessions&rdquo; when applied to certain forms of tax relief, and above all to social welfare benefits.  They are not concessions, they are rights and they should be seen as such.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach invited us to consider the budget in all its glory as presented a week ago, to ignore the past virtually entirely and to close our eyes to the future.  In this he was following the line he has followed since he came into the House as Taoiseach not long ago.  He has managed to dissociate himself politically from a Government of which he was a member for two-and-a-half years and to whose Cabinet decisions he had been collectively bound.  I suppose this was part of his appeal to his own backbenchers and one should not hold it too hard against him, but he not only underlined <Col N="1352" /> the message that he had nothing to do with the mess of the last two-and-a-half years but asked us to close our eyes to the possible, let alone the probable, future implications and results of this budgetary strategy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is an accountant by profession and nobody knows better than he that you cannot look at one year's trading figures of a company in isolation; you must look at the effects your policies have had in the past and at your investment and cash flow projections in the future.  We contend that when you look at investment and cash flow projections for the future the future presents a much more dismal prospect than the Taoiseach would like us to believe.  He is blaming the problems of today on the misdeeds of yesterday, for which he himself was partly responsible, and he is borrowing from tomorrow to pay for them.</P>
    <P>This budgetary strategy will undeniably land us in very serious trouble this time next year, and when I am asked what I think of the budget, part of my answer has to be, &ldquo;I will tell you in January 1981 because it will not be until then that some of the negative effects of the budget will become apparent&rdquo;.  Some of us may not be here then if the Taoiseach decides to make a dart for the country, but that is neither here nor there. I will not argue about percentage points, about whether inflation will be 22 per cent or 16 per cent or whatever, because I do not think you can put a figure on it at this stage.  However, it seems clear that the situation must be worse next year than it is this year.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government will not be able to do next year what they have done this year.  Indeed I think we will be very lucky if the Government do not follow the principle which was a feature of at least one other Fianna Fáil Government in which the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, when they got their sums wrong and had to introduce a supplementary budget in the autumn.  I am afraid the taxpayers must prepare themselves for just such a shock this year because we have it on the authority of <Col N="1353" /> the Minister for Finance in his budget speech that if more money is needed he will come to the House to look for it. There is only one way he can do that and that is by increasing taxation.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Minister for Finance was interesting because at the beginning it seemed to set the scene for some radical measures.  In particular it referred to changes that had taken place in the previous year.  At column 705 of the Dáil Official Report for 27 February he is quoted as follows:</P>
    <P>Obviously there has been a complete change of circumstances compared with the situation as it appeared this time last year.</P>
    <P>I can remember sitting here when the Minister said that and waiting with some anticipation for the details he would give us about this complete change in circumstances. What did we get?  He spoke about the massive oil price increases and increases that were to come.  He said the farming community had met with serious difficulties during the year&mdash;he did not go into details about that&mdash;and he spoke of the pattern of industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>That is not a long shopping list when you draw a line underneath it and put underneath it &ldquo;a complete change of circumstances&rdquo;. The oil price increase was probably the largest single element in the change that had taken place.  I have not got on the tip of my tongue the figure for the value increase in oil prices during the year but I understand they were about 80 per cent.  The Minister must have a very short memory if he does not recall that in an earlier year, 1975-76, oil prices went up by nearly four times the percentage that they went up last year and that the budgetary measures taken then and subsequently reduced the rate of inflation to approximately 7 per cent by the time that Government went out of office.</P>
    <P>The wheel is now going in the other direction.  The inflation rate is either going up or staying as it is.  So the complete change of circumstances referred to by <Col N="1354" /> the Minister for Finance materialises when we look at the evidence which he adduced in his statement.  In the Minister's speech there is a total absence of any statement, assessment or estimate about the effects of the budget on growth next year.  We have had from the Department of Finance in their preliminary statement on the budget a comment to the effect that growth next year will likely be less than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>It was reasonable to have expected the Minister for Finance in his budget speech to have said what in his opinion the budget would do to achieve greater growth.  Because he did not, the only conclusion we can come to legitimately is that no news is bad news.  Though the Taoiseach came here this morning to warn us about a projected negative growth rate in our largest single market, the UK, not even he in a carefully researched and well prepared speech made any reference to the budget's effect on our growth rate.  He must be faulted for that.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister's and the Taoiseach's speeches can be faulted in relation to jobs.  It was 5.15 p.m. on budget day before the Minister for Finance mentioned jobs, and he skated over the subject obviously because it was a very difficult area for him.  It is equally obvious that criticism not only from these benches but from the benches behind the Taoiseach have set his ears tingling because he came in here this morning in a deliberate attempt to counter the criticisms that have been made about the budget and its omission of any specific reference to jobs.  One can very easily come to the conclusion that there is little more in the Taoiseach's speech today than rhetoric.</P>
    <P>I invite Members of the House to compare what the Minister for Finance said on Wednesday last and what the Taoiseach said here this morning about jobs with the pages of material about jobs contained in the Financial Statement of the former Minister for Finance on 7 February 1979.  Then there were at least three full pages devoted to jobs, investment and employment creation in all <Col N="1355" /> its forms.  There is a long way between 1979 and 1980&mdash;from three pages of facts, projections and estimates to a couple of stirring phrases delivered on the eve of a battle by a general not altogether sure of his troops.  I have differed on many occasions, politically and economically, with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy George Colley.  But I do not think that anybody who sat here during not just his budget speech last year but during the detailed discussion of the provisions of the Finance Bill which followed the budget could doubt that man's concern for jobs, could doubt the concern with which he challenged these benches to put forward alternative strategies or measures which would do more to create employment than the measures he was suggesting on the far side of this House.  We did our best.  Obviously we did not satisfy him, but I would not have expected that we would have done.  The important thing is that the argument was about something that is real and important in our society.  In place of that argument of last year we have the rhetoric of this year.</P>
    <P>In one area of special concern to me, that of education, there were specific promises given in the budget last year for new jobs in the educational sector.  It turned out&mdash;as I was afraid it might&mdash;that many of those proposals for jobs in the educational sector were so ill-conceived and under-financed that the degree of take-up within them was not as large as the Minister for Finance, and presumably the Minister for Education, had hoped.  In some cases the degree of take-up was 30 per cent or less and the Minister for Finance and Minister for Education were justifiably criticised from these benches for devising schemes which did not produce the intended jobs. At least they devised schemes.  They sat down and tried to do something about giving to our schools, to the hard pressed staffs in our schools, some extra administrative and caretaking facilities. That absence in this year's budget is as nothing compared with some of its other deficiencies.  To my mind the major achievement of this budget has been <Col N="1356" /> totally to deflect attention from the savage cuts both in the Public Capital Programme and in the Estimates for current expenditure published by the Government in the period between Christmas and budget day.  We cannot ignore these for the simple reason that they form part of the budget.  The budget, in terms of its desire to reduce borrowing and to cut the current budget deficit, has a direct relationship with the Estimates and with the Public Capital Programme.  Here again it was plain that the Taoiseach was coming in to respond to criticism reaching him from the ranks behind him.</P>
    <P>Let us look again at education.  The Public Capital Programme for education is reduced by 7.5 per cent in money terms.  That means a reduction in real terms of the order of 20 per cent; in layman's language, a fifth less will be spent on capital provision in the educational area this year than was spent last year.  This is dispiriting news for the parents of children in overcrowded classrooms or perhaps in some of the shanty towns of prefabs that have to do duty as educational facilities in many of our schools.</P>
    <P>The situation is not much better when we come to education on current account. When we look at the various subheads here we see that the Government's prating about discretionary expenditure in relation to taxation on drink, tobacco and so on has been designed partly to conceal the fact that they are cutting their own discretionary expenditure very shortly in these areas.  Many areas have no money increases at all, which means a cut in real terms when inflation is taken into account.  It is interesting to note that the areas in which these cuts tend to be made on the current side are those in which the Government have not traditionally funded the total amount necessary.  In other words, in relation to items such as free books, the fees grant element of the money made available to some post-primary schools and so on, where there has had to be traditionally, despite so-called free education, a matching contribution from the private resources of the parent or student concerned, <Col N="1357" /> the Government's contribution has been pegged or even cut back.  This means that the resources necessary to bridge the gap between what was given last year and what is needed this year will have to be found privately.  When we consider this we have also to consider the fact that different people and different parents are in different positions when it comes to finding the extra expenditure that will be called for this year if they are to maintain the educational services for their children at the level at which they were maintained last year.  It is all very well to talk about discretionary expenditure but, first of all, one must have some money about which to exercise discretion.  For all the changes that are to be made in this budget the fact is that some parents have very much more discretionary powers than others because they have very much more discretionary expenditure.  It is precisely the parents who have less money over which to exercise their discretion who will be most seriously hurt by the severe cuts that have been made in the Estimates for current expenditure.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.  The monitoring of air pollution by local authorities to total emissions to the atmosphere from all sources and separate figures on vehicular pollutants are not available.  The monitoring of emissions from individual vehicles for toxicity is not feasible, but the present law provides specifically against emission of excessive smoke, which may be detected and made the subject of court action.  Furthermore, the EEC directive on road worthiness tests for heavy vehicles, the implementation of which is being prepared at present, provides for a check on smoke emission.  I may add that emissions from diesel engines, which are generally used on the heavier vehicles, are considered to have a lower toxic content than those from petrol engines.  I have previously indicated that on grounds of practicality and cost, I do not propose to require re-location of exhaust pipes as suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment impact of micro-processors will be felt in two main ways:</P>
      <P>&mdash;first, in the manufacture of micro-processors and products incorporating them;</P>
      <P>&mdash;second, as a result of the application of such products to the production process in other industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is in a position to benefit greatly from the growth of electronics <Col N="1380" /> manufacturing and Deputies will be aware of recent progress.  For example, employment in the production of micro-processors and products incorporating them at June 1979 is estimated at 10,000 as against 5,000 in January 1973 and is expected to grow to between 25,000 and 30,000 in 1985.</P>
    <P>I am examining the occupational implications of this projected increase in employment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the impact of microprocessor applications on employment in industry and services, relatively little concrete information is available.  To improve our information the National Board for Science and Technology are undertaking a study of the various effects caused by the introduction of micro-electronic technology.  A steering group, on which my Department are represented, are monitoring progress.</P>
    <P>The study will assess, in the context of the Irish economy over the periods 1980 to 1985 and 1985 to 1990, the new industrial and employment opportunities arising and the potential impact of micro-electronic technology on the nature and level of employment in existing manufacturing and service industry. Until this study is completed it would not be possible to quantify with such reliability the precise employment impact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he has performed an extraordinary feat here this afternoon in referring to the effect of micro-processors on employment only in a positive sense?  Is the Minister not aware that one union alone has already indicated a forecast of up to 80,000 jobs that could be lost in the commercial and administrative sector, and that many of these jobs are at present done by women workers? Does he not consider this danger real enough to comment on at this stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the comments made by the Deputy.  But, as I said in the course of my reply, it is a very early stage.  I would also point out to him that it is not possible to quantify the likely impact on employment.  But we <Col N="1381" /> in this country have much better prospects of getting, first of all, the new &ldquo;greenfield&rdquo; and job creating and manufacturing enterprises, which is on the positive side and, on the other side, our existing industry is, in relative terms, much less vulnerable because we have fewer of the traditional electro-mechanical industries.  I say that in a positive way because of course we must be concerned about the possible impact. I am not so sure that mention of figures that, at this stage at any rate, certainly cannot be substantiated is of any help in situations such as the Deputy mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with what the Deputy has to say at all. The opinions offered are the reverse.  But it is early days and it is impossible to quantify exactly the impact on employment at the moment.  It is of concern, of course; I accept that.  But the Deputy will also be aware, when he mentions statements by certain people, that these people have admitted in public that they been suggested at this stage either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is a universal tendency in manufacturing industry and, indeed, in service industry in the private sector, for employers to turn profits into machinery rather that more jobs for people, that this increases the likely deleterious effect of the micro-processors and that the Government's taxation policy with regard to companies encourages it?</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the IDA who have been so successful in procuring the kind of industry that is most beneficial in our circumstances.  We can increase employment in such a situation.

      <P>In my reply to a similar question on 21 February 1979, I referred to the attraction by the IDA of a number of new industrial projects to Loughrea, which is eight miles from Derrybrien.  The companies involved have already recruited a number of workers and the level of manufacturing employment in Loughrea has in fact more than doubled between January 1979 and January 1980.  The companies concerned are expected to provide a further 200 jobs when they reach full production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one fact clearly on record in this House. I think I know more about the Seafield Gentex situation than the Deputy.  The employment maintenance scheme had absolutely no relevance to a decision taken by the board of Seafield Gentex last week.  I want to make that very clear.  The Deputy was absolutely incorrect when he inferred it had a relevance.  Regarding employment in the textile industry generally and in associated industries, I wish to point out that the Government showed their concern for vulnerable industries such as textiles, footwear, clothing and tanneries. Although the previous Government did not do so even though they were under severe pressure to do it, in our first budget in 1978 we introduced the employment maintenance scheme.  This scheme had to have approval from <Col N="1387" /> Brussels and it was mainly to counter the effects of the temporary employment subsidy then in existence in the UK.  In 1979 we repeated the maintenance scheme and again sought approval from Brussels.  Because of the ending of the temporary employment subsidy in the UK it was made clear to us by Brussels that we could not continue our scheme after 31 March 1980.  We are aware of and are concerned about the vulnerability of such industries and because of that we are examining urgently possible alternatives to the employment maintenance scheme to aid the industries in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In his statement in the Dáil on 11 and 13 December last the Taoiseach announced a number of changes in the structure and functions of Government.  Those changes, which dealt with the reassignment of functions between Departments of State and consequential changes in ministerial and departmental titles, have already been affected by Government Orders.  Two of the Taoiseach's proposals, however, require the amendment of existing legislation and hence the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals referred to are&mdash;first, to bring the Departments of Labour and the Public Service together under one Minister, and second, to increase the number of Ministers of State from ten to 15.  The opportunity presented by the amending legislation required to give effect to these proposals is also being <Col N="1414" /> availed of to make certain other technical amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.</P>
    <P>As regards the first proposals, the position at present is that section 3 (3) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1973, provides that the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service shall be assigned to the same person.  Before the department of the Public Service can be assigned to a member of the Government who is not also the Minister for Finance, it is necessary to repeal this provision.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that most of the functions exercised by the Department of the Public Service since they were set up in 1973 were transferred from the Department of Finance.  The main principle underlying the creation of the new Departments was that it would enable adequate attention to be given to, and adequate skills to be developed in, the important areas of personnel management, including industrial relations, and organisation which had hitherto been, inevitably, subordinated to financial, fiscal and economic matters in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The creation of the Department followed from the recommendations of the Public Services Organisation Review Group who had also recommended that the Department should be assigned to the member of the Government who was also Minister for Finance.  However, the needs of Government are never static; circumstances change and the structures in operation at any given time must be flexible enough to respond.  The changes announced by the Taoiseach are part of that process.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the Department of the Public Service in 1973, the successful management of industrial relations has emerged as one of the main requirements for national progress.  The Government have a twofold role.  The Minister for Labour is responsible not only for providing much of the institutional framework and all of the legislative basis for industrial relations matters; he is also concerned with fostering a constructive climate in the industrial relations field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> At the same time, the Government are, directly or indirectly, the largest employer in the State.  In broad terms, over a quarter of the work force and well over a third of those employed on the basis of a wage or salary are public servants.  The Minister for the Public Service is responsible for a co-ordinated approach to industrial relations in the public service. Because of the size, both relative and absolute, of the public service and the variety of occupational groups it encompasses, movements in the public service obviously exercise a major influence on the whole economy.  Trouble in the public service is trouble for the country. At this juncture in our affairs the situation requires that the Government's two roles in the industrial relations area should be co-ordinated at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided to assign the Departments of Labour and the Public Service to the same Minister.  While there has in the past always been a high degree of coordination between the two Departments, their assignment to the one Minister will extend and deepen this co-operation. This Bill, by removing the requirement that the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Finance shall be the same person, will make it possible to assign the Department of the Public Service to the member of the Government who is also Minister for Labour.  I would not be foolish enough to suppose that this is a panacea for curing all industrial relations problems.  It is, however, the visible manifestation of the Government's determination to get to grips with the problems in this area and to ensure that there is a fully co-ordinated approach to these problems.</P>
    <P>Before concluding on this aspect of the Bill, I would like to make myself clear on a number of points.  The change in ministerial responsibility does not in any way imply diminished commitment to the existing programmes of the two Departments concerned.  The Department of the Public Service, for example, will continue to perform their central <Col N="1416" /> staff role for the Government in relation to the organisation and personnel functions in the public service.  In particular, there will be no change in the priority to be accorded to the various programmes for the reorganisation of the public service in terms of structures and personnel policies.  The Department of Labour will also continue to perform their many important functions in addition to those which are directly related to the industrial relations area.  For example, their work in regard to the safety, health and welfare of workers and manpower policy, including training and retraining of workers, will have a high priority.  The importance of schemes for creation of employment particularly for young people and for protection against redundancy is self-evident and will, of course, continue to have a major role in the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>The second major provision of this Bill is the proposal to increase the number of Ministers of State from ten to 15. At present, section 1 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No 2) Act, 1977, restricts the maximum number of Minister of State to ten.  This Bill provides for an increase in the maximum number of Ministers of State to 15.</P>
    <P>It is only a little more than two years ago since this House debated in great depth the many issues arising from the creation of the office of Minister of State. Prior to the creation in 1977 of the office of Minister of State the business of Government was allocated between 15 Ministers of Government who had the assistance of seven Parliamentary Secretaries.  This situation had existed for 40 years despite the ever-growing range and complexity of Government business.  When we introduced the 1977 Act we made two fundamental changes. First, we abolished the office of Parliamentary Secretary and replaced it with a new office of Minister of State which would give greater responsibilities. Second, we increased the number of posts available to lend assistance to Ministers of the Government from seven Parliamentary Secretaries to ten Ministers of State.  As I have said, this <Col N="1417" /> House debated those measures in great depth at the time.  I am heartened by the knowledge that there was general acceptance on both sides of the House of the need for the measures proposed. Nobody was in any doubt as to the dramatic changes that had come about in the nature and complexity of Government business.  The impact of economic development, technological change and, particularly, our entry into the EEC placed inordinate demands, on the limited number of people available to deal with them.  Indeed, in 1977 such was the widespread acceptance of the need for the measures proposed that one of the considerations arising from the Opposition side was that the creation of ten posts of Minister of State would not be sufficient to meet the needs that existed at the time.  In replying to that debate the Tánaiste and then Minister for the Public Service pointed out that time would tell whether ten Ministers of State would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>We have now had over two years in which to judge this issue from experience. In this period the demands giving rise to the 1977 Act have not diminished.  On the contrary, these demands have grown.  We have had the continuing growth of responsibilities in relation to all aspects of EEC matters. There has also been a continuing increase in the demands made on Ministers on the home front.  There has also been a dramatic increase in the demands being made on politicians generally and Ministers in particular by the general public in terms of the service the public require.  We are now dealing with an electorate that is more articulate and better informed than ever before. Such an electorate demand a more sophisticated level of service from their elected representatives.  Each and every Deputy in this House will be aware of these developments.  The results of the combination of these factors can be seen in the expansion of the roles, functions and activities of the various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> Over and above these considerations, there is the question of the role and influence of the Oireachtas.  In all democracies there is a feeling that, because of the increasing complexity of the business of Government, the institutions of the State are not sufficiently answerable to Parliament.  We are now in the process of taking corrective action. We have an active Joint Committee of both Houses looking into the affairs of the commercial State-sponsored bodies; a Bill to establish the office of Ombudsman has been introduced; and the present measure will ensure that the number of Members of the Oireachtas answerable to the Houses for the management of the public business is brought to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have now had more than two years to judge whether ten Ministers of State are sufficient to cater for these ever-increasing demands.  There is, of course, as Deputies know, a constitutional limit of 15 on the number of Ministers of the Government.  If, therefore, we are to meet all the needs to which I have referred, it is essential that the number of Ministers of State be increased. As already stated by the Taoiseach, this means, in the case of some Departments of State, the assignment to them of more than one Minister of State because of the scope and complexity of the business they discharge. The process of Government is becoming an increasingly sophisticated one.  We can no longer hope to respond in a piecemeal manner to the challenge being posed.  Neither can we expect to share out ever-increasing burdens among a constant number of hard-pressed individuals without affecting the level of service being delivered.  Our experience in the last two years or so has convinced us of the necessity of having the number of Ministers of State increased to 15. This measure, together with the rationalisation of functions at ministerial, and departmental levels already announced by the Taoiseach, will mean that we are moving into the new decade with a full strength team equipped to meet the challenge ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> I said at the outset that the opportunity afforded by the amending legislation required to provide for increasing the maximum number of Ministers of State and for having a person other than the Minister for Finance appointed as Minister for the Public Service was being availed of to make certain other technical amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  First, the 1977 Act makes no provision for the termination of the appointment of a Minister of State on his becoming a member of the Government, nor for his resignation for any other reason.  I am proposing that such provision now be made.  Second, section 7 (4) of the 1939 Act provided, in the case of the office of Parliamentary Secretary, that his appointment or tenure of office would not be affected where another member of the Government was nominated to act for the Minister having charge of the Department to which he was assigned.  I propose here to make a similar provision for the office of Minister of State.  Finally, as regards technicalities, section 2 (1) (6) of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, still contains a reference to the obsolete office of Parliamentary Secretary.  I am proposing that the office of Minister of State be substituted in the relevant section for the office of Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say to the House that those measures announced by the Taoiseach which have already been carried out by Government orders together with the provisions of this Bill represent part of the on-going commitment of this Government to the reorganisation of the public service to meet the challenges of the present day. This is a process which will continue at departmental level under my aegis as Minister for the Public Service.  Looking at all the relevant factors, I can confidently recommend the provisions of this Bill to the House as part of this process and as a major step towards providing this country with more effective and efficient Government machinery.</P>

      <P>Nobody believes that what was read out here today by the <Col N="1420" /> Minister for Labour and for the Public Service is the reason why the number of Ministers of State is being increased from ten to 15.  When the original Bill came before the House two-and-a-half years ago we welcomed it because we recognised that the work of Government was much more demanding than it had been when the original limits were set. We agreed to the amendment and, as the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, just mentioned, we suggested that perhaps ten were not enough.  At the time the Tánaiste was in charge of the Bill and he said that the Government had considered it very carefully and that ten was sufficient.  This is a matter of the restructuring of the Government and the Taoiseach should be here to justify his reasons for wishing to increase the number of Ministers of State from ten to 15. This is the second occasion when under a Fianna Fáil Government there were increases and the Taoiseach did not come into the House to justify these extra posts.  The last time, the Tánaiste justified this as being primarily a matter for the Minister for the Public Service and I presume the Minister for Labour who will be Minister for the Public Service on the passing of this Bill is justifying it on the same grounds.  This is not a sufficient reason.  It is technically a matter for the Minister for the Public Service to guide legislation of this nature or to have it initiated in his name but it is a matter of restructuring the Government and is a decision taken by the Taoiseach of the day.  I do not think the Minister will pretend he knew about, or was consulted about, the proposed change before he read of it in the newspapers on the morning of 14 December.  The Minister said in the course of his speech:</P>
      <P>Our experience in the last two years or so has convinced us of the necessity of having the number of Ministers of State increased to 15.</P>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to reply to my suggestion that the first he knew of the proposal to increase the number was when he read it on 14 December.</P>

      <P>I do not believe any Member would pretend that there was any other reason for the appointment of the extra five Ministers of State than the fact that there are political debts to be paid off.  When speaking during the Adjournment Debate the Taoiseach justified the appointment of the extra five Ministers on the basis that when the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1977 was going through the House the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy FitzGerald, welcomed it.  That is so, and it is possible that if we felt this Bill was being put forward to aid Government we would accept the reasons given by the Minister for Labour.  However, we do not agree with the Bill because we believe the motives for introducing it and increasing the number are suspect.  In the course of his contribution to the debate on 13 December, as reported at column 2054 of the Official Report, Deputy FitzGerald stated:</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with the question of the appointments of the Ministers of State.  The Taoiseach referred to my remarks at a time when the numbers were increased to ten.  He was quite right.  It has been my view that in one sense we are undergoverned. There are too few people of ability engaged in the work of government. We need more such people engaged in this work, but the need is for people with a capacity to take on economic and social problems, to have the imagination to tackle them and the willingness to get down to and stay at their desks getting on with the job.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be harsh but I have to say that the appointments so far made do not conform to this need.  I should like to leave aside from this criticism Deputy Moore.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the changes in the personnel appointed by the Taoiseach to the ten posts of Ministers of State on that date.  Deputy FitzGerald continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining new appointments, I am afraid, are too obviously a reward for political services to one section of <Col N="1422" /> one party and do not offer any realistic prospect of an improvement in the quantity or quality of the Government in tackling the actual tasks to be undertaken inside Government Departments.  Those appointments which have this characteristic and will be seen by objective obser vers as having this characteristic&mdash;I do not think that in this I will be seen as making any kind of political point because it is the view widely shared by people who are not particularly political.</P>
    <P>Those comments were true and were borne out by statements in the national newspapers the following morning.  <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that ten new Ministers of State were appointed and five more would be named when the Act governing their appointment could be changed as the Taoiseach continued to reward those who backed him in the struggle for leadership.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> stated that Charlie's men came in for their own reward when he announced ten Ministers of State; Jack's men had been purged in the reshuffle of the second string.  <i>The Irish Press</i> said that the new appointments would be welcomed by supporters of the seven Deputies appointed while the return to the backbenches of four of the outgoing Ministers would add to the seeds of bitterness already sown with the ending of the services of four of the previous Cabinet.  The paper also stated that Deputy Haughey's obligations to reward those who worked for his election could be matched by an equally important need to alleviate bitterness which could now be built up into a permanent hostility.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> stated that four more of Jack's team retreated to the obscurity of the backbenches.</P>
    <P>This provision will not do the House, the Government, democracy or politics here any good.  I do not think anything happened since 14 December that would make a neutral observer feel that the appointments were, to use the words of the Minister for Labour, part of a major step towards providing this country with more effective and efficient government machinery.  Does anybody believe that <Col N="1423" /> the changes made in the second string of Ministers last December improved the position or that the appointment of the additional five Ministers will provide more effective and efficient government machinery?  I do not intend naming the Members appointed before Christmas because many of them are decent, hard working and well-intentioned people but a number of them will not be successes in their jobs.  The team which now forms the second string of Ministers is weaker than that which existed up to last November.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the response Deputy Barry Desmond received to a parliamentary question last week as to the cost of fitting out Ministers of State with cars.  Deputy Desmond was told that the cost of providing a car and drivers was £33,000 annually but we must add to that the cost of a private office, telephones and the back-up facilities available to a Minister of State.  That would increase the figure to £75,000.  It is because of that that we are talking about adding £500,000 to the cost of government at a time when many things are being cut out of Estimates under the guise of belt-tightening.  Small items such as grants to museums, the ICA and others, which have been discontinued, when totalled would not come anywhere near the cost of providing the new Ministers of State with cars and offices. Nobody denies that our Ministers have a heavy and onerous task to perform. There is an enormous amount of travelling attached to the post, a lot of detailed work to be done and attendance required here regularly.  We were given to understand when the other Ministers of State were appointed that Government Ministers would be available more often but that did not happen.  We have not seen Government Ministers very often and the workload is left to Ministers of State who do not have the final responsibility and are not in a position to give final answers.  I accept that Ministers must attend functions outside the country and that during our Presidency of the EEC there was a lot of extra work involved. Had this Bill been introduced at <Col N="1424" /> that time we would have understood the need for the appointment of additional Ministers of State.  Had the Government told us prior to the Irish Presidency that there was a need to increase the number we would have welcomed such a move. If that had been done then there would have been a welcome for it from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>However, the motives behind the introduction of this measure today are suspect and can be interpreted, both inside and outside the House, only as a means of rewarding those people who the Taoiseach considers must be rewarded. In this regard I can only quote from reports in the four national newspapers on the day after the announcement of this measure.  The line taken by all four was that the Taoiseach had to create more jobs in order to reward his friends. This measure will not be interpreted in any other way.  The reason given by the Minister for the measure is, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We have an active joint committee of both Houses looking into the affairs of the commercial State-sponsored bodies: a Bill to establish the Office of Ombudsman has been introduced: and the present measure will ensure that the number of Members of the Oireachtas answerable to the Houses for the management of the public business is brought to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>I am not a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies but so far as I am aware neither Ministers nor Ministers of State appear before that committee.</P>

      <P>I have been surprised often by some of the speeches emanating from Government benches in supporting the various measures being put forward but I am astonished at the effrontery of the Minister for Labour in respect of the case he is making in defence of this Bill. Deputy Barry said he doubted that anybody on this side of the House believed the argument being offered.  I wonder whether the Minister believes it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary to note the comparison with the situation today and the situation as it was some time ago when this move was mooted but before going into that I wish to say something about the extraordinary specious arguments advanced by the Minister in relation to the Bill.  A major point he made&mdash;and this was a general point&mdash;was by way of his reference to both aspects of the Bill. He told us that the Bill represented a reorganisation of Government services to meet the challenges of the present day. He went into some detail on the first aspect of the Bill, that is, the transfer of the Department of the Public Service from the Minister for Finance to the <Col N="1427" /> Minister for Labour.  One could agree with much of what the Minister said without agreeing that this necessarily involved such transfer.  The more obvious explanation is that the Minister for Finance is not up to dealing with the Department of the Public Service.  To put the kind of gloss on the situation that the Minister put on it only makes the Minister for Finance look even more unfortunate than he has been made to look in the past couple of days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that this Bill could be brought in by the Government with the supporting argument that it involved a reorganisation of Government services to meet the challenges of the present day, within three months of that Government abolishing one of the major institutional and administrative innovations ever effected by an Irish Government.  I refer to the Department of Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that we did not oppose the setting up of that Department. I can remember the Deputy soon to become Minister for Economic Planning and Development berating us, and with some reason, at our modest complaints about the scope of the new Department's proposed activities saying that the Coalition were in power and asking what innovations did they make? We accepted that this was a major innovation but we did not make any secret of our belief that it was inadequate.</P>
      <P>We are now being asked by the Government, who abolished their own innovation because they apparently regarded it as useless, negative and a delusion of some sort, to agree to the allocation of certain functions from one Department to another and to agree to the creation of five ministerial jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other part of the Minister's speech to which I listened with growing disbelief was his assertion that what led <Col N="1428" /> him and his Government to take this step has been &ldquo;our experience of the last two years or so&rdquo;.  It is obvious that the experience which led the Government to this deed was not the experience of the last two years or so but the experience of the two or three days between the vote in the Fianna Fáil party rooms and the vote on the floor of this House for the election of a new Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>That was an experience which one could sense in this House on the day the new Taoiseach was elected.  It was so tangible one could practically carve it up and sell it in lumps to visiting American tourists.  No one who was here on that day, when the newly-elected Taoiseach, in his first announcement to the Dáil, revealed that he proposed to come back to the Dáil to ask for sanction for five new ministerial posts, will forget the atmosphere of shock and almost disbelief and astonishment that reigned on these benches, and I suspect in some quarters on the Fianna Fáil benches as well, when that announcement was made.</P>
    <P>What is obviously taking place now is the cosmeticisation of the naked political realities we saw on the floor of this House on that occasion.  It is a political back-hander of the most sordid kind. Deputy Barry has already spoken of it in terms of rewards made available by the Taoiseach to certain of his supporters.  I have no objection to the Taoiseach rewarding anybody who votes for him. He can invite them to champagne parties in Kinsealy or do anything he likes, but I do have an objection to these rewards being paid out of the public purse, and that is precisely what is being done in this measure.</P>
    <P>We are not even sure that a reward system is actually what is operating here because there are two ways at looking at this.  You can look at it as a reward system&mdash;we will know in more detail when the names are announced exactly which prognosis is more accurate&mdash;but you can also look at it as a sticking plaster system in which the Taoiseach will not be rewarding the people who supported him, he has probably done that already, but he will be making sure <Col N="1429" /> that the very fragile, very secret, coalition which exists within Fianna Fáil at this moment and which has existed ever since the election of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach does not suffer any permanent or serious damage.</P>
    <P>We heard enough laughter from the Government benches over the last two-and-a-half years about what went on under the National Coalition.  It is no secret I would not support everything done under that Government, but at least the National Coalition was a public coalition. What we have on the Government benches at present is a private coalition whose shape and activities we can only discern by seeing the occasional outward actions that betoken activity within.</P>
    <P>It is like the story of the two blind men who were asked to describe an elephant. One of them touched the elephant on the leg and said it was like a wall and the other touched the tail and said it was like a snake.  All we know is that something is going on.  We have a rough idea from time to time when something breaks the surface, and obviously something is breaking here.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill, the Minister went into some detail about how useful Ministers of State would be.  The experience of the last two years has shown that the main functions of Ministers of State have been taking political heat off Ministers who should be in here bearing it.  I have no personal animosity for Deputy O'Malley who was Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, but we did not see him in this House for months. It was left to his deputies to carry the can on prices and many similar areas where he was very justifiably exposed to attack from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>When we come to considering the fact that more Ministers of State are to be appointed the problem we have to consider is that not all the existing ten Ministers of State are bad.  One or two are half reasonable.  I will spare their blushes by not naming them.  On that basis, there is a possibility that one of the five to be appointed will be worth his job.</P>

In the British House of Commons the newly-elected Government have enough jobs to give approximately one job for every one-in-three of their supporters on the Government benches.

I do not see that kind of precedent being followed very rapidly by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall the inference the Minister sought to bring to bear on this problem was that we would have a better democracy in this State and in this House by the appointment of five extra card carrying members of the Fianna Fáil party who would have certain as yet unspecified responsibilities on behalf of the public.  He has not even told us which Departments they are likely to be assigned to.  I do not think anybody would disagree that our democratic structures and process need to be looked at and overhauled from time to time and that the Oireachtas is not as responsive to the public and to the electorate as many people, including many Deputies on the Government benches, would like it to be.  The answer to that problem is <Col N="1431" /> reform of the Oireachtas structures, not the appointment of extra bodies to fill extra seats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember 5 July 1977 and the acceptance speech of Deputy Lynch on his election as Taoiseach.  He chose as his theme&mdash;every Taoiseach chooses a theme or two for that speech&mdash;an unusual subject, reform of the public service, administrative reform. That was what Deputy Lynch, and presumably the Government he led, regarded as the first priority.  He admitted two or three times in the course of his speech that it required political will, and that political will would be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>As the months went by I asked a couple of questions to find out how the Government assessed the progress they had made in public service reform, and in one of the replies I was told that they regarded the extension of the second-row ministerial ranks from seven to ten as a substantial public service reform.  I spoke at length on the Bill that effected that change.  I said that it was contemptible to the extent that it reflected the awful Paddy Whack inferiority complex which that party have in their bones.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; which had been good enough for Willie Cosgrave, for deValera, for Seán Lemass and for Liam Cosgrave was somehow not good enough any longer because the people whom we met, the neighbours, were confused because in France, Germany and in other countries they tended to regard a secretary, no matter how qualified the title might be, as a mere official&mdash;they did not recognise that behind that title a throbbing political animal lurked.  And so people like Deputy MacSharry and his colleagues who had been made Parliamentary Secretaries by Deputy Lynch, so that their real nature would not be disguided for our neighbours, had to be given this upgrading of title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the same kind of thing in the Army from time to time, just because our rank insignia and titles were different from others and because we had not the courage to stand on our own feet and to do our own thing, and let the other people <Col N="1432" /> get puzzled by it and come and say &ldquo;Tell us what is going on&rdquo;.  But we traipse after the English every time.  We are perfectly willing to encounter people like the Chinese or the Vietnamese and humbly try to pick up clues from them about how they run things, but when it comes to running our State in our own way, creating our own posts, our own titles and our own structures, there is not a possibility of it, especially when the Soldiers of Destiny occupy the Government benches.</P>
    <P>I suggest that any fair assessment of the history of the State&mdash;I admit a period of initiation is more favourable to innovation than any other period&mdash;would agree that the only serious innovative spirit ever seen here was between 1922 and 1932.  Things were done then of a drastic innovative character compared with anything done since.  The establishment of the State's institutions, the establishment of a judicial structure which the people could respect, were done and the entire apparatus of symbolism and of ceremonial which surround these things, and are an important part of the working of the State, were cast out of raw materials by the first Government.  In many cases they were given a distinctive Irish shape.</P>
    <P>Since then, for the most part anything that has happened has been the destruction and the diminution and blurring of these native models and their replacement, when they have been replaced at all, by something slavishly taken from the English.  All you have to do is put your hand in your pocket and look at the coinage it brings forth, the size, the shape of our decimal coinage&mdash;the design, of course, a monument as much to the vanity as to the taste of the present head of the Government, who personally assumed responsibility for it and gloried in it until it was pointed out to him that it was ugly and inappropriate&mdash;that coinage was copied from the English, and the decimal coinage was introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree I have been going far afield.  This Bill fits into the pattern of the public service reform which the last Taoiseach on forming his Government held out to the Dáil as being a first priority.  What happened?  He upgraded the title of Parliamentary Secretary, which had been good enough for all his predecessors, because the neighbours did not understand it.  Where did he get the title &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo;?  Where did he run to for that?  Was it to the Italians, Russians, the Chinese?  No.  He did not run further than London for it.  He made ten of them while he was at it, not seven.</P>
      <P>We have been told here again, with unparalleled impertinence, by the Minister who spoke a few moments ago, that the new office created in 1977 would be &ldquo;an office with greater responsibility&rdquo;. I defy Deputy Calleary opposite me to tell me what greater responsibility does a Minister fo State in the Office of Public Works or elsewhere have than the corresponding Parliamentary Secretary had under Deputy Liam Cosgrave's Government.  I have no personal spleen about this, but I have a general anger about the way the country is being run, not only by this Government but by their predecessors in some respects.  I have a particular anger about the sham and the cod and the loping after the English.  However, it is not any personal experience of mine that adds to my sense of outrage about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Parliamentary Secretary for four years in the office of the Taoiseach and simultaneously in the Department of Foreign Affairs for two years&mdash;according to Deputy Lynch I had a title which was misleadingly modest&mdash;I was paid only half what either Deputy Lalor or Deputy Andrews were being paid when they were upgraded.  It took the two of them to do the job that I did. Deputy Bruton for two years was simultaneously Parliamentary Secretary to the Departments of Education and Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Bruton <Col N="1434" /> has an even harder case than I.  I do not mean a hard personal case&mdash;I am sure it would not cross his mind to make this calculation&mdash;I am trying to put into perspective what are supposed to be the &ldquo;greater responsibilities&rdquo; of these Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities carried by Deputies Lalor and Andrews, two decent gentlemen and, I should like to think, two friends of mine, were roughly half the responsibilities I carried and approximately one-third of what Deputy Bruton carried.  He had Education and both sections in Industry and Commerce which were given to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Ray Burke.  Where is the &ldquo;greater responsibility&rdquo;?  There is not any.  The sections which were assigned to me in Foreign Affairs are the same as those assigned to Deputy Andrews when he was Minister of State.</P>
    <P>In other words, the workload has shrunk: less work is expected from more office-holders, at least less work of the kind they are paid to do.  But of course that is not the whole story, because to the extent that their load is lighter in their Departments they have more time for other things.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to mention a Deputy against whom I have no personal spleen although I have, on a couple of occasions, asked questions about him in the House.  I think he resented it and felt that I was in some way out to do him down.  I was not.  I give the House my word that I have absolutely no reason to persecute this Deputy, now a Minister, personally in any way at all.  But the conspicuous manner in which he seemed to restrict his public duties to his own constituency struck me time and again.  I asked questions about it, not because I had anything against him, but because he seemed to be a particularly flagrant offender in this regard.  I call it an offender, because he is not a Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary for one county, or one and a half counties, but for the whole State, if the title means anything at all.  That Deputy has since become Minister for Agriculture.  He is one of the <Col N="1435" /> Gang of Four, or the gang of whatever it is supposed to be that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps that phrase &mdash;Gang of Four&mdash;is not yet sufficiently housetrained or domesticated to be acceptable among the exquisite sensibilities represented in this House, and I am sorry I used it.  But at any rate it is said that the Deputy about whom I am <Col N="1436" /> speaking was one of the small group of conspirators who effected the change in the leadership of his party.  It is in no sense of resentment or personal pique&mdash;in fact I scarcely know the Deputy; my contacts with him have always been civil and polite; I have never had any trouble with him, in the House or anywhere else&mdash;and I do not in any way intend this as a specifically personal attack.  But it is a useful thing that I happened to spot his form earlier on, because it enables me to track the way in which the duties of these Ministers of State, with extended responsibilities, were performed.</P>
      <P>I have here a file&mdash;I do not guarantee that it is a complete file but I imagine it is a reasonably representative file&mdash;of speeches made by Deputy MacSharry, now Minister for Agriculture, in the year 1978.  In case anyone suspects the provenance of this material, I want to explain to the House how it comes.  The office in my party rooms which has these files does not go round clipping the contents out, or especially requesting them in the case of any individuals.  We merely get the ordinary Government Information Services circulation, like many other people in the House, and as I do also personally.  I need not tell the House that the speeches are never read, or almost never read, but are distributed into files under the names of the respective officeholders in case they are ever needed, and they usually are not needed.  But they are there now anyway, and here is Deputy MacSharry's record so far as it remains in the imperishable printed word for the year 1978.</P>
      <P>He addressed five meetings in Dublin, all in the middle of the week, needless to say, because it would be impossible for him to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On Wednesday 5 April he addressed a reception in the Institute of Public Administration, another matter <Col N="1437" /> perfectly relevant to his job as Minister of State in the Department of the Public Service.  On 23 March of that year he addressed members of the Public Service Advisory Council.  On 23 February he addressed the people who attended the inauguration of the degree of Bachelor of Public Administration at UCD, again in Dublin.  His only other engagement&mdash;at least I do not guarantee that the list is complete but certainly no one has picked and chosen; anything we have here, as far as I know, is what we got from the Government Information Services&mdash;on 9 February was when he addressed the Civil Service Training Centre at Lansdowne House.  These were five functions, all in Dublin, all carried out on a Wednesday or Thursday; no other day of the week features in Dublin.  Every other single function in respect of which that Deputy, now Minister for Agriculture, handed out a script, or had a formal government script, took place in his own constituency.  So far as Deputy MacSharry, now Minister for Agriculture, was concerned no other county in Ireland existed except Sligo and Leitrim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am falling over backwards to make it clear that I have no personal animus at all.  Perhaps the <Col N="1439" /> Chair would accept my word of honour that I have no personal animus at all against this Deputy.  I single him out, it is true, through the accident that I happened to spot his form, so to speak, in this regard, and I am juxtaposing this public record with what was said in the House here by the Minister who moved this Bill in the House half an hour ago when he described the office which Deputy MacSharry then occupied&mdash;and all the other ones, the other six&mdash;as a &ldquo;new office of Minister of State with greater responsibilities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am trying to show how those responsibilities were discharged.  I am trying to insinuate, indeed I am saying flatly that the purpose of these appointments, or at any rate the result of these appointments, was merely to create an office holder who would have more freedom of action and influence in his own constituency, and that is not good enough. Above all it is not good enough to sell it to the people, or get the people to pay for it under the name of &ldquo;public service reform&rdquo;.  That is a brazen piece of cynicism.  It may have some function. Perhaps it does fulfil a useful political function.  No doubt a party which has absolute belief in its own rightness must be allowed a certain amount of leeway in making sure that it is not put out of office. But to represent it as a &ldquo;public service reform&rdquo; is a piece of brazen absurdity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened in the public service since 1977, since the change of Government?  I will tell the House one thing that has happened.  I am not so sure that there was any visible reform; certainly I have not seen anything very much.  As Deputy Horgan said, we did have an innovatory new Department which was not allowed to exist as much as two and a half years before it was scrapped, although of course the man who scrapped it is on record&mdash;and I will come to that when I have a chance to speak on the budget&mdash;as being in favour of resuming economic planning and giving it a better status.  He said in a speech a week before the dissolution of the last Dáil that that was the most conspicuous <Col N="1440" /> innovation and it has, as Deputy Horgan said, been cancelled out.  What have we had in public service reform?  What other high profile feature on the public service landscape is there?  When we left office after having incurred a good deal of unpopularity both inside and outside the House for having applied, in the public interest, an embargo on recruitment to the civil service, there were 48,600 civil servants.  That was far too many.  It was the equivalent of three army divisions with support troops, lines of communications, cooks, troops, entertainers and so on.  That was in 1977.  As recently as 1950 there were less than 30,000 people in the civil service.  I know that a lot of things have happened since then but not so much as to justify an increase of that order.</P>
    <P>It would be more important in the context of civil service reform to get value for the money spent on 48,600 people, on three divisions of civil servants&mdash;an army corps.  That is an unpopular thing to talk about.  It can cost votes.  The Government, because they are the Government they are, because they never risk unpopularity if some cheap stroke can rescue them from it, did not devote their attention to that. They recruited more civil servants; and the number we had in January, 1980, as I have been informed by the Minister's own Department, is 53,800.  That is an increase of 5,200 over the number of people in July 1977.</P>
    <P>One can be misled by global figures.  It is possible that many new tasks and functions have to be performed which it is not possible to do with 48,600 civil servants and that would justify the extra recruitment.  However, it is more likely that the extra recruitment was a deliberate part of the effort to prove that the new administration were able to make a dent in unemployment by taking up school leavers.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of making a dent in unemployment figures but not by way by making jobs which do not produce wealth but only consume it.  In order to pay a relatively junior civil servant with a salary of £5,000 per annum, before <Col N="1441" /> one can assess the cost of that single post one must add something for the building, heating, various overheads, office equipment, desk, table, allowances, superannuation, travel expenses and so on and, taking into account the cost of renting or building these days, one could double that figure in order to get the true annual cost of an extra civil service post. If we assume that each of the 5,200 extra people in the public service which, after three years of that Government is the only conspicuous difference between the state of the public service and when we left it, I am not too far away from the mark in saying that people are paying £50 million a year for those jobs.  If one assumes an annual salary of £5,000 &mdash;some have more and some have less&mdash; that is £25 million, double it and it is £50 million.  The health boards have shown an even more dramatic rise compared with when we left office.  There are over 8,000 more people employed in the health boards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to produce the revenue to pay the salary of a single civil service post, even allowing for the fact that some of it will be clawed back in tax, five or six other citizens have to work.  It takes the total tax contribution of five or six other citizens to pay that salary.  Some of them are in the public service but some are in wealth producing jobs.  It inhibits their capacity to invest, and their incentive if that extra burden is placed on them.  That is the only reform which the Department, now presided over by Deputy Fitzgerald, has to show that can be seen above the skyline. Perhaps there are reforms of a kind which are not visible, and if so I would be happy to hear about them.  The only reforms which are visible about the <Col N="1442" /> skyline are the extra 5,200 jobs which are fed into the propaganda machine that they have done this and that to relieve unemployment.  Of course there is no limit, if one does not mind borrowing from the Japs and Germans, to the number of jobs one can create if one just sticks people behind desks and gets them to push paper around to one another. But someone must pay for those jobs.</P>
      <P>We are now getting another stroke in the field of public service reform.  We will get not seven or even ten but 15 of these people with &ldquo;special new responsibility&rdquo;. I have demonstrated by reference to Deputy MacSharry's record that the stuff about responsibility can be dismissed with a horse laugh.  They will be doing far less work than any of the parliamentary secretaries I worked with did, and even less than the Ministers of State before today have been doing.  The work will be spread more thinly.</P>
      <P>There is an undoubted need for more political gumption and more instructed and understanding political will in Government.  The leader of my party said that in 1977 and I accept it.  It cannot always be got by simply promoting persons who got into the Dáil, thus demonstrating a range of abilities which are undoubtedly very unusual and respectable but which are by no means the kind of abilities necessary to run a Department or even a fragment of a Department.  If they are short of talent, there is an option open to the Government. Knowing Deputy Haughey's weakness for the cheap stroke which captures the cheap headline, I would not be surprised if he was to try this when he or the Government appoint the extra office holders.  To the extent that I am suggesting this myself I will be inhibited from criticising him if he does do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution under Article 28 specifies that the Government are to consist of not more than 15 members, and of those any two except the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance may be Members of the Seanad. They do not have to be Deputies.  A Government, newly elected, are in the happy situation that they can nearly <Col N="1443" /> determine about one-third of the people who will be in the Seanad.  The Taoiseach has 11 direct nominations and I know from my own experience that a political party which is serious in the way it does its business can put another handful of people into the Seanad although it is not possible to absolutely control beyond a certain point the franchise of the Seanad electorate.  There is a fair chance that one can put another few people one particularly wants to see in into the Seanad.  Something like up to 20 people, between the nominees and the people whose election can be organised at long or short range, can be put into the Seanad by a Government out to get talent.</P>
    <P>It has always seemed strange to me that&mdash;I am not pointing the finger at Fianna Fáil particularly but I do not think we ever did it except in the days of the first Government&mdash;the possibility of having as many as two people who are not Members of the Dáil, members of the Government, has not been availed of. I am not a complete baby in politics, although I am not as cute as many of my friends and colleagues, but I know that there would be great resentment in a political party if the people who bore the heat and burden of the day were passed over in favour of someone who has never had to get up a political sweat, so to speak, brought in from some profession or industry and put in charge of the Department.  Of course he will be resented. That is one of the penalties, burdens and natural handicaps that one has to carry if one is trying to do a job properly.  That is the Government, strictly so called.  Any two Members of the Government can be drawn from the Seanad as long as they are not the Taoiseach himself, the Tánaiste or the Minister for Finance.  When it comes to the rank of office holder that we are talking about here this afternoon, Ministers of State, there is no such limitation.  It would be possible to fill every single one of these jobs from the Seanad, at least constitutionally&mdash;I am not sure if the legislation allows it, I think it does as a matter of fact, but I am talking off the <Col N="1444" /> top of my head now and am not certain.</P>
    <P>I genuinely do not like saying something hurtful about the Deputies, I have nothing against them and no special reason to distrust them any more than I distrust the whole party over there.  I do not want to hurt the people in these offices, but must say that even charity stops short at calling them the best men for the job.  There are some exceptions as Deputy Horgan has said but, by and large, the appointments made here last December are ones of which even charity would feel ashamed to say that these are the best men for the job.  If we are going to get five more of these, charity will have an even harder time in putting a face on what is going on.  I hope that the Government, when it comes to making these appointments of people who are going to carry heavy responsibilities and get ahead with the job of running this vibrant, new, dynamic State with all the tasks ahead of us and so forth, will appoint people who look as though they are capable of doing these jobs, who look as though they know and understand what these jobs are and are really able to manage a Department and not have to have their hands held and their ears whispered into all the time.  In that respect, I would not personally complain if the Government looked to the other House as well as to this, for people to fill these posts.  I have a feeling that, since the leader of the Government is a man who cannot resist a day or two in the headlines, we may easily see a Senator or a couple of Senators appointed to one or more of these new positions.  This is exactly the kind of stroke which would appeal to him, very easy to do but in this particular case, also, there is something to be said for it.  So far as I am concerned, he would disarm me so far as that is worth anything to him by doing this and it would be a useful precedent as well.  I do not want to rehash things again. Everything that Deputy Barry and Deputy Horgan said about this being a naked pay-off for political support, I go along with.  I do think that these appointments are unnecessary.  They will be particularly unnecessary if people who are <Col N="1445" /> not really fit to hold them are put into them.  They are unecessary and extremely expensive.  It is a shame, as Deputy Horgan said, that the people should be asked to pay another £½ million a year&mdash;this is a very conservative estimate&mdash;for the establishment of five men who would simply be behaving during the rest of the time they are in office in the way that the present Minister for Agriculture behaved when he was Minister of State.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the pressure on what I might call the serious office holders is appalling and ought to be relieved.  Any serious measure designed to do that&mdash;whether by the appointment of auxuliaries, co-adjutors or the simplification of Dáil business or anything of that kind&mdash;I would go along with very gladly.  I spoke at length in the autumn of 1977 when the last Bill in this series was before the House, on the ghastly pressures on Members of the Government, as I was able to observe them during my time as Government Whip.  The fact that we changed sides does not alter my view.  Members of a government do need to be protected from being screwed into the ground by the grinding round of engagements to which they leave themselves open, which they feel they have to go along to and which people wish upon them.</P>
    <P>I do not care what party forms a Government.  My opinion of the other side is, I suppose, known to them.  I am not going to make any pretence about it, the sooner they leave office, the better I shall like it.  At the same time, the people did elect them and they should be given a fair chance, so long as they are there, to do the job which they were elected to do and they should certainly be protected from having their health ruined and being visibly ground down by the demands which it is now commonplace to lay on Ministers.  A member of a Government is entitled to be ruthless in demanding eight hours' sleep for himself and a weekend for himself or a day or two for himself and his family every week.  In fact, he is not doing a job properly unless he does so.  These additional appointments must <Col N="1446" /> be genuine appointments of people who can really do the work so that they will relieve the pressure on the existing officers; I would support that.</P>
    <P>I would also support, as I have said here umpteen times before, a further reform of Dáil procedure of a kind which would take the pressure particularly off members of the Government.  I can claim credit for one substantial improvement in the rearrangement of the sitting hours. We do not have to sit here until 10.30 or 11.00 every night.  I would go far further than that and would have done so if I had got the agreement of the representatives on the far side on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  For example, it is insane that Ministers should have to hang around here until the end of business at a time when they are not wanted for any business of their own in the House, merely to record their votes.  I realise that it cannot constitutionally be otherwise on Committee Stages of Bills but there would be a great case for postponing votes on Second and Fifth Stages of Bills in the way that votes on Estimates are postponed and in that way let the Ministers go home and put their feet up.  If they feel that tired, they should do so, or go back to the office and do more work if they are not tired.  There is a great case for reform along these lines. Even if this particular move which the Bill here today represents will do something to alleviate the personal, physical, mental and moral strain on Ministers, it will at least have that much to be said for it, if no more.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This Bill proposes to amend the law in at least two ways, firstly by providing that the Minister for the Public Service may be a Minister other than a Minister for Finance.  With that amendment I agree.  To have it obligatory for a Minister for Finance to be a Minister for the Public Service is wrong.  He is not the appropriate Minister, because he would always have a vested interest which might not necessarily be in favour, or in the interest, of discharging his duties as Minister for the Public Service in an impartial and objective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> The Bill also proposes to amend the law by increasing from ten to 15 the number of Ministers of State who may be appointed.  I am against that amendment and very much against it at this time.  It is inappropriate, at this time of national recession, national cut-back and at a time when the Taoiseach and other Ministers are exhorting people to tighten their belts and work harder, to add another £½ million to the Exchequer bill by appointing five new Ministers of State.  It is not right to appoint five new Ministers of State now under this administration, because such evidence as we have goes to show clearly that the nation is not getting value for money. Thirdly, these new Ministers of State should not be appointed because the evidence clearly goes to show that the appointments are being made at the request of the Taoiseach in order to repay political debt incurred by him during his election as Taoiseach.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am making a political charge only.  The five new Ministers of State are being appointed by the Taoiseach to reward the appointees for political services rendered to the Taoiseach.  We are now living in a time <Col N="1448" /> of national recession, national stringency.  Every time the Taoiseach has spoken since assuming office he has told the nation that it is living beyond its means, that it is not working hard enough, that it is borrowing too much and that our balance of payments is haywire.  As evidence of that some stringent cut-backs appear in the Book of Estimates and some mean reductions have been made.  For example, a scheme that is very important in my constituency and in the western constituencies known as the local improvements scheme and which was extended under Deputy Lynch's administration from under £2 million to £2,750,000 is being cut back this year to £2 million.  Does Deputy Calleary not know this?</P>

In this time of economic stringency and recession it is wrong to appoint five additional Ministers of State at a cost of £500,000.  If the economy were buoyant, no shortage of money, no request to other people to work harder or cut back on spending or do with less there might be something to be said for appointing these Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go into personalities but there is no doubt that the Taoiseach has not availed, when filling the ten offices of Ministers of State, of the best material available in his own party.  And that is an understatement.  It is also true that some&mdash;and I emphasise some&mdash;of the Ministers of State appointed obviously misunderstand their duties and do not accept that it is their duty to serve the country.  They have stated that it is their duty to look after their own constituencies. Nothing could be further from the truth.  It would appear from their statements since they were appointed that is what they regard as their duty&mdash;some of them.  I shall not sort them out and name them.  I think we must assume that the same criteria will be followed and the same qualifications accepted when the Taoiseach is appointing the next five and that he will go on the basis of rewarding <Col N="1450" /> people in his party for political services rendered to him and totally disregard whether those being appointed are the best qualified for the posts.  That is why I am completely against the appointment of these five additional Ministers of State at this time.</P>

      <P>Not only does everything I said in my opening adress stand but having heard the Opposition speakers it is obvious that they themselves were not convinced of the validity of the objections they were offering to the Bill.  First, may I thank them for their interest and their contributions?  At least they welcomed some sections of the Bill and eventually I think it developed into a political issue on the question of appointing extra Ministers of State.  It is not necessary for me to stand here to establish or uphold the integrity of the Taoiseach.  His record in the House, his service to the Government, his experience in government and his undoubted contribution in government over many years give him advantages that are perhaps not available among the Opposition parties and which perhaps they would like to have.</P>
      <P>I think I established at the outset the many reasons why it is now necessary to appoint extra Ministers of State.  Opposition speakers spoke of the additional cost.  Some of them are people with business involvement and cost is important. I am sure that Deputy Barry will appreciate as much as anybody else that that cost is an investment in greater government efficiency and greater availability for a population which deserve the highest performance at government and public service level. This is the essential point in these additional posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very amused at Deputy Kelly who launched a rather unfair attack on the civil service and the lack of necessity <Col N="1451" /> for extra civil servants being appointed between 1977 and January of this year. He took pride in claiming what a great thing had been done for the country by imposing the embargo on the decision taken by that Government.  Every Deputy knows that that embargo on both pay and recruitment was a major problem in later years.  The results of it were part of the problems which this Government had when they came into office.  He claimed to be proud of that achievement.</P>

      <P>Deputy Horgan does not.  I appreciate the reasons why he does not.  I want to tell Deputy Barry and Deputy Kelly that they succeeded in keeping numbers to a particular figure. Deputy Kelly did not say&mdash;I found this in my Department as did many of my colleagues in their Departments&mdash;that certain essential services to the public were allowed to run down through lack of staff.  Surely our people need a better service from our public service than that?  That was the position that existed when we took office.  I took exception to a very selective reference to the Minister for Agriculture, whom I have known for many years and know to be one of the hardest working and most dedicated Members of this House.  His commitment to political life in his Opposition days and his Government days has been a very complete one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allegations by Deputy Kelly were selective.  He selected a series of speeches which were issued to him from the GIS. It is time that Deputy Kelly grew up in relation to his contributions in the <Col N="1452" /> House.  There is no way that the number of speeches issued through the GIS should be the criteria by which a person doing a reasonable amount of work in his Department is judged.  It is most unfair of Deputy Kelly to be selective in that way and to use criteria which in my opinion are not fair criteria in asserting the performance of a very committed Member of the House for many years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry quoted from some newspapers.  It is true to say that the compliments paid to Deputy MacSharry, the Minister for Agriculture, during our term of the Presidency of the EEC were widespread through all the media.  It was unfair of Deputy Kelly to go into that sort of detail in relation to that Minister.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies referred to the Minister of State appointed last December. I do not have to defend their performance in the House.  I do not have to defend them individually or collectively because their constituencies have for many years returned most of them, well realising their work rate and their commitment to their jobs.  I believe that all of them are not only fitted but also experienced and concerned enough to be appointed to the posts they now hold.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and the Government in appointing those five people will have the same concern that they be people suited to hold the posts, that they be people who will be able to give the extra commitment needed at Government level.</P>
    <P>I want to quote an independent person, an extract from No. 20 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Service.  This is their opinion:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that the responsibilities of Ministers of State are significantly greater than were the responsibilities of Parliamentary Secretaries and we take this into account in our recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy FitzGerald, in December last criticised in a political way the new appointments.  I do not agree with this criticism but I do not deny him the right, as an Opposition Member in politics, to make such a political criticism.  He went on to say that he, too, was satisfied that there may be need for more than ten Ministers of State, as was said when the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1977, was introduced, by the Opposition people on that occasion also.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry said that if this Bill was introduced before the EEC Presidency he would have supported it.  There is an added work load during the period of the country's Presidency of the EEC.  There is no Member in the House, if he is honest, who will say that the work load of the Government and the Ministers has not increased very substantially for the reasons I pointed out so clearly in my opening statement.  I believe that only the best possible service should be provided for our public.  The appointment of those extra Ministers of State will help very much, in conjunction with the many changes which are taking place in the whole public service area, to give the country and our people a better and well deserved service.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the unfair attack on my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.  I could not be happier about his commitment and his performance.  Those people have performed well not only in this House but in their constituencies, and who has greater knowledge of whether people are working than those people who have consistently returned all of them over long periods?</P>

I mentioned that because I thought it was relevant in the context of a Second Stage speech on this measure before us.  Any criticisms offered were purely political.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when replying to the Second Stage debate, said that the last Government brought in an embargo on recruitment in the Civil Service and that this was responsible for the cutting back on services.  I would think that for a Minister of any Government to say that there is an open door for public service recruitment and wage increases is most irresponsible, especially when the cost of public service pay in 1980 is going to run to 50 per cent of the amount of the current budget.  Recruitment in the public service was certainly given free <Col N="1456" /> rein during 1978 and 1979.  If it is not cut back in 1980 there will be a cut-back in services because too much of the amount provided in the Estimates will be eaten up by wage increases and there will be nothing left, as in the case pointed out by Deputy John Bruton in a speech he made about three weeks ago, where the Land Commission, after they had paid wages and everything else for 1980 will have £10 left to buy land.  That is not servicing the ordinary people of the country.</P>
      <P>Obviously we need a civil service, a well paid civil service; I do not mind saying that.  We need an efficient civil service, but we cannot have a level of recruitment into the civil service that unbalances that provided outside the civil service.  That is a self-evident fact.  To plead, as the Minister appeared to be doing a moment ago, that it was a mark of their good Government that they have recruited heavily into the service and given wage increases does not strike me as responsible or something that any Minister in Ireland or anywhere else in the world should be boasting about.  The public service has a role to play.  The level of pay in the public service should be high in comparison with that outside it but one cannot unbalance the very delicate level of what the private sector can afford to pay in taxes to support the public service.  If that is over-balanced in favour of the public service then we are going to have the type of tax revolt experienced over the last 12 months.  It is the level of tax that people are paying that is causing the unrest here and those taxes are being paid to provide services and wages for the public service.  If too much is demanded, as I believe is the case now with 50 per cent of the current budget going to pay for the estimate of the current side of the budget, then we are in danger of becoming unbalanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made by the Minister was about the criteria which the Taoiseach would apply to the five new appointments he is going to make.  Let me put it like this.  I certainly should have said that Deputy Seán Calleary is exempted from any criticisms I may <Col N="1457" /> have had; I have always found him to be intelligent and concerned and hard working.  I am sure the Taoiseach will apply the same criteria to the five new appointments as he did to the appointment of this Government and to the appointment of the Ministers of State before Christmas.</P>

What I said was that the results of the embargo were evident.  I agree entirely with the need for balance but the balance must be two ways.  The balance must be such as to ensure that services are kept at an adequate level to service our public, taking into account the entire cost and particularly the cost of a structural economy such as ours.  What I was referring to was the fact that Deputy Kelly claimed with pride something that I believed had done tremendous harm at the time, that is, in relation to the embargo and the subsequent special pay increases. That caused many more problems in later years than when it was imposed.</P>

      <P>As a result of the rearrangement of the Government before Christmas, the Minister for Labour will now be Minister for the Public Service.  I think that is a more sensible arrangement than that existing heretofore when the Department of the Public Service was connected with the Department of <Col N="1460" /> Finance.  At the time I would probably have thought it better to have the Department of the Public Service tied in with the Department of Finance but it does not appear to have worked.  I know many other Departments considered that financial considerations took precedence in the activities of the Department of the Public Service. However, I may change my mind about the desirability of having the Department connected with the Department of Labour.  I think I am correct in assuming that if there were to be a change in the future there would be no necessity for new legislation?  I think the position is that it can be assigned to any Minister.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress before Question Time I was making the point that one of the major successes of the budget has been to deflect public attention and criticism from the cuts in the Estimates and the capital services.  I was giving chapter and verse for that accusation from the public capital expenditure and current expenditure on education.  I had not mentioned the fact that on the current side some of the most severe cuts would take place in the area of higher education in general and the universities in particular.  The universities have been allocated about 5 per cent more in money terms on the college expenditure side in the Estimates than they were allocated in the previous year.</P>
      <P>The irony here is that even a very sharp increase in university fees, which no doubt we can now expect, would not be enough of itself to cover the shortfall between what the Government are going to make available to universities this year and what they are going to have to spend to maintain their services at last year's level.  The only option will be that the universities will have to cut their services and no parent of any child going to university, however much he may smile at his pay packet after this budget, can afford to look at it without looking also at what is going to be the effect on his child in third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by one aspect of the Taoiseach's speech here this morning when he referred to services, the Public Capital Programme and the Estimates. Obviously replying to criticisms, which have been made very justifiably, he said in effect, that this year's allocations <Col N="1462" /> were&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;&ldquo;sufficient to maintain existing services at a satisfactory level&rdquo;.  That sentence would need to be parsed and analysed very carefully.  He did not say that the allocations were sufficient to maintain existing services at existing levels.  They are not.  He said that they would be sufficient to maintain the existing services.  Naturally, you can hardly close down a service wholesale, but to maintain them at a satisfactory level we must ask the question what is a satisfactory level?</P>
    <P>What is satisfactory to the Taoiseach and to members of the Government may not be satisfactory to members of the public.  The inference which it is legitimate to draw is that people are being asked now to accept less in the way of services than they got last year in order to pay partially for the income tax concessions which are being given in this budget.  In all the important areas, such as local authority housing which has a cut in real terms on last year, education, which, if one ignores teachers' salaries, is cut also on last year, and no doubt health as well, the member of the public would have to realise that before he gets to the bank with whatever he has extra in his pay packet from the income tax concessions, he is going to be hijacked not once but twice, first by the VAT man and by the tradesman and other people who are selling him the things which are being taxed extra in this budget, and, secondly, by the Government, because if he wants to maintain the value of the services in these important areas such as housing, health and education, he will have to dip into his pocket to make good the deficiency which has been built into the Estimates and the capital programme.  The confidence trick of the Government is that the ordinary punters are being led to believe that if they cut down a little bit on the drinks and smokes they will be able to keep all they get back in the way of the extra concession. To put it mildly what is not being emphasised&mdash;one might almost say it is being concealed&mdash;is that they will also have to dip into their pockets to pay extra for the services in these important <Col N="1463" /> areas that would otherwise have been provided for them at the last year's level. It is one thing to talk about discretionary expenditure in relation to drink, alcohol, betting and so on, but when you come to health, education and housing, different members of the public are in very different situations indeed when it comes to filling the chasm which widens in front of them as a result of this year's Estimates. That is the basis for the cynicism of this budget which does not&mdash;as Deputy de Valera's budget did in the olden days&mdash;merely take money out of one pocket and put it back into the other and charge for the privilege.  It takes money out of the two of your pockets and puts it back into only one.  The levels of investment in our social services that this Government consider satisfactory are not regarded as satisfactory by the people on these benches.</P>
    <P>I turn now to taxation in more detail.  I want to underline the fact that, whereas some of the comparatively modest claims that were made by the ICTU in their budget submissions have been met by this budget, the great majority of claims have not.  I can identify them very easily for the benefit of the House.  I have dealt already with the resource tax that has been proposed by the Government, but since this morning suddenly it has become seriously attenuated.  Three of the most important sections of the ICTU's budget submissions dealt with capital taxation.  They pointed out&mdash;the information came partly at least, from a Dáil question which I put down&mdash;that out of a total tax revenue of over £2 billion in 1979 capital taxes are expected to yield less than £15 million which is less than the figure for any of the four previous years.  They say that this is wholly unacceptable.  If that is wholly unacceptable how much more unacceptable is a budget which does not do anything positive in relation to increasing the yield from capital taxes and in fact lessens the yield from capital taxes in certain important respects?</P>
    <P>It seems that nobody on the Government side of the House is prepared to accept that if you relax personal taxation in <Col N="1464" /> order to increase incentive, productivity and so on&mdash;and there are reasonable arguments for this&mdash;an essential concomitant of relief of income tax is a progressive system of taxation on accumulation of capital and wealth. Otherwise you are not encouraging initiative alone, you are encouraging accumulation, and almost inevitably the use of resources not in investment but in ostentation.  I remember reading an article by Senator Whitaker in one of the Sunday papers not so long ago in which he referred very pointedly to the fact that as he saw it one of the main reasons for the tax grievances and for the tax marches was the very large perceived difference in lifestyle between some members of our society and other members. These differences in lifestyle are directly related to the absence of any effective capital taxation system.  The ICTU say in No. 20 of their pre-budget submission, that something should be done about this.  They specifically ask that the wealth tax be reintroduced, that the tax threshold applying to capital acquisitions tax and to capital gains tax should be reduced, certain exemptions amended and the rates of tax raised. They say that particularly short-term capital gains should be treated as income and taxed at the appropriate income tax rate.  I was on the tax march and one placard out of every three asked the Government to bring back the wealth tax.  If the Government think that these concessions relating only to income tax while doing nothing about capital taxation have satisfied the marchers they have another think coming.</P>
    <P>A major aspect of the budget is the change to indirect taxation.  I must pose some very serious questions about this. One of the exceptions I hold relates to smoking.  We were rather surprised that this was not hit more heavily, even though people say that it is harder to give up smoking than to give up drinking. The Government chose to regard this as discretionary and I find it difficult to disagree with them.  A minor item relates to the tax on cigarette lighters.  I do not know who thought of that, but he has a splendid future in front of him <Col N="1465" /> either in the public service or in Government if he is on the Fianna Fáil benches. To have found something that was not taxed before, on which one can put a tax of 20 per cent to which nobody can object, is the mark of genius and I take off my hat to whoever it was.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about the shift to indirect taxation is that we are already very heavily taxed indirectly.  About 55 per cent of our total revenue comes from indirect taxation.  This is one of the highest rates in the EEC.  We already have one of the highest rates of VAT in the EEC.  Indirect taxes, in some respects, especially where VAT and excise duties are concerned are open to evasion by many of the groups who avoid direct taxation.  Indirect taxes are not related to ability to pay but one of the main reasons why I query this shift to indirect taxation is that although workers will continue to carry an unequal share of the tax burden, it is now harder to prove this.  At least under the present income tax system, the unfair burden could be clearly shown.</P>
    <P>How discretionary is expenditure on petrol?  If one lives in Drogheda it is probably quicker to commute to the centre of the city than it is to get from parts of my constituency in south County Dublin.  The Government's failure to adopt a rational comprehensive and co-ordinated transport policy means that for many people a car and petrol is not a luxury if they have to get to work.  If the Government were serious about not wanting to pass this on to the general public in the form of rising prices and so on through industry they could have raised the VAT on petrol instead.</P>
    <P>For large numbers of working people a modest amount of alcohol is fairly discretionary. Many people working in unpleasant surroundings, under considerable stress feel that a pint at the end of the day is as good any time as the business man's gin and topic, but the working man will have less to spend in terms of discretionary expenditure on his pint, for all the tax concessions, than the business man on his gin and tonic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> I was intrigued to hear the Taoiseach remark that the food subsidies were being retained.  Anybody would think that the Taoiseach had introduced them and we were encouraged almost, to forget that a Fianna Fáil Government not only failed to introduce food subsidies but reduced their value by one-third since they came to office.  This should not be forgotten and any attempt by the Government to further reduce these subsidies which unfortunately form a decreasing percentage of the price of some of the stable foods of large numbers of low income families, will be resisted from these benches.</P>
    <P>In relation to income splitting the Government took their courage in both hands in going further than the Supreme Court wanted them, but it raises certain issues which have not apparently been considered.  It makes it more likely that women in general, married women in particular, and married women in the lower income groups most of all, will tend to be forced out of employment and back into the home.  In a socialist philosophy, in a socialist society, we believe in the equal division of labour both inside and outside the home.  It is because I fear that the application of income splitting, unadorned by any serious consideration of some of the social consequences, may have this effect on female employment and on the right of women to work outside the home if they wish, that I must put a question mark against it.  The incentives that income splitting provides are overwhelmingly in the region of those jobs where women are not only better paid but where their employment is better protected often by trade unions.</P>
    <P>In relation to tax on businesses there has been a wholesale ignoring of the very modest requirements of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In item No. 27 of their pre-budget submission they asked that steps be taken to ensure that the companies sector make a bigger contribution to tax revenue.  This year corporation tax is expected to amount to £121 million which represents less than 6 per cent of central Government revenue. <Col N="1467" /> They also argue strongly for the need to review the various reliefs and allowances that have grown up during the years which companies can use to reduce their tax liability.</P>
    <P>On capital taxation the budget provides three things: stock relief, a concession to be continued for a further year at the level which applied in 1979; a special incentive for manufacturing companies, again a concession which involves a special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax, to be extended to 1980 and the big attack on the world of the corporations in Ireland that the deduction for business entertainment expenses for tax purposes will be limited to 50 per cent.  It is extraordinary that anybody can believe that this seriously represents any kind of an attempt to meet the justified call of the labour movement, inside and outside trade unions and on these benches, for a level of company taxation which comes close to meeting some kind of share of the profits they are making. We have the evidence of the Financial Executives Association, as quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 December 1979, that there has been a boom in company liquidity or in the growth of company profits in recent years.  Far from siphoning off anything from this boom the Government are giving even more away.</P>
    <P>The Government are giving more away to the companies and the shareholders at a time when the introduction of new forms of technology make it all the more dangerously likely that these profits, in so far as they are not distributed in dividends, would be used to replace human labour with mechanical labour.  Above all this is a time when the advent of new technology in general, and the microprocessor in particular, should be used by the Government as the excuse and the opportunity to bring in financial and fiscal legislation which would force companies to take a more realistic view of their responsibilities in the employment market.  I do not believe that because the new technology may threaten some jobs we should never introduce it and no <Col N="1468" /> Member of these benches would take that view.  However, we are concerned that the benefits of this new technology should be shared and the extra profits it creates should be used to create extra jobs in the service industry and not simply siphoned off into the pockets of directors and shareholders.</P>
    <P>In relation to social welfare I should like to state that I do not believe that anyone in ICTU fully appreciated the levels that inflation would reach when they asked for a certain rise in the percentage of social welfare benefits.  It is clear when one looks at that situation that we will be lucky if the increase given in the budget will match the inflation that will take place next year and the inflation that took place last year, which the budget increases also intended to cover. When this general approach to social welfare is set against the Taoiseach's action, when he was in charge of the Department concerned, of cutting the funds to the Committee on Poverty it can be said that, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, they do not care much if the poor are always with us.</P>
    <P>I accept that we will always have relative poverty, that there will always be some people who will be relatively better off than others, but it should be part of the aim of any Government of this State to abolish absolute poverty.  That can only be done if the Government have a clear sight of the structural causes of poverty in our society.  The Committee on Poverty were doing that and are continuing to do so with limited resources. They are trying to analyse the structural causes of poverty in our society.  It is because a clear analysis of this kind would threaten the interests represented on the Government benches that money is being denied.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can only express the wish that the person who wrote the Taoiseach's speech had known a little more about some of the metaphors the Taoiseach was advised to use.  In his peroration the Taoiseach referred to the ship of State and the ship of the economy and said, proudly, that in the months and years ahead he would keep <Col N="1469" /> her head to the wind.  The Taoiseach does not know anything about sailing because if he did he would know that when one turns a boat's head into the wind she stops dead.  The Taoiseach should stick to his horses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on an extremely good budget.  At least two Opposition Deputies told me last week that they found it very difficult to compose a speech criticising the Minister's first budget.  They could not do so because what they wanted to see in the budget had been included.  The newspapers, the community, the trade unions and PAYE taxpayers had been greatly concerned about taxation prior to the budget, but that was adequately dealt with by the Minister.  I am aware that, irrespective of the good features of a budget, an Opposition feel obliged to tear it asunder just for the sake of criticising the Government.  However, they cannot criticise the improvements in social welfare benefits or in income tax allowances.</P>
      <P>This is the first time the women of Ireland have really benefited under the income tax code.  I am aware that changes had to be made in the tax system because of a Supreme Court decision, but the Government extended that tax benefit to all married couples. As a result women who decide to remain at home to look after their children will benefit to the same extent as the women who decide to continue working.  It pleases me to hear of women continuing their career after marriage and being able to bring home a decent pay packet every week or month.  Before last Wednesday if a husband was being paid any sort of a decent wage she was stopped tax at the rate of 60 per cent.  The result was that basically it was not worth while continuing to work after marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about all affairs related to women in employment but I am old fashioned enough to express a preference for married women staying at home to look after their children until <Col N="1470" /> they reach a certain age.  It is important that mothers should be at home in their children's formative years.  I believe most Irish mothers would prefer to stay at home.  The budget will benefit such people and will not make them feel inadequate when they hear of their working sisters continuing with their careers.  The woman who stays at home will now feel more content.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge the trade unions only sought a 20 per cent increase in social welfare benefits but everybody was surprised to hear that they were being increased by 25 per cent in the budget.  We are all aware that, even with that increase, benefits paid to pensioners, deserted wives, and widows are not enough.  Even if we managed to increase those benefits by 100 per cent they would not be adequate.</P>
    <P>On the question of widows and deserted wives, I am glad to note that so far as these people are concerned there will be an extra tax free allowance of £500 but, as I have said before here, I am concerned for widows and deserted wives who are left to rear young families.  Usually they can cope fairly well until the children reach secondary school level at which stage the children of one-parent families are discriminated against because their mothers are not usually in a position to send the children to third-level educational institutions whereas if the fathers were there and bringing in incomes the situation would be different. Not many widows or deserted wives are in the position of being able to send children to third-level institutions.  I hope that in another budget this sort of situation will be catered for in the sense that the third-level education fees will be covered in full in regard to the children of one-parent families and that any other possible help will be put at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The greater problem in the city area is that of housing.  Yesterday I attended a meeting of representatives from UCD and TCD at which was discussed the accommodation problems of students in Dublin.  It is very difficult for the local authority in Dublin to cope with the influx of people to the city in so far as <Col N="1471" /> housing is concerned.  Some years ago the students coming to Dublin to attend university would have been content to go into lodgings, to live with families, or to stay in a hostel, but that is no longer the case.  Students coming to Dublin now are seeking flats.  They look for accommodation in which they can be free to study without distraction.  However, this trend takes from the housing stock in the city. Up to a couple of years ago young married couples would have been likely to live in flats for a few years and until such time as they had got together enough money for a deposit on a house or until they qualified for a local authority house.  Now, however, there are not flats available for married couples. I am not saying that the number of flats occupied otherwise is colossal but the position is that the occupation of these flats by students is taking from the housing stock for married couples.  Consequently these young couples seek corporation housing with the result that the situation is very difficult for the local authority.</P>
    <P>We are building as many houses this year as have ever been built in any year, but the problem is the increase in the number of people seeking local authority housing.  The first reason for this situation is the considerable improvement that has been brought about generally in the past decade whereby more young people are being employed gainfully at relatively high wages than was the case before.  In addition, they are marrying at an earlier age with the result that we are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the extra numbers on the housing list.</P>
    <P>Since our young employed people have got such a good deal in terms of taxation in that they are being allowed earn a fair amount of money more before being eligible for income tax, with the result that their take home pay will be much improved, I trust that they will be encouraged to start saving for the time when they wish to buy houses of their own.  I know that there is advertising on TV to so encourage these young people.  However, we should go even <Col N="1472" /> further and launch a very strong campaign on the lines that since young people will now have a good deal more money in their pockets they should begin saving for their own homes.  They should be encouraged to begin their saving not when they are engaged to be married but long before then, in fact from the time they enter employment.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that we are in a very difficult economic situation and that sacrifices are demanded of all of us. But I do not consider any sacrifice should be involved in so far as people may find it necessary to have fewer drinks than before, to smoke a little less than before or not to use their cars as frequently as they used them before for short journeys such as to the church or to the shops.  While Deputy Flynn was speaking today there was an exchange across the floor about the horse and cart. A couple of Sundays ago I witnessed a beautiful sight when I saw a family going to Mass in a pony and trap.</P>

      <P>It was in Walkinstown, which is only a five-minute journey from Ballyfermot.  That was a sight that I had not seen for years.  I envied those people. I do not know how they accommodate the horse but they are to be congratulated. Perhaps we should revert a little more to this sort of transport.  It is too easy for us to use our cars.  Not even the traffic jams in the city deter us from using them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about increased taxation on some commodities.  While I do not wish to go into more detail in regard to figures, I mention merely that I welcome the increases in respect of the low-mortgage scheme loan from £9,000 to £12,000 and also the increase of the same order in respect of the SDA loan. In addition, the income limit has been increased from £4,000 to £5,500. However, this is not yet enough and I should like the figure to be reviewed again within the next year if possible.  On the other hand, house prices have <Col N="1473" /> stabilised during the last year.  At least the increases in value have not been anything of the order of the previous year.  I urge as many people as possible to take advantage of the improved situation in regard to loans and income limits and to try to buy their own houses.  A start on the purchase of a house will be of benefit to a married couple throughout their lives.  It is sad if young couples have to live with in-laws.  As well as being devastating for them, there is an imposition on the parents who should be enjoying peace and quiet in their own homes.  It is appalling for a young couple, perhaps with two young children, to have to live with their in-laws.  Therefore, I consider it a priority to try to create a situation in which these young couples could have their own accommodation.  It is extremely difficult to provide a £20,000 house for a married couple with one child.  Would it be possible to provide short-term accommodation for these couples?  It is extremely difficult for young married couples to live with their in-laws.  If these young couples were given short-term accommodation it could mean peace in both homes.</P>
    <P>No Government can be successful without the co-operation of the people. The people must be happy.  They must realise that the Government are doing their best and that they are compassionate and caring.  They must realise we care for our old people, and they should help the Government by also caring for the aged.  The Taoiseach, when Minister for Health, more than once said communities should participate in the care of the old, the infirm and the disabled. When the people see that the Government are looking after the aged they will respond.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the increases in the price of alcoholic drinks but I was disappointed with the tax on soft drinks, because when young people meet in a disco or a pub they must have a glass in front of them.  If the price of soft drinks was very far below that of alcoholic drink, I imagine they would choose soft drinks more often.  If there is very little <Col N="1474" /> difference in the prices they would probably take alcoholic drinks.  I do not know if the Minister could reconsider this tax at this stage, but he might encourage young people to stay off alcoholic drinks by reducing the tax on soft drinks.</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried about the drinking patterns of our young people. They seem to have plenty of money.  It is not unusual to see a group buying five or six rounds of small drinks for themselves in the course of an hour or two.  I hope the increases in the price of alcoholic drinks will discourage this trend.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is an extremely good budget.  I was criticised about my remarks on farmers' tax last Wednesday. If I seemed to be harsh to the farmers.  I am sorry.  No matter what tax is mentioned the farmers' spokesmen immediately rebel and say it is a penal tax and they will not have it.  All the PAYE workers wanted was to see a fair distribution of tax and they had a very good case.  About 100,000 PAYE workers marched through the streets.  It was better to have 100,000 people marching for that reason than to have 100,000 unemployed marching.  These people were all working.</P>
    <P>This time last year I spoke to a very well known spokesman for the farmers.  I asked him to arrange a meeting with farming interests so that city Deputies could understand the farmers' problems and why the farmers do not want this tax or that tax to be imposed.  He said he would arrange such a meeting, but nothing happened.  In the last few days I spoke to another member of the farming community and said the same thing.  I am very grateful to him for organising such a meeting; and any city Deputy who wants to hear the farmers' point of view will be very welcome at this meeting which I hope will be in the near future.  As a Dublin Deputy I am not familiar with farming problems, but I know the problems of the PAYE workers.  They were very heavily taxed on overtime and that tax was stopped at source.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is an extremely good <Col N="1475" /> budget.  I sympathise with the Opposition who are finding it very difficult to criticise it.  They have to criticise; that is what politics are all about.  In my view, this budget will work very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Lemass that it is not very difficult to criticise this budget.  It was interesting to hear her pay tribute to the people with ponies and traps.  Fianna Fáil would be prepared to welcome anything that would avoid embarrassment.  I cannot see many Fianna Fáil Deputies going around Dublin in a pony and trap.  She mentioned the aged and the underprivileged. If Fianna Fáil had any sympathy in their hearts for the old and the poorer sections of the community they would not be prepared to go into the lobby at the first opportunity to vote for the abolition of food subsidies.</P>
      <P>When the budget was introduced I thought there was a certain amount of good in it.  I agree that some of the provisions will be of benefit, but with the epidemic of prices increases any good in the budget will have been eroded by the time it reaches the would-be recipients. Therefore, the budget is a damp squib. We have had three years of price increases under Fianna Fáil and it leaves us doubting if they have any control over prices.  They abolished the food subsidies although their 1977 manifesto told us how they would control prices when Fianna Fáil were given control of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the National Coalition were in office the then Opposition told us that inflation was not imported but had been brought about by the inherent weakness of the Coalition Government.  The present Government have a majority of 19 and what have they achieved in three years?  There have been price increases and industrial unrest, everything that would lead to national bankruptcy.  Since the budget we have had speeches by Fianna Fáil Deputies to the effect that international recession has caused a deterioration in our economy.  It is nice to hear them say so now because three years ago the man who is now Taoiseach <Col N="1476" /> said from this side of the House that inflation was the sign of a weak Government, that if Fianna Fáil were in office everything would be OK.  What has happened? Fianna Fáil have been three years in office.  They have abolished food subsidies and have thus increased the prices of bread, butter, gas and numerous other commodities.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that social welfare benefits have been increased, but was it not time to look after the underprivileged? They are entitled to these increases because in the past two years they have been left behind on the breadline.  Many of our underprivileged children are in hospital because of lack of nourishment.  Most of the relief being given in this budget to PAYE workers will have been eroded before it reaches them.  How does anybody expect a family of four or five children to live on £50 or £60 a week?  Why are they forced to live on such amounts?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that between 1975 and 1978 farmers' incomes rose by more than 70 per cent but they have fallen by 4 per cent in this year.  Was that why he imposed extra taxes on them in this budget?  Is that why the agricultural grant has been abolished?  I wonder what would have happened in this respect if 1979 had not been a bad year.</P>
    <P>In 1978 the Minister for the Environment issued his famous document limiting increases in rates to 10 per cent. He said that people who did not derive benefit from the abolition of domestic rates were entitled to be protected from additional rates.  What has happened since?  Farmers have had their rates almost trebled.  In other words they are subsidising domestic householders. When we were in Government we made provision in 1977 to reduce rates by 25 per cent, the Exchequer to bear the loss. Now we have levies on farmers which will mean substantial increases, and I cannot see how farmers will meet them.  I come from Limerick where we have a number of large farmers, but there are many small farmers there who are finding it difficult to survive.  I believe the Government will not be successful in <Col N="1477" /> getting the £6 million they are expecting from the farmers.  It must be remembered that the people directly associated with agriculture are not the only people who make their living from agriculture; there are many thousands of others working in the processing services and that will be a danger to employment.  I can foresee unemployment rising this year and the Government are doing very little about it.</P>
    <P>When we speak about the amount of money paid by farmers we are told it is for services.  I am sure there are many rural Deputies who find it very difficult at present to drive along country roads because they are full of potholes, rendering them unsafe even for school children and that is no exaggeration; they are like Beecher's Brook.  Yet we are being told we cannot exceed 10 per cent.  What are we supposed to do with our roads?  Are our people entitled to any service?  Quite recently I was approached by a constituent on a very limited income who had damaged his car on one such road, when one of his children was thrown against the windscreen because he ran into one of these famous potholes known as the environmental potholes down the country.  In his case there is no compensation forthcoming.  This is what we are asked to put up with; this is the type of progress we are supposed to be making. Where is the progress?  At present there are many housing schemes before the Minister for the Environment in regard to my county in respect of which there will not be approval of allocations.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister of State opposite writing because there are a lot of things he will have to write down.  He is placed in that seat because it would be difficult and embarrassing for others to occupy it.  I sympathise with him.  At heart I believe he is a good-natured, honest man, but he will find it very difficult to tell our farmers why they have not proper roads on which to travel.</P>
    <P>There are cut-backs in all of the services. I was reading in the Minister's brief reference to industrial disputes and the amount of man-days lost in 1978 <Col N="1478" /> and 1979.  When the Taoiseach was picking his new Cabinet he reinstated the Minister for Labour.  In fairness to the man, in view of the way he acted in 1978 and 1979.  I ask the House why was he reinstated.  The disputes that lasted for so long made it almost impossible and most embarrassing to make a telephone call, post a letter or whatever in the communications field.  Bearing this in mind how can we expect tourists to come here?  How can we expect industrialists to come when we have not proper roads, are unsure of our telephone service and, if we do have telephones, they are not automatic?  Even in the capital city of my county we do not have automatic telephones and, as a result of lack of service, we have lost industry after industry. The first question any foreign industrialist will ask is whether there are adequate communications.  There is no use in Ministers or Fianna Fáil Deputies going down the country, carrying on a whispering campaign that, now that Professor O'Donoghue has been demoted, all will be well.  Recently at a cumann meeting in my constituency a decent Fianna Fáil man was told by a Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That Minister told that man and a number of other people present that, now that we were rid of Deputy O'Donoghue all would be well.  I understand that the new procedure is to have changes of Ministers every year. The former Minister for Finance has gone; the present Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, will probably be gone before the next change of government.  In these circumstances one can always blame former office holders for being responsible for mistakes made but that now one has the right man.  We are asked to believe now that we have a new Government.  We have no new Government, only a rehash of the existing personnel, <Col N="1479" /> who I believe to be a weak team.  But perhaps a weak team is important to the Taoiseach because they will act to him, as do ventriloquists' puppets. When he pulls the string they will jump, because that is exactly what the Taoiseach is doing.  Indeed, I am looking forward to the time in the near future when Ministers may well change again. It is very difficult now to pin down blame or to know who to criticise.</P>

      <P>In fairness, with no criticism meant of the Minister of State present, we have experienced in the past three years the worst government we have ever had. That is said not alone by us but by Fianna Fáil people within their own party.  As a result of what was known as the tug-of-war for power in the past three years our economy suffered; there is no doubt about it, no interest was taken in our economy but rather in power, when the party opposite had vindictive attitudes to one another from which this nation is now suffering.  I look forward to the day when the Taoiseach will go to the country and give the people an opportunity to tell him what they told him in Cork City and in North-East Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the comments of Opposition Deputies on the budget.  But during all the time I have been here I have not heard one Fine Gael or Labour Deputy put forward a constructive argument, or say what they would do in our present economic circumstances.  I should like to hear from those benches what they would do with our economy. It is all very well to comment here, contending it is not right, maintaining that <Col N="1480" /> the various proposals contained in the budget are not the proper ones but both Labour and Fine Gael have a duty to tell the House what they would do.  They have not done that.  Even the leaders of both parties have not.  It is well known that the finances of the country have to be put in shape.  We are setting about doing that now.  Some of the measures we had to take were not of a pleasant nature but as a Government we have to face up to that.</P>
      <P>It is well known that the employment situation has improved enormously.  Let there be no doubt about that.  Jobs are available for most people who want work but in some areas where employment was offered to certain individuals they refused it.  I know that they have that right and we respect that.  There is no use in saying that there is no work here or there.  As regards the live register, which is the number of people who are supposed to be unemployed, there are a lot of people on that who are in employment and doing nixers and using the maximum know-how&mdash;in other words, exploiting the system we have.  No one can deny that that is going on.  I regret to say that all taxpayers have to prop this up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the tax situation, it has been said that we are forced into the position we are now in by the court ruling. <Col N="1481" /> For some time I was unhappy with the system we had.  I admit that we were burdened with a big share of that amount and I am now glad that action has been taken on it.  We have a long way to go yet.  It is something that cannot be overhauled overnight.  I come from a rural area and know a good deal about farmer taxation.  I am a farmer and farmers know well that they have to pay their fair share of tax.  The tax on land valuation is of a temporary nature only until a commission sits on the matter and reports to the Government.  The farming community knew of our proposals in regard to taxation quite well.  Farming organisations were unable to agree among themselves on the type of tax they wanted and they told me so. One organisation wanted it one way and the other wanted it another way.</P>

      <P>Last evening I was praising the Fine Gael spokesman on law reform for the idea of bringing forward a Private Member's Bill to have this matter aired where it should be aired, here in this House of the Oireachtas. Whilst I was saying that, although the idea was not new, nevertheless it was worth while bringing it forward and discussing it in the context of law reform generally.  As the Minister pointed out last evening, this action, known as an action for criminal conversation, was not provided by any statute.  It was, in fact, developed by the courts over the years. As I understand it, action for criminal conversation is a common law remedy which was developed either in the last century or in the late eighteenth century. It was abandoned in England when divorce was introduced but was carried on here.  As was said last evening, the action in itself is not enshrined in a statute of the British Parliament, nor is it enshrined in an Act of the Oireachtas. Rather has it developed over the years through court usage or through court interpretation. Up to now, as has been <Col N="1484" /> stated, only a husband has been successful in such an action.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission have put forward arguments in favour of the proposition that, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution and to various legal developments, a wife could now, in fact, succeed in such an action. There is no gainsaying that fact. However, that has not yet been established by authoritative court decision. We in this House must act on the assumption that the law as at present constituted is quite clearly discriminatory. It is discriminatory of one sex as against another&mdash;in this instance discriminatory against the female of the species.  If it is discriminatory, and it is, there can be no doubt that it would be struck down by the courts as unconstitutional if the matter were tested. Again, however, this House clearly ought not to ignore a law that we believe to be bad, just because we feel certain that it would be changed by challenge in the courts.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be too critical of the Bill before us but I am not in favour of the nature of the Bill.  I am in favour of a specific legislation, but not of the type enshrined in this Bill no matter how well intentioned the Bill is, and it is a well-intentioned Bill.  I believe that will hurry the day when this type of action will be abandoned altogether and/or something will be put in its place.  Where a law has operated, as this law has on a clearly discriminatory basis it is understandable that there should be not only objection to it but a feeling of resentment, especially among women.  For that reason it is particularly important that there should be no misunderstanding about what was said here last evening by the Minister for Justice.  Some of the reports of what he said were very abbreviated&mdash;by definition they have to be abbreviated in the newspapers, which have only so many column inches in which to report the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas and that is in no way criticism of the newspapers. Nevertheless, the reports were abbreviated and could perhaps be liable to some misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> I go further and say that I know some people did get quite a wrong impression. There is no doubt that this debate in the House has created tremendous and widespread public interest and, for that reason alone, we should be grateful to the movers of the Bill before us.  A number of people with whom I have discussed this matter during the course of the last 24 hours have indicated to me that they were somewhat concerned and probably did get the wrong impression of what, in fact, the Minister said.  The Minister, in expressing his own attitude to this law, certainly did not confine himself to saying that he would like to see the present law changed.  I believe he went much further than that, in fairness to him.  He pointed out that, both in this House and outside it, he had already publicly committed himself to having amending legislation introduced.  Last night, in my interpretation of what he said he went further than that, and on the basis that what he had heard from the Law Reform Commission was able to undertake that the legislation would be introduced and perhaps even enacted by the end of this year.  It is not a question of his liking to see the law amended or the problem solved.  He has undertaken, as far as I understand it from what he said last night, that it will be done.</P>
    <P>Some reports said that the Minister asked the Dáil to keep an open mind.  He did use that phrase, no doubt, but not about the question of abolishing the discrimination in the present law.  The Minister himself obviously has not an open mind on that; he has already decided that it must be amended.  The Minister made two points about the Bill, first that it dealt only with criminal conversation and not with other types of legal action such as enticement of a spouse.  He said that all these actions should be dealt with at the same time and on the basis of the same principle.  In that sense the Minister was clearly saying that the Bill was too narrow and ought not to be accepted purely on that basis only.  It is a fair observation and it should not be suggested that there is an <Col N="1486" /> implied criticism in that observation, which is reasonable and constructive. Surely the movers of the Bill might accept that and there can be no argument about the wisdom of that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second point was that it was one thing to abolish the present right of action&mdash;and I doubt if even one Member of the House would disagree with abolition&mdash;but it was, however, another matter to decide that it should be abolished with nothing put in its place, or whether it should be abolished and replaced by a new type of action actually open to both husband and wife and perhaps, indeed, to the issue of the marriage, the children themselves.  It was on that matter, and only on that matter, that the Minister asked the House to postpone the decision until the final recommendation of the Law Reform Commission becomes available in the near future.  That is clearly the right approach, as I stated in my opening remarks last evening.  I am sure we are all agreed that we should move as soon as possible to get rid of the discriminatory element, but we have an equal duty to consider how best to do it and what way of doing it would best serve the interests of all concerned&mdash;husbands, wives and children.  In doing so, we should pay particular attention to the question of what would be most likely to protect the interests of children of the marriage.  Let us not forget them.  Their interests might best be served by abolishing such actions altogether, but let us look at it carefully. The need to abolish this kind of discrimination does not relieve us of the duty to abolish it in a way that is most likely to do most good for the support of the family as a unit.</P>
    <P>As we know, the Constitution has a lot to say about the family as a unit in this country.  This constitutional guarantee is not a bad thing at all, in my opinion, and we should be very jealous of what it does say in regard to the family unit.  We should try as best we can to protect the family against assaults from outside elements, whether it be elements like the other man or the other woman, <Col N="1487" /> or the other pressures that modern living brings to bear on that unit.  We should guard very strongly against those attacks on it.  While the Bill on the face of it reflects a widely held view, I believe that the wife herself if she took an action on her own right would undoubtedly succeed in an analogous situation to the husband at present.</P>
    <P>The main burden of my argument is that if we abolish this common law right of action as it is do we just leave it abolished or do we put something else in its place?  Do we, for example, consider that the children of the marriage have some right regarding the adulterous behaviour of one or other of their parents with another individual?  Do we think they should have a remedy for the emotional wrong done to them as children of parents, one of whom errs in this case?  Do we consider that they have a right to protect their reputation against attack by an outside element, in this instance, a man, as the criminal conversation action is presently constituted? Having decided there should be an alternative remedy, what type of compensation should we give to the wronged party or parties?  The question then raises itself as to whether the State should arbitrate on the morals of the society over which it presides.  Certainly, my first reaction to a question on those lines would be in the negative.  The State as far as possible should remain outside the situation of setting itself up as moral arbiter of the community it governs.</P>
    <P>There are certain instances&mdash;this may be one of them&mdash;where the State might have to take a part.  It has an obligation under the Constitution to protect the family against outside attack.  The family unit at present is under very great stress throughout the world because of all the elements that are attacking it.  Should we leave the remedy to the religious beliefs of the persons concerned and to whatever God they pray to?  Should it be left to the day of judgment&mdash;to God? This is a very difficult decision for the Minister to take and I do not think it can be taken today.  That is why I say we <Col N="1488" /> have a very serious obligation to consider deeply what is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is extremely well-intentioned, brought forward in a bonafide manner and the arguments adduced by the Members who contributed have been sound, well-founded and wellresearched. That is as it should be on such a serious issue.  Nevertheless, if we do as the Minister suggests and leave the matter until we have the final report from the Law Reform Commission we can then probably have another discussion in the House before the Minister finally decides what should be done.  I would urge the Minister and his colleagues to give the matter very serious consideration.  If somebody were to ask me as a backbench Dáil Deputy what my solution would be I would say now that the action itself should be abandoned <i>simpliciter</i> and nothing should be put in its place.  I have a very strong feeling about the rights and entitlement of the State.  I say this as a guide to the Minister as a backbencher in the party in which he is a Minister and it is a view that I shall be articulating in true, democratic Fianna Fáil fashion between now and whenever the Minister decides to bring it to the attention of the party at parliamentary party level.  Nobody has to date convinced me that having abolished the criminal conversation action something should be put in its place.</P>
    <P>One argument which would convince me that something should replace the abandoned discriminatory action as presently constituted would be the position of children in the family.  That would convince me that there should be some alternative to the present action, that is the present action if the wife had the right on the same grounds as the husband has.  That is one consideration which would lead me to support an alternative right of action&mdash;the position of the children.  In a situation like this children are brought into a position not of their own making, by an outside person or persons and he or she should be asked to accept some responsibility for the harm done to the emotional make-up <Col N="1489" /> of the child or children and to the reputation of the child or children if they are old enough to appreciate what reputation is in the context of the community in which they live.</P>
    <P>I am really in a dilemma and I say this frankly.  I have not come to any personal decision in relation to the matter but at present I am of the mind which says that the right of action as at present operated by the courts should be abandoned and nothing put in its place.  On the other hand, I am concerned about what happens to the children where adultery is committed by one or other of the parents.  Have they any rights in this situation?  I believe they may have.  We have this anachronism before us.  That is what it is, the right of the male of the species to go after the other man for interfering in some way with his wife where there is no right on the part of the wife to go after the other individual in similar circumstances.  It is a total anachronism; it is discriminatory and an outrageous affront to women that this legal remedy is open to the male and not to the female.  The sooner we in this House deal with it one way or another the better.  That is the merit of Deputy Keating's Bill.  He has given us an opportunity of airing this matter publicly.  He has done a service to the community.  He is dealing with a Minister who, I believe, is sympathetic to his point of view.  He is dealing with a Minister who will listen to him and who, when he has given the undertaking he has given&mdash;I hope I put the record right in relation to what he said last night&mdash;will discharge it.</P>
    <P>Taking those three elements in relation to the Minister into account, in addition to the fact that Deputy Keating has brought this matter to the attention of the House at this stage, he might do his own case a lot of good by withdrawing the Bill.  It is entirely a matter for himself whether or not he withdraws it and leaves it to the Minister to conform with what he said yesterday evening.  This is my first opportunity to say that I had a very pleasant association with the Minister for Justice and his Department. I have always found him to be a gentleman. <Col N="1490" /> That even strengthens my plea to Deputy Keating to withdraw the Bill in the interest of his case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss Barry Miss Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to speak on this Bill because it affords us an opportunity to speak on an issue which directly concerns women.  I am sure we all agree that the issue of criminal conversation discriminates unjustly against women.  The underlying principle is that a women is the property of her husband, a mere object.  I believe that no woman would like to be referred to as the property of her husband, which gives her immediately an inferior status.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which Deputy Keating introduced last night, should be accepted. The Minister for Justice does not see any great urgency.  It is obvious that he is not at the receiving end of this discrimination. The Bill seeks something urgently and we need action now.  Why put off until tomorrow what can be done today? Why not accept this simple Bill and remove this great indignity to women? By all means let the Minister leave the option open of introducing legislation arising out of the Law Reform Report.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in September 1978 that this wrong should be removed.  It is now 5 March 1980 and he has an ideal opportunity of getting rid of this injustice. Why will the Minister not support this Bill?  It is a symbol of this party's commitment to equality and to removing all legislation which discriminates against women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very interesting discussion.  I do not propose to delay very long but I feel impelled to make a number of points in relation to the debate taking place, yesterday evening and again this evening.  This particular cause of action arose in the Law Reform Commission's Report.  I am not saying this to take any credit from Deputy Keating.  When I was a member of the other House we intended to introduce a similar measure as an amendment during a family Bill going through to that House but were ruled out of order as not being germane to the subject matter of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> Deputy Andrews made an interesting point, which he could have developed further, when he pointed to a particular aspect of this cause of action.  He underlined the fact that it had its flowering at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century in the United Kingdom.  He described it as an anachronism today.  Of course it is, but an anachronism which once had a function. It is useful to look at the function it originally had.  I believe if we would do this we would have more reasons for abolishing it today.</P>
    <P>It is no confidence that the growth and the development of the cause of actions for criminal conversation as a remedy in law for a husband whose wife has disappeared with another man took place during that period in history when the British middle classes were developing and consolidating their laws on property to a most extraordinary degree. I have been a solicitor's apprentice in my time and I have waded through some of the tortuous tangle of the British and, to a large extent.  Irish law as it relates to real property, the kind of property which can be bought and sold, the kind of property that can be transferred between husbands and wives and passed on&mdash;this is most important&mdash;from husbands and wives to children.  It is very likely that one of the reasons why this cause of action developed was as a deterrent because the possibility that the wife of the average Victorian middle class might run off with another man was not just a threat to his emotions.  It was a threat to his standing in society and to the possibility that he might have children to whom he might leave his property.</P>
    <P>This cause of action was undoubtedly created as a deterrent to prevent this kind of thing happening.  I have no doubt either that it did serve a very useful function in the Victorian society of the 19th century in making it much more difficult for a woman whose affections might be transferred from her husband to another man to take what in more recent times might seem the more obvious course of action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> As far as I am aware.  Deputy Andrews' speech contained no technical objections to the Bill.  As far as I am aware the Bill does not suffer from any technical or drafting defect, certainly not one of any significance which might give the Minister and the Government occasion to ask the people who drafted it to withdraw it.  What then are the objections to accepting the Bill?  The classic query is: if we abolish this cause of action, what do we put in its place?  This is a classic argument of conservatism.  If we never abolish anything because we have not decided what to put in its place we would never abolish anything at all. There is the assumption behind that, that for all the perversity of the way in which it operates in our courts this extraordinary cause of action in some sense defends a value we ought to maintain and defend.</P>
    <P>There is time enough to consider what we want to put in the place of this action, if we want to put anything in its place at all.  I was more heartened than I have been for some time to hear Deputy Andrews speak so forthrightly about his belief that this cause of action should be abolished forthwith and that there is no need to put anything in its place.  He reviewed some of the options before coming to his personal conclusion, and we respect that personal conclusion.  In the course of this review he made one statement which I am sure on reflection he would probably have phrased differently, when he referred to the possibility that not only the wife might have a cause of action in present day conditions but that the children might have a cause of action.  He referred to the possibility of children having a cause of action in a situation in which one of their parents was erring.  There was an unmistakable implication from what he said, which I am sure he would not necessarily go along the whole way with, that the mere fact that one partner in a marriage has had physical sexual relations with somebody other than the other partner of the marriage automatically makes that partner guilty and the other partner innocent.</P>
    <P>It has taken a long time for legislation <Col N="1493" /> in other countries to move away from this extraordinary inflexible and frequently unfair concept of guilt and innocence and towards a realisation that in marriage, as in all human relationships, there is a lot to be said on both sides.  I would be very slow to welcome any development which would bring this back into our political discourse and, much more so, into our legal system.  It is bad enough that at present we have this action in which the relationships between a man and a woman have become property relationships.  It would be worse entirely that we should extend this to include the components of the family circle so that no two members of any family could look at each other without calculating the cash value of a defalcation in any direction.</P>
    <P>I have a particular reason for objecting to the continuing existence of this course of action in the present circumstances. As Deputy Andrews says, it is now an anachronism.  The property aspect of it is not as big an aspect of it as it used to be.  But anybody who has seen the court reports of the cases that have taken place here over the last couple of years would find little difficulty in coming to the conclusion that what is involved in any of the court cases has nothing to do with compensation and everything to do with vengeance.  We have had enough Old Testament morality in Ireland.  It is about time that into our legal system and our social relationships generally was introduced a bit more of the New Testament approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews said that he was in a dilemma.  He believed that the question of what should be put in place of this cause of action was a difficulty but that it should be abolished.  I am in no such dilemma.  The answer to the dilemma in which Deputy Andrews finds himself is to be found in his own speech because he made it quite clear that the reason why this cause of action eventually became disused and was, in the last analysis, actually legally abolished in Britain was that the British legal system finally came up with a scheme for civil divorce.  This scheme met the needs, originally not <Col N="1494" /> very satisfactorily or sensitively but increasingly so, of people who would otherwise and previously have resorted to this extraordinary Victorian legislation. I believe that civil divorce is the answer to the problem raised by Deputy Andrews and I think that some Irish Government some day, perhaps in the not too distant future, will have to recognise as much.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating has nominated Deputy O'Keeffe to conclude.  The position so far as the Chair is concerned is that the speaker concluding has not less than 15 minutes. The Standing Order has never been clarified and I would think where there is more than 15 minutes left that the speaker would have 30 minutes.  No other speaker except the opening speaker has 30 minutes.  Therefore if the Deputy wishes he can take 30 minutes to conclude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight and last night we have been discussing the Law Reform (Abolition of Criminal Conversation) Bill, 1980.  The action known as criminal conversation developed from a case in the year 1692 brought by an English Duke against a person who had a sexual relationship with his wife.  Here we are, almost 300 years later, discussing whether such a cause of action should still continue within our legal system.  I put some stress on the 300 years because there have been suggestions that we should not circulate this Bill, that we should not press on with the Bill, that we should not ask the Government to accept it, to allow more time for discussion: that is 300 years since the <Col N="1495" /> cause of action first began.  The women in this country are entitled at this stage to answer anybody who talks about delay with the question.  &ldquo;How long more?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In discussing the Bill I find that in analysing the speeches in this House, having, in my time, spoken on law reform with many of the women organisations here, and in reading the public press I have yet to find a single person who is prepared to speak in favour of the retention of criminal conversation as a cause of action in our legal system.  There is not a single voice raised in favour of retaining criminal conversation as a cause of action.  Why then can we not put through this very simple four section Bill which will completely and effectively carry out the will not alone of the women here but of virtually all the people here?  I accept that the Minister has some difficulty in considering the working paper of the Law Reform Commission.  There are views expressed there as to the introduction of a broad based form of action for adultery and this obviously requires consideration and it is obviously something that would, if we are sensible, dictate that we should wait until the final report of the Law Reform Commission comes through.  But at the same time I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that in quite unequivocal terms the same Law Reform Commission, in their summary of recommendations, said:</P>
      <P>The present action for criminal conversation should be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite simple.  There is no qualification and the purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the views of the women here, to give effect to the views of all right-minded men here and, furthermore, to give effect to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The report of the commission was very helpful in providing the background to the recommendation.  It covered the situation in many other countries and from my reading of the report it is clear that this type of action is not available in any other European country.  We are the <Col N="1496" /> sole exception standing out, not like a shining beacon in the cause of equality of women but like a sore thumb, as a country that is not prepared to take the appropriate measures to remove this form of discrimination.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked why there is such a unanimous view in the country about the need to abolish this form of action. Very simply, there is a basic inequality in relation to equal human rights which allows a husband to take an action but does not allow his wife to do so in similar circumstances.  That is the first basic point.  The second basic point concerns the implication of treating a wife as a chattel of her husband.  These are the two basic grounds on which any right-minded person will agree that this form of action cannot be allowed to remain in our legal system.  It is why I suggest that any right-minded person should go into the lobby and support our Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the first part, the question of the husband having an entitlement but not the wife, I accept that a view was expressed in the report of the Law Reform Commission that possibly a wife might be able to take a constitutional action following which if she were successful she might be entitled to take such an action. That is a possibility but we have to take the law as we find it.  We cannot go on the basis that in certain circumstances the Constitution might provide such a right for a wife.  In any event, how many people are sufficiently well-off to consider taking a constitutional action to the High Court or possibly to the Supreme Court for the sake of establishing such a right?  It is beyond dispute that at the moment no such right exists in law for a wife and it is on that basis that we present this Bill.</P>
    <P>Need I develop the point regarding a wife as a chattel of her husband in the year 1980?  Surely there cannot be any more degrading suggestion, any greater affront to the dignity of womankind?  I say to the Minister that if he accepts this viewpoint let him reverse the attitude he has adopted.  Let him say we will take one step at a time, that we will get rid of this degrading affront to women by walking into the lobby.  There is even no <Col N="1497" /> need to walk into the lobby.  When we call for this Bill let him not vote it down. I accept that the other side have a majority in this House.  I and my colleagues in this party have not tried to bulldoze the Bill through the House.  We know we have to convince the Minister and the Government.  I know the Minister has the milk of human kindness in his heart and I am not trying to harangue or harass him in any political sense.  I am hoping at this final stage to convince him that it is in the interests of all that this outrage to women in this country be removed.  The way to do it is here and now.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a considerable heightening of awareness regarding inequalities and discrimination in respect of women.  I hope the eighties will bring practical and concrete implementation of the necessary social, legislative and attitudinal changes so that the ideal of full and equal human rights for women becomes a reality.  I think the progress made in the seventies was considerable if only from the point of view of heightening the awareness.  We are now in a new decade.  Let us start that decade with the implementation of the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not completely resolve the problem but it is a symbol of what can be done, of Members of this House&mdash;mostly men&mdash;agreeing to tackle the problem.  Following on that I would like to see many more changes introduced by the Minister.  If we accept this Bill we will show that we are prepared to tackle once and for all the outstanding issues of discrimination against women.  Legislative change will be needed.  There are other aspects such as a widened perception of the dignity and rights of the individual, but in this House we can help in encouraging that perception by putting this Bill on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The position is that in 1967 the United Nations voted a declaration on the elimination of discrimination against women.  That declaration stated as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> Without prejudice to the safeguarding of the unity and the harmony of the family, which remains the basic unit of any society, all appropriate measures, particularly legislative measures, shall be taken to ensure to women, married or unmarried, equal rights with men in the field of civil law.</P>
    <P>In 1967 this country subscribed to and voted for that convention.  We approved of the declaration and in so doing we indicated that in this country we would take the necessary steps to ensure that principles enshrined in the declaration would be implemented.  There have been some changes and improvements and here tonight we have a further opportunity of showing the sincerity of our actions, the sincerity of our belief in that United Nations declaration.</P>
    <P>If we think the declaration is something above and beyond us, let us consider our own Constitution.  In 1937 we adopted a new Constitution and one of the basic Articles was that all citizens shall as human persons be held equal before the law.  We are in the situation that when we deal with criminal conversation all citizens are not held equal before the law.  That is absolutely clear and all the authorities support this viewpoint. All the precedents that are there lend support to what I have said in that regard.  In that situation surely the taking of just one small step, which can be done here tonight, must have the support of every Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The leading authority on family law in this country is Alan Joseph Shatter's book <i>Family Law in the Republic of Ireland.</i>  On page 89 he refers to the action of criminal conversation being brought, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...by a husband against a person who commits adultery with his wife.  The basis of this action is derived from the principle that anyone having sexual intercourse with a wife is violating a property right of her husband.  A wife has no corresponding right of action against another woman who commits adultery with her husband.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> These claims are undisputed.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the basis on which damages are won.  Let us see clearly the basis on which the dignity of women is insulted by this call of action. The Chief Justice on one of the leading cases in the last decade stated that in assessing damages regard must be had to the actual value of the wife to the husband. I do not want to seem facetious about this, but it would remind one of going to the fair and valuing a cow.  It is outrageous that this should be part of our legal system today.  It is outrageous that this should not be removed.  With all the strength of my eloquence in any argument that I can adduce here to the Minister I press him to take the step tonight and indicate to his party that this Bill will not be opposed.</P>
    <P>We have had from the Minister's party commitments which are uttered probably in good faith.  On page 36 of the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977 there is a commitment to a belief</P>
    <P>that the concepts of justice and fairness, of the dignity of the individual and of equality before the law which permeate and are enshrined in Bunreacht na hÉireann are very relevant</P>
    <P>and would be totally supported.  We have also had the commitment of the new Taoiseach when only a few short weeks ago he indicated at his party's Ard-Fheis that there were still areas of discrimination and that full equality was the aim of the party.  His words were:</P>
    <P>There are, however, still areas of discrimination and difficulty for women.  Full equality is the aim of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Further on in his speech he said:</P>
    <P>I would like to give this Ard-Fheis an assurance that we intend to proceed as rapidly as circumstances and resources permit and that we will not be satisfied until women enjoy a status in our society equal in every way to that of men.</P>
    <P>The important words here are &ldquo;as rapidly as possible&rdquo;.  I do not know <Col N="1500" /> whether he understood that a couple of weeks later he and his party could stand here and support this Bill which goes some way towards the very principle that he espoused that evening when he spoke to his supporters at the Ard-Fheis. Further, he may not have realised that this Bill which we present to this House would not cost his Government even one shilling.  There is no question of resources being involved.  There is no question of any financial commitment of any description in supporting this Bill. There is merely a question of accepting the principles and of putting this commitment into practice.  He has the opportunity now and the Minister has the same opportunity.  I do not know whether there is any need to produce further evidence for the Minister but if we go outside this country to the report of the Scottish Law Commission in 1976 there is one other relevant quotation which might cause a change of heart in the Minister.  I quote from that commission report as given in <i>The Law Reform Commission Working Paper No. 5&mdash;1978,</i> page 32:</P>
    <P>...whether we regard the basis of the paramour's liability as a species of affront or insult or wrong against the husband's feelings or honour...or whether we regard it as the infringement of the husband's exclusive right to the possession of his wife's body (on the analogy of the Common Law action of criminal conversation), the liability appears difficult to defend.  On the one hand, the notion of compensating a husband for the wrong to his pride or honour seems open to the objection that an action for damages would simply add to his own humiliation and the family's disgrace.  On the other hand, the notion of a possessory or quasi-proprietary right is seen by many as degrading the wife to the status of a piece of property.</P>
    <P>I would hope by the manner in which I have made my case in concluding this debate to have caused a change of heart on the part of the Minister.  I say to him sincerely that this Bill is not presented in any political way.  There is a chance here <Col N="1501" /> tonight to make a start on the road to which I believe we are all committed. Surely not a single person will stand up publicly&mdash;and I am sure very few privately&mdash;and say that issues of the removal of discrimination against the women of our country must not have total support.  We will not solve all the problems in one night or one year.  but let us make a start.  In September 1978 the Minister himself indicated his commitment. On re-reading the speech he made last night it is clear that he himself also wanted to tackle the problem.  but there is a danger here.  He is confusing two issues.  Everybody agrees that the cause of action known as criminal conversation should be abolished.  It is absolute and total support as far as I can see.  His own backbencher and former Minister of State indicated similarly.  The Minister in his heart agrees also.  The Law Reform Commission gave us that proposal in absolutely unqualified terms.  The action for criminal conversation should be abolished.  That is what we want to do tonight.  I accept the view presented by the Minister that there are differences of opinion about introducing a cause of action available to all the family for adultery.  That is legitimate, a new concept proposed in the working paper of the Law Reform Commission in December 1978.  Obviously, it needs to be analysed and teased out as there are complications attached to it.  I discussed this proposal with a number of people and got conflicting views and advice on it.  This is an aspect which the Minister <Col N="1502" /> may bring before the House by way of a Bill and, if so, we will give it a reasoned hearing and offer our views in a non political way in trying to write a new law in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>A Bill proposing such a cause of action has in effect nothing to do with this Bill here.  This Bill relates to criminal conversation. There is absolutely no word of support for it from any individual.  any Deputy or any person outside of this House.  We have, I hope, made the case for its abolition in a restrained way.  The members of the Government party. given the slightest opportunity, would, I am sure, be delighted to support this Bill. Why then can we not put it through?  Let us at a later stage discuss the introduction of any further cause of action, but let us take the first step tonight.  We have made our case in a restrained way hoping to win the support of the Minister and his party.  In present circumstances we cannot put this through without the support of the Government, and from the heart I appeal to the Minister to give us that support tonight.  Let us take the first step on the road if we genuinely believe in the cause of full equality for women, if we believe in the concept that all aspects of discrimination should be removed.  Let us support this Bill, let us put it on the Statute Book and let it be the first step in this decade towards removing all further aspects of discrimination.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Petrol Charges.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise on the Adjournment the difficulties arising out of the pending prosecutions in respect of garages that charged the increased price for petrol prior to the coming into effect of the Ministerial Order.</P>
      <P>On budget day the Minister for Finance imposed an increase of 20p per gallon on petrol.  On the passing of a resolution before midnight on that day, February 27, that order came into effect after midnight.  It referred to suppliers of petrol so that deliveries as and from that time were subject to the new price increases. The problem arose because retailers were not allowed increase the price of petrol to the consumer until the following Monday because the relevant order so far as they were concerned&mdash;Maximum Prices (Petroleum Products) (No. 2) Order 1980&mdash;was issued on 28 February but stipulated that the price increase could not be imposed until 3 March.  Many retailers had to purchase petrol immediately after the budget in order to replenish their stocks simply because there was a substantial run on stocks prior to the budget in the almost certain knowledge that the prices would be increased.  The result of this was that on the Thursday morning many stations were without petrol and deliveries made were at the new price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> The choice that faced the retailers was either to sell to their customers at the old price, thereby incurring a loss of 20p per gallon, or to close their premises and wait until the Monday when they could apply the new price legitimately.  This was a rather invidious choice, a choice that was forced on the retailers by the administrative bungling of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  We know what was said before when garages closed.  Had they closed in this case they would have been accused again of exploiting the motorist.  It would have been said that those retailers had purchased petrol at the pre-budget rate and were hoarding it until they could apply the 20p increase.  In these circumstances many garage owners decided to sell to their customers at the new price and in many instances they were warned by officers of the Revenue Commissioners that they were in breach of the order and were threatened with prosecution.  That threat still hangs over them.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to highlight is the unfairness of the attitude adopted by the Revenue Commissioners in the circumstances in which the retailers found themselves through no fault of their own. Indeed, officers of the Revenue Commissioners told some garage owners that they could sell the petrol at the new price provided they guaranteed to refund to the customers the 20p per gallon extra being charged.</P>
    <P>Faced with the Hobson's choice of closing or of suffering a loss of 20p per gallon many thousands of retailers decided to close because they were not in a position to absorb the loss that they would otherwise have incurred.  As a result of this many people who needed to use their cars during the weekend were not able to get petrol.  Nobody can say how much inconvenience this situation caused, possibly there was even loss of life as a result of doctors not being able to attend to emergencies.  I have not heard of any such case but it is a possibility.  It was very wrong on the part of the Department not to have coordinated <Col N="1506" /> the orders so that the new prices would have applied simultaneously to both retailers and suppliers.</P>
    <P>My reason for raising this matter this evening is to try to ensure that proceedings will not issue against people who regarded themselves as acting fairly and in a practical manner on the occasion in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that for any law to be just it must apply equally to all individuals and to all sections of the community.  Unfortunately, however, the regulations that are the subject of this debate were not applied equally thereby giving the impression that there appears to be one law for the oil companies and another for the petrol retailers.  The order in question was retrospective so far as the oil companies were concerned with the result that deliveries on the day after the budget were subject to the increased prices whereas the retailers were prevented from charging the new prices until the following Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By acting in this unfair way, the Minister did a disservice to his Department. That was a retrograde step on his part, a step that has resulted in the laws being brought into disrepute.  Since this happened I have been receiving telephone calls from petrol retailers telling me that deliveries of 5,000 to 10,000 gallons were made to them on the Thursday and Friday of budget week and that, although these deliveries were subject to the price increase, they were prevented by order of the Minister from charging the new price until the following Monday. Many of those retailers are known to have kept their premises open seven days a week down through the years and in order not to disappoint their customers they sold the petrol on the weekend in question at a loss of 13p or 14p per gallon.  Many people who run these garages are trying to make a living and to raise families.  They are not multinationals. They are small retailers.  If a small garage owner sold 1,000 gallons over the period in question that could <Col N="1507" /> mean a loss of 14p multiplied by 1,000. That is a lot of money.  The Minister must ensure that this sort of bungling does not occur again.  This sort of situation should not be allowed happen again. The Minister announced in the budget that the increase would be of 20p but when he was making the order he increased the margin for petrol retailers by 2p.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to make the point that increases of this nature should be announced at the same time.  The threatened proceedings against retailers should not be proceeded with.  There is no point in blaming the Revenue Commissioners. They act under the direct authority of this House.  We should not pass the buck by saying they are outside our control and there is nothing we can do.  That is not good enough.  This House passes the legislation under which the Revenue Commissioners work.  We have to control this situation and ensure that summonses are not issued against innocent retailers.  The Minister should give us an assurance that the Revenue Commissioners will not be made the &ldquo;fall guys" for the bungling which has happened.</P>
      <P>If some petrol retailers are prosecuted every petrol retailer in the country will be up in arms.  I was amazed at the dissatisfaction among retailers over the last few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred the people who phoned me about this matter to the Department of <Col N="1508" /> Finance and the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  I got in touch with both Departments and each referred me to the other.  Nobody seemed to know who was responsible for what. It was simply a question of passing the buck.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>In future when budgetary changes are being made all interested Departments should work in unison, which did not happen on this occasion because the two Ministers involved appeared to be working on different levels.  As I said, the Minister will have to explain if the price inspectors were authorised by the Department to tell the retailers who had supplied proof that they had paid the increased price on supplies delivered on Friday that they would be prosecuted if they charged the new price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="The Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke) The Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>The Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his budget speech of 27 February 1980 the Minister for Finance announced an increase of the prices of all grades of motor spirits and of auto diesel of 20p per gallon VAT inclusive, at wholesale level, effective from 28 February 1980.</P>
      <P>On 28 February, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism made an order, the Maximum Prices (Petroleum Products) (No. 2) Order, 1980, providing <i>inter alia,</i> for an increase of 22p or 22.1p per gallon, VAT inclusive, on the retail price of petrol and auto diesel, with effect from 3 March 1980.  The purpose of the time lag, which seems to have escaped the Opposition, between the increase at wholesale level and at retail level was to allow for the disposal of petrol stocks bought at the old price.  I am sure that every fair minded person will agree that an occasion such as this should not be used by holders of large stocks of petrol to make a killing at the expense of the motorist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context I would refer to occasions in recent years when the Minister found it necessary to reduce the maximum retail price of petrol.  On those occasions it was very evident that certain petrol retailers were less than prompt in <Col N="1509" /> reducing their prices.  I accept that there can be difficulties which may delay the adjustments of the pricing mechanism of the petrol pumps but I must express my reservations as to whether this problem was really as widespread as claimed. Were it not for the energetic action of the prices inspectorate of my Department, a considerable number of motorists would have been unfairly penalised.  A similar situation could have arisen on the occasion of the recent increase in petrol prices, had not the order made provision for the clearing of old stock.</P>
    <P>During the period Thursday, 28 February and Monday, 3 March 1980, 140 complaints were received in the seven Priceline offices about petrol retailers increasing prices before the date permitted in the Maximum Prices (Petroleum Products) (No. 2) Order, 1980, that is, 3 March 1980.  Most of these complaints were dealt with on Thursday, 28 and Friday, 29 February.</P>
    <P>The investigations showed that some confusion had arisen from the Minister's budget speech and from subsequent news bulletins about the retail price of petrol.  Petrol retailers apparently were under the impression that retail prices had been increased from midnight on Wednesday, 27 February.  The fact that Priceline offices had a total of 279 inquiries about petrol prices from Thursday to Monday, 3 March confirms this view.</P>
    <P>All but three of the petrol retailers checked to date had either reduced prices prior to our visit, or reduced them <Col N="1510" /> when requested by the inspector, and agreed to refund the overcharges to complainants. Because of the confusion over the prices, it would not be fair to prosecute retailers who undertook to refund overcharges to complainants. However, in cases where petrol retailers refuse to refund overcharges and where evidence of overcharging, by way of statements from complainants, becomes available to the Department, legal proceedings will be instituted immediately. I do not offer any apologies for the Department taking proceeding in cases like that.</P>
    <P>In fairness I should say that there were retailers who because of the rush on petrol after the Minister's announcement on Wednesday afternoon had to purchase new stocks on Thursday at the new wholesale price.  These retailers were informed that they could not increase the retail price until the new maximum prices order came into force on Monday.  For this reason a small number of garages were compelled to close until they could pass on the increase.</P>
    <P>It seems to me a little sick, to say the least of it, to see Fine Gael in unison with their hearts bleeding on behalf of the petrol retailers when the people they should be concerned about are the consumers who had to pay the extra price.</P>

I assume also that the questions in as far as they relate to voluntary secondary schools confine themselves to halls for which grants were sought under the secondary schools building grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The total number of physical education halls built over the past five years in the various categories of schools mentioned is as follows: Vocational schools: 2; Community schools: 8.</P>

      <P>To bring classes down to the maximum size of 12 recommended by the Commission on Mental Handicap, 24 new teaching posts were created at an annual cost of approximately £128,800.</P>

The recordings were sent to adults from the locality working in the Third World.

This report outlines a comprehensive series of proposals for investment in the North-West.  Taken together with the 1977 Communications Report there now exists an excellent source of guidance on the needs of the North-West, the priorities for expenditure and the manner in which the undoubted extensive resource and potential of the area can be properly developed and exploited.  This present report is also of help in examining areas such as water and sewerage matters which are not included in the communications study.</P>
      <P>While I am not in a position to give any commitment to the implementation of the various proposals that arise in the report I can inform the Deputy that I have brought the report to the attention of the various other Departments with direct responsibility for the areas covered in the report and have asked that they give it their fullest consideration. I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the work of all those involved in drawing up this report and to commend them on the spirit of co-operation and initiative that they have shown.</P>

      <P>The reason why the person referred to by the Deputy is in receipt of reduced rate unemployment assistance is that an appeals officer has determined his weekly means at £24.00 and he is being paid at the weekly rate of £8.45, which is the maximum rate applicable to a married man with two children residing in a rural area&mdash;£32.45&mdash;less the value of his means.  If the claimant feels that his circumstances have changed since <Col N="1410" /> the date on which the appeals officer decided his case, it is open to him to apply at his local employment exchange to have his means reassessed.</P>
      <P>As I announced recently to the House, it is proposed to increase from the beginning of April the level of the disregards of income which are applicable to seasonal fishermen applying for unemployment assistance, a measure which will be of benefit to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 28 July 1979 to 8 August 1979.  His claim was not admitted as he had no paid or credited contributions in 1978, the contribution year governing his entitlement to benefit in the period from June 1979 to May 1980. It has since been ascertained that his 1978 insurance card was received under an incorrect insurance number.  The matter has now been rectified and a cheque in payment of the full amount of disability benefit due has been issued.</P>

      <P>A claim for disability benefit in respect of incapacity for work from 15 January 1980 was received in my Department from the person concerned on 31 January 1980.  Payment of benefit could not be authorised at that stage as he did not quote his social insurance number on the medical certificates. When, following inquiries, the social insurance number was obtained, payment of all flat-rate disability benefit due to the date of the latest medical certificate received, less the amount paid by way of supplementary welfare allowance, was <Col N="1411" /> made.  The person's entitlement to pay related benefit is being examined and any payment due will issue as soon as the necessary inquiries are completed.</P>
