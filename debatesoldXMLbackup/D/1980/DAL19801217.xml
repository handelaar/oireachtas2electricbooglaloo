      <P>I regret raising this matter without giving the Taoiseach notice but I have not had an opportunity of doing so.  I would like to ask him whether he would be willing to consult through the whips to see if it would be possible for a report to be made to this House today on the course of the fishing negotiations in Brussels in view of the disturbing reports which we have read this morning.  I recognise we cannot expect an answer immediately but would the Taoiseach consider a consultation with the whips to see if something of the kind would be possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £33,161,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and certain grants-in-aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original Vote for Health for 1980 was £541,860,000, including a capital provision of £27,500,000.  The first supplementary estimate which was agreed to last June totalled £93,190,000.  The Supplementary Estimate covered the amounts required to meet the cost of approved special pay claims which is <Col N="1393" /> £88,390,000 and the cost of increases in cash allowances which had been provided for in the 1980 budget, £4,800,000.  This brought the total approved Vote for Health for 1980 to £635,050,000.</P>
    <P>The net total additional grant now estimated to be required is £33,161,000. The gross amount required is £43,311,000 but deductions totalling £10,150,000 fall to be made because of an estimated increase of £10 million in the amount to be realised by way of appropriations-in-aid and an anticipated saving of £150,000 on Subhead G7 the Grant to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the gross supplementary requirement amounts to £43,311,000.  This is made up of: £36,311,000 for non-capital services, and, £7 million for capital services.</P>
    <P>The additional grant required for non-capital services arises under the following broad headings:</P>

    <P>Despite the very commendable efforts made by health boards and other health agencies to effect all possible ecomomies in the running of the services in 1980 a number of adverse factors reduced to an extent the effectiveness of their programmes for securing economies, such as particularly heavy increases in certain commodities like heating oil, drugs and medicines, and medical and surgical appliances and equipment.  It was found necessary in all the circumstances to provide additional assistance in the sum of £16 million to ensure that essential services could be maintained.  Of the total <Col N="1394" /> amount of supplementary estimate sought, £2.35 million relates to the General Medical Services Scheme as financed through the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  The amount which relates to the drugs refund scheme and the long-term illness drugs scheme is £3 million.  The balance of the increase is related largely to increases in costs associated with hospital services.</P>

    <P>If the outstanding claim has not been settled before the end of the month then the provision included in the Supplementary Estimate &mdash; £130,000 &mdash; which is referable to the claim will not be drawn.</P>
    <P>Arising from the question of surrendering unexpended funds which are authorised by the Dáil for specific purposes, I should perhaps refer to statements made recently in regard to the surrender in 1979 of amounts approximating to £27 million.  A sum of £25,918,000 was included in the Supplementary Estimate of £72,480,000 for Health in 1979 to cover the cost of pay claims where negotiations had reached an advanced stage or where offers in settlement had been made.  If agreement was not reached before the end of the year in respect of any of the claims not so far finally settled then the provision made in the Supplementary Estimate which was referable to any such claims would not be drawn.</P>
    <P>In the event the total amount falling to be surrendered on the voted subheads was £22,942,269 made up as follows:</P>
    <P> (i)  £22,804,000 in respect of offers on special pay claims which were not finally settled before the end of 1979, the main constituent of which was £21.25 million in respect of offers made to nurses;</P>
    <P>(ii)  surpluses on miscellaneous subheads offset by some minor excesses &mdash; £138,269.  </P>
    <P>The surplus realised on appropriations-in-aid amounted to £4,046,159.  The combined total of the amounts falling to be surrendered was £26,988,428.  This amount was certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The accounts as certified will be reviewed by the Public Accounts Committee, as is the normal course, probably early in 1981.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> The procedure followed was in strict accordance with established practice. Public moneys may be appropriated only on the authority of the Dáil, that is, expenditure may only be incurred within the limits of and the purposes of the amounts voted.  Any sums for authorised purposes which are not expended, including any surplus of appropriations-in-aid realised, must be surrendered.  While virement may be exercised with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, in regard to excesses and savings as between subheads, it relates to authorised expenditures, generally of a minor nature.  Virement, or the swithching of moneys between subheads, was availed of in that way in 1979.</P>
    <P>An amount equivalent to the provision of £22,804,000 for pay awards which was not drawn from the voted Supplementary Estimate for 1979 was included in the 1980 Supplementary Estimate for Health which was voted by the Dáil on 20 June 1980.  This amount was paid out during 1980 in espect of retrospection, almost entirely to nurses.</P>
    <P>The rates of social insurance contributions &mdash; employers' share &mdash; were increased as from April 1980.  The employers in this instance are health agencies funded from the Department's Vote.  The estimated amount required to meet the expenditure involved is £1.85 million.</P>
    <P>In line with the provisions of the second national understanding and the approval already given on the social welfare side, a double payment is being made for one week in the amounts of the payments made to recipients of disabled persons maintenance allowances, infectious diseases maintenance allowances, blind welfare supplementary allowances and domiciliary care allowances for handicapped children.  This will cost about £500,000 and is in addition to the amounts provided under the Social Welfare Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I am seeking an additional sum of £7 million to meet capital expenditure on health projects in 1980.</P>
    <P>The amount voted earlier this year for capital works was £27.5 million and, in addition, £0.5 million was available from <Col N="1397" /> the Hospitals Trust Fund making a total capital allocation of £28 million.</P>
    <P>I had sought this £28 million in the context of the need for constraints in public expenditure in the current year and I had expected that by placing certain restrictions on the capital programme it would have been possible to manage within this allocation.  However, despite these measures, this did not prove possible, due mainly to inflation and the fact that the output of work on the projects in progress in the restricted programme has been maintained at an unusually high level.  It is estimated that inflation added some £5 million to the cost of schemes this year.</P>
    <P>Accordingly an additional £7 million is required to meet commitments arising from this year's capital programme.  I would like to explain that despite the restrictions imposed this year it was possible to maintain progress on 79 projects which were in course of construction at the start of the year and to allow a limited number of new works to start, the major works being Cheeverstown Mental Handicap Centre and the first phase of the development of St. James's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Vote for Health provided for receipts amounting to £42.8 million.  It is now expected that income will amount to £52.8 million.  The increase of £10 million is made up of an increase of £8 million in receipts from health contributions and £2 million in receipts under EEC regulations.</P>
    <P>The receipts from health contributions have been more buoyant than had been anticipated.  The amount originally provided for in the original estimate was £35 million.  It is now expected that the amount received in 1980 will come to about £43 million.  When the original Estimate was prepared in 1979 there was no previous experience of the operation of an income-related contributions scheme which had commenced in April of that year.  The position was also affected by the difficulties caused by the postal strike in that returns from employers were delayed.  In the circumstances the income realised from health contributions <Col N="1398" /> in the first half of the contribution year 1979&mdash;80 was considerably below the level eventually reached.  An upward drift in the overall level of pay also meant that the income from health contributions was further boosted.  The increased receipts from health contributions in 1980 will mean that the level of Exchequer grant that would otherwise have been required can be significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>As a result of negotiations with the British Department of Health and Social Security agreement has been reached that an increase will be made in their payments in respect of health services provided for persons for whom they are liable under EEC regulations.  The additional receipts in 1980 over and above the amount provided for in the original estimate &mdash; £7.3 million &mdash; are expected to amount to £2 million.</P>
    <P>While the increase in grant requirements as set out in the second Supplementary Estimate is very considerable, the major proportion of the increase on the non-capital services end is due to movements in prices and pay levels and to unavoidable expenditure on the capital side to meet commitments.  I now ask the House to agree to the Supplementary Estimate of £33,161,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>By no stretch of the imagination can 1980 go down as having been a good year for health, for the Department of Health or for the progress of the health services, because it became clear very early on during the financial year that the best the Government were aiming for was to maintain, at the level of 1979 services, the existing health services. The fact that they failed even to achieve that objective is indicative of the lack of thought and foresight which was put into the planning of the current and capital budget by the Government at the commencement of the year and on the input made by the Department of Health and the Minister responsible in the prebudget negotiations and discussions which determine the share that each Department gets.  Perhaps it was understandable. There was a new Minister in one of the largest spending Departments and one of the Departments that, traditionally, <Col N="1399" /> suffers when there is a recession or cut-backs.</P>
      <P>At the commencement of the financial year we were constantly beleagured by statements and inspired leaks to the media by the Minister to give the impression that everything in the health garden was rosy and that there would be no cut-backs in the health services.  That, more than anything else, has contributed to the sense of dissatisfaction, unease and unrest amongst the personnel in the health services because they were assured at the start of the financial year that all their needs would be met and that the new Minister had arrived, like a light from heaven, to implement all the necessary services.  It was only as the year unfolded that we realised just how much of a shortfall there was in the Estimates provided, even for the continuation of the existing level of health services.  The original Estimate of £541 million had, after a short while, to be supplemented by £93 million and, today, by this Supplementary Estimate which the Minister is seeking, of £33 million.  On an original Estimate of £541 million the Minister has to look for a further £126 million &mdash; an increase overall on the original Estimate of 22 per cent.</P>
      <P>As I said in relation to one of the accounting procedures in relation to the Department of Social Welfare, I do not think, even in inflationary times, that it redounds to the credit of the Government, or the officials in the Department that, at the out-turn of the financial year they have to admit that during the course of the year they had to come back twice to the House to seek increases of 22 per cent on the original Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give a supreme example of under-budgeting, which neither the Minister, his predecessor, nor his officials can say was outside their compass or had not been drawn to their attention.  When legislation was being enacted to bring in the present health contribution system, to allow everybody over a certain figure to benefit from the refund in the cost of drug scheme, I pointed out to the Minister of the day, the present Taoiseach, that the amount he estimated as being necessary <Col N="1400" /> to pay for the refund of drugs and medicine scheme was totally inadequate and that he should think again.  The Minister was adamant, presumably on the advice of his officials, but we see today on an original estimate of somewhere between £3 and £4 million, the cost of the scheme, the Minister having to ask for a further allocation of £3 million.  in other words, in the course of this financial year, the cost of the refund of the drugs and medicine scheme has practically doubled over the original estimate.</P>
    <P>A child going to primary school, with any knowledge of the trend in the health services, could have told the Minister and his personnel that the original estimate was inadequate and the scheme itself was designed to encourage people to seek prescriptions.  It also encouraged the medical profession towards the prescription and dispensing of costly drugs.  There should be far more care exercised on the part of the Department of Health, the General Medical Services Payment Board in relation to the GMS and the Health Education Bureau in relation to the prescribing and dispensing of over-expensive drugs and medicines.  They are very often unnecessary for people who have them dispensed by chemists on the medical card scheme or on the refund of drugs and medicines scheme, at an unnecessary cost to the State and to the overall detriment of the health of people generally.  I believe this scheme is encouraging the medical profession and the general public to develop into a pill popping society.  I exhorted the Minister at the time to take care of the manner in which the scheme was introduced.  I regret to say all the trends which I prophesied at the time now appear to be coming to light.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to the Health Education Bureau to redouble their belated efforts &mdash; I accept there are belated efforts now being made &mdash; to bring some sanity into drug costs and the prescribing of certain drugs, brand name drugs, rather than the generic type drugs. The Minister distributed to the Members of the House yesterday a document from the Health Education Bureau for 1981. That document shows clearly, in chart form, that certain drugs which have been <Col N="1401" /> widely prescribed have only the same remedial effect as other drugs which are not as popular in the public mind and can cost far more than cheaper drugs which perform a similar task.  I have not got the document here but two of the most commonly used drugs which doctors prescribed are named valium and librium. There are similar drugs which can be prescribed far more cheaply and which are just as effective.</P>
    <P>Unless an improvement can be brought about in the excessive cost of drugs and medicines provided by certain firms, action will have to be taken by the Department of Health on behalf of the taxpayers.  It is not for me to say whether that involves the central purchasing of drugs in bulk or the setting up of certain machinery, price control and perhaps a prohibition on the sale and distribution of certain drugs.  The situation is getting more and more serious and is not being controlled by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the situation in our psychiatric services and to the physical conditions in so many of our psychiatric hospitals and institutions for the mentally handicapped.  At last, thankfully, there is a growing awareness on the part of the general public of the deplorable conditions in which so many of our patients in psychiatric hospitals and mental institutions are living.  The fault and the responsibility is ours.  It is not good enough to blame society at large; the main responsibility rests with the House and with responsible, successive Governments who have not devoted the money which is necessary to improve the physical conditions in these hospitals.  In the discussion on the Mental Services Bill we heard once again of the deplorable conditions under which so many of our psychiatric patients live.  Many mentally handicapped patients who should not be intermingled with psychiatrically ill patients are now and have been traditionally accommodated in one institution under the same roof in outmoded, Victorian type institutions.</P>
    <P>It is indicative of a lack of concern by the public and this House that, despite the fact that the media and some people <Col N="1402" /> in society are beginning to pay more attention to this area, in this year, when one might have hoped for a large input of a capital nature to bring about real improvement in the physical condition of the psychiatric services, we saw an increase of £500,000 &mdash; the capital estimate for 1979 was £27½ million and the Minister's estimate for 1980 was £28 million, with inflation running at 20 per cent. In real terms this means a severe cutback in capital services on the health side. Despite the Minister's reining in, restrictions and so on, the overspending for the year amounted to £7 million which forms part of this Supplementary Estimate of £33 million.</P>
    <P>Within the last month a number of us got a document from the consultant psychiatrists employed in the Eastern Health Board.  They made what has to be a very telling point.  They said:</P>
    <P>When requests are made to update the services to conditions more appropriate to this century &mdash; the stock answer is always that there is no money.  There is money however, for General Hospitals.  In the last few years the Department of Health has invested millions of pounds in this area with little or nothing being given to the psychiatric services.  Does this mean that depressed patients are cherished less by the state than patients with Hypertension, or, Arthritis?  From the state's track record this looks very much like the case.  If this is so, it raises many questions about our society, particularly, constitutional ones. </P>
    <P>They go on to say, and let us reflect on this for a moment:</P>
    <P>Let us put it another way.  If the state gave to the psychiatric and community services of the Eastern Health Board approximately twice the figure they promised to the electorate in Donegal in the recent by-election, the services could be updated.  We are talking about thirty-five million pounds.  Surely human dignity is as important as airports or will we use the airports to ferry the patients to destinations abroad <Col N="1403" /> where they can undergo treatment in more civilised conditions. </P>
    <P>That is the question we ought to ask ourselves in this week before Christmas. That is the question the Minister for Health, now almost one year in office, should ask himself.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has more muscle now than he had last year, when he was unable to get a fair share for the health services. I ask him to use it not for a real increase in the share of current expenditure in the health field for 1980, but for an increase of real measure on the capital side.  The capital side has been starved of funds and consequently the improvement of physical conditions and facilities which bring about an improvement and updating in the medical services and standards of care being provided could not be made in 1980.  I exhort the Minister for 1981 &mdash; I believe that it ought to be Government policy &mdash; that the emphasis should be on capital spending to improve services in a real way as well as providing much needed employment and a much needed boost for the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I want to encourage the Minister to see a real increase in the capital services on the health side as part of an overall Government commitment towards the encouragement of employment and the boosting of the economy to expenditure on capital services.  A large share of those capital services should be devoted, allocated and promised to the improvement of physical facilities in mental hospitals and pyschiatric institutions.  I accept this will have to be over a phased programme but the need is there, and it is great, for a commitment to a five-year programme for the eradication of the Victorian workhouse for mentally handicapped and psychiatrically ill patients.</P>
    <P>I promise the Minister the support of this party for any measures taken to help those who are mentally handicapped and the psychiatrically ill.  The House realises that they are also constituents to whom we have a responsibility, which I do not believe we or our predecessors adequately exercised in the past.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  The Minister referred to the fact that it was reported in the press that the Department of Health handed back £27 million.  I accept entirely the Minister's explanation but it is regrettable that the transfer of these unexpended funds was represented to the public in that way.  It is clear that money voted by the Dáil for a particular purpose, but not expended must be returned.  They cannot be taken out of one pocket and put into another pocket. The public finances and accounting procedures are, perhaps, rather cumbersome but it is necessary to realise that they are devised in that way to provide proper checks and safeguards on behalf of the public Exchequer and the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Minister and the Department I accept that while there is a need for the expenditure of not only £27 million but multiples of that figure, the fact is that this money was voted by the Dáil last year in the event of a wage agreement being settled and money being there to meet that wage agreement.  If that did not come about, the money had to be transferred to the Exchequer and be revoted.  To some extent it is regrettable that people who are very anxious to see additional money spent in their areas might have been misled into thinking that there was in some way an uncaring attitude on the part of the Department.  In fairness to the Department I have to make these remarks.</P>
      <P>It is also appropriate to point out that the junior Minister for Health, Deputy Nolan, has been nominated to become a member of the Cabinet, and, as shadow Minister, I offer him my good wishes in his new role.  One always has to admire a clever politican.  I suppose it is a fair trick for a fellow to be in the Department of Health for a year, with special responsibility for child services, and manage to get out of the Department without issuing the report about child services.  That is a fair trick for any Minister to do, and do on his way up rather than on his way sideways&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to give way because there are several other speakers anxious to contribute.  In general I want to deplore the limited amount of time we have to discuss these Supplementary Estimates.  This was not a happy year for the health services.  In relation to the capital programme especially there was a real cutback which I hope will be reversed in real terms next year.</P>
      <P>I was asked particularly to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that he promised twice on recent occasions to announce the planning board for the new Tallaght Hospital in County Dublin.  The composition of that board has not yet been announced, much to the detriment of that much-needed hospital.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know when we may expect to see that board established and real planning for the provision of that hospital get under way.</P>
      <P>I hope 1981 will be a better year than 1980, a year which can only go down in the memory of those employed in the health services as being the year when they did not have sufficient money even to buy elastoplast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the £33 million now being voted is merely to make up for the under-estimation in the provisions voted earlier in the year and that it is not an additional sum of money for new works so badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to that part of the Minister's speech devoted to capital grants-in-aid for hospital works, the provision <Col N="1407" /> of new hospitals and extensions to existing ones.  I have raised at Question Time on several occasions the necessity for a new 100-bed replacement geriatric unit in Dungarvan to replace the present St. Joseph's Hospital which has been due for replacement for the last 30 years.  The conditions obtaining in this hospital have been described as Dickensian.  I could not dispute that fact.  Deputy Boland in the course of his speech referred to Victorian workhouses.  Conditions at that hospital could be described as Dickensian or Victorian but certainly they should not be tolerated in any civilised society.  At Cabinet meetings when the Minister is seeking funds for projects, especially hospital projects for 1981, I hope he will make a point of ensuring that projects such as these are given the go ahead.  I also want to see additional moneys being provided for the new general hospital to replace Ardkeen in Waterford, long due for replacement, the plans for which were presented to the Minister's predecessor. Can the Minister give us any hope that the moneys for the provision of these two long sought projects will be provided in the Estimates for 1981?  We in the South-Eastern region suffered severe cut-backs in our health estimates for the current year, cut-backs which are disproportionate to those being imposed on other health boards.  The projects I have mentioned have suffered as a result of these cut-backs.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister also the fact that annoyance was expressed at last week's meeting of the South Eastern Health Board with regard to his recent visit to St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny.  While I have always found the Minister to be most courteous in his dealings with public representatives, and with Deputies in particular, I should like him to know that there was a deputation chosen to meet him to discuss some capital projects which had been discarded in 1980.  That deputation intended asking him to provide the additional moneys necessary in 1981.  They felt snubbed at the manner in which they were ignored on that occasion.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that visit <Col N="1408" /> when replying because it was severely criticised at last week's meeting of the board.  I know that some members of the board felt their position was virtually ignored and they felt aggrieved.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could elaborate somewhat on the sum of £0.5 million referred to regarding the Hospitals Trusts Fund.  Is that the total amount of money coming from that fund in the current year and, if not, what is the total?  Moreover, how does the total amount of money from this fund compare with the amount granted in previous years.  If such comparison shows a downward trend perhaps he could tell us whether there are any moves afoot to substitute it with an alternative type of fund.  It may be that the type of project used for raising funds of this nature has outlived its usefulness and is due for replacement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The £33 million we are voting here today, as Deputy Deasy has said, is basically to allow for errors of estimation and matters which could not be adequately estimated when the original Estimate was introduced.  It is crystal clear, however, that the Estimate does and can do absolutely nothing to meet the basic problem in this area.  The basic problem in this area is that when the present Minister for Health assumed his present responsibilities he discovered that his immediate predecessor had done absolutely nothing for the preceding three years and had allowed the health services, our hospitals and other basic essentials of the health care system to, at best, mark time and at worst, actually get worse.  Unfortunately, he did not have the option, available to some incoming Ministers of a new Government, of throwing up their hands in horror at the state in which they find the books of the Department with which they are entrusted, because the person who entrusted them to the present Minister is the person who had been immediately responsible for them just before he assumed office.  The history of the Department of Health in the time of the Minister's predecessor was a tale full of sound and fury signifying very little.  That is the basic problem the Minister faces <Col N="1409" /> and one that this Estimate will not and cannot solve.</P>
      <P>I should like now to refer in some detail to some of the subheads being dealt with in this Supplementary Estimate.  The first is in relation to the double payment being made to the recipients of certain cash allowances.  These are identified as recipients of disabled persons maintenance allowances, infectious diseases maintenance allowances, blind welfare supplementary allowances and domiciliary care allowances for handicapped children.</P>
      <P>When these allowances were first introduced we welcomed them from these benches, but we drew the Minister's attention to what we saw as a serious flaw in the scheme, one which I believe was drawn to his attention about the same time by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions under the terms of the national understanding.  That flaw was that the double week's payment was being made only to people who became eligible in the week beginning 12 December, or who were already eligible at that date.  It excluded a small number of people who will become eligible for these allowances in the final two weeks of December, including Christmas week.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the number of people involved is relatively small.  I have no doubt that the amount of money involved is relatively small.  Therefore, it is all the more Scrooge-like of the Minister to deny the double week's payment to people who become entitled after the end of the week beginning December 12.  I fail to understand how any excuse, such as administrative difficulties, could be pleaded in order to avoid giving a small amount of money to a very small number of people to make their Christmas just a little more bearable this year.  I do not know what the final outcome will be of the discussions the Minister or his Department may have had with the congress people about this.  Personally I regard this as a total breach of the spirit of the national understanding which is bitterly resented in many trade union quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the drugs <Col N="1410" /> refund scheme.  It is true, as Deputy Boland said, that very expensive drugs are over-prescribed.  It is astonishing that an error of estimation of the order of 100 per cent should have been made in relation to the cost of this scheme.  There are a number of other aspects of the scheme to which enough attention had not been paid up to now.  In the first instance, over-prescribing of very expensive drugs predated the introduction of this scheme and will go on, no matter what refund of drugs scheme is in existence, for as long as the drug companies and their advertising agencies exercise so much control over the prescribing habits of our medical practitioners and are allowed to exercise so much control and influence.</P>
    <P>It is also worth pointing out that it is not ultimately of very much satisfaction, except in cost terms, for a mother of six children whose husband becomes unemployed a fortnight before Christmas to be told that she is now being prescribed a less expensive but equally effective drug which will do the work of valium or librium.  Drugs are not the answer to these people's problems which are rooted in a much deeper social and economic situation.  We must beware of assuming that the answer to their problems is to reduce the prices of medicaments which are meant to keep people passive and docile in the face of appalling adversity.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions about the refund of drugs scheme.  First, is he aware of an apparently fairly recent practice by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in relation to their own refund of drugs scheme. I am given to understand that a change of policy on the part of the board has meant that they refund their insured clients with £8 for drugs in any month. They point out, as they are entitled to do, that any excess of £8 for prescribed drugs can be recovered from the Eastern Health Board under the refund of drugs scheme.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in some cases subscribers to the VHI will feel somewhat annoyed about this because the delays in the processing of payments under the refund of drugs scheme can be very considerable whereas, I imagine, the <Col N="1411" /> VHI administration is rather more efficient. What seems to be happening is that the VHI are off-loading a responsibility which they accepted at one stage in relation to their insured subscribers on to the public health services.  I should like to ask the Minister the degree to which this may be partly responsible for the enormous percentage increase in the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The second question &mdash; and it is a key question &mdash; is to ask the Minister is he aware of the extent in which this scheme is being abused.  I believe it is being abused in two significant ways.  First, it is altogether possible that dockets and receipts issued by pharmacists for duly prescribed drugs can be altered by people who pay the bills and submitted in an altered form to the Eastern Health Board where the administrative staff, I would hazard a guess, are not remotely capable of doing any substantial amount of checking, much less checking back with the original pharmacist to find out what the amount of the original invoice was.</P>
    <P>In the second place I believe that considerable pressure can be brought and is being brought by customers on pharmacists to issue receipts for non-prescribed medications in such a way as to make it appear that they were in fact issued on foot of a medical prescription.  I have no doubt that the pharmacy trade is a very competitive one.  The threat to a pharmacist of any substantial body of customers removing their custom to the pharmacist next door or down the street is a very real one and could put many pharmacists in an intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me to have been essential from the outset of this scheme that a spot-check system should have been inaugurated and that sample checking should have been done in relation to the amount of the drug and whether or not it was actually prescribed.  The scheme has now grown to such proprotions that one has to ask how much would it cost to adequately police and check out a scheme that involves the repeated processing of so many relatively small items of information over a very short period of time.  The scheme is costing £6½ million <Col N="1412" /> now.  I wonder how much would it cost the State to say in relation to all genuinely prescribed drugs that it would bear the cost.  I tend to think the cost of adequately policing the scheme, added to the present cost of the scheme, would be very high.</P>
    <P>The next thing I want to talk about is in relation to some detailed aspects of the Supplementary Estimate and in particular the work of the Health Education Bureau.  On the whole, the Health Education Bureau does a magnificent job of work.  It is an initiative in preventive medicine which was long overdue and, by and large, I would not grudge it a penny of the money it gets for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I was offended in the extreme and disturbed yesterday to get through the post from the Health Education Bureau a 400-page expensively printed, expensively produced and expensively bound year book and diary.  I have no doubt that every other Member of this and the other House got the same piece of literature. The relevance of this piece of propaganda to the cause of health education is marginal at best and almost certainly negative. I regard it as a total waste of money sanctioned by the same man who, wearing one of his other hats, closed down the combat poverty committee this month.  I should like to ask the Minister to seriously consider whether the cause of health education or the cause of anything other than the fawning congratulations he may get from some of the recipients of this expensive piece of nonsense is well served in this way.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of Appropriations-in-Aid to which the Minister referred.  It is interesting to note the substantial increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid but we have to remember that were it not for a particular aspect of the legislation which set up this inter-related scheme the Appropriations-in-Aid would be even greater.  If I am not mistaken there is a cut-off limit of £7,000 for contributions under the income-related scheme.  That means that anybody earning more than £7,000 &mdash; the secretary of a Government Department now earns £21,000 &mdash; is paying exactly the same as a person earning £6,999.  That cut-off point is a real discrimination <Col N="1413" /> in favour of the rich in our society and one which removes further possible sources of resources from an under-financed health scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the money the Minister had to return to the Department of Finance during the year, I should like to state that we fully accept his explanation that in terms of normal accounting practices there was nothing else that could be done with the money and that the principle of virement only normally applies to relatively small sums and then with the sanction of the Department of Finance.  I invite the Minister to consider this and give his personal views on the adequacy of this Victorian system of running a Government, or a Department of State, in the final two decades of the twentieth century.  That Victorian accounting system adopted and perfected in Britain was basically designed to ensure that money was not wasted or expended for purposes for which it was not voted.</P>
    <P>There is now substantial need to look at that system again and provide for much greater flexibility in the allocation of public finances so as to ensure that money voted for Health can be spent in Health on suitable projects with the approval of the Government, or the Department of Finance.  One of the problems about public administration in this tradition is that it is basically a tradition which is devoted to the saving rather than spending of money.  It is because it is a tradition devoted to saving rather than spending that it is not one which thinks in terms of always having, as every Government should have, on the shelf up to two dozen projects begging for money and ready to go into action at the drop of a Government cheque book.</P>
    <P>Thinking positively about spending money would be a much better way of approaching the situation with necessary safeguards than the system we have inherited from the Victorians and should be reviewed, particularly at this stage in our history.  This is a large Supplementary Estimate.  It is a patching up operation, it meets the pay bills but it does not solve the basic problems and I do not think <Col N="1414" /> under this administration those basic problems will ever be seriously tackled.</P>

      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to provide money out of the Estimate for the provision of full maternity services in the county hospital in Roscommon town.  This issue has been going on for many years, long before my membership of this House, and it has reached the stage where it is of paramount importance that a decision should be made to appoint an obstetrician-gynaecologist and paediatrician for the maternity unit at Roscommon County Hospital.  The people of Roscommon have been patient in the negotiations between the Western Health Board, the authority of Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and the Department of Health. Our patience is almost exhausted now.  It is in the interests of the mothers and babies of County Roscommon that the provision of the services I mentioned should be made without further delay.</P>
      <P>The maternity wing at the hospital is fully equipped and there is a full back-up staff.  The other medical personnel necessary, such as a surgeon and physician, are also available.  Without the appointment of an obstetrician-gynaecologist and paediatrician the unit cannot be regarded as a full maternity unit.  I appeal to the authorities of the Ballinasloe hospital to come to terms immediately with the Western Health Board and agree on an application for a joint unit between that hospital and Roscommon County Hospital so as to ensure we have full services in Roscommon.  It is interesting to note that the chairman of the Portiuncula hospital board is none other than Mr. Sean MacBride, S.C., a former Member of this House and a man of outstanding ability.  However, in this regard he has not contributed anything to the debate between the two authorities. In fact, he has set out to frustrate the appointment in Roscommon County Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in an application which has been made for a special kidney machine for the mid-west region.  At present it will be argued that the number of people seeking this specialised kidney service in the mid-west is small.  Nevertheless, the number is <Col N="1416" /> increasing yearly and, as a result, when we survey the number of people involved and where they have to go for such a machine we find that most of those people have to go to Galway, Dublin or Cork.  In one case in my county a person, a young girl, had to leave home and take up a job in Galway in order to be near this specialised service.  I am here today to appeal to the Minister to give prime consideration to an application from the Mid-Western Health Board in the very near future for this service.</P>
      <P>I have about half a minute to go.  I would like to raise something in connection with the choice of doctor scheme. The number of patients allowed on a panel, 2,000, is grossly in excess of what any doctor could serve.  In my county, and I would say that the same applies throughout the country, the doctors are not capable of giving the service to so many people and as a result we find bitterness and friction between patients and doctors because doctors are not able to come out late at night.  The good reputation and the good name of the medical profession, of the GPs who always had the tradition of the bedside manner, are dying fast.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about reducing the number of patients on a panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say first and foremost that I am somewhat disappointed that none of the Deputies in the course of all the contributions thanked me for getting these funds to maintain the level of services during the year, which aspect, of course, is relevant.  I take it from what has been said in the House that the Deputies all round welcome the provision of these additional funds to maintain the services and to allow in particular the opening of many new units which, unfortunately, once opened run into current continuing expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a large number of projects under way &mdash; I have mentioned 79.  People have mentioned Donegal in the course of this debate.  I should point out that I was responsible for opening a reasonable number of units in Donegal because this was planned from the beginning <Col N="1417" /> of last year.  I had to leave the opening until late in the year because of the provision of finances for the running costs of these units, but it allowed me to open these units as the year went on, and this was always our intention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland said that in his view this has not been a good year for the health services.  The health services have improved in many aspects and a number of projects have gone ahead in very major ways in the course of the year.  I mentioned 79 projects.  These are all advancing to different stages.  We commissioned a very large number of projects so far as these areas are concerned and I could not take up the time of the House at this stage to mention all of them, but it was a very good year for a very large number of units in the health services.  Cavan Surgical Hospital, Ennis County Hospital, St. John of God's, Cahercalla, the Mercy Hospital and St. Finbarr's in Cork all have had additional units and pieces of equipment provided.  There is the pathology laboratory and X-ray department in Letterkenny Hospital, Temple Street Hospital, Dr. Steevens Hospital, the Mater Hospital, a very large list of developments during the year.  Of course, all of these developments were important and it was a worthwhile year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland, particularly, criticised the Supplementary Estimates, especially the previous one for £93 million.  It was always quite clear that there would be a requirement for the special pay awards of which he is very much aware as are all Members of the House, which was £88.3 million of the £93 million.  This was not a question of a lack of estimation, it was a question of the conclusion of the work of an arbitrator.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland expressed concern about the drugs refund scheme and I would agree with him.  I would be quite concerned to ensure that this scheme works as efficiently as possible without harassing people unduly in the course of any of our activities.  I am looking at this at present and I think the Deputy gave me some credit for that.  I will try to make it as efficient as possible mainly because I want to see the services working as <Col N="1418" /> widely and efficiently as possible for the community.</P>
    <P>In particular, Deputy Boland raised the question of the psychiatric services. He talked about deplorable conditions and the letters circulated by consultant psychiatrists in the Eastern Health Board.  There has been considerable debate in recent times on the question and a good deal of criticism about conditions in psychiatric hospitals.  I would like at first to make quite clear one aspect which was involved in this criticism, that is that the Secretary of my Department of Health has been criticised personally and publicly by some of these people who were consultant psychiatrists.  This was grossly unfair, inaccurate and ill-founded criticism and, because I regard the Secretary of my Department as one of the finest public servants that you will find within the public service as a whole, totally committed and dedicated to public service and regarded as such throughout the public service, I want to put on record that I refute totally and unequivocally the comments made in that regard.  There has been general criticism about the conditions in the psychiatric units.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy should let me speak now.  I did not interfere with him when he was talking.  Since I became Minister for Health about a year ago I have visited a number of mental hospitals throughout the country in which institutional services for the psychiatrically ill are provided.  In a number of them that I visited the standard of the environment in which the services are provided is of the very highest quality, and I want to make that quite clear.  The atmosphere is warm and caring and the staff at all levels are totally involved in and committed to the care and activation of all the patients. It is significant that the Nurse of the Year <Col N="1419" /> Award recently went to Nurse Marian Doyle from St. Senan's in Enniscorthy, a hospital dealing with the psychiatrically ill.  Many of the staffs in these services have been offended by the statements which have been made publicly, especially given the fact that they have been doing such an excellent and caring job and have improved their own environment so well.  Buildings which are old and outdated by modern standards have been adapted and renovated so that they are functional and at the same time comfortable. They have been decorated and furnished with imagination with regard to the need to preserve the privacy and dignity of the individual patient.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, where new buildings have been provided they have contributed to the comprehensiveness of the complex and have enhanced the services which the institution provides.  I have mentioned some of the buildings I have visited and some which are quite outstanding in this respect include St. Fintan's, Portlaoise, St. Conal's in LetterKenny, St. Loman's in Mullingar, St. Davnet's in Monaghan, St. Dympna's in Carlow and St. Senan's in Enniscorthy. These are all units some of which are very old but which have carried out the kind of adaptation that was encouraged by my predecessor and indeed predecessors.  On the other hand, there are buildings of the same general age in other institutions where there is a general air of neglect and where apathy rather than activity seems to be the order of the day.  Incidentally, there are new buildings in these institutions which in some instances have assumed the aura of neglect which characterises the older buildings.  I have found these contrasts very puzzling and this is something I personally intend to pursue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take St. Brendan's, which has been publicised so much recently, and in particular the alleged failure of my Department to provide money for it, there are two aspects to this matter.  First, let us take the long-run situation for the kind of patient now in St. Brendan's.  This is a huge complex of buildings, some over 150 years old.  The number of patients has been dropping steadily and in the <Col N="1420" /> past 15 years has declined from 1,614 to 1,065.  Modern developments in psychiatric care which in the Dublin area have included considerable development in outpatient treatment facilities, including day hospital, outpatient clinics and hostels, have contributed to this decline in patient population.  Nevertheless, it must be recognised that a number of patients must remain in psychiatric hospitals and that facilities in them must be satisfactory. As regards St. Brendan's, there have been many innovations and improvements in recent years, including a new admission unit, a new outpatients' department and new nurse- training facilities. In all, since 1966 £1 million has been spent on such developments.</P>
    <P>Capital allocations to health boards are divided into two categories; first there are allocations for specific major projects which are selected according to the priority of the health board.  In this regard I should say that the Eastern Health Board did not, in spite of all the protestations in recent times, list works&mdash;particularly to St. Brendans&mdash;at St. Brendans as a first priority for major capital development in proposals submitted to my Department for the years 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980.</P>
    <P>To take the specific major allocations first, in 1977 a total allocation of £600,000 for specific projects was made available to the Eastern Health Board.  None of this was for St. Brendan's.  In 1978, £1.15 million was made available for specific projects and £400,000 of this went to St. Brendan's.  In 1979 £890,000 was made available for specific projects of which £370,000 was for St. Brendan's.  In the present year the allocation to Eastern Health Board projects was £260,000 of which £150,000 was for St. Brendan's.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are minor capital schemes.  For the years 1977, 1978 and 1979 each health board received an allocation from which it could spend money at its choice on capital schemes costing not more than £50,000.  In 1977 the Eastern Health Board was allocated £300,000 under this arrangement.  It assigned £62,000 to St. Brendan's.  In 1978 the board received £350,000 for minor capital schemes.  It allocated £92,000 to St. Brendan's. In 1979 it received £400,000 for <Col N="1421" /> minor capital schemes and it allocated nothing to St. Brendan's: so, of over £1 million available to the Eastern Health Board in the three years 1977-1979 for minor capital schemes, only £154,000 was provided by the board for St. Brendan's.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that in the years 1977-79 the Eastern Health Board were provided with revenue resources amounting to £6.2 million for expenditure upon the upkeep and maintenance of their hospitals and clinics.  I am, as I said earlier, somewhat puzzled by the contrast in the standards of some psychiatric hospitals.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, I am somewhat puzzled by the contrast in the standards of some psychiatric hospitals.  I have seen for myself that parts of St. Brendan's are bad.  Why should they be so bad when the board had at its disposal moneys of the order of £7 million in the three years 1977-79 to spend at their discretion? Why, in addition, did the board not accord St. Brendan's first priority in seeking resources for major capital projects? These are the questions and I intend to pursue them with the board.  I do not intend to be diverted from this by the protestations of the people who are possibly attempting to divest themselves of responsibility which they themselves carry.  I assure Deputies that this is a matter that I shall take very seriously in the coming year and I shall do what I can within the resources available to me to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Numerous other points were raised by Deputies and I should be glad to reply to them in full but we do not have the time now.  I will communicate with Deputies who asked specific questions.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £12,399,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1980 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid. </P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Environment is required to meet additonal expenditure on 11 subheads of the Department's Vote.  The amount involved is £12,399,000 bringing the total for the Vote for Environment in 1980 to £289,305,000.</P>
      <P>The amounts provided for &ldquo;pay&rdquo; in the original estimate did not, in accordance with standard practice, make provision for the extra amounts needed to implement pay awards negotiated during the year.  Such awards include the application of the first phase of the second national understanding 1980, the implementation of the second phase of the recommendations of the interim report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector and of a number of special increases awarded to other grades.  The total extra amount being provided for pay in the Supplementary Estimate is £477,000.  Departmental staff covered by subhead A.1. of the Vote account for £428,000 of this amount.  The grant-in-aid to An Foras Forbartha is being increased by £41,000.  An extra £6,000 is being provided in subhead L to cover the cost of these pay awards in the case of the National Road Safety Association and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The remaining £2,000 is in subhead Q in respect of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of £150,000 for subhead B for travelling and incidental expenses arises because of increases in the rates of travelling and subsistence allowances, <Col N="1425" /> effective from 1 January 1980 in each case.  There was also increased activity on inspections generally but particularly in the housing grants area where every effort was made to have the maximum number of applications inspected with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>On subhead B.2. for office machinery and other office supplies the increase is £17,000.  This amount is needed to enable the Department to meet their unavoidable commitments for the year arising from the purchase of essential equipment. The additional £50,000 required for Post Office services is for the most part due to the delay in receipt of accounts because of the postal strike last year.</P>
    <P>An additional £4 million is being provided in subhead E.2. for private housing grants.  The original allocation was £23 million &mdash; £8.5 million being earmarked for new house grants and £14.5 million for house improvement grants.  An unexpectedly large number of applications were made for both the ordinary improvement grants and the special improvement grants to reduce dependence on oil for domestic heating.  It became clear that the budget provision would be inadequate and the Government approved a supplementary provision of £4 million in September.  This brings the total allocation for the year to £27 million which is the highest on record, enabling the payment of over 50,000 grants in all.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the extra amount of £6,000 being provided in subhead L to meet additional pay costs of the National Road Safety Association and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. The remaining £5 million of the extra provision is for payment of road grants which brings the total provision under this heading for road grants for 1980 to £52,969 million.</P>
    <P>Since assuming responsibility for the Department of the Environment I have been considering in detail future requirements for the road network.  I am very conscious that the growth of our economy, with the attendant growth in road traffic, has placed a severe burden on the <Col N="1426" /> road network, emphasised particular deficiencies in the system and the adverse effects which these deficiencies can have on the achievement on national development. I am fortunate to have available to me the Road Development Plan which was published last year and which outlined a programme of work designed to eliminate the existing deficiencies in the road system and to cater for anticipated growth on the more important sections of it.  This plan provides for flexibility in the timing of projects, having regard not merely to the availability of finance, but to progress by the road authorities in planning, design and the acquisition of land by agreement or by compulsory purchase.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House of the Government's and my personal commitment to the implementation of the proposals as set out in the Road Development Plan. I am at present preparing a programme of works for 1981 which I am confident will go a long way towards eliminating deficiencies in the road system, with particular emphasis on the principal routes and also on ensuring a satisfactory standard of maintenance.  This programme will, in particular, place special emphasis on strengthening the existing road structure and on the improvement of roads which will provide the infrastructural base essential for industrial development. Indeed the contribution which such a programme of works can make to the industrial, commercial and social life of the community is immense.  I am also fully aware of the invaluable supplementary benefits that will be derived from a full roads programme in that it will create activity in the construction industry; generate employment both on-site and offsite and utilise materials and equipment of Irish manufacture.</P>
    <P>The increased voted provision of £52.969 million for road grants for 1980 has enabled the allocation of grants to the unprecedented level of £58.46 million. These grants represent a significant commitment on the part of the Government to tackle the deficiencies in the road system, as identified in the Road Development Plan.  The grants have also contributed largely to the high level of <Col N="1427" /> employment that has been sustained on the works programmes of the road authorities.  In particular, the supplementary sum of £5 million now being sought forms part of the Government's undertaking in the national understanding to maintain and stimulate employment.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of roads I think it is appropriate that I refer briefly to the question of road safety and to the work of the National Road Safety Association. The contribution of this association to the improvement of safety standards on our roads is immense.  The National Road Safety Association are responsible for the organisation and implementation of road safety campaigns. The Association has organised a winter campaign which will extend over Christmas and into the New Year, highlighting pedestrian and cyclist safety and the menace of drinking and driving.  At the association's request, and with the co-operation of Radio Telefís Éireann, I have made a special appeal for extra care on the roads over the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Traffic Accident Facts</i> as published annually by an Foras Forbartha indicates that the human factor contributes in nine out of ten accidents.  They make it clear that as far as drivers are concerned, the main contributory factors are excessive speed and drinking and driving, while for pedestrians the main faults are careless crossing of roads and failure to make themselves more visible on the roads at night.  Failure on the part of drivers and front seat passengers to wear safety belts increases the severity of injuries in accidents, resulting in many deaths.  I would appeal to everyone to make a very special effort during the festive season so that accidents will be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The additional £500,000 provided for in subhead N arises from the decision to introduce an interest subsidy as a temporary measure to building societies. Building societies' investment and mortgage rates remained at 9 per cent and 14.15 per cent respectively during 1979. The level at which societies pitch their investment rate is of the utmost importance in attracting new funds to enable them to meet the demand for mortgage <Col N="1428" /> finance and assist in financing the Government's housing programme.  In setting their investment rate societies are conscious of other competitive rates, mainly those of the associated banks.  Traditionally, societies have always maintained a differential over the minimum bank investent rate.  However, their rate of 9 per cent which operated throughout 1979 was 1 per cent below the minimum bank rate of 10 per cent which came into effect in June 1979.  Because of the direct relationship between the investment rate and the mortgage rate, I know that in taking the decision not to increase their investment rate after the bank rate increase in June 1979 societies were conscious of the hardship which would be created for existing borrowers.  However, it is clear that the size of their inflows in the first half of 1979, consequent on the repatriation of funds as a result of the imposition of exchange controls following Ireland's entry into the EMS, had a major bearing on this decision.</P>
    <P>Following a further increase in the banks' minimum investment rate from 10 per cent to 11.5 per cent with effect from 11 April 1980 the building societies informed my predecesor of their proposal to increase their investment rate from 9 per cent to 10.75 per cent which would necessitate an increase in the mortgage rate from 14.15 per cent to 16.5 per cent. Following a meeting of representatives of the Irish Building Societies Association and the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the former Minister for the Environment, a working group was set up to examine the problems faced by societies and to make recommendations in the matter.  The group unanimously recommended that an immediate increase in building society investment rates to 10.75 per cent was warranted as the minimum increase necessary to enable societies to retain their existing funds. The group also accepted that the mortgage rate had to be increased to 16.5 per cent to enable societies to meet the extra liabilities incurred by the increased deposit rate.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the report of the working group, and conscious of the severe hardship which would otherwise <Col N="1429" /> have been created for borrowers, the Government decided to make available, on a temporary basis, a direct payment by way of subsidy to the societies for the purpose of enabling them to offer such rate of interest on shares and deposits as might be specified from time to time, thereby obviating the need to increase the mortgage rate from its existing level of 14.15 per cent.  Having regard to the current level of interest rates generally an investment rate of 10.75 per cent was specified for this purpose.</P>
    <P>This subsidy was a temporary measure and the need for it was to be kept under constant review in the light of changes in interest rates generally and inflow of funds into the societies.  I am pleased that the downward trend in interest rates generally in recent months has made it possible to terminate the subsidy with effect from 1 October 1980.  The cost to the Exchequer in 1980 will be that in respect of the month of June only.  While the investment rate was increased from 1 May 1980 the mortgage rate increase did not take effect until 1 June 1980.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in a supplementary estimate passed in June last for £1.4 million to meet the requirements arising this year in respect of the subsidy to building societies.  The Revenue Commissioners have since drawn attention to the fact that because of the requirements of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, building societies will be required to pay tax in respect of the subsidy.  Such a reduction in the net amount receivable by the societies would not have been in accordance with the Government decision or with the purposes for which the subsidy was provided.  It is therefore necessary to increase the amount of the payment to the societies in order to ensure that their net receipts after tax will be £1.4 million. It is for this purpose that the additional £500,000 is being provided in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Following on the further reduction in bank interest rates by the associated banks I had a number of discussions with representatives of the Irish Building Societies Association on their interest rates and future policy generally and I am <Col N="1430" /> pleased to note that they have decided to further reduce their lending rate with effect from January 1981.</P>
    <P>The extra £2 million in subhead O for malicious injuries arises because of the difficulty of estimating at the beginning of the year the likely recoupment to local authorities in respect of decrees granted and arising from payment within the year.  The amount of claims falling on the Exchequer in any year depends on the number and nature of the claims made on local authorities and the speed with which claimants can have their claims processed and, of course, the decision of the courts as to liability and amounts to be granted in individual cases.  It is not possible therefore to predict with any degree of accuracy in advance the amount of the successful claims which fall to be borne by the Exchequer in any particular year.</P>
    <P>Finally on subhead S &mdash; Appropriations-in-aid &mdash; receipts are likely to be £205,000 lower than expected.  A shortfall of £440,000 on one heading will be partially offset by £235,000 more being realised elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is expected that there will be a shortfall of £440,000 in receipts from driving test fees.  This is due to the level of applications being lower than anticipated and to the refund of fees to those applicants who were exempted from the driving test under the temporary arrangements which were introduced in October last year.</P>
    <P>A small increase of £15,000 is expected in the expenses repayable by local authorities in respect of the combined purchasing system operated by the Department.</P>
    <P>Receipts from fees for certificates of reasonable value and the new house structural guarantee scheme will increase by £65,000 and £70,000, respectively as a result of an upward revision of the level of both these fees earlier this year. Increased receipts are also expected on the miscellaneous heading.  The amount of the increase in this case is £85,000 which for the most part is attributable to the refund of salaries of officers on loan to outside bodies.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This Supplementary Estimate of £12,399,000 forms part of a package of Supplementary Estimates which have been introduced in the House and are on the agenda for introduction amounting to £463 million.  That sum of £463 million represents a supplementary budget for the year and not a Supplementary Estimate and it displays a complete lack of budgeting and planning in the Departments at the beginning of the year.  It represents make-believe budgeting.  In the Department of the Environment this type of budgeting has penetrated right down to the local authorities on the direction of the Minister.  Last year local authorities were limited in the amount of finance they could provide for their services and it was well known that the Estimates being introduced were grossly inadequate.  The Minister gave a direction that he would only allow a 10 per cent increase in finance for local authorities at a time when everybody knew that inflation was raging at about 20 per cent. The Minister can introduce Supplementary Estimates, but again, by ministerial direction the various local authorities were prevented from introducing Supplementary Estimates and the result was inevitable and obvious: services were cut down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about his future plans for roads and said that he intends to improve the roads and has said how important they are.  Is the Minister aware that as a result of Government action roads are deteriorating?  Our roads are a national and international disgrace.  The <Col N="1432" /> potholes have proliferated at an alarming rate and there are signs of the complete neglect of the road network as a result of Government action.  Not enough money was provided in 1980 to pay the road work force and the people who went to the wall were the roadworkers.  The Government could have provided adequate funds by way of Supplementary Estimates so that the men could be retained and materials and machinery purchased. That would have been a sensible thing. The Government could have let the men go from about September on in large numbers, but that would have been extremely bad politics and would have embarrassed the Government.</P>
    <P>The third choice was to put the men on short-time and the Government selected that option because it was less damaging to their ego and it would cosmetically get over the difficulties.  However, a man with three children employed by a county council for a five-day week had a take-home pay of £61 on average but that same man on a three-day week became entitled to unemployment benefit and with what he got from the county council and the Department of Social Welfare came home with £74.  I do not begrudge him that, and it would make economic sense if the employer were a private individual who, due to the recession, did not get the orders and wanted to save on the transaction and to pay the man for a three-day week with only half his wages and the Department of Social Welfare would pay the other half.  But here we have the same purse paying the three-day week wages and the three-day social welfare benefit and the net result is that for £14 more the nation gets half the work.  The Roscommon County Council pointed that out in those terms, got in touch with the Minister for Finance and suggested that the money should be transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of the Environment so that the men could be retained.  The men wanted work and not unemployment benefit.  The former Minister for Finance, who has now gone to Brussels, said that that would require legislation but even if that could be done there was more in creating jobs than <Col N="1433" /> paying wages.  What the Minister was saying was that the council had not been allowed to budget for tarmacadam, gravel or the hire of machinery and that, even if these men were retained, there would be no work for them although the potholes are still gaping and the roads deteriorating.  That is the sense of madness that has decended into the running of local authorities and the running of the Department.  This Minister is only a short time in office and I hope there will be no repetition of this.  To understand what is happening is to become convinced that the Government is being badly run and that the taxpayers are getting extremely poor value for the money being extracted from them.</P>
    <P>We are creating potholes and deteriorating roads and running up bills for next year, the year after and every other year. This is an example of lack of planning and of not running our finances properly. There is £4 million provided here for housing grants.  What would be required if loans were available to people to build houses and complete them so that they could apply for grants?  Local authorities have been starved of money for house loans.  They have reached the stage now when they are not prepared to cover any longer.  They are saying to applicants for loans &ldquo;We will pay your loan when we get an allocation of money from the Department of the Environment&rdquo;.  In the meantime, the unfortunate housebuilder is paying enormous interest on a bridging loan and the £1,000 grant is eroded by the time it is obtained.  It is extraordinary that, notwithstanding that housing grants were cut off as from January last, there still was not enough money to pay the grants which the Minister and his Department must have known were accumulating. I regret to have to say that I find it difficult to accept from the Minister that these demands for house improvement or reconstruction grants came as a surprise. The announcement was made on 21 January 1980 that all grants were stopped unless work had already commenced on that date and unless applications were in before 1 February.  No unexpected applications could have come within that category.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> The Department of the Environment housing section is in chaos and I do not blame the staff for that.  They were certainly hounded because of the decision of the Minister in charge of that Department. I get as good a service from the Department of the Environment as any other Deputy, but it is impossible to get house grants paid within a reasonable time.  Like other Deputies, I have been forced now to resort to the parliamentary question instead of the letter which adds more work on to the Department staff. Deputies are not resorting to the parliamentary question just for fun.  They are resorting to it as the only means of getting any sort of final answer from the Department about grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided further travelling expenses for the inspectorate because there has been more activity among inspectors during this year as a result of increased grants.  All I can say is that there is not half enough activity yet. The Minister should realise that the longer these grants are withheld from people &mdash; whether they are the £1,000 grant, the outstanding home improvement grant or the fuel conversion grant &mdash; the less valuable they are.  They are being eroded by inflation and by payment of interest and are less valuable to the unfortunate people who are waiting for them.</P>
    <P>What proposals has the Minister to put the local authorities in funds to pay the people who are waiting for the £12,000 loans, inadequate as they are?  It is no answer for the Minister to tell me that the loans are now higher than they were when we were in power, and he will tell me that.  When he is saying that, he should not forget that the average price of a house has jumped from £12,000 in 1976 to £28,000 in the third quarter of 1980, an increase of about two-and-a-half times.  The £1,000 grants are being withheld from people and successively eroded and wasted by inflation and by payment of interest on bridging loans.</P>
    <P>There is some provision here for certificates of reasonable value.  The Minister introduced his regulations dealing with these certificates on 24 September <Col N="1435" /> last.  He should keep a close eye on these certificates of reasonable value and the process and machinery within his Department for dealing with them.  The procedure lends itself to delay.  It is so hard to sell houses at the moment that the building contractors, those building and selling houses, are accepting suggestions from the Department, but the procedure is very cumbersome and there are more and more queries from the Department, which leads to delay.  When people have to resort to the Circuit Court by way of appeal, delays will become intolerable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up all the time available, because Deputy Willie O'Brien will have a contribution to make. I conclude by saying that the Minister's Department is in a financial shambles. The Minister's direction to local authorities has created chaos and insane economic procedures in every local authority. The procedures for housing grants must be expedited and people must get grants when they are due to them.  If the Minister were to put far more staff into the Department's housing section where the chaos built up in February and the subsequent months of this year, he would be doing a good job.  If the country, as a whole, is being run like the Department of the Environment by the Minister, and by the local authorities on the Minister's direction, then it is no wonder that we have the gloomy reports, both national and international, which we are having.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I am appalled by the spate of Supplementary Estimates which have come before this House in the last six weeks.  £463 million is an enormous amount and under normal circumstances and with a normal Government one would expect the situation to be dealt with in a different way. These things have to be provided for and <Col N="1436" /> it is simply piling up the money which will have to be added on to deficits going into 1981.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amount of money mentioned in this Vote, £12,399,000, it is only fair to say that we are not talking about additional money which will be spent now.  We are talking about money which has already been spent.  The next couple of weeks will have the tail end of it but in the main the money has already been spent.  It might be no harm if the Minister pointed this out to his back benchers, who, having seen the Vote for this sum of money, have been going around promising that this additional money was coming in the months of December and January.  They know so little about budgetary affairs that they will be spending this in the early part of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know, as I said recently, if the Minister and the other Ministers are living in a world different from the one the rest of us are living in because one gets the impression, listening to Ministers in the House, that they are living away back several years ago.  I am not blaming this Minister for what has happened here.  A game of draughts is being played by the Taoiseach who has been moving Ministers about.  Some of them felt the draught the first time the move was made.  The draughts are moving along and there is no point in moving a Minister or the draughts into an impossible position where they will be taken straight off the board.  A few of the Ministers found themselves in that position. Unfortunately, the Minister who is in charge of the Department of the Environment knows now, but he will not get an opportunity of knowing it next year, that what he has been given is a position as Minister for the Environment where, because of a weak predecessor who was not able to fight his corner in the Cabinet, the Department of the Environment got less money than they needed to carry on their normal work.  They proceeded to tell the local authorities that they must tighten their belts.  While they had to tighten their belts and operate under the 10 per cent limit by which they were allowed to increase the rates, they were <Col N="1437" /> not told that towards the end of the year there would be a big shortfall because the farmers would not be asked to pay their rates this year.  How does the Minister propose to deal with that?</P>
    <P>The Department felt it right that they should be allowed to increase their Estimate by £463 million while they did not allow local authorities to make any movement to try to cover their losses.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that most local authorities are up to their ears in debt to contractors of various kinds. Even though they entered into agreements to purchase land for road widening and building houses, they had to cancel essential contracts because they did not have the money.  The Minister has said what his precedessor also handed out to me, that there has been an increase in the amount given this year compared to that given a few years ago.  He must know, after listening to the outgoing Minister for Finance yesterday, what the value of money is now as compared with about four years ago.  The Government should realise that they are no longer talking to people who do not understand.  The people understand that they have been codded up to the eyes and they will not take it any longer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is quite right when he says an effort was made to go back to the old Hugo Flynn days, a three-day week.  There was no social welfare at the time but this time the money is made available from social welfare to pay the people on a three-day week.  As a result, people are getting more money than they would get if they were working.  I am not objecting to that but I am objecting, as a representative of the working class for over 30 years, to the suggestion that has been made generally that most of those who are unemployed would rather be unemployed than working.  That is untrue, whether they are getting more or less when they are unemployed.  Those people would prefer to continue working but they were not allowed to do this.  The Minister for the Environment should have been able to make a case to have some money transferred to his Department to keep those people in employment <Col N="1438" /> and leave them with their self-respect. They get very little else from the Government.  I am glad Deputy Lemass is present because before the last election I listened to her on television.  She was very impressive and was very eloquent about the insult to the people in the country who were not allowed to work.  She told them: &ldquo;You are entitled to work. They are making little of you by leaving you idle&rdquo;.  We know what the score is now.  I am sure she is as annoyed about it now as she was when she spoke on television before the last general election.</P>
    <P>Many of the Minister's backbenchers are very perturbed about the situation which has arisen.  Local authorities have been left as the poor relations of the Government.  The members of local authorities are the salt of the earth but they are not being treated as such by the Department.  I know they got a little extra in their travelling expenses but they are not getting enough to cover their losses. This is something the rich people can take up but the workers cannot because if they do lose a day's wages they cannot make it up.  That is not the type of money which should be given.  Adequate money should have been given to local authorities to allow them to carry on their normal work, but this was not given.</P>
    <P>We bragged in County Meath that we had better roads than anywhere else in Ireland.  Perhaps County Kildare and portion of County Dublin compared with us.  The roads of County Meath were really first class.  They are now appalling. It would be laughable if it were not so tragic to listen to the Minister talking about the road plan for 1981.  Does he not realise that even the engineers who are employees of local authorities said earlier this year that if there was not a very big imput of money &mdash; they mentioned £20 million &mdash; spent immediately it would take £20 billion in a few years time to rebuild the existing roads, those which are being destroyed, and to maintain them.  This is the situation throughout the country.  We hear complaints from the AA and various motoring bodies who have at last come to realise what the situation is and are saying what they <Col N="1439" /> should have said months ago, something must be done quickly.  The roads surfaces are so bad that at the moment the main difficulty on a narrow road is to watch out because almost certainly when one comes to a corner, if there is a vehicle coming against one, it is in the middle of the road.  The person cannot drive on the edge of the road even going around a corner because the sides of the roads seem to be rapidly deteriorating.  The whole structure of the roads has been destroyed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley spoke some time ago about giving grants for bog roads which have not been used for some time.  They are much better than some of our country and main roads.  There is no point in a Minister talking about having a plan for new roads in 1981 if we cannot do something to maintain our existing ones.  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about people being laid off in Roscommon.  Cavan County Council had to lay off staff because they did not have sufficient money.  If county councils keep on a full staff they do not have enough money to buy materials and if they buy materials they cannot have a full staff.</P>

He is an able young man and if he was there when the budget was drawn up he would not have allowed his pound of flesh to have been swiped away and be satisfied with a quarter pound which his predecessor got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to malicious injury claims does the Minister know that if such a claim is taken to court it takes two years before payment is made?  A friend of mine had his car smashed in the town of Drogheda at midnight on New Year's Eve.  Two years ago the case went to court and a decree was given for malicious injury payment.  That person has <Col N="1440" /> not yet been paid.  I asked the county council when the person would be paid and they said they usually pay out by the end of the year.  I asked which year and they said the second year when it has been provided for.  This is the end of the year and it has not been paid and I do not think it will be paid because the money is not there.  It is absolutly ludicrous to have a person at the loss of several hundred pounds when his claim has been proven simply because there is no money to pay him.  Something must be done about this whole system.  The law says that that is the way it is done but it should not go into the third year before a relatively small sum of £260 is paid out by the local authority.</P>
    <P>We seem to be rearing a nation of young vandals.  We have reached the stage where decent young people will have to help the authorities to ensure that the odd brat &mdash; there is one in every town and village &mdash; is stopped from carrying out the mindless vandalism which they do carry out.  They do not give a damn about anyone.  Some 98 per cent of young people are decent but the 2 per cent can do a lot of damage.  People laugh and say the State will have to pay and the county councils will have to pay but it is the people who are paying for their so-called enjoyment.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I made a song and dance in the House when Deputy Boland was Minister about the question of reflective marking of vehicles.  Eventually it was agreed that vehicles would be so marked.  However, that seems to have died off now.  Foreign vehicles do not have to be marked and Irish vehicles do not bother in many cases.  Anyone driving along a country road at night who meets a car with a green or black lorry on his side of the road will find it extremely difficult to pass without getting into trouble. Many accidents have occurred and people have been killed because of this.</P>
    <P>The arrangement where a red triangle was put behind a broken down vehicle seems to be forgotten.  Buses are the only vehicles that do this or put out seats behind the bus to indicate it has broken down.  Cars are often parked on the side of the road with no lights and with no <Col N="1441" /> marking.  These things, as well as drunken driving, cause accidents.  Repairs to vehicles are very expensive and people do not bother having them carried out.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled about the additional interest which building societies charge. While officially they have a rate comparable to the banks the rate they charge is 1.1 per cent higher than that because of the system they operate.  I do not know if the ratio is what it is supposed to be.  I do not know if it was carried on in my time but it is something that must be looked at closely.  Interest rates are high enough without people having to pay more.  I give fair warning to the Minister that if we take part in Government we will re-introduce home improvement grants.  Building houses is one way of building up a stock but if we do not do something to ensure that existing houses are kept in good repair and are habitable we are allowing the stock to run down.  It is the same as spilling water into a barrel that has a hole in it.  This would relieve considerably the demand for home loans which is very high.  People want money to build houses and they cannot get it. Deputy Fitzpatrick is correct.  Where I live there are 20 houses within a mile radius which have been for sale for a long time and nobody wants to know.</P>
    <P>The list of applications for planning permission is smaller than it used to be. People are not able to afford to build houses and this is a serious matter.  The people waiting for home improvement and heating grants are dissatisfied.  The Minister cannot do much about it because the money is not there.  That is unfortunate for him and for his officials who have to deal with correspondence from public representatives and applicants.  Something must be done about this.  So many people applied in the last few weeks before the axe came down that there are three times the normal number of payments required and the money is not there to pay the normal number of applicants. The Minister says he has been given an additional £4 million for the purpose of paying the £1,000 grant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of a house, what is the value of this £1,000 grant?  When the old grant was done away with its value <Col N="1442" /> at the maximum was £900, not £645 as some people think.  therefore, the difference is only £100.  Many people were promised this grant but they are not getting it.  When I did away with the payment of supplementary grants to relatively wealthy people Fianna Fáil, on this side, created a song and dance &mdash; boy, what a noise.  Good luck to them, they had the neck afterwards to come along and do away with the supplementary grant.</P>
    <P>There are two most important aspects in all this.  People who looked for the grant, with the supplementary grant from local authorities, are being told by the local authorities that they are precluded from the supplementary grants, and it is the poorest of the poor who are being affected.  Having committed themselves to work which would qualify them for the first part of the grant they are being told that they cannot get it at all.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the insulation grant, but people are getting letters from the Department saying they are not finishing the job and that if they had not finished the job before 20 October they are not entitled to the grant. Either the grant is there or it is not, and there should not be this fiddling about with it.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the heating grant is the same.  It has been most difficult to get payments.  Financial provision should have been made for it.  The latest date for receipt of applications was 31 January last.  Many people in Dublin handed in their applications on that day at O'Connell Bridge House but they were ruled out as being ineligible because the applications were not on the desk before 1 February.  The Minister cannot do this to ordinary people throughout the country. They have done the work, either through borrowing or on trust by small contractors.  This is not the sort of thing Departments are for.  The Minister's predecessor told us that he would reconsider the cases of people who sent in late applications, but so far we have not had a comment from him or from the present Minister.</P>
    <P>Generally in this debate what we are talking about is academic because the <Col N="1443" /> money has been spent.  The Minister is about to prepare the Estimate for 1981 &mdash; he will not be there for the spending of it &mdash; but will he see to it that his Department will get a fair share of the funds and not be letting his stronger colleagues run away with the lot?</P>

      <P>The success or failure of a Department's plans depends on financing, and we all agree that the Department of the Environment have been starved from the point of view of funds.  The two previous speakers referred to roads and housing.  I have only five minutes and I intend to use most of it to deal with these two subjects.  First of all, I will refer to reconstruction grants. I have here a Departmental circular, dated 26 November 1979, referring to supplementary grants.  It states:</P>
      <P>As regards supplementary grants, the attention of local authorities is directed to paragraph 21 of Circular B.C. 8/79 of 22nd August, 1979.  Local Authorities should note that the payment of supplementary grants after 31st January, 1980, will be invalid unless application for the grant was received by the local authority on or before 31st December, 1979, and application for payment of the grant was received by the authority on or before 31st January, 1980. </P>
      <P>Any enquiries in regard to this circular may be made to Housing Grants Section, Floor 5, O'Connell Bridge House, Dublin 2. (Phone 713377).</P>
      <P>My local authority in County Limerick have had this system in operation for some years.  I do not blame the local authority, but they have been sending out supplementary grant forms to applicants and if the Department do not notify payments the local authority cannot know whether the applications were in order. In this way hundreds of people have been deprived of this grant.  Many of them who had spent money were hoping to get payment by Christmas but they have been told by the local authorities they will not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roads are a terrible problem.  A lot of <Col N="1444" /> money has been spent in operating the breathalyser system, but to my mind the Department, and I include the Minister, are as dangerous to the public as any man with drink in him behind the wheel of a car.  The condition of our roads is so dangerous that people's lives are at stake. Recently in my constituency a man was knocked from his motorcycle near Rathkeale because of a deep pothole.  He took the case to the District Court and justly was awarded damages.</P>
    <P>This sort of thing will continue unless our roads are rendered safe.  I have discussed this with car drivers and I have advised them to take their problem to their solicitors.  This is totally justified because people have been paying rates for a long time and they have not got roads on which they can travel safely.</P>
    <P>I will go back to grants.  I was in O'Connell Bridge House recently about a specific case and a courteous lady came to me and told me the file had been handed to an inspector last May.  What has the inspector been doing with that file since last May?  That is only one of nearly 200 cases I have had to inquire about in the last 12 months.  It is rough justice to the people concerned to be told: &ldquo;We have not got the staff&rdquo;.  Why have they not got the staff when there are 130,000 people unemployed?  Why do we bother to talk about unemployment when we hear that one of the most important Departments have not got the staff to deal with even the most urgent hardship cases?  What is the purpose of the Minister handing us this script today talking about 1981 when the position in 1980 is something none of us wants to hear about again?  This Government are literally bankrupt.  Whether we like it or not, it must be known to the people.  As a public representative in rural Ireland it is embarrassing being approached by people talking about their roads and about bad bends.</P>

      <P>I would just like to tell Deputy Tully a little story.  He mentioned that I was very concerned about employment and spoke on it at length.  I am still very concerned about it and always will be and I still think that every citizen who needs employment and wants work has the right to get it.  But there is a factory in the Dublin area which recently sent out 5,000 leaflets to 5,000 homes stating that there were 5,000 potential jobs in their factory if they got the workers.  They got 12 replies.  That probably means that the type of job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That probably means that the type of jobs available are not wanted by young people.  They want white-collar jobs and are not prepared to go into industry.  Maybe it is our fault. We should train them more and try to convince them that it is honourable to work in industry and in a factory.  Until we can get this across to the young people those jobs will still be there with nobody to go in and do them.  The factory I am talking about could double its production if it got the workers.</P>

      <P>I am just going to say a few words about the housing situation in Dublin.  A lot has been said recently about the housing crisis in the city.  I have been in many cities in Europe and nowhere in the whole of Europe is there better local authority housing than here. <Col N="1446" /> Has anybody been to Hamburg or Berlin? Nobody there has a three-bedroomed house with a garden at front and back.  Here we have three new cities being built up around Dublin at the moment &mdash; Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.  We are now in a position where families of three are on a housing list, are eligible to get and are getting a three-bedroomed house from the local authority.  This house is probably costing about £20,000 to £22,000, and in a short time that family are in a position to purchase that house at a subsidised amount of money.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have built more local authority houses than any other country in the same circumstances.  I am proud of what Fianna Fáil have done.  Seventy per cent of those on the housing list at the moment are families of three.  That is because there are so many more young people in the country, so many more people getting married at a very young age.  This is why our housing list is so long.  There are very few families on that housing list with four or more children and a lot of them would already be housed if they were not waiting to be housed in a particular area in the city.  There will always be a housing list.  No Government can ever eliminate it totally, because there are always young people coming up.  Our population is increasing very rapidly at the moment and we will always have people looking for houses from the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for allowing me the few minutes to say these few words.  I hope he will be particularly sympathetic to Dublin Corporation in the coming year with the allocation for housing because, as he and everybody else knows, one-third of the population is now living in Dublin.  We have a very young population, it is increasing and we need more houses.  I know the Minister is doing great work.  In the fifties the Coalition, in two terms of office built no houses because nobody was looking for houses &mdash; they had all emigrated.  Every road in local authority areas had vacant houses which were boarded up.  It is only when we are doing well that we have a housing <Col N="1447" /> problem and that is what is happening now.</P>

Much more has to be done.  I met a deputation from the housing committee of the corporation last evening and we discussed the matter.  They made some very important points which I will be taking into account in deciding on the allocations for the various authorities in 1981.

      <P>Bad as they are, they are not as bad as what happened earlier on.  Deputy Fitzpatrick attacked the whole principle of the Supplementary Estimates for various services being processed through the Dáil at this time and ignored the fact that the Supplementary Estimates were a regular feature of the administration which he served in from 1973 to 1977.  He went on to attack the limit of 10 per cent in rate increases applied this year as being in some way related to the Supplementary Estimate although there is no provision in the Supplementary Estimate for rates relief grant.  He also ignored the fact that the 10 per cent rate increase meant in effect that an average of 13 per cent extra funding was available in income from rates and that there has been a very substantial <Col N="1448" /> increase in the State subvention and capital allocation for the various services &mdash; all building up to an unprecedented flow of State funds to the local authorities.  He also criticised the provisions being made for roads and employment.  He appears to forget how little his own administration spent on the roads and the low level of employment afforded on that service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully covered many of the same points and I would like to give them the facts.  Are the local authorities being left short of money?  They have £750 million to spend between current and capital moneys this year.  That is an increase of £117 million on 1979.  An estimated £106.565 million will be paid to the local authorities in 1980 in respect of the abolition of rates on domestic and other dwellings.  The approximate cost to the Exchequer of the agricultural grant in the current year will be £43 million.  A total of just over £150 million will thus be paid to local authorities directly for the relief of rates this year and the total current expenditure of local authorities this year will be close to £520 million.  About £307 million or almost 60 per cent of this will come from State grants including the £150 million which goes in direct relief of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech road grants totalling over £58 million have been allocated to local authorities this year.  That is more than double the amount allocated by the Coalition in 1977.  By way of further comparison this Government, since taking office less than three years ago, have allocated road grants totalling £149 million, whereas the Government in which the two Members opposite served made available grants totalling £68 million in the three years 1975-77.  Even when account is taken of inflation, it must be recognised that the Government's performance leaves no room for criticism by the Opposition, especially by two members of the former Cabinet.  One direct result of the increased investment in road works has been an upsurge in employment by the road authorities.  In 1976 the average monthly employment of road workers was 9.540 and since 1977 this figure has increased substantially.  Despite this <Col N="1449" /> year's financial constraints I anticipate that the road works programme for the year will absorb up to 11,000 workers compared to the 9,500 employed during the last year of the Coalition.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the present standard of the roads and the Government's commitment to the proper maintenance and improvement of the roads can best be gauged by the level of funds made available to the road authorities since they took office.  Legal responsibility for public roads is vested in the roads authorities and it is their statutory duty to maintain and improve the roads for which they are responsible so as to keep them fit for the traffic which uses them.  While my Department reimburse a large proportion of the expenditure incurred on road works by way of annual road grants, nevertheless it is the road authorities who decide the extent of overall investment in the annual roads works programme.  It is estimated that the total expenditure on road works in 1979 amounted to £96.29 million, of which the local authorities expended more than 50 per cent from their own resources.  Since the vast bulk of their investment is in maintenance work, the condition of public roads outside the national road network &mdash; for which I make available full cost maintenance grants &mdash; is dependent largely on the level of their funds, including the amount of their own resources which they apportion to road works.  In the case of the maintenance of national roads I have allocated grants totalling £11.451 million for work this year which represents a generous contribution.  In 1977 the corresponding grants amounted to £5.266 million.  As regards other roads, the funds available this year to local authorities should enable them to carry out a satisfactory programme of road upkeep.</P>
    <P>Regarding housing grants, last January, when the termination of the house improvement grant scheme was announced, the Department received the equivalent of a full year's applications in ten days and this severely disrupted normal procedures and it was not realistic to expect that all those grants could be paid <Col N="1450" /> at once.  Every possible step was taken to streamline procedures and expedite inspection.  On 14 August it was announced that we were dispensing with first inspections of improvement works and that the last date for completion of the works had been extended to 31 March 1981, provided that a binding commitment had been made before 21 January 1980.  A considerable amount of overtime has been worked by staff and all this means that the total number of grants paid this year will exceed 50,000, the highest number ever by a long way.  The figure of 50,000 grant payments also refutes absolutely the frequent allegations by Deputies opposite who like to give the impression that grants are not being paid.  The additional £4 million provided by the Government last September for these grants brings total expenditure to £27 million.  By comparison, in their 1977 Budget the Coalition Government provided only £4.95 million.  I want to give an assurance that every effort will continue to be made into next year to see that all outstanding grants are paid as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien referred to the provision under which supplementary grants could not be paid by local authorities unless work had been completed before 31 December 1978 and the grant applied for before 31 December 1979.  This provision was not imposed by departmental circular but was made by the Housing Act of 1979, which was fully discussed in the Dáil and Seanad.  It would not be open to me or my Department to change the law on the subject without further legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Regarding house purchase loans, Deputy Fitzpatrick alleged that there is a scarcity of such finance.  This is not in accord with the facts and there is more money available for mortgages than at any stage in our history.  During the quarter ended 30 September 1980 all lending agencies &mdash; building societies, local authorities, banks and <Col N="1451" /> assurance companies &mdash; paid out £104.4 million for the purchase of 7.382 houses. This compares with £81 million for 6,591 houses in the corresponding period in 1979.  The results of the availability of this money will be seen when the total number of houses completed this year is ascertained. It will be an all-time record.  In the first eleven months of 1980 a total of 26,468 new houses were completed and I am satisfied that the number for the full year will lie between 27,000 and 28,000</P>
      <P>The Deputy was critical of the provision made for SDA loans.  For the record, the original provision in the Public Capital Programme for house purchase loans was £64.5 million and a further £7 million was provided last September, bringing the total for 1980 to £71.5 million.  This compares with expenditure last year of £52 million.  In 1978 it was £33 million and only £19.5 million in 1977 in the last Coalition budget.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully spoke about the legal requirement of the marking of heavy vehicles.  The enforcement of the law is a matter for the Garda Síochána and I will draw their attention to the Deputy's observations, particularly regarding the use of triangles in the case of breakdown of heavy vehicles.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully also mentioned delay in the payment of malicious injury claims. I appreciate that there are delays and in many cases very lengthy delays in court proceedings.  Once a decree has been given, present law, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, requires a local authority to make a provision in the Estimate for the following year to meet that decree.  Of necessity this involves further delay.  However, Deputy Tully will realise that the Minister for Justice has at present a Bill before the House to reform the law on malicious injuries.  I understand that this Bill has a number of provisions which could speed up the payment of awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the 10 per cent limit and the criticism by Deputy Fitzpatrick, he appears to want it both ways.  He claims to be put out by rate limits which he sees as a threat to the freedom of action of local authorities and on the other hand <Col N="1452" /> he seeks to lay the blame elsewhere for the consequences of unpopular local decisions.  He does this by using the excuse that local authorities have decisions forced on them by a shortage of money and the facts speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>The local authorities taken together were better off financially at the start of 1980 than at the end of 1977.  There is no reason why all local authorities could not be in the same position.  There are, as there always have been, differences between local authorities; but if there is a small number of cases where individual local authorities believe that they are being forced to take unpopular decisions by shortage of money, they would be well advised to look closely at their finances and priorities. The present financial position of each local authority is in some measure the result of their own decisions freely taken in the years to the end of 1977 and equally freely taken since the derating of domestic and other property.</P>

    <P>Is é an t-iomlán atá á iarraidh anois ná £33,036,000.  Agus leis an máid bhreise seo, chomh maith leis an £4,244,000 a cuireadh leis an Vóta Árdoideachais cheana, tagann an mór-iomlán glan atá á sholáthar do na Vótaí Oideachais imbliana go dtí £536,318,000.  Seo é an méid is mó airgid a cuireadh ar fáil do na seirbhísí oideachais ariamh; is ionann é agus méadú de 21.3 faoin gcéad ar an soláthar a deineadh anuraidh.  Ní beag mar éacht é sin, agus léiríonn sé go bhfuil sé ina rún daingean ag an Rialtas an toideachas is fearr is féidir, i gcomhriar lenár n-acmhainní, a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Seo iad na rudaí is mó is cúis leis an éileamh iomlán de £33,036,000 atá á dhéanamh sna meastacháin fhorlíontacha seo:</P>
    <P>Baineann £9,847,600 le costais bhreise tuarastail agus pá a éiríonn as feidhmiú an chéad chuid den Dara Chomhthuiscint Náisiúnta i leith Forbairt Eacnamaíochta agus Shóisialta agus as socruithe eile ar glacadh leo de bharr idir-réitigh is eadrána, agus fós le méaduithe sna cioníocaíochta leasa shóisialaigh a thuiteann ar an bhfostuitheoir faoín scéim síntiús de réir pá.  Baineann £9,351,000 leis an dámhachtain pá a fuair na múinteoirí le deireannas.</P>
    <P>Tá £9,250,000 ann i leith cuspóirí chaipitil.  Chomh maith leis an méid sin, tá £2,435,000 breise á chur ar fáil do <Col N="1455" /> Chiste na nIasacht Áitiúil chun cur ar chumas coistí gairmoideachais dul ar aghaidh le beartais bhreise chaipitil.  Mar sin tá iomlán breise caipitil de £11,685,000 á chur ar fáil: ina choinne sin meastar go mbeidh sábháltais chaipitil de £185,000 ar an Vóta i leith ionaid chónaithe agus scoileanna speisialta.  Ba mhaith liom focal nó dhó eile a rá faoin soláthar chaipitil seo.  Ach an bhreis atá á iarraidh anois a chur leis an £48 milliúin a soláthraíodh cheana, tá iomlán de £59,500,000 airgid chaipitil á chur ar fáil imbliana, méadú 16.6 faoin gcéad ar sholáthar na bliana 1979.  Tá freagra annsin ar na daoine a bhí ag maíomh go raibh tógáil scoileanna beagnach ina stad. Imbliana, deineadh conarthaí i leith 70 scol, idir bunscoileanna agus meánscoileanna, agus h-iarradh tairiscintí i leith 106 beartas eile tógála.  Is teist é sin ar an saothar atá curtha i gcrích againn imbliana.  Tá £4,420,100 breise ag teastáil do na seirbhísí taistil: baineann an fuíollach de £438,300 le cuspóirí ilghnéitheacha.</P>
    <P>Seo iad na mionsonraí:</P>
    <P>Vóta 29: Oifig an Aire Oideachais</P>
    <P>Tá suim bhreise de £96,000 ag teastáil faoí fho-mhírcheann A.1 in aghaidh costas na bliana seo den chomhthuiscint náisiúnta.  Iarrtar £138,000 breise faoí fho-mhírcheann D.8, don chuspóir chéanna, i leith cúntóirí chléireachais sna scoileanna náisiúnta agus na meánscoileanna.

Iarrtar suim bhreise de £6,200 d'Acadamh Ríoga Ceoil na hÉireann freisin, faoí fho-mhírcheann G.2, chomh maith le £12,000 faoí G.4 d'Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann.  Cuimsíonn an £12,000 seo dhá rud &mdash; £4,000 don Chomhthuiscint Náisiúnta agus £8,000 chun siollabais nua i dteangacha Eorpacha a thabhairt isteach sna scoileanna iarbhunoideachais ar bhonn trialach.</P>
    <P>Tá suim bhreise de £4,240,100 á lorg i leith costais reatha na seirbhísí iompair scoile (fo-mhírcheann D.3).  Tá an méid <Col N="1456" /> breise seo ag teastáil chun arduithe i gcostais na seirbhísí iompair a ghlanadh, agus chun a chinntiú nach mbeidh aon isliú ar leibhéal na seirbhísí seo imbliana.</P>
    <P>Éiríonn na costais bhreise seo as méaduithe móra, thar mar bhí coinne leo, i gcostais iompair i gcoitinne ar a n-áirítear praghasanna peitril, ola diesel, boinn, agus páirteanna eile cárrannaí, luach saothair agus an iliomad rudaí eile atá san áireamh i gcostas na séirbhísí iompair scoile.  Deineadh méadú de 19.5 faoin gcéad, chomh maith, ar an ráta a íoctar le conraitheoirí príobháideacha iompair as seirbhísí scoile a chur ar fáil le h-éifeacht ó 1 Lúnasa 1980.</P>

Bunaíodh an scéim seo i bhfeidhmiú na geallúna a thug an tAire Airgeadais, ina óráid ar an gcáinfhaisnéis, go gcuirfí £100,000 ar fáil i leith ceannach camán do dhaoine óga.  Bhí mo Roinn i gcomhairle le Cumann Luthchleas Gael i ndréachtadh na scéime: bainfidh sí freisin le Cumann Camógaíocht na nGael.  Is é is cuspóir don scéim seo, camáin a chur ar fáil do dhaoine óga ar bheag-chostas, chun nach gcuirfí ó chleachtadh agus ó imirt iomanaíochta agus chamógaíochta iad, ó chluichí oirdhirce náisiúnta na hÉireann, toisc a mhinice is a bhriseann camáin agus a dhaoire is tá siad ag éirí.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This may or may not be the last occasion on which we will be able to discuss the Education Estimate in this House under this Government.  Even so we are restricted in what we can say. Therefore, in the time allotted to me I intend to take three or four items and discuss them in depth rather than range over the totality of the Department's activities, or inactivity.  The first item I should like to discuss is the school transport service.  The original sum provided was £16 million and that represented a reduction of £500,000 on the 1975 estimate. That is a clear indication that the Minister and the Government were thinking seriously of drastically reducing the service or instituting a charge for that service.  In the course of the year my fears in relation to the school bus service were realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12 May 1980 a statement was issued on behalf of the Minister indicating major changes in the regulations governing the provision of school transport.  Very briefly I will go through the changes which then were indicated positively.  In relation to the primary school sector, the number of eligible children necessary for the establishment of a school transport service was increased from ten to 12. Children over nine years of age must have at least three miles, whereas the age limit had been ten before that.  Children between four and five years may not be <Col N="1460" /> taken into account for the purpose of establishing a service.  In relation to post-primary children, the number of eligible children required for the establishment of a school transport service was increased to 15 and the eligibility for free transport was four miles as opposed to the three then ruling.  The fares for fare-paying passengers were increased by £1.50 per car.  That was, and I suggest is, an indication of the Minister's attitude towards the school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>That statement caused a tremendous furore and many protests, both in this House and by way of public statements by the Fine Gael Party.  Subsequently, because of the public pressure which was put on the Minister, that statement was pigeonholed, withdrawn, forgotten, whatever word you like to use.  There have been suggestions that a petition was brought up among the back-benchers in the Fianna Fáil Party and that the present Minister damn well nearly lost his office because of the moves he had made.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is anything in the Estimates about mythology, but what harm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should address that remark to the Minister.  However, the changes were, I can only say, suspended.  I do not think that they were withdrawn.  Current rumours are that it is intended to introduce an across-the-board charge for the school bus scheme.  The Fine Gael Party will resist any introduction of charges for the use of the school bus scheme for students who have enjoyed the free scheme up to now.  The last Coalition Government sought a report from consultants and that report became available towards the end of 1973 and became known as the Hyland Report.  On a number of occasions spokesmen for the Fianna Fáil Party have taunted the Fine Gael Party, and I suppose the Labour Party as well, for seeking a report on <Col N="1461" /> school transport services.  It is the duty of any Minister to ensure that the services he provides are efficient and run properly. Therefore, a consultants' report was a necessary examination of a scheme in the Department.  Any suggestions to the contrary are ill-founded.</P>
      <P>The suggestions in the report are a different matter and they would await a political decision.  In 1976, 154,500 pupils availed of the service at a cost of over £9 million.  In 1980 I am sure the numbers have increased but the cost has more than doubled and it is now £20,420,100, and Hyland suggested that by 1986 the cost of running the school bus scheme would be nearly £30 million.  That may have been at 1976 costs.  Therefore, there is no doubt that the school bus scheme has been expensive to operate.</P>
      <P>However, it is and must be seen as a great social agent in the education process. Many children living in isolated areas in rural Ireland and perhaps in many towns and villages throughout the country would not be able to avail of an education at primary or post-primary level were it not for that school bus service. The changes proposed by the Minister last May struck at the very root of people who are deserving of the free bus scheme, that is those people who live in isolated areas.  It is at those people that the Minister's proposed changes were directed.  That, to my mind, is an extremely anti-social method of tackling any reform in the school bus scheme.  The scheme also is a necessary adjunct to compulsory schooling for people living in isolated areas, yet it was and may again be the intention to strike at these people by making it extremely difficult for them to attend and avail of the school bus service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Minister on sound educational grounds and on grounds of social equality to ensure that the school bus service is not reduced in quality and that people living in isolated areas, especially people living furthest from schools, are not affected adversely by any changes proposed in the school transport scheme.  If the Minister is going to introduce a fare-paying system it is going to be extremely expensive to <Col N="1462" /> administer it.  I ask him not to change the school bus service as it operates at present and to ensure that those living in isolated rural areas are allowed to avail of the service free of charge.</P>
    <P>This year many representations have been made to me about children living in what are known as the boundary catchment areas who have been attending a school in one centre and who all of a sudden, because of a very strict interpretation of regulations &mdash; and the Minister assured me in this House that no direction had gone out from his Department and that no changes had been made in the administration of the system &mdash; were whipped off the school bus service to that school and made go to a new school simply because they were on the boundary of a catchment area.  I contend that children who are attending school in one centre, irrespective of what interpretation is put on the catchment boundary area, should not be forced to leave a school they have attended for a number of years.  If there is to be a strict interpretation let it apply to children who are only beginning to go to primary school or beginning secondary school, and if there is a continuation from the primary to the secondary cycle in the same school the children there should not be changed. This year quite a number of children throughout the country were forced to change schools.  On an educational basis that is very bad and I am sure the Minister does not agree with it.  I appeal to him in relation to the boundary catchment areas not to interfere with children going to a school for a number of years but to leave them to continue attending that school so as not to affect their education, otherwise I contend that he would be making a bad decision educationally.</P>
    <P>A second matter which I would like to discuss relates to the salaries of the teachers and I want to refer in a reasonable way to the recent recommendations of the review body in this area.  I believe that up to now the teachers in our schools have been badly paid <i>vis-à-vis</i> their professional status and the responsibility they have.  The time scale referred to in paragraph 2.8 of the <i>Review Body on Teachers' Pay Interim Report</i> was too <Col N="1463" /> long and it would take up to 36 years' service in a school before a teacher would reach the maximum of his scale.</P>
    <P>That seems extremely unfair and I am glad the Minister treated this problem rather favourably.  There is an aspect of the matter to which I would like to refer and it is in paragraph 2.6 of the report.  It is an interim report and can be changed at the final stages.  I am quoting from that interim report which says:</P>
    <P>The salary we recommend will, we believe, correct those inadequacies but we would emphasise that the salary so recommended is justifiable only if it is overtly recognised that supervision, substitution, parent contact and pastoral care are integral parts of the teaching function and essential to the proper running of a school. </P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesman on education I agree with that attitude and agree with the approach adopted in the interim report.  When the final report comes to hand I would hope the Minister would be able to treat this problem, which he ignored when he finally dealt with the interim pay proposals.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disturbed to note in the same paragraph:</P>
    <P>From the evidence presented to us we are concerned that the quality of school service is not being fully maintained at present. </P>
    <P>This can only be seen I think as an indictment of the Minister, perhaps of his Department and perhaps of the managerial bodies involved in running schools and perhaps even an indictment of the teachers themselves.  That statement in the report is a serious statement.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too much on this aspect now because I accept to an extent that the matter is <i>sub judice</i> in that we are awaiting a final report of the review body but let it be understood clearly that the Fine Gael Party support the approach taken by the review body in relation to the involvement of teachers in the running, in the pastoral care concept and in the management of schools as well as in <Col N="1464" /> matters of substitution, parent contact and supervision.  I hope that when the final report is published these matters will be tackled by all parties involved in this very important and complex area.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the question of qualification allowances and other allowances and the A and B posts of responsibility nor do I want to deal with payment in respect of examinations because these are matters of current negotiation and also await recommendations in the final report.  I am merely setting a tone as far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned and I hope the Minister will be responsible enough in tackling the question of teachers' pay, conditions of work, responsibilities at work in a positive and open manner and that he will take this opportunity to resolve the question of the professional status of teachers at this time.  It needs to be tackled and if that is done now we could, perhaps, look forward to a considerable period of progress and perhaps enlightened progress in the development of education services.  Part of that would also be the establishment of An Comhairle Mhúinteoireachta. Again I ask the Minister to examine this possibility at a very early date.</P>
    <P>There is the question of in-service training of teachers and granting of leave of absence for that purpose.  I firmly believe there is need for greater emphasis on in-service training and I ask the Minister to examine the matter in the course of the next year.  In a policy on education which I had the pleasure of publishing on behalf of Fine Gael the problem of teacher assessment procedures was tackled in a very positive way.  Again this has not been tackled by the present Minister to any great extent to my knowledge. There is an undeniable need to introduce a system of continuous assessment, certainly in the primary sector where there is need, not for re-introduction of an examination at the end of primary school but need to introduce an assessment procedure which would allow a child to be assessed in say the fourth or fifth year of the primary cycle to ensure that the pupil is getting the benefit of the education services provided.  That is important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> At second level, certainly in the junior cycle, the question of assessment procedure should also be an important element in the education scheme.  In the senior cycle there is room for the establishment of such a procedure.  Also, there is need for a radical re-assessment of our school curricula.  The new curriculum in our primary schools for the past ten years needs to be re-assessed and perhaps updated. We certainly failed in not giving sufficient teachers' aids to ensure full implementation of that curriculum as originally envisaged.  There is now need to look at that system to see how effective it has been.</P>
    <P>There is also a radical need to re-assess the curricula in post-primary schools to ensure that they are relevant as regards subject content and subject availability. Great stress has been laid recently on the need for practical type subjects to be made available so that children can have available subjects with a direct relation to the working place.  In many schools, perhaps especially in girls' schools, the curricula available are not relevant to the employment potential of girls.  Many scientific subjects and technical subjects are not available in girls' schools and because of that they are subsequently limited in their career opportunities.  That is unfortunate. Therefore, I ask for the establishment of an independent curriculum and examination code which would involve experts in education and educationalists and give them an important say in the structure of curricula, subject content, subject availability, and in the question of equality of access to various careers, and which would also tackle this awful question of the points system at leaving certificate stage.  There is a very good case to be made for having an examination after the leaving certificate.  If that were done the leaving certificate could be a proper examination to test the general aptitude and abilities of a child.  The examination after the leaving certificate could be used for entry into university.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak about the regionalisation of education and devolution of the administration of education from the Department to local educational committees. There should be an attempt to <Col N="1466" /> regionalise the administration of education in order to break what has been called the monolithic grip of the Department on the system and which is detrimental to the development of a progressive educational service.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous disparity in the salaries of those who lecture in universities and in non-university sector.  This is a matter of serious concern.  Where it can be proved that the work of lecturers and heads of Departments is comparable with that carried out by their counterparts in universities, there is a responsibility on the Minister to tackle the matter before there is serious unrest in the non-university sector.</P>
    <P>I must castigate the Minister for not playing a proper role in preserving the Wood Quay site.  I realise this is not directly an educational matter but he provides the funds.  For a man so involved with American visits showing the treasures of Ireland and one who is so apparently committed to culture, it is to his discredit that he did not become more publicly involved in the preservation of the Wood Quay site.  We have lost an ideal opportunity to preserve one of the most historic sites in western Europe which could have been used also as an environmental model in the centre of Dublin.  Offices for workers in Dublin Corporation were needed but they could have been provided in an area where they would not cause serious traffic congestion. They would have had a beneficial effect from the point of view of the environment if they had been built outside the choked-up and congested centre of Dublin.  In many respects the Minister has not done badly but in relation to Wood Quay I am sorry to say he has failed.  As far as I am concerned he has failed to carry out his duties although he has professed himself to be devoted to cultural activities.</P>

      <P>I wish to state that I propose to give the last five minutes of the time allotted to me to Deputy John Ryan. I should like to issue a stern warning to the public not to be deceived by the blandishments of the Minister for Education into believing that all is well.  He has <Col N="1467" /> come to the House this afternoon with a sack of goodies over his shoulder lacking only the red cloak and the long white beard.  However, the Santa Claus image he is attempting to portray is not borne out by the facts.  When he listens, as he must, to the chorus of complaints from the schools and educational institutions, which reaches my ears and I am sure the ears of Deputy Collins, we must wonder if the sense of security which he exudes is in accordance with reality.  I would argue he is less like Santa Claus than Alice in Wonderland.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned the increase in the Estimates during the year, including the Supplementary Estimate. He stated:</P>
      <P>...brings the total net amount provided for the Education group of Votes to £536,318,000.  This is the greatest amount ever spent on the education services and represents an increase of 21.3 per cent over the amount provided in 1979.  This is no mean achievement and is an indication of the commitment of the Government to provide the best possible education commensurate with our means. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it is the greatest amount ever spent.  Heaven help us if it were not.  We have an inflation rate of between 18 per cent and 20 per cent and it is obvious even apart from inflation that there would have to be an increase in money terms.  The Minister may argue that an increase of 21.3 per cent involves an increase in real terms even allowing for inflation.  That is true but we must remember that a substantial proportion of the Vote is accounted for by teachers' salaries.  The Minister has been successful to some degree in getting extra money for teachers and I am not going to blame or criticise him when he gets extra money for teachers.  However, I will blame him and criticise him if he uses the extra money which teachers have got for themselves through their industrial bargaining and muscle to conceal the real problems that remain in many of the other subheads of the Vote which have been cut, pegged or only marginally increased.  I <Col N="1468" /> will deal with these in more detail as I deal with the Votes.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to put on the record of the House that not one red ha'penny of the £536 million has been used to produce a White Paper.  One would have hoped that a few shillings of that sum, a few hours of the Minister's time, would have been spared to give us a White Paper on education if not by the time it was originally promised &mdash; the end of last year &mdash; at least by the 17 December deadline as promised in the national understanding. The failure of the Minister and the Government to deliver the White Paper is treating the national understanding and the partners to that understanding with contempt.  We are given to understand that the White Paper will be out on Friday.  About that I say it marks nothing more than a continuation of a long and ignoble tradition practised by governments of all hues in this House that documents that are embarrassing, and which governments and Ministers wish to see buried are issued very conveniently on the eve of public holidays.</P>

      <P>The Minister may not recall that the OECD Report on Investment in Education was issued on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve, 1965. I know of other documents and reports that were issued in the last days of July. I will modify my criticism only if the Minister in his reply gives a guarantee that Government time will be given after the recess for a debate on the White Paper and its implications so that all Deputies, not least Fianna Fáil back-benchers, will have an opportunity of debating the matter here in the right fashion. It is not an exaggeration to say that the negotiators on the national understanding found it easier to extract percentage points in salary from the Ministers for Finance and for the Public Service than to extract anything from the Minister for Education, and his delay in delivering on existing promises is sad evidence of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> I understand that, in relation to the matters connected with the recent pay agreement between himself and the various managerial and teacher organisation, some difficulty arose in calculating, in a very short space of time, exactly how many teachers were on each point of the scale.  It was thought that they would be paid in January by way of arrears, rather than immediatly following the conclusion of that agreement.  I understand that several, if not all, vocational education committees who have the necessary information to pay the increases immediately are doing so and, as a result will be in overdraft by the end of the year.  I should like the Minister's assurance that any action of this kind by vocational educational committees will be underwritten by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it might not be paid until January.  In relation to the Votes, there are one or two points that I should like to draw to the attention of the House. When one has made allowances for salaries and looks at some of the increases and compares them &mdash; and this is important &mdash; with the figure for 1979, one will see that even the increases being brought forward by this Minister in some of these subheads are not sufficient to bring these subheads even up to the 1979 levels or to the 1979 levels adjusted for inflation.</P>
      <P>Take GI, for example, which is a grant-in-aid fund for cultural, scientific and educational activities.  This shows an extra sum of £11,400 which will increase the original estimate of £135,000 to £146,400.  However, last year the grant under this subhead was £147,000, so that even the Minister's largesse this year has failed to bring that subhead up to the 1979 figure.  Let us look also at subhead G3, grant-in-aid fund for youth and sports organisations.  The Minister is providing for hurleys, £100,000 to be added on to the original 1980 estimate of £1,392,000.  However the 1980 original estimate itself was £12,000 below what was provided for this area in 1979.  If one takes the original 1979 figure and indexes it for inflation, one will arrive at a figure of £1,670,000 which is the best part of £200,000 more than the Minister is giving with all the supplementary estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to primary education capital costs, one point is worth commenting on. The increase here is substantial, there is no doubt about that.  Yet, we have been told by the Minister himself and by the INTO that the number of sanctions for primary schools new buildings and extensions showed a very sharp decrease in the first nine months of 1980 over the same period of the previous year and, indeed almost any previous year in recent years. The only possible conclusion one can draw from this is that the Minister savagely cut the capital allocation for primary school building and extensions this year in order the better to be able to release a flourish of money from now <Col N="1471" /> until the general election, in the hope that the £s spilling out of his pocket will blind people to the fact that they have had nothing for months and years beforehand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly can see no other reason for that.  In relation to capital, the Minister notes that the extra provision &mdash; and he is talking not just about primary schools but about all schools &mdash; together with the £48 million already provided, gives a total capital budget of £59½ million, an increase of 16.6 per cent compared with 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the answer to those people &mdash; and I am still quoting &mdash; who have stated that the building of schools has been practically stopped.</P>
      <P>We all know that the cost of building has gone up by far more than the cost of inflation generally, because of the very large wage component in it.  That is one spy-glass for looking at the 16.6 figure. The Minister is also aware that, in its recent report the National Economic and Social Council calculated &mdash; and as far as I know the Minister did not dissent from its finding &mdash; that the cutback in the capital programme for education amounted to the best part of 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

The Government have appointed representatives to the National Economic and Social Council who are more than capable of dissenting &mdash; as, indeed, were the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; from various parts of <Col N="1472" /> that report and this is the first instance that we have heard of this figure being queried.</P>

      <P>In relation to secondary education, the main points to be noted are those which are not included there, and about which representations have been made to me and, I am sure, to the Minister concerned.  I do not think that anyone in that area would be fooled by what the Minister is providing.</P>
      <P>In relation to vocational education, is the Minister satisfied, even now, with the amount being paid, £816,000 for training of teachers and £115,000 for extensions or the £2 million-odd for the specialist training teaching colleges is still enough to meet the serious shortage of teachers of these subjects?  The Minister is well aware that, despite the extra money being put into the training of specialist teachers, they are still as scarce as gold dust around the country.  He will also be aware that the introduction of the three-year course, of which we all are in favour in this House, is leading to a situation in which, in 1982 no teacher of metalwork or woodwork will come out from a training college so that there will be an extra year's backlog added on to the situation which has schools absolutely screaming out for these teachers.  Here is an area, if anything, where we should have had even more money than we have at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> In relation to higher education, on the evidence of the Minister's own speech this is something like the third supplementary estimate for higher education which we have had this year and we have had many detailed votes for the various third-level institutions.</P>

      <P>It is not agreed that there was any breakdown in communications between the Office of Public Works and Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Office of Public Works had expected, following consultation with Dublin Corporation, that a plot of ground sought as a site extension for the new headquarters building for the Department of Defence, would be made available following acquisition of adjoining lands by compulsory purchase order. The Office of Public Works were prepared to offer some areas of State ground in the vicinity in exchange for the plot sought.  Subsequently, Dublin Corporation decided that, having regard to the acute housing shortage at the time, they could cede only a small portion of the ground in question.  This development necessitated a redesign of the scheme for which fees were properly payable.  A contributory factor was the space for road widening which was required by the corporation in connection with access to the proposed housing scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement under which public service pensions are revised on 1 July <Col N="1489" /> each year by reference to the rates of pay in force on that date has been in operation for a number of years and is considered quite generous.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that has been the position for a number of years, but will the Minister not agree that from time to time it can be very unfair to pensioners when their former colleagues get a substantial wage increase while they are subsisting on a much reduced pension because the increase does not operate for up to 11 months in some cases?  Will the Minister agree this should be looked at?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Coalition brought the date back and the intention was to bring it back gradually over a number of years so that ultimately the pensioners would get their increases at the same time as beneficiaries under the national pay agreements.

      <P>I think the Deputy is mistaken here.  This year a certain amount of money could be spent on overhauling a vessel but next year she would not need the same overhaul and less money would be required.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in reply to the Deputy's question on 24 June 1980, provision was included in the Defence Vote, 1979, for a down payment on the purchase of a twin-engined helicopter.  Tenders were invited with a view to purchase but, as it was indicated by the manufacturers of certain aircraft in which the Defence Forces were interested that these would be phased out of production and replaced with newer models over the next few years, it was decided not to proceed with purchase; it was intended instead to arrange for the lease of a twin-engined helicopter this year.  Tenders for the lease of a twin-engined helicopter were invited and, after evaluation, a contract was placed for the lease of a suitable twin-engined helicopter.  Delivery is due by the end of May 1981.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the necessity for detailed technical investigation and examination of the aircraft offered, including their suitability for the roles required of them and the change in procurement arrangements occasioned by the developments relating to the introduction of new models.  I do not consider that there was any undue delay in finalising arrangements for the acquisition of a suitable aircraft in this case.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a statement and a report to the House.  I have received a preliminary report on the incident today when the Chamber was invaded by unauthorised persons.  At approximately midday about ten young <Col N="1672" /> people climbed over the railings dividing the College of Art from the Leinster House courtyard and dashed through the hallway and up the main stairway to the Dáil Chamber.  Attempts to stop them by ushers in the hall and at the bottom and top of the stairway were unsuccessful and the intruders entered the Chamber.  Four or five of these succeeded in reaching the door of the Chamber, the rest being held successfully by the Captain of the Guard and the ushers.  It took about three minutes before the Chamber was cleared. Two of the intruders were taken into custody by the Garda and the remainder were ejected from the premises.  I am calling a special meeting of the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider the matter at 7.00 p.m. this evening.</P>

I am glad to hear that the matter is being considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this evening.  I trust that arising from this meeting effective measure will be taken forthwith to ensure that there will be no repetition of this kind of incident.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the step you have taken in referring this as a matter of urgency to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which, as the body most concerned directly with security in this House, will have to take whatever lesson has been learned from today's affair into consideration. Any event of this kind is serious for a number of reasons.  It underlines the difficulty of combining reasonable security with reasonable access to the Houses of the Oireachtas for Deputies and members <Col N="1673" /> of the public.  Nobody here wants Leinster House, the Dáil or Seanad turned into an armed camp because of the sort of event that happened today.  It underlines also the right and, indeed we would argue, the duty of our democratic institutions to defend themselves against attack.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1980. - Vote 29: Office of the Minister for Education (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £5,080,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain miscellaneous educational and cultural services and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the Supplementary Estimate for higher education and to the fact that this is the third Supplementary Estimate in relation to some of the institutions of higher education that has come before us this year.  I should like the Minister to explain whether it is the accounting of the Higher Education Authority or of the institutions themselves that is at fault to the extent that it is necessary for him to come back twice or three times to the House for sums of money to enable the third-level institutions to complete the year's work.  I also note that there is no provision in the Supplementary Estimate for any increase in higher education grants for this or any year and I would remind the House that there is an obvious connection between this fact and the fact that <Col N="1674" /> the proportion of third-level students who are grant holders seems to be sadly going down.  At the beginning of my speech I said that the Minister's Santa Claus image would fool nobody.  It is more of an Alice in Wonderland exercise and I believe that time and the complaints of the people who are trying to operate our educational system will bear me out.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the remainder of my time, by prior agreement with the Ceann Comhairle, to Deputy John Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Horgan and the Chair for their co-operation in this matter.  I am concerned about the development of regional colleges and the impact on the future needs of our youth. In recent times we have heard and read of professors and people of knowledge indicating, due to the arrival of the microchip, the need to prepare our youth for this tremendous challenge in the next 20 years.  Because of this call for more technocrats and the need for further development in this region I am very concerned as a member of a vocational education committee that the position regarding regional colleges and their needs and finances be assessed as a matter of urgency by the Minister.  For that reason alone I intervene in this debate.</P>
      <P>There is great and urgent need for an increase in the number of scholarships to regional colleges if we are to meet the challenge of the microchip and prepare our young people for it.  In the future more boys and girls will need assistance from the Department in preparation for this challenge through regional college education.  For that reason I strongly recommend to the Minister an in-depth study and urgent review of the situation and a substantial increase in the number of scholarships to regional colleges.  I should also like to emphasise the need for a review of the means test in regard to these scholarships.  We need many thousands of boys and girls if we are to withstand this challenge in the future and a review of the means test is vitally necessary in the case of thousands of parents whose sons and daughters are anxious to learn the new technology for employment in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1675" /> I should like the Minister to look into another matter.  There seems to be confusion and overlapping in the allocation and preparation of schemes by county councils and vocational education committees. If there was co-ordination through the Minister's Department and more relevant arrangements between the county councils and the VECs in regard to the grants scheme it might avoid some confusion among pupils seeking scholarships.</P>
    <P>As we may be approaching the possibility of another package I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the very strong case submitted to the Higher Education Authority for the Minister's final sanction on the question of the recognition of the new vocational school in Thurles as a regional college in County Tipperary.  The need is there and the case has been constructively put forward and I ask the Minister to give the matter urgent consideration.  County Tipperary as a unit is entitled to a regional college. The White Paper submitted to the HEA will bear me out.  I appreciate that the HEA have a big say in the matter but the ultimate decision I believe will rest with the Minister.  We in Tipperary look forward to the new school in Thurles which will be completed for the school year commencing in September 1981 and I hope that by that time the Minister will have accepted that the school should be a regional technical college.  In that way he will be doing great service to County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>As a layman I want to say that what is now offered is a travesty of free education. Gone are the days when we heard the late Deputy Donagh O'Malley introduce free education.  The position has changed today.  I have had numerous requests from primary schools &mdash; the Minister I know has also had them &mdash; indicating a crisis in primary education because of shortage of money.  The shortage has now gone to the secondary sector. A school in Thurles that I know found it necessary to write to the Minister personally on 1 December indicating a crisis in that school.  That indicates a national crisis both in primary and secondary education. <Col N="1676" /> I should like the Minister to bear in mind the points I have mentioned and I hope that what I said in regard to Thurles and the package for north Tipperary will be remembered in the impending by-election.</P>

      <P>I regret that I did not measure up to the image with my red cloak and white trimmings.  I envisaged Deputy Collins as Don Quixote de la Mancha when he was on his mission tilting at windmills because he came out fighting about the school transport service and began attacking something that unlike in Don Quixote's case was not there, some problem regarding school transport.  At least Don Quixote had the windmill to remind him of the realities of life and one of its vanes struck him.  I want to tell Deputy Collins that I found it very difficult to refrain from laughing when he expressed his great concern about our school transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he admitted himself, a Minister from his own party set up a special committee to find out how the transport service should be organised and to suggest a scale of charges, which is precisely what happened.  When Deputy Ryan was Minister for Finance he flew a kite &mdash; in fact, <Col N="1677" /> he was an expert kite flyer &mdash; about the transport system but he was made aware in no uncertain fashion that he would not be allowed to interfere with it.  I want to direct the attention of the Deputy and the House to the fact that more than £20 million was provided this year for the school transport system.  I should not like any worry about it to come between Deputy Collins and his night's sleep during the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to education to the extent that they have allocated £536,318,000 for this purpose. That is £100 million more than was provided in the 1979 budget.  If I include the non-voted money the sum is £545,397,000 which is a considerable sum to provide for educational services. Recently all Deputies received a memo regarding the census.  I ask them to look at some of the statistics in that memo and in the census report.  Speaking in general terms there are about 1,029,000 children in the category 0-14 years and more than 800,000 in the 14-29 category.  The latter figure is not very helpful: it would be much better if we had a 14-22 grouping. On the continent the 14-29 grouping is much more significant because students there continue for a longer period in third-level education.  The young people are the concern of the Government and it is for them the moneys I have mentioned have been allocated by the Government and have been voted by the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan said there was a reduction in capital expenditure.  However, if he examines the figures he will see that total expenditure on capital works this year was £59,500,000 which is £9.3 million more than the out-turn for last year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Horgan reluctantly mentioned that we had some success with regard to teachers's pay but then he proceeded to do some nit-picking with regard to expenditure under the various subheads.  The Deputy mentioned the £100,000 being made available under subhead G.3 for the purchase of hurleys for young people.  The original Estimate, according to Deputy Horgan, was £12,000 less than was provided in 1979. The Deputy should study the Estimate more closely because he overlooked the fact that the 1979 Estimate provided £300,000 for capital.  In 1980 capital is being provided from the tripartite fund. In fact, under subhead G.3 the Estimate for current expenditure is £300,000 more than was provided in 1979.  He mentioned something about NESC and I said I would refer to it in my reply.  The reason I said they were unscientific was that they were comparing 1979 with 1980 but they were comparing the out-turn in 1979 with Estimates in 1980.  That is unpardonable. The exercise we are going through here at the moment indicates how unscientific that procedure was because the moneys being voted now as a result of the Supplementary Estmates and the moneys voted during the year must be added to the amount in the Book of Estimates to get a fair basis for comparison.  This should have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference is made to the review body <Col N="1679" /> on teachers' pay.  The Supplementary Estimates make provision for payment in respect of an increase in salaries as from 1 September 1980 following agreement at the teachers' conciliation council who processed it on proposals deriving from the review body.  I am very glad to have this opportunity of expressing my thanks to members of that review body for their sterling work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The structures of that report were incorporated in the final agreement with the teachers.  I must dispel <Col N="1680" /> any impression that the proposals that eventually were put before the conciliation council for the purpose of an agreed recommendation departed fundamentally from the proposals of the review body.  Perhaps it was inevitable that proposals so revolutionary, in particular in relation to the introduction of long-phased increments, should have needed to be negotiated before being accepted by the teachers.  It was agreed, by way of negotiation, that the span of the long phased increments should be reduced from 23 to 11 years, but the length of the normal scale, on the other hand, should remain at 15 points instead of 13 as recommended in the report of the review body.  The minimum of the new scale was fixed at £5,300 instead of the recommended £5,050, but the amounts of the increment over most of the scale were precisely as recommended in the report, and the maximum to be attained by the long phased increments was fixed at the level of £10,200 recommended by the review body.  I am saying this in order to indicate to the House how the structures were worked out by the review body and adhered to and that what he did after that was build on the work of the review body.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to Deputy Horgan's reference in relation to the lack of specialist teachers.  I am on record, in this House and elsewhere, as stating that my ambition is that any post-primary school which needs a teacher of engineering workshop theory and practice or building construction should have that teacher available.  The House must know that this is the first year that Thomond College was brought into this teacher-training area.  It had already been in existence as a physical education training college for teachers.  This year, we have started off with a new crop of rural science, engineering workshop theory and practice and building construction students.  There is a great future for Thomond College and we hope that that college will provide enough teachers to leave enough available for each post-primary school in the country.</P>
      <P>The problems which will arise in the year, when the new long course is getting under way, is a serious one but one which we hope to be able to deal with.  With reference to the number of grants going down, I want to say that the number of scholarships from vocational education committees has rocketed in comparison and that the number of ESF grants available for regional technical colleges has also increased and is well up over 11,000 altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point that Deputy Ryan made about the regional colleges.  Of course, he had to put in his plug for his own constituency and nobody blames him for that.  Let him not forget, however, <Col N="1682" /> that Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Cavan and Mayo are also plugging for new regional technical colleges and I must keep all their claims in mind.</P>

We intend not to let the country down as far as this is concerned.  I know that our young people &mdash; and I gave the statistics to the House, well over one million in the 0 to 14 year group &mdash; will answer the challenge adequately, as the Government are doing.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has said, we are back to the nuts and bolts.  When leaving them last week, I referred briefly to the problems which now confront us despite the best efforts of the IDA to try to break the log jam which is now causing severe unemployment.  The Minister for Education, in winding up, referred to the faith which the Fianna Fáil Government have in our youth, which was expressed in the amount of money now being poured into education.  However, faith without good works is of little use.  What is needed now is some emergency approach by the Government in the form of a positive reaction to the present diabolical state of the economy which is causing severe hardship to many thousands of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council, which comes under Subhead P, are doing very fine work and they are to be complimented on the campaign which they have spearheaded in relation to the purchase and sale of Irish-made goods in the Guaranteed Irish campaign.  They are also to be complimented on their efforts to promote import substitution.  However, despite their best efforts and despite the fact that the IDA will reach their target of job creation this year, we are still losing ground.  It is not good enough for the Government to say that they have introduced specific measures to meet the needs of the time.  The measures which have been introduced do not seem to be having the corrective effect they were meant to have.  The most lamentable statement I have seen in a long time was made by the former Minister for Labour, who is now Minister for Finance.  A week ago, when commenting on the latest unemployment figures from the CSO, he stated that the impact of those provisions showed that matters were improving. How can they be improving with an increase in the unemployment figure of 4,000 people for the month of November? When any Minister can stand up and say that, speaking on behalf of the Government, <Col N="1686" /> we have reached a lamentable stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to subhead R.1, I note that we are in excess of £40 million under this subhead.  During the election campaign of 1977 a Fianna Fáil Minister in the first week in June went on the radio and stated that the existing level of subsidy was inadequate and that on assuming office Fianna Fáil would ensure that subsidies on essential food items would be increased.  The subsidies at the time that man was speaking were £66 million. Inflation then was not as high as it is today.  That particular Minister was party to a decision to reduce, and in some cases abolish, subsidies on essential items.  Subsidies no longer seem to be a priority with the Government, despite the fact that they always tell us it was they who campaigned, when we were in office, to have subsidies introduced because of the hardship caused by high inflation.  We have now had a high inflation rate for approximately three years.  Inflation is at the level where Fianna Fáil Ministers maintained subsidies should be introduced.</P>
    <P>The theory behind subsidies is a very sound and logical one.  If you have high prices causing severe hardship to the lower paid and people in receipt of social welfare benefits and allowances, the application of subsidies reduces hardship for them.  It also helps to reduce the cost of living which in turn, helps to reduce the high wage demands made during a high inflationary period.  High inflation reduces our competitiveness abroad.  The logic of that kind of progression makes sense to me but the Government, who pride themselves on putting enough pressure on us to have subsidies introduced in the first place, are now in the position where they could increase subsidies.  I am not surprised at this as it is not the first time we have seen promises broken and a gullible electorate left disappointed with promises made by Fianna Fáil at election time.</P>
    <P>A very large number of our people depend for their livelihood on industrial production and many of our people are now leaving the land to seek employment elsewhere.  Now that the traditional <Col N="1687" /> escape route for those people is closed, it is incumbent on the Government to look at this problem and to do something to relieve the seriousness of our economic position.  I assure the Minister that those problems will not go away.  We hope that an upward trend in international economic affairs will occur some time, but we cannot go on forever as we are.  Unless we have some plans to take advantage of that when it happens, we will be left behind.  The people who are now suffering will have to suffer for a longer period because of the inadequate inputs by the Government to ensure that they are looked after and something done for them in this emergency situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal, under Subhead A1. with the Office of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and with the activities of the present holder of the office.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is second in importance only to the Minister for Finance.  He has a great responsibility in relation to our people.  His top priority must be the creation of further employment through greater national investment in industry.  We are facing, according to well-informed sources, a very serious time next year.  The unemployment situation is very serious and is escalating. The reports we are getting are even more dismal and indicate a rise to a disastrous figure of 150,000 unemployed by the end of 1981.</P>
      <P>As a layman I can see that our economy is in chaos and the unemployment crisis, together with the state of the economy, is the greatest challenge yet to the Minister and his Department.  If we are to make any impact or stem the tide of the unfortunate escalation of unemployment predicted by the experts there is grave need for a substantial increase in national investment in industry.  While I agree that the IDA have made substantial gains in job creation, despite this the net result for the past two years has been that job losses have been greater.  Nineteen eighty-one will be a year of great challenge to the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> As an Opposition back-bencher I feel that the present incumbent of the office has an abysmal record.  His abject failure on price control is second to none in our history.  He seems completely indifferent to the savage onslaught on living standards because of the ever-increasing cost of living.  This is an area of grave responsibility for the Minister.  In 1977 the rate of increase was in the region of 7 per cent.  In 1978, it had reached 13 per cent; in 1979, 20 per cent, and it is expected that a similar figure will be reached this year.  Unfortunately there seems to be no light at the end of the economic tunnel to indicate any defusing of this explosive situation.  In the past few days we have heard of substantial increases in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>In my budget contribution last year I said that the budget was a timebomb, the main ingredient of which was a substantial and highly explosive petrol increase which in time would create a massive conflagration in the cost of living standards, an erosion of living standards, substantial unemployment and industrial unrest.  My predictions were unfortunately very correct.  In the space of over two-and-a-half years we had in the region of a 50 per cent increase in the cost of living.  This is a frightening prospect as we face 1981.  How can one blame the industrial work force for the unrest that is there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume I can refer back to the 1973-1977 era, I well remember that the Minister, our new Minister for Finance, and a TV entertainer and Fianna Fáil preacher, Mr. Frank Hall, recently defrocked, since the advent of the Taoiseach, succeeded in their efforts in the House, on television and through many of their established consumer bodies to create an image for the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the time as &ldquo;the Minister for Rising Prices&rdquo;.  After three-and-a-half years the day of criticism is at hand for the present holder of the office because of his inefficient handling of the cost of living.  With all due respect, <Col N="1690" /> I would describe him as the Minister for raging inflation.  Housewives and people generally would readily accept this description.</P>
      <P>There is no price control.  I regret to say that in the past year the Minister seems to have ignored the situation completely. Prices have got completely out of control.  The Minister made a statement in America to the effect that we were pricing ourselves out of the world market. This was an inference I resented, because it was intended to convey that it was workers and their demands for increases that had priced products out of the world market.  The Minister has a responsibility to control prices and he is not doing so and it is time to put this on record.</P>
      <P>During the four years we were in Government I listened to the present Minister and present Minister for Finance swinging out of the rafters and decrying the then Deputy Justin Keating as &ldquo;The Minister for Rising Prices&rdquo;.  Now, after two and a half years, the cost of living has risen by 50 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subheads F.1 and P, I should like to refer to the Irish Goods Council, to Mr. Murray and his executives and compliment them on the efforts they are making to enlighten the people on their responsibilities to support the Buy Irish campaign.  Without the support of the people there will be further unemployment because many of our traditional industries have already gone to the wall&mdash;footwear, textiles and furniture. All this is because of a terrific invasion from the EEC and Third World countries into our home market.  Unfortunately the major portion of our retail trade has been taken over by multi-nationals who have little regard for the country, the people, the economy, or the worsening unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure a successful Buy Irish campaign the Minister should, without delay, emphasise the need for a Sell Irish campaign. The shelves in many of the multi-national supermarkets and hypermarkets <Col N="1691" /> carry about 90 per cent non-Irish produce brought in from all over the world.  The promise in 1977 was to improve, expand and develop our food processing industry. Surely when we go into supermarkets and see such a vast proportion of their stock imported we must do something about it.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism should make every effort to develop the Sell Irish campaign. Those people have no interest in us and it is therefore up to us to ensure that what is put before the consumer is the good produce of native industry.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some of our produce is inferior and that one cannot expect the housewife to buy an inferior Irish product if a better imported item is on general sale.  There should be a relationship between the IIRS and the Irish Goods Council so that they could work together. We want to sell our goods at home as well as abroad and we want to be able to buy best quality Irish goods, and here the IIRS have a big role to play.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the IDA on their efforts overseas to inveigle and to invite major industries to come in here. In particular I compliment the outgoing chairman.  Mr. Michael Killeen, on his years of effort, on his contribution to the development of Irish industry.  I and all sectors of the community are sorry to see him go.  I doubt if it will be possible to improve on his efforts.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the terrible crisis in Irish industry and to the employment position.  Today we heard about the £157 million made available to complete this year's programme.  In 1981 that figure will have to be increased by at least 50 per cent so that there will be an investment of at least £250 million to ensure that the terrible scourge of unemployment will be challenged, slowed down and ultimately defeated.  This year 40,000 new jobs were created and I was delighted to learn that 10,000 of them are in the smaller firms.</P>
    <P>I congratulate SFADCo, who had the foresight to recognise the expertise among local industrialists.  Together they have been able to assess prospects for future development in factories with <Col N="1692" /> work forces of 50 people each.  I am most concerned that we should have development of native small industries employing between 50 and 100 people.  If a big industry is closed in a small town it is a major calamity but if one of a number of small industries fails it has not the same effect and it is possible to find alternative work for those disemployed.</P>
    <P>In SFADCo, Mr. Quigley and his staff have done marvellous work for the midwest region.  Indeed I should like to pay tribute to the local officers who work in the towns and villages and I would say a special word in praise of Tom O'Donnell&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better if you did not.  Somebody else might come in later to attack him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is beyond reproach and his concern for the development of small industries cannot be faulted.  His efforts have resulted in a big increase in employment and I compliment him.  As I said earlier, I welcome the efforts of the IDA to bring in major industries but sometimes I worry that a day may come when we will have such industries shut down because of decisions taken abroad. I advocate encouragement for the Irishman who is prepared to invest to develop industries at home.</P>
      <P>SFADCo, as I have said, have gone from strength to strength in my region and I should like to see their efforts copied in other parts of the country, complementary with the efforts of the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been reference to the bread subsidy of £14½ million, but the time is appropriate for the reintroduction of the total food subsidies which were available in 1977, because at the moment the housewife is under extreme pressure from day to day increases in food prices. It is because of this pressure that trade unions, through the national pay talks, endeavour to ease this pressure.  As we approach 1981 the Government must show their concern for the underprivileged, the lowly paid, by reintroducing the food subsidies in full and I propose to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism that he will fight for this at <Col N="1693" /> budget time.  Deputy O'Malley has energy in the field of industrial development and I should like to see him use some of it in the field of price control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to cover ground already covered by Deputies Ryan and O'Toole.  My main topic will be tourism, but before I come to that I compliment the IDA for their foresight in acquiring land at reasonable prices on which to build advance factories, making it easier for industrialists to move in.  In the case of Little Island in Cork Harbour tremendous work has been done.  There has been criticism of efforts to develop a certain part of the Cork area which had been designated a green area.  If industrialists specify certain areas, they will have to be facilitated.  It is all very well to say that we must put an industry here or there, but very often the final decision rests with the person who intends to set up the industry.  It is very difficult to change his mind and, if we try, it is possible that we could lose industries.</P>
      <P>Whatever we do about money, this is one area where we should not cut back. The local authorities have been facilitating industrialists in regard to infrastructures &mdash; water, sewerage and so on &mdash; but at this stage we could be spending more on promoting new industries.  We should be pushing a bit harder to get these factories into production in view of the number of industries running into trouble and that have in fact closed.  I am not going to make an issue of this, but I believe more should be done to help industries in trouble at the moment.  We are not doing enough in this area.  I am afraid that the skills connected with the various carpet and cotton industries, skills that have been developed over many lifetimes, will be lost.  Our woollen mills are gone, and with them the related skills. They were lost during this period of recession and the danger is that when things buck up again they will not be around to cash in on the boom times.  A bigger effort should be made to protect the skills where there are problems at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the problems are caused by not buying Irish.  It is no use saying anything <Col N="1694" /> else.  We must introduce some enticement to shopkeepers to sell Irish. The shopkeepers and the bigger supermarkets are very much to blame for this problem because they give pride of place to overseas products.  It is terrible to see stuff coming in from Taiwan, Korea and so on.  We have no links with those countries. They are not in the Common Market and the only employment they have created here is for somebody with a telex and a secretary and that is about all and their goods find their way into our shops. We should consider giving some grant inducement to shops that are selling Irish to the exclusion of these products where an Irish product is available.  It is hard to blame the hard-pressed housewife who will often go for the cheapest item in an effort to balance the budget.  It is all very well to preach to her about buying Irish, but if we promoted the selling of Irish goods we would in the long run be doing ourselves a good turn.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism, the Minister gave quite a bit of space to it in his opening remarks.  That was only right because it is a very important industry.  It has grown from a neglected one to a full industry in its own right.  It earns over £500 million and, more important, 99 per cent of it is Irish-owned and controlled, thus contributing in a big way to the economy and playing an important role in our commercial and industrial development. At the moment, unfortunately, this industry is faced with many problems. We have a very high inflation rate. There is trouble in the North.  There is very strong overseas competition.  There is internal industrial unrest.  As yet, we have a pretty undeveloped tourist industry. As the Minister pointed out, tourism is going through some difficult times.</P>
    <P>I would be the last person to talk about gloom, but we have some very big problems. There have been a lot of cancellations and a lot of empty hotel rooms in the resort areas.  However, I would compliment Bord Fáilte for coming out fighting at this critical time because they have shown professional competence and they fully realise their accountability to the nation.  If we realised the magnitude of our problems the battle would be half <Col N="1695" /> won.  Bishop Lucey once said that most of our tourists were exiles coming back. That was true once, but it is not so true now.</P>
    <P>Tourism came our way with comparative ease &mdash; Ireland of the welcomes, cheap holidays, friendly people.  I hope we are still a friendly people, but our holidays are no longer cheap.  At the moment competition for tourists can best be described as savage.  Countries hitherto not involved in tourism, such as Yugoslavia, are offering strong competition. The United States are launching a massive campaign.  Last year they were offering two or three weeks in Miami for £300, but they forgot to say that one would be scalded to death there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>From the sun.  Inflation is an important factor.  At 20 per cent it has hit us worse than most other countries. The Government's fiscal policies and the budget decisions are calculated to strike a direct blow at our industry. Word has got around about our high prices for petrol, drink and cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The cost of transport here is a major factor and it is affecting the industry.  One of the biggest impediments to a prosperous industry is the high cost and low quality of transport.  However, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus, CIE and B&amp;I face a dilemma.  Carriers are obliged to pay their way and, as a result, they probably give priority to commercial rather than tourist interests, In times of recession the carriers are inclined to rationalise.  Their capacity is tailored to expected demand and decisions reflect commercial priorities. Bord Fáilte's transport objective must be to ensure that there is a well-balanced economic network of services to and within Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry is still reeling from the disastrous effects of last year's postal dispute and petrol shortage.  Every effort must be made by all concerned to maintain industrial peace.  In difficult times it is reasonable that there should be a closing of ranks among the various interests <Col N="1696" /> to ensure maximum benefit to the nation. In this ruthless competition we are not advantageously placed.  This is a tiny island off the beaten track.  There is a danger of being bypassed and it is easy to understand the reluctance of the various carriers to lose revenue by reducing fares for a specific service.  But these carriers must co-operate and risk initiatives that will increase traffic and result in profit rather than loss for all concerned.  There is a clear-cut case for the Government to intervene to underwrite the carriers' risk.</P>
    <P>Overseas visitors rightly resent the cost of car hire and these firms are at a very serious disadvantage because of the 15 per cent VAT on car hire turnover and the high cost of car insurance.  An obvious relief would be the remission of VAT on their turnover.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that tourist accommodation must be of the highest quality, well distributed throughout the country to enable visitors to see as much as possible of Ireland in comfortable circumstances. With the success we have experienced over a number of years, Irish hotels, expecially resort hotels, have developed and expanded and in many cases borrowed heavily to do so.  Hotels and guesthouses make a significant contribution in their own right to the tourist industry, as well as being part of the tourist and social infrastructure in their own areas, and help to attract tourists to those areas, even though the tourists may not stay in the hotels.  In general tourists frequenting hotels and farm guesthouses come from hard currency areas and spend an average of £200 per visit.  Hotel and guesthouse accommodation of a very high standard is an essential prerequisite for servicing the requirements of these tourists, many of whom still insist on a mobile-type holiday which enables them to sample a large number of our hotels in one visit.  Hence the necessity for uniformly high standards because one weak link spoils the chain.</P>
    <P>I will spell out briefly the causes of some of the problems being faced at present. Hotels must pay very high bank interest rates and have difficulty in the repayment of loans.  I note that the Minister has taken £700,000 out of the industry <Col N="1697" /> because of development problems. There is a case for the Minister to become involved and to cut through a lot of the messing which can go on with local authorities regarding planning permission and so on.  Quite a number of hotels are encountering stupid little problems which hold them up.  That £700,000 should have been put into the industry in the last year because it is badly needed.</P>
    <P>I gather that grants to hotels for improving bedrooms are not available in respect of existing bedrooms but for only new bedrooms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>The Minister should also examine the essential but expensive matter of providing fire escapes in hotels.  There should be a 100 per cent grant for this work because so many of our buildings are old. I hope that the £700,000 will be recovered by the industry next year.</P>
      <P>The excise duty on drink, cigarettes and petrol adds up to higher charges and more expensive holidays.  If the hotel and guesthouse industry is to survive and prosper it must be treated by the Government as an industry, nor merely as a reliable source of revenue.  To encourage hoteliers to carry out improvements or in some cases just to stay in business, finance must be made available forthwith from the ICC at the preferential rate of 12 per cent which is given to industry. There should be a top 10 per cent rate of profit tax.  VAT should be removed from food consumed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I had copies I would have no objection to circulating them.</P>
      <P>In the likely event of changing trends and the swing away from the mobile tourist because of petrol costs, we must look at amenities attached not necessarily to hotels but to resort areas.  I refer to amenities such as tennis courts and swimming pools, pony trekking, boating, fishing, shooting and so on.  This will involve local government initiative and participation by central government.  Tourist centres must be provided with golf courses and tennis courts and there must be substantial grants for festivals of music and culture. In seaside resorts people with small boats should be encouraged to provide boating facilities and this is an area which should be further developed.  Even in areas where such facilities are available, the fact is not generally known.  Clean beaches are also very important.  Deep sea angling events have proved in the south to be very successful and are a major attraction.</P>
      <P>Our road network badly needs improvement.  This is not the direct function of this Minister but we must try to improve the appearance of the countryside. Hedge cutting is being neglected and there is widespread dumping of litter. The Minister and his colleagues will need to impose much more severe penalties in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It affects tourism.  The local authorities are the worst offenders in this respect.  One local authority is proposing to dump raw effluent into the most beautiful part of Cork harbour, comparable in beauty to the lakes of Killarney. Some of us went to the trouble of proving that it would be just as cheap to treat it.</P>
      <P>Every Irishman who holidays at home is as good as two overseas visitors.  By encouraging Irish tourists we could spread the tourist load over the whole season and avoid problems associated with the peak period.</P>
      <P>When we consider some of our competitors we find that they give all sorts of concessions.  Perhaps they are better off than we are but we must try to copy them. We have much to offer.  Visitors from EEC countries are very interested in the new member states.  Euro-tourists are coming in large numbers, despite the cost, but they are conscious of value for money.  I have spoken to a number of these people and they are satisfied with the hotels, meals and so on.  They commend very highly family and farm guesthouses and would like to see more of these guesthouses especially in areas not designated tourist areas in the Bord Fáilte catalogue.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte have been doing an excellent job promoting certain areas but they are inclined to neglect other areas, such as east Cork, Cobh and so on.  I am not being parochial but these areas come to mind.  People are inclined to look for things one would least expect.  Recently I met some Germans who were most interested in looking at a good Irish farm, village, crops, cattle and so on.  Many tourists are interested in this kind of thing.  Their interests are diverse and we should cater for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to spend some of the £700,000 by taking VAT off food <Col N="1700" /> consumed in hotels &mdash; I am not talking about drink &mdash; guesthouse operations, hire cars, which at present stands at 15 per cent, and give preferential loans to the people involved in the industry.  The wine licence increased to £100.  Some of these small guesthouses would hardly make £100 a year profit from their operations. Obviously that was a prohibitive increase.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry must be a matter of prime concern for everybody.  Every facet of the industry should be involved with the tourist board.  Regional tourist boards should be given more teeth and more money and further developed because they are doing a great job, but I am not happy that they are getting their fair share of the cake.  For instance, little things happened this year, like closing offices.  Maybe we could do without some of them but in areas where we are trying to develop tourism these offices are essential.  I was not in favour of those closures.</P>
    <P>Regional tourist boards consist of voluntary workers who take pride in what they are doing.  They live in tourist areas and seem to have their fingers on the pulse of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer first to something Deputy O'Toole said on the last occasion in regard to Córas Trachtála Teoranta and their apparent lack of services to small firms and their apparent concentration on larger ones.  This is a misapprehension, although it is a fairly common one.  It probably arises from the fact that larger firms tend to be in evidence at the more visible CTT activities &mdash; in group promotions, such as trade missions and trade fairs.  These activities are a relatively small part of that organisation's overall budget; they constitute only 16 per cent of expenditure.  The bulk of their resources are allocated in a much less visible area &mdash; the provision of marketing advice on an individual firm basis.  It is this service which is availed of mainly by these small firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a survey carried out by CTT last June it was found that 59 per cent of the <Col N="1701" /> firms they were helping had less than 50 employees and in order to cater particularly for the smaller firms, the organisation recently decided to establish a small firm export department to try to encourage new firms of that type who are not exporting into that business and to try to get many of those who were exporting to Britain, for example, to diversify out of it.  Already this new section has had meetings with 200 small firms of which they identified 75 as potential new exporters.</P>
    <P>The recently established CTT regional offices furnish small firms in the regions with the first point of contact and give them an opportunity they would not have had up to now.  A major priority of these regional offices is to conduct a drive to get as many firms as possible in those regions, particularly the smaller ones, involved in exporting.  Helping them is of course proportionately much more expensive because a great deal more effort has to be put into doing things for them that would, in the normal course of events, be done by a larger company for itself.  In the long term this is worth doing and a very high proportion of their resources and energy are being devoted to these smaller firms.</P>
    <P>There was a traditional outlook here that a small firm was set up to satisfy a local need, but increasingly one would like to convince small firms, wherever they are, that looking within the confines of this very small island with its tiny population can be a restrictng attitude and they should look to the European Community with 260 million people and beyond it.  The scope for them if they are prepared to broaden their vision in that respect is enormous.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole referred at some length to job losses in industry.  From everybody's point of view, they are running at an unsatisfactorily high level, particularly after the very substantial net gain in jobs in manufacturing industry in each of the last two years, the biggest gains ever achieved, perhaps in the history of the State.  At the moment the indications are that, notwithstanding the enormous job creation this year, there will be no gain in manufacturing employment. Indeed, there may be some marginal <Col N="1702" /> loss.  We will not know that until January.  The fact that I can say in respect of Irish industry in 1980 that it will only have a marginal loss of jobs is a considerable achievement on the part of this country.  It is worth recollecting, for example, that less than six years ago the number of people unemployed in the UK was 400,000 and the number of people unemployed there today is 2¼ million. Unless we get carried away by the sight of figures like 114,000 or 115,000 unemployed, which we have not seen since 1976 when we saw a lot of such figures with a smaller population than now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>And a smaller public service at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In case we get carried away with those type of figures, which are repeating now after four years and in a much more severe recession than the one which existed then, it is as well not to look at this part of the country in complete isolation.  We should look, for example, towards Northern Ireland.  If present trends continue it looks as if the unemployment figure in Northern Ireland will begin to catch up with the figure for the Republic.  That is in spite of the fact that our population is substantially more than double the population in Northern Ireland.  It is fair to draw the conclusion from that that the real rate of unemployment in Northern Ireland is just about twice what it is here.  We are only too tragically aware of the problems that exist in Northern Ireland and the obvious influence they have on that kind of situation, but we should be also equally aware of the enormous rate of subsidy that is pumped into Northern Ireland by the British taxpayers.  If notwithstanding that kind of subsidy, which we could never hope or expect to match, the rate of unemployment is still running at a level which is roughly twice ours in real terms, then I do not think we are exactly among the most destitute economies in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From some of the things Deputies O'Toole and Ryan have said one would think that the Republic of Ireland was some kind of self-contained unit isolated in space not affected in any way by anything <Col N="1703" /> that went on in the rest of the world. One would get the impression that everything, good or bad, that might happen here was directly under the control of the Government.  The reality of course of the modern world is very different, and those who have had any experience of these matters know that well and have given up making statements that are based on the implication of total isolation.  It can be demonstrated, for example, by a reference to our situation in the British market, which is of such paramount importance to us, taking 46 or 47 per cent of our exports.  We have currently a tremendous advantage in the British market in currency terms.  It is approaching a differential of almost 20 per cent.  One would imagine in those circumstances that normal economic laws apply.  One could envisage a huge upsurge in our exports to Britain, but that is not happening in spite of the tremendous currency differential.  The reason is that, even if we were to offer those goods at half the price again on the British market, we could not sell them because there is no demand in Britain for them.</P>
    <P>That type of situation is unfortunate. We have lost the benefit of our currency advantage.  There is nothing anybody here can do about that.  That is, unhappily for us as well as for the British, the state of the British economy today and that is one of the reasons why for several years at my instigation or encouragement CTT have been seeking to divert firms out of the British market.  If more of them had gone out sooner we would be in a somewhat stronger position today.  I do not expect our sales to Britain to drop and I look forward to a continuing strong presence in the British market but, at the same time, a declining and, hopefully, quickly declining, percentage of our total exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss of the differential is not due entirely to a loss of demand in the UK: it is due to a loss of competitiveness at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an element of <Col N="1704" /> that in it also but the differential has been so big in the last couple of months, 20 per cent, that it should, if the British market was normal, have meant a tremendous advantage for us, not just against other exporters to Britain but against domestic producers there.  It has failed to do that principally because of an extraordinary basic lack of demand in Britain.  It is worth nothing that if we had not the currency differential our present problem in competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain with much lower wage increases would create definite problems for us.  It should be borne in mind that to some extent the good fortune of our currency relationship with Britain is only temporarily buying us time in the problems we will have to face up to soon.  The fact that they have not happened yet does not mean they are not going to happen.  We would be well advised to bear those difficulties in mind now and make up our minds that we are anxious and willing to take the necessary steps to prevent them having a serious effect on our economy.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the best efforts of the Chair, Deputy Ryan spent a lot of time on the question of my functions in regard to price control.  I dealt with that matter some time ago and I did not expect to hear any more about it but it is possible that Deputy Ryan was not here at the time.  I involved myself to such an extent in price control that at times the members of the Prices Commission began to resent my interference or interventions in regard to this.  They began to feel that they were not being allowed the traditional kind of independence they had enjoyed under my predecessor.  I do not know what the current figure is but I am aware that, when it was added up one year ago, I found that on 54 occassions I had intervened to reduce or disallow price rises recommended to me. Obviously, the current figure is a good deal more than 54.  I also discovered, having had the records in the Department gone through, that on no occasion in more than four years had my predecessor bothered to intervene in any recommendation. Deputy Ryan's suggestions of my alleged inactivity in this area are not well-founded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan quoted a whole lot of incorrect figures and he got them all wrong and for the wrong years, but I will not be pursuing that.  On the question of buying and selling Irish mentioned by Deputy Ryan, and also by Deputy Hegarty, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the chief executive of the Irish Goods Council chaired a meeting on 15 September last between the Irish wholesale and retail food trade which included multiples and multi-nationals.  The participants at that meeting agreed for a six-month period from then to (a) initiate no new importation of primary food lines (b) enter into discussions with Irish manufacturers with a view to substitution of lines being imported currently (c) where imported products were sold by an Irish manufacturer to procure those products from that manufacturer rather than through external sources and (d) undertake special steps to ensure that the Irish-made products are highlighted on their shop shelves. The representatives of that meeting of the wholesale and retail food trade also agreed that the Irish Goods Council should monitor progress in these areas.</P>
      <P>It was refreshing for me to listen to two Deputies here today speak in support of the Irish Goods Council and of their campaign. My recollection is that since I launched this campaign almost three years ago it is the first time I have had any support from that side of the House in respect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That campaign was disparaged for years by Deputy Kelly in particular when he was dealing with Industry and Commerce matters.  It was regarded as a joke, a waste of money and time, something that was just a sort of gimmick that I had dreamed up which was getting worse and worse rather than better.  It is noticeable that within the last six months there has been generally&mdash;I suppose reflected in what is said here <Col N="1706" /> today&mdash;a much higher public awareness and acceptance of the necessity for this campaign as well as much more practical support for it.  Much of the credit for that probably is due to the present Minister for the Environment, who when he was in my Department devoted a great deal of time and energy to getting that message across.  It had to be done painfully and repetitively at times, but it is fair to say that it had really begun to pay off. Because the type of work involved in getting people to sell Irish necessarily must be carried out privately, Deputies and the public at large perhaps would not be aware of what has been done in this respect.  The Irish Goods Council over the past year have visited virtually every store in the country of any consequence to encourage the staff in every way open to them to give much greater prominence to Irish goods and to push Irish goods to a much greater extent.  From what one can see that certainly is beginning to pay off.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan spoke at some length about SFADCo and the good work they have done in his constituency in recent years.  I was very glad that Deputy Ryan should say that because I recall that here almost three years ago, when I announced that SFADCo would be changing their role fairly dramatically, there was a very great feel of opposition. I recall in particular that one of those who were very vocal in condemning what I was trying to do was Deputy Ryan.  At the time he was encouraging SFADCo to resist any change in their activities, something which fortunately they did not do. I am glad that now he rejoices with me in the success of what we set out to do nearly three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty raised the point that I wanted to refer to particularly, and that is the fact that this Supplementary Estimate discloses that Bord Fáilte were unable to spend £700,000 this year on new hotel development or additions to new hotels which had been allocated in the Estimates for 1980.  As the Deputy mentioned, one of the principal reasons that they were not able to spend it &mdash; not the only reason &mdash; was that so many hotels that were thinking of undertaking <Col N="1707" /> development or anxious to do it were running into planning permission difficulties. The Deputy suggested that I should involve myself in these matters, but I have found that I have no statutory right to do that.  If I as Minister seek to dictate to local authorities about matters such as this, they resent it and resist it. As far as I know, I have no right other than to make normal, ordinary representations to An Bord Pleanála.  I will not make any comment about An Bord Pleanála.  I will leave it at that.  Charity is best expressed there by silence.</P>

It is pretty devastating that they take up the sort of attitude that they do in regard to certain development, and it is a pity. However, I am glad that the Deputy has drawn attention to this problem where money is going unspent.  While this is not the only reason &mdash; there are others &mdash; this is one of the major reasons why it is going unspent.  One would hope that the local authorities and planning authorities generally would take a more positive line or, as the Deputy puts it more directly than I do, cop themselves on in this respect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is necessary because income derived this year from the letting of lands on hands of the Land Commission is not sufficient to meet outgoings.  Subhead G &mdash; which must be looked at in conjunction with subhead M (3) &mdash; is a contingency provision to meet the situation that has now arisen.  Receipts from the letting of lands are paid into the rent and interest account, from which outgoings on the <Col N="1709" /> lands are also met.  Such outgoings comprise the charge for servicing the land bonds issued for the purchase of the lands, rates, wages of herds and caretakers and such items as temporary fencing to facilitate lettings.  In addition, the receipts from lettings go towards meeting part of the losses incurred on resale of lands.  The balance required to meet such losses is provided for under subhead E (3).</P>
    <P>Due to the buoyancy of letting income a call on subhead G has not been necessary in other years.  The general trend has been a surplus in the rent and interest account which is brought to credit of the Vote under subhead M (3).  On the basis that a similar situation would obtain for this year, therefore, only a token provision was made for subhead G.  In the event, the income from lettings is down by some 20 per cent on last year.  One of the reasons for this is that the area of land available for letting is lower by as much as 13 per cent as compared with 1979. This reduction is the result of the accelerated programme of allotment being pursued by the Land Commission.  The level of receipts from lettings has also been affected by the difficult conditions in agriculture generally, by the poor weather in the early spring of this year &mdash; the time of year when the bulk of the lettings are made &mdash; and by the fact that estates exceeding 40 hectares are now let by private treaty to facilitate smallholders who could not be assured of securing a letting division if the public auction procedure were employed.  The cumulative effect is that the expected surplus has not materialised and recourse must be had to subhead G to meet the deficit in the rent and interest account.</P>
    <P>Receipts from contributions towards improvements expenditure and from the resale of retirement scheme lands are also less than anticipated.  These come under headings 5 and 6 of subhead M. The drop in these items is, however, almost entirely compensated for by the increased receipts under the sundries heading 8 of the subhead.</P>
    <P>The total shortfall under subheads G and M is £985,000, but as against that <Col N="1710" /> there is an anticipated saving of £130,000 on subheads H.1 and H.3 due to the fact that intake of land under the retirement scheme has not been of the volume estimated. When the latter savings are taken into account the net additional sum for which provision must now be made is £855,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a great deal to be said about this Estimate in itself but it is a matter of concern that a supplementary estimate does not contain provision for a new land policy.  We had been given to understand that a new land policy would be in operation by now but all we had in the past few days was a Government White Paper with no date set for the introduction of legislation giving effect to new land policy.  I realise that land policy is not an easy subject but I would have thought that, given the time devoted to this by the inter-departmental committee and the very comprehensive report presented to the Government, the Government would have come forward with something more than a rewrite of the report in summary with some changes: I should have thought we would now have reached the stage of actually having legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on the Government's proposals regarding land policy.  I note in paragraph 27 of the report that all land purchases will now require the approval of the Land Commission. This will lead to a tremendous increase in bureaucratic activity and I imagine endanger the operation of the auction system.  If a person sells land at an auction and somebody buys it and the buyer applies for approval which is not given the person may be forced to have a new auction.  There is no guarantee that the under-bidder will accept the land six months later &mdash; the probable period the Land Commission will take to give an opinion on the highest bidder's title to buy the land.  There is at least the possibility that the system of free sale of land based on auction could be seriously undermined.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to set our minds at rest on that subject; I hope he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that notwithstanding <Col N="1711" /> the strong recommendation by the inter-departmental committee the Minister has decided to retain land bonds.  In the vast majority of cases land bonds are paid to small farmers in the west of Ireland who are selling land to the commission.  It is not big farmers who get land bonds but small farmers and to give them something that is not cash, something very often worth much less than its apparent face value in place of cash is to do an injustice to these people, to my mind.  I am disappointed that the White Paper does not contain a clear commitment to get rid of land bonds, if not immediately, at least over a period. It is clear from the White Paper that land bonds are to be retained forever.  I regret that very much, particularly in view of the type of people who will be getting these bonds instead of cash for the land they are selling which is valuable.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed at the passage in the White Paper on late inheritance. The Government have done very little to encourage the early transfer of land. Almost all their efforts are concentrated in the White Paper on trying to influence the direction of the small proportion of land which passes through the market place.  They ignore the fact that the vast bulk of land will not go through the market place in any year and in terms of restructuring land there are far greater opportunities for improving the management of land and bringing new and better farmers into the control of it by influencing inheritance and gifts of land between people and their relatives than by trying to influence the market place.  The passages in this document on inheritance boil down to nothing at all.  We have a page of words but no serious proposals to bring about earlier inheritance of land by younger farmers.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have made a specific proposal on this matter regarding a two-year abolition of stamp duty on transfers of land to farmers under 35 years of age who have an agricultural education.  Something on these lines accompanied by a radically reformed farm retirement scheme would be necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> I am deeply disappointed with what is said in the White Paper regarding the farm retirement scheme.  The Government have sought to put the entire onus for the reform of this scheme on the EEC authorities.  They have copped out of the subject themselves and have ignored the fact that there are two specific things within the competence of an Irish Government to do that could be done to improve the scheme.  If it were improved there would be a marked transfer of land to younger farmers.  First, they could increase the level of pension and bring it into line with other pensions.  Up to now pensions under the Farm Retirement Scheme increased in line with the cost of living, not with the level of increases in other pensions, with the result that since the scheme was introduced pensions under it have increased at almost exactly half the rate of equivalent pensions under the social welfare code.  People who retire under the farm scheme are losing as against social welfare pensioners and that is an obvious direct disincentive to participation in the scheme.  Bringing that pension in line with social welfare pensions would be entirely within the competence of the Government without any reference to Brussels.</P>
    <P>Further there is nothing in the scheme about enabling people under the farm retirement scheme to get benefits under the social welfare code such as free light or electricity.  If those facilities were made available to people retiring under the farm scheme, which again would be entirely within the competence of our own Government, it would have a direct effect in encouraging people to use the scheme.  The Government deliberately ignored what they could do to improve the scheme and tried to concentrate all attention on what might or might not be done in Brussels.  In other words, they washed their hands of trying to improve the scheme themselves.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed about the proposals with regard to long-term leasing.  I am glad a model lease is to be introduced but I am disappointed that it is not proposed to provide a financial incentive to get people involved.  To get this under way, for an initial period at least there should <Col N="1713" /> be some form of financial incentive, whether by way of grant or tax concesion on rent.  Such an incentive is needed in order to get an initial batch of farmers into long-term leasing.  Once that initial impetus has been given other farmers will follow.  I do not see the need for an indefinite financial incentive but, to get it off the ground, some financial imput is necessary. What is proposed here by way of model leases and giving pious advice will not work.  In five years time there will not be any long-term leasing and in retrospect it will be seen that the reason was that the Government did not have courage to make financial incentives available.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the attitude of the Government in regard to the division of commonages.  The paragraph dealing with this matter is similar to what was said with regard to late inheritance &mdash; full of pious words, encouragement, support and so on but no concrete measures are proposed to encourage the division of commonages.  We know existing instruments have not been successful in dividing commonages.  The Government should have changed the rule that exists at the moment where a small minority of people with an interest in a commonage can prevent the majority from dividing it.  If the Government had changed that law there would have been a rapid improvement in the division rate.  This problem should have been close to the heart of the Minister of State because he knows the situation as a TD in the west of Ireland.  I am surprised he did not make a change in this area.</P>
    <P>I note that in addition to requiring all land purchase to be approved by the Land Commission there will be substantial taxes on certain categories of purchasers. Has the Minister considered in detail the effect this might have, particularly in the current state of agriculture? The Minister is aware that many farmers who are in serious financial trouble are faced with the prospect of having to sell their farms.  As a result of what is being proposed now each purchaser will be scrutinised and many will have to pay a substantial surcharge.  Obviously this will mean fewer people will be prepared to <Col N="1714" /> buy land and, in turn, it will lead to a reduction in the price of land.  If land prices are halved &mdash; and this is on the cards as a result of the policy of the Government &mdash; it means that where a farmer would have been obliged to sell ten acres to pay his debts he will now have to sell 20 acres to raise the same amount of money.  The effect will be even greater fragmentation of holdings and much hardship for farmers.  Many young farmers will have to sell even more land in order to repay the banks.  The Minister should consider this matter very carefully. I know these measures have had a long gestation period.  For instance, in 1978 the problem I mentioned about farmers having to sell land would not have been a consideration one would have had to bear in mind in assessing the merits or otherwise of this kind of tax but now we know there are many farmers in such a situation.  They are already in trouble but this policy could ruin them completely. Perhaps the Minister has not much sympathy for that kind of farmer, although I doubt very much if he would lack sympathy for them.  I should like him to address himself to that subject, either in his reply or on some other occasion.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my good wishes and that of my party to Deputy Hussey on his dual appointment to the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  In the job he has held I have found him to be most constructive and I mention in particular his attitude when we were dealing with the legislation dealing with plant varieties. He showed a most welcome willingness to accept ideas from the other side of the House.  I hope he is glad about his new job and that he will do at least as well there as he has done in the job he has held up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Bruton for his good wishes on my transfer to the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  I appreciate what he said.  I was very happy to have had the opportunity of working with him in the past few years on the subject of agriculture.  I can honestly say we got on <Col N="1715" /> well together and that is as it should be because both of us are concerned about the agricultural industry and would like to contribute in that area.</P>
      <P>Here we are discussing a Supplementary Estimate for Lands and I gave the reasons in my opening remarks.  It is necessary because income derived from the letting of lands on hands by the Land Commission is not sufficient to meet outgoings. The income from lettings is down by 20 per cent on last year and the amount of lettable land available is down by as much as 13 per cent as compared with 1979.  Hence the reason for the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton dealt mainly with the proposals outlined in the White Paper on land policy issued recently and he regretted that the estimate did not make provision for a new land policy.  This was discussed on a number of occasions here. The Government are committed to introduce a new land policy and I am sure that legislative proposals on the matters outlined in the White Paper will be brought before the Dáil in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with the points I raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will deal with them as I go along.  Any discussion on land policy is emotive.  It takes a long time to formulate something that will be acceptable to farmers in general.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the position of vendors, about whom he was particularly concerned.  The operation of the land control system will be designed to ensure that no unnecessary hardship is imposed on vendors.  Of course, the details will have to be worked out as regards auctions.  There is no reason why a person seeking to buy should not apply for approval before the auction.  As regards inheritance, the White Paper argues forcibly that this is a sensitive area and I think we all agree with that.  It does not lend itself to legislative action. We would need to change the whole climate of opinion and attitudes.  ACOT will have an important role to play in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> As regards leasing, here again there is a limit to what the State can do.  Like inheritance, it is largely a matter of changing attitudes.  We are going to take positive action, as spelled out in the White Paper.  Leasing of Land Commission land is one of the things outlined in the White Paper and that a model lease would be prepared and also that there would be a campaign of advice on the feasibility of a leasing scheme, and so on.</P>
    <P>As regards the farmers retirement scheme, the Deputy says that the pensions have not kept pace with social welfare payments.  He has not, however, adverted to the fact that annuitants under the retirement scheme get the market price of their land plus a premium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards commonages, since 1939 the Land Commission have power to devide a commonage where all the owners do not agree.  The problem is not on the legal side but on the question of the practical application of compulsory division of a commonage.  It is one thing to have compulsory powers; it is another thing to use them in circumstances where trouble would ensue.  We all accept that this can happen, particularly in the case of commonages where a number of people are involved and where it is absolutely necessary to get the full co-operation of all the people before one can draw up a satisfactory scheme.  From my own experience I have found time and time again in dealing with these problems that it is not always easy to get the full co-operation of all the people involved.  There are always one or two people who for various reasons seem to think that they could get more than they are actually entitled to. This, in effect, stops the putting into operation of a scheme regardless of who tries to prepare it.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £417,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid. </P>

      <P>I hope that his tenure will be sweet but short, as short as possible. However, whether it is for three weeks, three months or &mdash; from the country's point of view with the appalling possibility of Fiánna Fáil winning the next election &mdash; three years, I hope that the responsibility which he undertakes in the <Col N="1719" /> Department of Finance is fully appreciated by him and that he appreciates the damage which has been done to the economy in the last four years by the Government of which he is a member.</P>
      <P>I do not like to talk about somebody who has left that office.  However we had a performance here yesterday from the Minister's predecessor in office which was confused.  He made a number of contradictory statements in relation to the balance of payments which were not borne out by the facts, even though he had figures at his disposal which I had not.  At one stage during Question Time yesterday the Minister said &ldquo;There is a significant increase in industrial exports&rdquo;. I do not know if the Minister had the figures issued by the CSO, which we received this morning, which show that the exports were not up as much in real terms over 12 months.  I presume the Minister had that information yesterday. It was not fair of him not to give it to the House.  The statement he made in the House was not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been endeavouring for the last fortnight to ask questions regarding the NESC.  I put them down to the Taoiseach, who did not reply to them but passed them on to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister said yesterday, in reply to supplementary questions, that they were the responsibility of the Taoiseach. I want to warn the Minister that, if we put down questions to the Taoiseach on matters which are his responsibility, it is not right that they are put off on to one of his Ministers.  We had another example today of that when questions which Deputy Creed put down to the Taoiseach were answered by the Government Chief Whip, who is Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  He admitted during the reply that these were matters within the responsibility of the Taoiseach.  We have had this on a number of occasions in this House.  Obviously, the Minister cannot answer questions relating to NESC if he is not the Minister responsible for that organisation.  He said that portion of the planning functions remained in his Department and this was <Col N="1720" /> the excuse he gave for taking the question at the time.  I presume there is a planning function in every Department for which the particular Minister is responsible.</P>
    <P>The NESC report was commissioned by the Taoiseach and for the last 12 months it has been under the control of his Department.  Its funds come through the Taoiseach's office and they submit their report to him.  If we want to ask questions relating to planning or on points that are brought out in the various reports published by NESC there is no point in the questions being answered by the Minister for Finance, because he can say: &ldquo;This is not the responsibility of my Department&rdquo;.  Collective responsibility is more bowed to than practised by the Government.  I do not believe that the present Minister for Finance or his predecessor would say that the Taoiseach discusses everything with them.  Every Minister should be answerable to the House in relation to any questions which are asked of him.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the task facing the Minister in his new Department. The budget date was announced today as 28 January next.  I warn the Minister that we cannot have a budget in 1981 like the one we had in 1980.  That budget did a greater amount of damage to the employment prospects, the export prospects, the tourist industry and the agricultural industry than any day's work any time over the last 60 years in this country.  It added at one stroke 4 per cent immediately, which probably became 6 per cent by the time it had worked its way through the economy through the rate of inflation.  If the Government had not passed that budget our inflation rate would now be 6 per cent lower.  Our interest rates would consequently be that much lower, our competitive position would be that much better and our exports would be that much higher.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Minister's predecessor said that manufacturing exports were increasing significantly.  The figures out today show that in real terms exports are down.  They would be down much more except for the statement on the back of the sheet of figures which we got this morning.  The first item here shows <Col N="1721" /> that between November 1979 and November 1980 live animal exports chiefly for food, increased from £14.6 million to £17.4 million.  This is the single largest increase in that category.  If the Minister repeats in the next budget the indirect taxation of the 1980 Budget then we will further damage our export potential, we will further damage tourism, we will increase inflation and we will have more people out of work than the 180,000 people out of work at the moment.  I see the Minister making a note about this figure.  I want to tell him how I got that figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister making a note.  I want to explain where I got that figure of 180,000.  There are 115,000 on the register, there are 8,000 on short-term and I am adding to that the figure which the present Minister for Finance, when he was on this side of the House, said must be added to every level of unemployment to show the real number of people looking for work.  The figure he gave then was 60,000.  The figure for unemployment, according to the present Minister for Finance, is 183,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the worst level of unemployment the country has ever experienced. It is because of all the actions of the Government but because of one factor especially.  When it was quite obvious in 1979 that the world would move into a recessionary period, the country did not need last year a budgetary policy which would damage the prospects of keeping people in employment, because that would damage our prospects of exporting. No month has passed when the organisations who speak for the business and manufacturing community have not said that one of the most serious things <Col N="1722" /> affecting their competitive position was the imposition in the last budget of the tax on oil.  Ministers have said many times that the high rate of inflation was due to external factors.  Germany does not import a lower percentage of oil than we do, yet their inflation and unemployment rates are much lower than ours.  We must conclude that the problems of inflation and unemployment are due to the policies pursued by the Government.  There must not be a repeat in 1981 of the budgets of 1980 and 1979.  The Minister is taking on this job at a time when all the Government's wits and brains will have to be applied to bringing down the rate of inflation, getting people back to work, increasing exports and holding our position on imports.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor was fond of saying that the balance of payments position was improving because our imports were down and our exports were up.  Manufacturing exports have been doing well.  A commentator in <i>The Irish Times</i> today said:</P>
    <P>Manufactured exports increased by only 9.6% to £203 million between November 1979, and November, 1980, ... </P>
    <P>An increase in money terms of 9.6 per cent is a reduction in volume terms because when the figure for inflation is announced it will probably be in the region of 18 per cent.  There was a drop in volume terms of 9 per cent.  During all the recessions in the last ten years, manufacturing exports have increased significantly but if this figure is correct it would appear for the first time there is a drop in volume.</P>
    <P>The Government should be worried about destocking by farmers.  At a time when they so badly need breeding stock to pay rate bills, taxation bills and bank interest, farmers have to sell their stock. This is very wrong and should be of great concern to the Minister and the Government. The drop in imports is in an area where we do not want a drop &mdash; in goods for further processing for re-export and also capital goods for manufacturing.  The reasons for the improvement in the balance of payments position are not advantageous <Col N="1723" /> to the country.  Exports are not increasing at a sufficient rate or, if they are, they are in the wrong categories.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will say how successful the guaranteed Irish campaign has been.  I appreciate that to quantify it is difficult but it did very well for the first 12 months when it was launched.  The Government were very committed to it but then there appeared to be a lull in which we were going back to the old &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  Only this year did the Government seem to put their full weight behind it.  It is one of the most imaginative and beneficial campaigns ever launched.  It could be extremely successful. I am satisfied that the Government are committed to it and are providing funds for it.  I hope the Minister will be able to say if it has been successful and if there is any method of quantifying it because I do not believe we can use import figures to say that it has been successful.  I am not sure what way we can measure its success or failure but my guess would be that it has been more successful this year than at any time in the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>The tendency is for Government to feel that once the danger has passed they can relax the amount of funds they give to such campaigns.  It is important when the recession seems to be lifting to ensure that there are adequate funds for such campaigns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that we are dealing with the Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas in this discussion.  I should not allow this debate to pass &mdash; it is rarely that the Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas is discussed at all &mdash; without saying that this House is perhaps the institution in the State most urgently in need of reform.  We do not do business in a proper fashion.  We are now dealing with money which has already been spent and are giving retrospective approval to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have argued before that estimates, supplementary or principal, should be approved before a single penny is spent. That means that estimates for 1981 should be presented during 1980 and not <Col N="1724" /> at the end of the year.  No money should be spent on supplementary estimates until they have been approved.  We need to establish a committee system and reform the general operation of the House to ensure that there is proper scrutiny of the spending of public money.</P>
    <P>The present procedures are archaic and give us no control.  All we are doing is giving our legal imprimatur to the spending of money over the initial allocation of which we have no control and of the use of which we have little knowledge.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of miscellaneous expenditure there has been an overspending of £50,000 on State entertainment this year.  I am not a kill-joy by any means but this is hardly a year in which the Government should decide to overspend on State entertainment to the tune of £50,000.  I should like to know where the money went and why the over expenditure was so high.  Is it possible that in the original Estimate account was not taken of the increase in the price of drink which the Government subsequently introduced and then they found they had to pay more in terms of entertainment expenses because they themselves had increased the price of drink?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain why we have a separate Estimate for remuneration.  I understood that substantial sums were made available in individual Estimates for remuneration.  Why therefore did we have a separate Estimate for remuneration for certain categories, presumably, of officials within the Departments in question?  This type of multiple accountability does not seem to lend itself to proper control.  As well, in this Department of Finance group of Estimates I am surprised there is not a Supplementary Estimate for the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Estimates before us are for the purpose of paying increased salaries, have increased salaries not been paid or to be paid under the National Understanding in the Revenue Commissioners?  How has that office been able to cope with the National Understanding increases without a Supplementary Estimate?</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that it is not a question <Col N="1725" /> of extra salaries being paid or additional money being provided for such salaries in the Revenue Commissioners without a Supplementary Estimate.  I would take the gravest exception to that happening. The Department would not have any right to use savings within the Revenue Commissioners under particular headings and re-allocate them for additional salaries.  If additional salaries are to be paid in that office the figures should come in here in the form of a Supplementary Estimate.  Why have we not before us a Supplementary Estimate in respect of the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

      <P>Qualified, perhaps I should have said.  Most of the points made by Deputy Barry are more relevant to the debate we will be having tomorrow than to the Supplementary Estimate before us.  I will go into them more deeply then.  I strongly disagree, as do the majority of the people of the country, with his views on the Government's handling of the economy.  During this Government's term vast strides have been made in growth and development despite serious international difficulties, but we do not preach gloom and doom.  We are resolved to endeavour to guide and direct the country through this deep economic recession, and to date we have had remarkable success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject Deputy Barry's comments in relation to the effect of the 1980 budget and its strategy.  The budgetary measures were designed carefully in the light of the circumstances then prevailing and having regard to factors with which the Government were forced to grapple.  For example, there was the matter of taxation of <Col N="1726" /> married persons.  I assure Deputy Barry that in the next budget we will have similar regard to the realities of the current economic situation.  Deputy Barry made a general comment on the agricultural situation but he did not comment on the very valuable Supplementary Estimate before us this evening in regard to agricultural grants.  We have a concession being given to a group of people in the £40 to £60 valuation bracket.  It is a substantial and very welcome concession to many of my constituents who happen to be in that situation.</P>

It is a tribute to us that this year more than ever we have given an opportunity to the Opposition to debate such Estimates in detail.

The figure here covers cases where Supplementary Estimates were not taken and cases where Supplementary Estimates were taken but subsequent special pay increases arose.  The Deputy mentioned the Revenue Commissioners.  He will find that savings have been made in the Vote for the Revenue Commissioners.  In other words, the Deputy does not have to worry that the National Understanding increase will not be paid to those people.</P>

Three minutes ago we passed a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Finance and it is now included in a printed Bill ready to be discussed here.  I appreciate that there is no other way of doing this and the money must be passed now.  But this underlines the point that Deputy Bruton made that <Col N="1730" /> our management of finance in this House is crazy.  I am not saying this in any party sense but it is time we got down to looking at how money is spent and accounted for in this House.  We are going to pass here £3,441,326,550, almost on the nod of a head.  I know a lot of the individual Estimates have been discussed but it is time we started trying to see how Estimates can be put before the House and debated on before the money is actually spent.

      <P>In this year the amount of time devoted by this Government to debating Estimates was substantially greater than has been the case in this House for many years.  As the House will remember in the earlier part of the year we specifically set aside Friday for Estimates.  That more than doubled the time devoted to Estimates last year.  The time devoted to Estimates this year was 113 hours as against 51 in 1979, 64 in 1978, 18 in 1977 and 56 in 1976.  I take the point Deputy Barry makes which is related to whether there should be a reorganisation. Obviously this is a matter that has been discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and one report has issued and the Government contributed to giving this extra time this year.  I understand a further report will emanate from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I am aware that Deputy Bruton has raised this not only tonight but over the past two years.  I am also aware that the greatest exponent on that theme was Deputy Vivion de Valera. But this Government, having discussed it with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, did allow a substantial amount of time this year.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress I had been dealing with the work of the IDA and the need for some form of new impetus to get over the present economic problems which have given rise to a very high unemployment rate.  Today in the House the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism made the point that Córas Tráchtála were deeply conscious of the value of the small industrial unit and drew attention to their track record.  I reiterate what I said regarding what might be done to complement the commitment by CTT and the IDA who are emphasising the need for and the value of the development of small industries. I am convinced that one of the major solutions to our economic problems lies in the sphere of small industries. I say this not because I am suggesting that the IDA will not continue to have such success in inducing large companies to come to this country, but because they know that competition for such industrial units is now very stiff indeed.  While they must be encouraged in their efforts to attract such industries here, there is nothing <Col N="1733" /> wrong with a parallel impetus in the development of small industry.</P>
      <P>The Government should show their commitment in this area by appointing a Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism who would have total responsibility for the small firm sector, backed by a national agency to help small firms to set up and to assist them in dealing with Government and various agencies.  Such small firms face an enormous amount of red tape and have not the capacity and the personnel to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Regarding our industrial development generally, we must retain our clean environment and the social fabric of our society.  These are matters on which I could speak at length, but time does not permit.  The warning lights are flashing regarding our treatment of the environment, and the existence of toxic waste as a consequence of industrial production is a matter which must be treated far more seriously.  There is an urgent need for the safe disposal of this toxic matter, and the Minister should examine this problem because it will get worse as time goes on and our industrial base broadens.</P>
      <P>I do not endorse the Government record on industry, and they have blatantly failed in their attempt to deal with the retention of jobs.  I endorse the work of the IDA, the Government agency. Long may they continue to attract industry from anywhere they can get investment from abroad.</P>

      <P>This motion strikes me as a somewhat inept one in the sense that it was put down two days after I made a speech early last week on many of these points, and it displays, for that reason, if only for that alone, a singular lack of originality.  It contains the potential danger of creating an appearance of xenophobia.  I am glad Deputy Desmond in proposing the motion last night did not take that approach.  In fairness to him, he almost went to the other extreme and made a very low key speech.  I propose to respond on the basis that no element <Col N="1734" /> of xenophobia will be engendered here and no ammunition will therefore be given to those who spend part of their time abroad trying to run down this country.</P>

      <P>Depending on how the motion was dealt with it could give rise to that.  That is why I said I appreciated the manner in which Deputy Desmond approached it and it enables me to approach it in the same way without having to say things that might otherwise be necessary.  I want to pass from that to make some general remarks in regard to our present industrial strategy.</P>
      <P>We have two main ambitions for our economy &mdash; full employment and a rising standard of living.  Together they provide the foundation for the stable development of our society &mdash; expanding opportunities, broadening the choice of goods and services, providing more resources for those in need and a feeling of confidence in the future.  In their absence &mdash; particularly over a long period &mdash; this foundation is at risk; opportunities diminished; choices are narrowed; social justice becomes a luxury as the limited available resources go to those with the strongest muscle; confidence is displaced by doubt and uncertainty; and stability itself is threatened by internal conflict and, ultimately, by social disorder.</P>
      <P>Over the past 25 years Ireland has undergone a &ldquo;crash course&rdquo; in industrial development.  We have had to go through this process to ensure the foundation for the stable development of our society. Seán Lemass saw this need and began the highly successful programme of planned growth, based on rapid export development, a high level of investment and selective attraction of foreign enterprise to strengthen the industrial base.  This period has seen a dramatic growth and broadening of employment opportunities and a steady rise in the country's living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has been enormously successful in adapting in such a short space of time to the disciplines of modern <Col N="1735" /> industry.  We have today the fastest growing industrial sector in the European Economic Community.  Our growth rate in output, investment and jobs has been faster than any of our EEC neighbours. This growth has taken place in a free market economy in competition with the best of other countries.  We have today an industrial management force with skills, experience and vision who are not dismayed either at the prospect of foreign competition or at the necessity to penetrate foreign markets to sell their products. We have, perhaps for the first time in our history, a healthy Irish industrial base with competent management personnel who know what they can achieve, who know they can measure up to competitive international standards.  We have a general work force who have assimilated the latest manufacturing techniques and technologies with commendable speed.</P>
    <P>The remarkable role played by the IDA in achieving this situation should not be underestimated.  I do not need to recite again a litany of statistics in order to convince this House of the professionalism, the effectiveness and the achievements of the IDA.  Through their efforts foreign enterprises operating in international growth markets have been persuaded in considerable numbers to locate in Ireland.  As a result, an increasingly wide range of products is being exported and new markets &mdash; especially in Western Europe &mdash; are being opened up.  During the last 15 years, this kind of investment has provided many of the new jobs that have been created in our economy and it has also taken up much of the slack as the older, more traditional industries have shed workers and as the number of jobs in agriculture has continued to shrink.</P>
    <P>We should make no mistake about this. If it were not for these foreign industries coming into the country and the IDA's efforts we would be in a very poor state indeed job-wise.</P>
    <P>Let no one underestimate the importance of the contribution made to our growth by these multinationals.  They have been fundamental to the growth of the economy over the last quarter of a <Col N="1736" /> century.  Without the solid base of productive effort represented by these foreign industries, we would not be able to afford many of the present expenditures on social welfare, health, education and housing.</P>
    <P>For this country direct foreign investment has been &ldquo;a means to an end&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;end&rdquo; I am talking about is the acceleration of the transition of the Irish economy from a primarily rural, agricultural-based one to a modern industrial economy with some of the most modern factories in Europe, with a solid base in the new growth industries of chemicals, electronics and pharmaceuticals.  This is an economy which provides challenging and worthwhile employment opportunities for our rapidly growing young population and enables them to stay at home and to contribute to the development of their country.  It is an economy in which young Irish businessmen can experience the best international management practices and technological developments; an economy in which these young Irish businessmen are stimulated and motivated to set up their own indigenous companies to complement the thrust of the foreign multinationals and go on to develop new overseas markets for new and innovative products made and rooted in this country.</P>
    <P>There was no other realistic way in which these extraordinary results could have been achieved in as short a time frame and I am proud to have been a part of, and indeed to have made some small contribution to this process.  I am particularly pleased to see during the last three years especially, the growth of indigenous Irish industry and the emergence of high-quality native Irish managers and entrepreneurs to manage these industries.</P>
    <P>I have encouraged this trend because I believe it is the way of the future and that the eighties and nineties will increasingly see the growth of indigenous industries in all kinds of sophisticated and technologically advanced areas &mdash; industries which are owned and managed by Irish entrepreneurs and managers.</P>
    <P>Even today there are clear signs that this is happening.  While there is a widespread <Col N="1737" /> impression that the IDA have concentrated most of their efforts on the introduction of large overseas companies to Ireland, this is to a great extent due to the fact that the establishment of such companies here usually attracts much more attention in the press than similar investments by Irish firms.  In fact, the most up-to-date estimates based on IDA employment surveys suggest that foreign-owned firms account for only about 33 per cent of total manufacturing employment.  The IDA, with my strong support, are heavily committed to the maximum support and encouragement of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Over the last three years the number of jobs approved from domestic industry has increased significantly mainly as a result of the decisions I took in late 1977 regarding indigenous small industry.  In 1973-74, for example, job approvals from domestic sources represented 41 per cent of the total job approvals while last year this figure was 58 per cent &mdash; a very substantial increase.</P>
    <P>Last year small firms employing 50 persons or less accounted for 24 per cent of jobs approved for assistance by the IDA. This year the figure will be at least 33 per cent of the total approvals.  The rapid growth of small industries in Ireland can be appreciated by a comparison of the results of the first year of the Small Industries Programme in 1967 when a total of 34 projects were approved, with 1979 when, on average, three projects were approved every working day.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to see this kind of progress not only because over 90 per cent of these projects are Irish-owned but also because small firms play a very important role in developing a balanced industrial structure.  They bring jobs to towns which are not large enough to sustain major industries.  Since 1967 small industries have located in 440 separate locations throughout the country.  On top of this they encourage native entreprenurial talent.  One in four projects helped by the IDA is created by persons not previously engaged in manufacturing, persons who are developing and exploiting their own ideas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> At the beginning of this year 23,000 persons were employed in small grant-aided firms, equivalent to 10 per cent of the manufacturing labour force.  Over the decade of the 1980's the growth potential for small industries will be greater than ever due to the increasing number of spin-off opportunities arising from new larger scale industries.  The 1980s will also see a vast array of new business and job opportunities becoming available to Irish entrepreneurs and managers.  We will need these job opportunities and we will need to capitalise on them if we are to continue the momentum of the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>Looking out into the 1980s our expanding population will place ever increasing pressure on our manufacturing industry to meet the future job requirements of our young people.</P>
    <P>This pressure will be greatly increased by the continued labour shedding in the agricultural sector.  This is expected to continue for a number of years to come, because productivity in Irish agriculture is on average below that of most European countries and the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture is still, by far, the highest in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The international environment in which our industrial sector will have to operate to provide the job opportunities I refer to is likely to be dramatically different from that of the sixties and the seventies. We are likely to see only moderate economic growth in the developed countries of the world.  Almost uniformly, forecasting institutes in most western countries are predicting slower growth in output, increasing inflationary forces, persistent monetary instability and increasing unemployment.  We are likely to see rapid technological change continuing to be an essential element for development. We are likely to see increased free trade between countries and, despite current protectionist pressures, we are likely to see increasing participation from developing countries in world economic exchanges.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland we must be prepared for the fact that the determinants of economic growth in the decade ahead will be different in quality and in intensity from <Col N="1739" /> those that dominated the economic growth in earlier times.  It is in this context that the Government last year asked the NESC to undertake a major review of our industrial policies and recommend the most appropriate strategies for the eighties.</P>
    <P>This review, which is being carried out by a team of international consultants, will deal with: the competitive position of Irish industry at present; the prospects for new growth industries; the cost efficiency of the instruments of industrial policy; the lack, until very recently, of significant growth in indigenous Irish industry; the role of foreign industry; the sources of funds for industry; the likely consequences for Ireland of shifts in international advantages, and the co-ordination of industrial development policies with infrastructural and manpower policies.</P>
    <P>The consultants involved expect to present their final report to NESC in early spring 1981 and the Government will consider what action is needed in response to these recommendations at that time.</P>
    <P>The task of shaping our industrial policies and our industrial strategies to face the challenge of the eighties will not be an easy one.  The next ten years will present many challenges and many problems. However, I believe that Irish industry today is capable of continuing real growth in the years ahead.  There is no question in my mind that we have the resources here to make it happen.  Let me enumerate some of the more important ones in my view: we have a high degree of political stability; Irish people have a clear sense of identity and a self-confidence greatly strengthened by the experience of the past 20 years, a period during which manufacturing industry grew by 6 per cent annually in real terms; we have had consistency of industrial development policies for over two decades; we have successful and dynamic promotional agencies and an attractive, well developed range of incentive programmes; we have some of the most modern plant in Western Europe, arising from the fact <Col N="1740" /> that our drive for industrialisation is less than 25 years old.</P>
    <P>We have a skilful and adaptable work force who have proved themselves in modern technology.  Our skills are not inhibited by hide-bound tradition and our industry is increasingly oriented towards sectors of long term growth.  Finally, and perhaps most significantly, for the first time in the history of this country there is available a substantial group of Irish managers, capable of competing with the best in the world.</P>
    <P>This, I believe, may be our greatest resource, and it is one that has only become available to the Irish economy in very recent years.  In the fifties and earlier the enterprising Irishman too often went abroad out of necessity and was lost forever to us.  But the Irish emigrants of the sixties have begun to come back bringing with them the skills, experience and vision acquired in their years abroad.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis it is this human resource, and the attitudes, the vision and the motivation of our own Irish people, that will determine how successful we will be in the next decade.  We need enterprising native businessmen to grasp the challenge of the eighties, to exploit the new product and market opportunities, to build a new generation of indigenous companies, technologically sophisticated and rooted here.</P>
    <P>If I were to pick one example of the benefits to this country of the marriage of multi-national technology with local brainpower and of the opportunities available for native Irish talent, I would pick the electronics industry.  The huge advances made in electronic technology and the fact that this country now houses some of the best companies in this field presents us, in my view, with a golden opportunity.  The revolution in information processing is only gathering momentum. There are literally thousands of applications to which microprocessors can be put.  Advanced electronics in the office, in industry or at home have a scope that knows no bounds.  Electronic starting and fuel efficiency control in the most basic of cars is likely to become the norm of the future.  Robot assembly is now quite common in almost every new car <Col N="1741" /> assembly plant and it is only a question of time before they are used in many other sectors of production line industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland is now ideally placed to exploit this downstream development of the microprocessor.  We have the technology, we have the educational infrastructure and we are acquiring the personnel. By 1985 the Industrial Development Authority reckon we should have over 30,000 people engaged in the electronics industry &mdash; we have 13,500 at present.  By 1985 we will be turning out a plentiful supply of trained technicians and graduates. But will these people have the vision to see, and the motivation to exploit the development potential that the new technology affords us?  It is being done in the United States all the time.  Employees of one company move out to start up on their own, either in competition with their former employers and deploying greater efficiency, or in developing another product.  Surely we can do it here.</P>
    <P>Given our commitment to the free enterprise system and our industrial incentive programme, there is all the more reason why such spawning should occur here.  This country offers ready-made factory units, substantial capital grants and a 100 per cent write-off of the investment in year one.  Manufacturing industry in Ireland, whether for export or domestic consumption, will pay tax on profits at a maximum of 10 per cent from the beginning of next year until the year 2000.  There is little excuse, therefore, for our businessmen and entrepreneurs not to seize the opportunities that are facing them.</P>
    <P>I believe we have the opportunity to undergo in the eighties the most significant shift in emphasis in our manufacturing profile since Irish manufacturing industry got off the ground 25 years ago &mdash; and we have the chance to do it ourselves. The technology and the work force are here and, increasingly, the infrastructure is being set in place.  The key ingredient that will determine our success is motivation.  What is the attitude of the graduates and technicians likely to be?</P>
    <P>Ireland has never really been regarded <Col N="1742" /> as a nation of enterprise.  The next few years will afford us the best possible incentive to prove the world wrong.  I not, then the enormous downstrean potential of the electronic revolution will pass us by, or what we do see of it will be as a result of foreign enterprise yet again taking the initiative.</P>
    <P>Apart from electronic hardware the other areas of potential of the 1980s, such as bio-technology, synthetic fuels, software development and so on are areas of potential suited ideally to Ireland in that they are low energy, often low capital but always high brainpower technologies. The key requirement in all these areas will be enterprise.</P>
    <P>Enterprise of all kinds will have an important contribution to make.  I hope that domestic private enterprise will play a key role along the lines I have developed earlier in this speech.  Foreign enterprise will continue to be a vital source of new investment and new jobs.  Public enterprise, either alone or together with the private sector, has also a contribution to make.  This potential contribution was recognised by the Government and discussed in detail with the unions and the employer organisations who took part in the negotiations leading to the last two national understandings.  In that context, as all Deputies will be aware, the Government have undertaken already to provide for the establishment of a national enterprise agency.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with this proposed agency I would like to make it clear that I do not share the view often expressed that only public enterprise can provide a really effective answer to the country's employment need.  I acknowledge that public enterprise has, and must continue to have, a part to play.  Unfortunately, the performance of many of the commercial State companies has been nothing short of abysmal.  In fact, with only a few exceptions, they add up to a litany of financial failure.  This may be due to some extent to the fact that the ventures themselves may not have been attractive in commercial terms in the beginning but quite obviously other factors are at work also.  In the light of these unhappy experiences can anybody honestly <Col N="1743" /> or convincingly make a case for further large-scale direct State participation in commercial activities?  The milestones along such a road would very soon become millstones round the necks of taxpayers.  Is this what we want?  The answer must definitely be no.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the commitment to set up the National Development Agency was given in response to sustained requests from the trade union movement for a national development corporation which would research new ideas for industrial development and establish new industries based on native resources and on improved technology. The preparatory ground work needed to bring the new agency into operation has taken longer than anticipated but, given what I have said about our experience of public enterprise, Deputies will appreciate the importance of assuring that the necessary framework and <i>modus operandi</i> are worked out fully before its launching.  Great care must be taken to ensure that there is no overlap between its functions and those of other State agencies, particularly the IDA and SFADCo.  We must also avoid a situation where the agency would be bidding in competition with other State bodies for the same projects.  I expect that detailed proposals for the establishment of the agency, taking those problems into account, will be considered by the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>From all that I have said here tonight it is clear that in continuing the momentum of our industrial development the task which we face as we head into the 1980s is a daunting one.  None of the difficulties which I have mentioned will be solved in any final sense, but they seem more manageable than those that faced Ireland 20 or even ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The opportunities for progress, as I have said, will be there.  However, to take advantage of opportunities calls for effort, co-operation and discipline.  Progress will not come by sitting around waiting for things to happen and allowing those opportunities to slip by.  Our country can be only what we make it.  For too long this was a country where the feeling <Col N="1744" /> that nothing can be done lay heavily like lead on the soul.  That era is over now.</P>
    <P>We all agree that full employment and a high standard of living are important, but statements of hope or good intentions are not enough.  To achieve our ambition we have to produce and sell goods and services that are wanted in home and overseas markets and we have to do this in a highly competitive world which does not owe us a living.  We will have to be clear about the scale of the challenge that confronts us.  We have to define the choices open to us, to set realistic targets and, above all, to commit ourselves to the action which is required to achieve these goals.  This will call for leadership of a high order at all levels of our society from the Government down to individual workers on the shop floor.</P>
    <P>For my part I assure the Deputies here tonight that I myself, my Department and all of the State agencies under my control are striving hard to provide an example to the industrial sector in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak in support of the Labour motion and to respond to the speech that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has made and to the tone of that speech.  I respect and appreciate the way in which he has proposed to deal with the resolution and the motion that we have put down.</P>
      <P>As I said in my intervention, this party, unique in this House, have not traded in the obnoxious, political ideology of xenophobia which has beset this country for so many years and there is absolutely no suggestion of xenophobic antagonism in this motion.  On the contrary it is fitting and right that a political party in a democratic assembly of the free Irish peoples should after 60 years look at the extent of their control and development of their own industrial base if we are to give any sense or meaning to the struggle for freedom that our forefathers had over many years.  To celebrate the partial victory of our antecedents and forefathers in achieving freedom for ourselves is in no way to claim or assert to be xenophobic at all; on the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present occupants of the Fianna <Col N="1745" /> Fáil benches like to refer to the late Deputy Seán Lemass and his contribution to the development of the State of this country. However, like most politicians they tend to be rather selective.  I was brought up in a Fianna Fáil house with long memories, and, without being disrespectful in any way to the positive ultimate contribution that the late Deputy Lemass made to this country without any great personal gain &mdash; indeed, with very little personal gain to himself &mdash; the record will show that in coming to Government in 1932, with the support of the Labour Party, the late Deputy Lemass spent 19 years establishing a Sinn Fein tariff-protected economy to enable private enterprise to create an industrial base.  When he saw the abysmal failure of Irish private enterprise he spent the last ten years of his life, from 1957 to 1966 when he retired, in dismantling it.  The fact that he was more successful in dismantling it than in erecting it in terms of its net impact on the growth of this country is something that we welcome. Let the House be quite clear that if the record was to be objective, the strategy of Sinn Fein tariff-protected industrial growth in this country failed and was seen to fail by the return in 1957 of Fianna Fáil to office, and clearly so by Deputy Lemass in 1959, when he became Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Those years were lost at a time of difficult economic development internationally. We are being assured now by the present incumbent of the post once held by Deputy Lemass that this time Fianna Fáil have got it right, that this time the magic formula of industrial growth and development has been discovered and that they are going to deliver in a way that they were not delivering before the two objectives, if I quote the Minister correctly, of full employment and rising standards of living.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party would like, first of all, to clarify the consensus of agreement which we share with other parties in this House, particularly with the Government. We share those objectives.  I suspect that we share them to a degree far greater than the Minister realises fully, but we are not the ideologues in this House.  The ideologues are over there. <Col N="1746" /> They are the people who believe consistently and frequently in the unique ability of private enterprise to deliver the jobs.</P>
    <P>We have had the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977 and the subsequent and constant reiteration of private enterprise whether at chamber of commerce dinners in the US or at CII gatherings here.  The ideologues, if one wants to read Deputy Desmond's speech yesterday or listen to me now, are not on this side of the House. We have frequently and consistently stated that we are in favour of a mixed economy with the dynamic role for the public sector.  We accuse successive Governments of not having recognised the real dynamic contribution that a well-managed &mdash; I emphasise that phrase &mdash; public sector can make to the development of our economy.  There is no such thing as private enterprise in our economy. The present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  I suspect, is better aware of that than any other occupant of that Department with the bleating queue of industries that do not want to pay taxes when making profits and are banging down his door seeking grants and bail-outs either from himself directly or from Fóir Teoranta when they are in trouble.  If that is private enterprise it does not square with usage of the English language.</P>
    <P>We already have a mixed economy &mdash; some would say a mixed-up economy. The public sector which in terms of direct employment is the largest sector is being misused and abused by elements within the private sector and in private industry where it is required to provide at below cost level an infrastructure for the development of the private sector without any guarantee that the private sector will automatically reinvest within the economy to create employment.  I do not wish these comments to be seen as an attack on the private sector; on the contrary, this party believe the representatives of private industry when they say they represent private interests.  They do represent private interests first and foremost. The history since 1977 as represented by spokesmen for the industry, Mr. Liam Connellan and others, clearly indicates that the survival of their own companies <Col N="1747" /> and the interests, not of their employees, but of their shareholders and debenture holders are their first concern and will be looked after first.</P>
    <P>What then does this motion seek?  We say there is a mixed economy.  We recognise the role and positive dynamic interaction of a mixed economy.  We say that the so-called privacy of that sector is very small and that the potential for dynamic growth and development within our economy from the public sector has been denied by successive Governments.  Specifically the present Government and the present Minister whose competency is in no way doubted by any Deputy &mdash; have regrettably failed to implement a commitment in relation to the industrial consortium &mdash; if that is the correct phrase &mdash; in the manifesto.  There may be difficulties attached to this.  The Minister indicated some of them.  The reports and analyses that now for the first time are being made available directly to Deputies and Senators by the State Sponsored Bodies Committee would indicate that for far too long the involvement of the Oireachtas in the public sector in terms of accountability has resulted in considerable mismanagement in more than one State enterprise.</P>
    <P>One swallow does not make a summer. The bankruptcy of not one but of hundreds of private enterprise firms does not in any way diminish the faith of the Fianna Fáil ideologues in the propriety of private enterprise, so why should those who believe in and argue for an increasing role for the public sector accept that faults and mistakes in management in the public sector somehow remove the correctness of that side of the economy for economic growth and development.  I say that so as to suggest that the dynamic positive mix between public and private has never really been sought and will not be sought until such time as the rather mild terms of our motion are implemented by some Government.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Government immediately to ascertain and publish details of the extent to which our industrial base in employment depends on foreign and multinational capital.  We are asking the <Col N="1748" /> Government now to review the policies of the Industrial Development Authority in relation to over-reliance on foreign and multinational capital.  Finally, we ask them again to look at the whole question of a national development corporation. There are many ways in which this might be done.  In my personal view there is an argument for taking all of the semi-State bodies under the wing of one Department and of creating a Department of Public Enterprise and assigning, for example, to the Department of Transport the role of regulator and not have it trapped as it currently is by either Irish Shipping on the one hand or Aer Lingus on the other. Instead of being an independent agency between the commercial interests of that company and the general public it somehow becomes a political lobbyist for the semi-State company as every working politician will readily concede.  Until such time as you can get all the semi-State companies together, separate those providing direct services which can be seen as services of a social nature &mdash; such as CIE &mdash; from those clearly in the business of manufacturing products, whether energy or foodstuffs, and look at the deployment of capital, how the capital is used, the return on it, its long-term and short-term benefits in the way any banking consortium would evaluate a proposal for funding from a group of commercial companies, we shall not get the growth-orientated, job-producing public sector that our economy desperately needs.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the consensus between this party and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism who is present &mdash; I am not sure that it would extend to all the members of his party &mdash; in regard to the commitment to full employment and to increasing living standards.  I recognise that the Minister is personally committed to that as the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development was very sincerely committed to it.  The strategy of the last three years has not produced from the private sector the kind of response that the present Minister and Deputy O'Donoghue hoped for.  They gave every possible incentive to the private sector to produce.  In the same way as the late <Col N="1749" /> Deputy Lemass learned from his mistakes over 19 years of trying to protect Irish businessmen from foreign competition, in the vain hope that they would produce a wealth base in the country which would obviate the need for emigration. I should like to think that just as he learned from the mistakes of that strategy and set about dismantling the tariffs he had spent many years establishing and critically &mdash; and this is what we are looking for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy not agree that Deputy Lemass had no option in the thirties because the whole world was protecting or was &ldquo;sinn féin&rdquo; if you like in its outlook then.  If he did not protect the Irish market he would have no other market available for manufacturing industry here because everybody was doing the same thing.  Our difficulty was that we had such a tiny market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's intervention and I accept it is a fair point. The option was whether one went for a public involvement, a mixed involvement or an exclusively private involvement. Regrettably because of the ideology of the 1930's &mdash; and neither the Deputy nor I were responsible for that &mdash; the thrust was exclusively in the private sector with very few State companies.  Perhaps the most successful was the sugar company which was established in 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have no illusions about the matter.  We cannot wave a magic wand and get rid of the problems that face the country.  As the Minister stated, re-echoing again the much-quoted Deputy Lemass &mdash; nobody owes the Irish people a living.  We live very well relative to the rest of the world.  It is up to us to look after ourselves.  The Labour Party recognise the contributions made to this State by people before and after independence but we ask if it is wise to have 50 per cent of our GNP controlled by foreign-owned companies.  Even though we are directly involved in the technology of the micro-processor and the whole question of the silicon chip, despite the positive efforts of the Minister <Col N="1750" /> to locate and integrate that technology with NIHE, Limerick, the control does not rest within our economy.  There is a hope and a belief that there will be a spin-off in this technology and that it will generate secondary and tertiary industries on the basis of the managerial expertise that exists now.  I would like to think that will happen &mdash; in many cases it will &mdash; but I must point out that the same hope and belief was shared when Shannon was established in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  The Minister knows better than I that there has not been that kind of spin-off either technologically or industrially in the Shannon region.  It has only been in the last two or three years with the commitment to the small industries programme, initially at SFADCo and then with the IDA, that we have had a take-off in terms of employment.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the majority of people are agreed on this issue which has not been well articulated either by this side of the House or by the Government.  There is a belief in the comfort and solidity of State employment.  Why not build on that?  Why not extend it?  As the Minister said, we have the technology and the expertise.  In my opinion we have the marketing capability to sell our products to hundreds of countries.  What is preventing the State from getting involved? In his speech the Minister mentioned the level of capital investment by various countries since 1960.  He told us that from 1960 to 1976 there has been an investment of £200 million from the UK, £106 million from the FGR, £133 million from Holland, £74 million from Japan, £120 million from Canada and the same amount from the United States.  All of this investment has been in a period of 16 years.  However, we are talking now of a current account budget of more than £3,000 million.  We are talking about capital funds that exist now.  Not only do we have the technology but we also have the capital resources to fund ourselves.</P>
    <P>Any Finance Minister will have to consider again the investment potential and role of pension funds in the matter of our economic and infrastructural development. It is clear that the private individual operating through the stock market <Col N="1751" /> in classic capitalist terms is a minor, insignificant component in the overall investment area.  It is major companies and institutions who are providing investment capital or, alternately, it is people such as the Minister who are investing taxpayers money into private companies without an equity involvement in the belief that somehow private industry will do the job. Why is it that, after 20 years of struggling to get a satisfactory standard of employment, with 100,000 employees in the public sector investing each month part of their salaries in investment funds, that some of those funds cannot be diverted into the ownership of some factories and the provision of infrastructural facilities. whether it be toll roads or harbour facilities?</P>
    <P>People in State companies take certain matters into account in making provision for the future &mdash; pensions for themselves and their wives, as well as jobs for their children and their grandchildren.  We should look at the capital investment potential of State employees who, by the success of the labour movement, have got solid and substantial pensions that are not being used to the full.  One of the things a national development corporation could do would be to look at the entire public sector as a whole, at the various corporations and companies that operate in it, at the 100,000 employees concerned, at their pension fund investment capital and consider how to make this marvellous achievement of Irish endeavour work to its full capacity.  That achievement was not as a result of executives of the IDA going to Japan or Germany in the same tradition that Dermot MacMurrough went to Pembrokeshire in 1160 &mdash; in saying this I do not wish to denigrate the efforts of the IDA &mdash; begging people to come along to do something for us.  The State sector gives more than ten times the amount of employment generated on the multinational side.  We could use that as a base to develop and expand.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by using the phraseology used by the Minister when speaking at a meeting of the National Dairy Council when he referred to some of the promises <Col N="1752" /> made by his party in their manifesto in regard to growth and development. One such area is the food processing sector.  Since 1977 the record has been abysmal even though there are companies with considerable capability in this area.  What is stopping the Irish people from putting together the acreage now owned by us, which was reclaimed from the bogs that countless generations of British administrations said were useless and which are now developed by Bord na Mona?  When a land area the size of County Louth becomes free of peat with the technology put together by General Costello in the Sugar Company, in Erin Foods, the skills and abilities of Bord Bainne and the marketing experience of CTT, what is stopping the Irish people from using together, under the umbrella of a national development corporation, the incredible resources of these four or five organisations and producing intensive foodstuffs in prime land the size of County Louth, from packaging and marketing it in a world which daily sees the deaths of millions of people from starvation? Is it the Arabs who are stopping us, the bankers in Zurich, the bankers in New York?  What major constraint is preventing us?  What better utilisation could there be for the pension fund of 100,000 State employees than to go into that kind of endeavour?  What better pension could anyone have than secure employment for children and grand-children?</P>
    <P>Is this not the very essence of what the Labour Party are saying in this Motion? Is it not the very logic of the rational application of our own technology, our own resources, our own skills and our own endeavours, free of the control of foreigners?  I use that phrase without any sense of denigration because in hard times&mdash;and they will come&mdash;someone sitting on the board of a company based in New York or Tokyo, owned primarily by New Yorkers or Japanese, will and must have regard to their own and where shall we be left then? What we are doing &mdash;and perhaps far too mildly&mdash;is simply asking this House to agree on the need for the establishment of a national development corporation.  We are not prescribing <Col N="1753" /> the way or manner in which that should be done.  We are leaving that open to those people who have immediate&mdash; and hopefully temporary&mdash;access to the resources of the civil service and the specialists to establish the most appropriate framework. Can this House seriously deny the real need for such a development, and at a time when the BBC and RTE are showing on screens here, in the UK and the Six Counties the history of the struggle of our people for a measure of control over their own destiny?  Can anyone in this House seriously oppose a request that a certain section of our economy, which currently employs 100,000 people and which produces light, heat, shipping, aviation, foodstuffs and has the capability, from the existing combined resources and technology, should expand into an opening and ever demanding market?  Can anybody seriously oppose the need for such development? If they do, and if it comes from the right wing.  Ronald Reagan republicans who sit on the far side of this House.  I should like to hear the ideological justification for such opposition.  Having heard it.  I should like them to match and stitch it into their own historical ideology.</P>

      <P>First, I want to make clear the stance from which the Labour Party approaches this topic.  The Labour Party is a socialist party.  It is not a Leninist party.  It is not a party which believes that the State must own everything and that nobody else can own anything.  It does so because one of the central beliefs of socialism is in a diffusion of political and economic power and the maximum degree of participation by people in the economic and social life of the country in which they live.  For this reason, our approach to questions such as industrial policy is basically a balanced one.  It is because we see the present situation in Ireland becoming dangerously unbalanced that we have put down this resolution. It has prompted an excellent debate in this House.</P>
      <P>The first question which must be asked is, what exactly is the situation in relation to the balance between foreign and domestic-owned industry in Ireland?  The sad fact of the matter is that, while we may have some suspicions in broad outline, we simply do not know.  I asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism a number of parliamentary questions which were answered yesterday, about the percentage of industrial jobs in firms or industries which were foreign owned, about the percentage of Irish industry, excluding agriculture, which was foreign-owned and for the approximate breakdown of IDA investment in relation to firms or enterprises owned by Irish nationals and firms or enterprises owned by non-nationals.  The reference is questions 351, 353 and 354 of yesterday's date.  The answer was &ldquo;The information which is maintained on the ownership of industry is not in the form requested in these questions.  Because of the difficult problems of definition which arise, it has not been possible, in the time available, to re-process the data into the headings which the Deputy appears to have in mind.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that was not a total put-down, but it was as near to it as you will meet in a long day's walk.  The Minister, apparently, did not see fit to tell the House or me exactly the form in which the data is <Col N="1755" /> kept, so that I could rephrase the question and get the necessary information.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister whether he had, at any time since assuming office, indicated to the IDA his or the Government's view as to what their policy in relation to foreign or multi-national investment should be and the nature of any such view or instruction in relation to IDA policy.  The reference is Question No. 352 of Tuesday 16 December.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>My Department has frequent liaison with the Industrial Development Authority and my views on all aspects of industrial development policy are conveyed to and implemented by them.  Moreover, in formulating their industrial plan, the authority take full account of the Government's overall economic targets and policies.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the 1978-82 IDA industrial plan has set a very high target to provide 75,000 new grant-aided manufacturing jobs in the period.  A central target of this plan is that over 50 per cent of these jobs should come from within Ireland.  This reflects my desire that the employment creation potential of Irish industry should be developed to the maximum, while at the same time recognising that, in the medium term at least, overseas-sponsored investment will continue to make a very important contribution to the industrial base. </P>
    <P>The Minister enlarged, to some degree, on these rather inadequate replies in his speech here this evening in which he gave his estimate that some 33 per cent of industrial jobs in the country at the moment were jobs in foreign-owned industry.  I do not know if it is too unrealistic to project from that figure the hypothesis that roughly one-third of our industry is foreign-owned.  If that is correct, this raises very serious questions for our economic stability in the long term. I spoke not very long ago to the former Prime Minister of Finland, a member of the Socialist Party, whose country has a population of four million people, who are not very rich in their own resources <Col N="1756" /> and who have several large, somewhat suspicious and antagonistic neighbours. The percentage of foreign-owned industry in that country is about 3 per cent, one-tenth of what it is here.  He expressed concern, which we share, over this high proportion here.</P>
    <P>The next question is to ask what is the cost to us of this heavy and increasing reliance on foreign industry?  The latest IDA report has some very interesting figures on this on page 7, which deals with the year 1979.  It states:</P>
    <P>The average fixed asset investment per job in new overseas industry increased in real terms by 20 per cent from £13.167 in 1978 to £15,684 in 1979.  This increase is largely due to the capital intensity of several major overseas electronic and mechanical engineering projects negotiated during the year.  If these industries are excluded the trend shows a decline in real terms. This continues a trend evidenced in 1978, reflecting a move in new investment towards the more labour-intensive industries. </P>
    <P>I would like to parse and analyse that paragraph because it has the air of a paragraph that was written by somebody who had his mind made up in advance when he came to look at the figures and used them in a way which would best justify a certain point of view.</P>
    <P>It is obviously true that several major projects were, as the report makes clear, negotiated during the year.  It is not so very clear why those industries should be excluded from the calculations in relation to fixed asset investment per job.  If we are to exclude the industries which have a high capital ratio, then obviously we will get a situation in which the trend in cost per job will decline.  There is no reason I am aware of why we should exclude things in order to make it easier for us to prove our case.  The IDA may argue that this is a once-off type of investment and that therefore there is a logical reason for excluding it.  I suspect it may well be true that in relation to some of the other industries the initial cost per job is low but the major part of capital investment, especially in very expensive <Col N="1757" /> machinery, may come at a time when the plant has been open for several years. The degree, therefore, to which these industries are labour or capital intensive cannot be estimated adequately until they have been in operation for a number of years and have reached their full running potential.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that there is a move in new investment towards the more labour intensive industries, or if there is such a move that this trend in any sense can be long lived.  When we turned to the trend in average grant costs per job, the problem of the cost of these jobs in foreign-owned industries is even more marked.  The report states:</P>
    <P>The average grant cost in real terms per job approved in new overseas industries increased from £4.998 in 1978 to £7.063 in 1979 prices. </P>
    <P>That is a 75 per cent increase in one year. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>This largely reflects the very stiff international competition encountered in attracting the electronic and mechanical engineering industries. The expected spin-off benefits from these industries should more than offset the extra initial cost. </P>
    <P>We have here a mixture of fact and optimism. I hope, like the IDA, that the optimism is justified, but standing here tonight we have not a guarantee that it will be.</P>
    <P>I have talked about the costs in cash and money terms of the present IDA policy, supported and promoted by the Government.  I would now like to turn to how our present industrial situation has been brought about.  The IDA coin has two sides.  On the one hand it has succeeded in attracting to the country a considerable measure of foreign investment in the electronic and mechanical engineering fields.  Much of this is very modern industry.  I predict it will become more capital than labour intensive in the long run, but it is modern.  It is viable at least for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The other side of the IDA coin is that the older industries here have been allowed to die.  The problems of the old <Col N="1758" /> and dying industries are reflected in the ferocious rate of redundancies and job losses in those traditional industries.  It has been a very hard-hearted policy in many ways.  The Minister and the Government may justify it on the grounds that there were no alternatives, but there are families and whole communities on this island who still wish that the transition from a small and perhaps inefficient but largely nationally-owned industrial base to a larger, more efficient, more profitable, more modern foreign-owned industrial base could be less traumatic for them and for their families.</P>
    <P>In all this, the IDA have been assisted by the tax situation under which the rate of corporate taxation has effectively been reduced almost to nothing.  It has also been assisted by the fact that this country is in a very real sense the only underdeveloped region of the EEC which has its own national Government.  There are many other underdeveloped regions of the EEC looking for grants of one kind or another, infrastructural support and this, that and the other.  Wales, Scotland, Southern Italy and we presume large parts of Greece, Portugal and Spain will be looking for them.  In relation to countries that form part of the EEC at present, when underdeveloped areas look for money from the EEC they must compete with their own Governments.  When the British Government look for money from the EEC for its own purposes and its social fund, in a certain sense what Wales and Scotland are looking for represents a threat to what London is looking for. There are many areas in which the claims of peripheral regions of other EEC countries cannot and will not, for political reasons, be pressed at Brussels with much assiduity.  The situation in Ireland is different. We are, in the entirety of our State, an underdeveloped region so that when the Government go to bargain it is not with an eye cocked over their shoulder to see what, as in the British case, the Welsh and Scots are doing.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech, I was intrigued by what he said and what he did not say.  I was especially intrigued by the reference&mdash;it was so fleeting that I barely caught it&mdash;to new and larger <Col N="1759" /> State industries which he said would be a feature of the scene of the eighties.  We in the Labour Party are delighted to hear that.  It is somewhat at odds with his categoric refusal, in the same speech, to countenance any further major State involvement in industry.  Further on in his speech the Minister itemised five reasons why we had a good chance for the future &mdash;political stability, consistency of policy, modern plant and equipment; a skilful work force and good managers.  He omitted or ignored one of the main reasons why IDA policy has been so successful and that is the fact that the majority of us speak the English language. When we realise the huge bulk of investment that has come from the United States we must also realise that a US investment manager faced with the prospect of locating a plant in this country or in another European country in order to gain access to European markets will most likely come to the conclusion, all other things being equal, that he would prefer to locate in a country where he does not have to set up language courses as well as factories and where managers will be able to communicate directly with the work force without intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The problem about foreign investment is that it is mobile capital.  If it can be moved in, it can be moved out again: and, if world conditions, recessions or trends in the parent countries of these investments cause it to move out, it will move out and leave not a rock behind. We are being short-sighted if we regard the present policy as an adequate basis for industrial development.  I was intrigued by the Minister's reference to the fact that in the 1978-82 industrial development plan 50 per cent of the new jobs should come from within Ireland. He half tried to imply by the fact that only 33 per cent of the jobs at present in industry in Ireland are in foreign-owned firms that the situation is well under control. The former Minister of State.  Deputy Burke, told me not long ago that since 1977 six jobs out of every ten new ones provided have been in foreign-owned industry.  Let us not be fooled by the figure of 33 per cent.  The proportion <Col N="1760" /> is not only high but it is rising despite the targets of the 1978-82 plan.</P>
    <P>I would also enter a <i>caveat</i> in relation to the Minister's praise of the electronics industry.  One of the main features of the new electronics industry is low pay and female employment.  One of the reasons it is able to get away with low pay is that it is able to maintain that the work it is providing has not been previously done by men and, therefore, it can pay women the going rate.  The going rate is very low. No wonder Ireland is a profitable place for foreign industrial development.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to hear the Minister's effrontery in claiming that we have the educational infrastructure for industrial development within days of a report put out by a committee, of which his colleague &mdash; the now Minister for Finance &mdash; is chairman, pointing out that the situation was precisely the opposite and that we have huge shortfalls in the kind of skills that schools, third level colleges and universities should provide and which could produce young people to take up the industrial and mechanical jobs which will be available in the future.  It is not so long since I overheard a very senior personage in the IDA laughingly remark to a senior personage in the Higher Education Authority that perhaps the IDA should allocate some of its funds to the HEA to let the HEA do things they knew have to be done but for which they could not get money from the Department of Education.  The Department have been one of the biggest log-jammers in the drive towards industrial development that the country has ever experienced.</P>
    <P>We need a national development corporation, and views about what it should do will differ.  Deputy Quinn spoke about the possibility of all semi-State bodies being grouped under it.  There is another alternative which deserves thought.  It should act as a goad to every Government Department.  They are all hide-bound by the Victorian tradition of making sure that money is not spent for anything that it was not voted for and saving money wherever possible.  If every Department is to be a development corporation in its own right as Seán Lemass used to say he <Col N="1761" /> wanted the situation to be, they will have to be goaded to the point where they are all busy thinking of ways to spend money whether or not they have it to spend. There are times when money comes on stream for projects and if the projects are not there the money goes away.</P>
    <P>The modern approach to industrial development and social planning is evident in the EEC and is one based on projects.  Projects are on the shelf to create jobs and industries.  If the money is <Col N="1762" /> there they are taken down from the shelf and put into operation.  At present I doubt if many Departments have a shelf and the role of the National Development Corporation would be central in promoting public enterprise through the public Departments of the State.  That is one of the main things they are set up to do and should do but unfortunately it is something they do not do.</P>

      <P>The Minister wrote to me again on 30 January 1980 indicating that there were some difficulties about the title and that he was not in a position to make a decision.  Therefore the Minister was unfair today when he said that all this started with a meeting at Kilgarvan a fortnight ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to divide the parish.  The GAA, the IFA, Macra <Col N="1765" /> na Feirme, the Youth Branch, and the Anglers' Association are all united with the parish priest in their efforts to have a community centre in the parish and they see the old school as an ideal location. It was always the practice of the Board of Works to sell off old schools, particularly in Kerry, to St. Brendan's Trust.  The Minister knows well that St. Brendan's Trust still have an interest in the lease of that school.  When the parish priest and all the organisations have come together in a united front the Minister should take the opportunity, coming up to Christmas, of giving them a Christmas present and acceding to their request.  I would like to hear the Minister say quite positively that he will give the old school to the local community and put an end to the speculation there.  It is known that certain individuals, who are very amenable to the Minister's party, have approached him and it is rumoured down there that those people are about to get the school.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a golden opportunity now to give this small parish a community centre, a community centre that all the organisations that I have referred to will be only too glad to develop and which will do something positive for the parish of Kilgarvan.  In this week before Christmas he should tell them that they can have the school for nothing and let them make their own arrangements with St. Brendan's Trust.  I am quite sure the Minister's esteem will rise in South Kerry. When one Kerryman says that to another a person can be suspicious of it.  The Minister has an opportunity to do something positive for the parish and he should put an end to the speculation and divisiveness.</P>

      <P>The fee simple interest in Kilgarvan former national school is held by the Minister for Education. The premises were used as a national school until 31 August 1979.  The Commissioners of Public Works were informed by the Department of Education in November 1979 that the premises <Col N="1766" /> were no longer required for school purposes. In accordance with normal practice the Commissioners then circulated all Government Departments to ascertain if the premises would be required for State purposes.  The Department of Defence initially expressed an interest in the premises but subsequently indicated in August 1980 that, following investigations, they did not wish to proceed with the acquisition of the property.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the Commissioners have notified the sport and youth section of the Department of Education that this property could be made available for the purposes of An Cospóir.  The Kerry Diocesan Youth Council and the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee were approached regarding the possibility of the premises being made available to them, possibly for use by the local community.  Earlier this month the Commissioners were informed by the Department of Education that the premises were not required by either of those organisations and that the way was now clear for me to decide on the best means of disposing of the property.  Accordingly the commissioners were not in a position to dispose of the State interest in the property to any group before this time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with interest that I have listened to the Deputy pontificating on the sale of the school.  Unlike Deputy Begley during his term of office in the Office of Public Works, I have, in the short time since it became apparent that the property was surplus to State requirements, examined all applications for the use of the property, <Col N="1767" /> including those of his own party and its members.</P>

During his tenure there he was personally responsible for the sale by public treaty of five schools.</P>

When I make a decision I will do so on the basis of facts and merits and not in the interest of political expediency, as the Deputy did before he left office.</P>

      <P>In the case of the competition for cadetships in the executive branch of the service held in 1979, a total of 220 candidates were admitted to the competition and called to a preliminary interview before a board of naval officers.  The number called to the final interview was 77 and, of these, 24 failed to report for the interview, five failed the medical examination, one withdrew before the interview and 47 were actually interviewed. Of the 20 found suitable by the board, two were found ineligible on educational grounds and 12 accepted offers of appointment.</P>

Work has commenced on one of the vessels and work on the other will be carried out when refit of that vessel is due. The machinery and spares situation in relation to these vessels will be surveyed and monitored during the refits.  The <Col N="1522" /> future of the third minesweeper is under consideration in the light of the hull survey report.  No decision has been taken to scrap any of these vessels.

It was decided in 1974 that a further classroom should be provided and the commissioners confirmed in September of that year that the preparation of a revised sketch-scheme was not necessary.</P>
      <P>Confirmation that full planning might proceed on the basis of the agreed revised schedule of accommodation was not received from the school authorities and in June 1979, they submitted revised proposals to my Department.</P>
      <P>Because of the long lapse of time since the original scheme of extension was agreed, it was necessary to reconsider the accommodation requirements of the school in the context of the total requirements of the area.  A report from the Commissioners of Public Works on the feasibility of implementing the revised proposals is awaited.</P>
      <P>Because of the need for additional accommodation pending the provision of permanent accommodation, my Department will agree to the provision of prefabricated accommodation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education why a 52-seater bus is still in operation to transport children from the Tullykyne School area to Moycullen national school after more than 12 months in view of the fact that there is already a cut-back in school transport services; if the expense of this service could be better spent elsewhere; and, if not, why.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no cut-back in the operation of the school transport services. Due to the fact that the large bus in question is also engaged in post-primary transport, there would be no cost saving involved by substituting an existing or new contractor's smaller vehicle for the proposed service from Tullykyne to Moycullen.</P>

      <P>The service which previously operated from Clarinbridge to Gort, with a spur to Ballinabuckey, was encroaching seriously into the Oranmore catchment area and had to be adjusted to operate from Kilcolgan.  Students from south Galway may continue to avail themselves of the catchment boundary concession in the school transport scheme subject to the usual conditions.

      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the number of jobs which might be created if directly competing food imports were supplied by the Irish food industry cannot be quantified with any precision particularly as the consumption of some domestically produced processed goods would be offset in many cases by a decline in the volume of exports.  The net effect on jobs in the Irish food industry in these circumstances could therefore be less than might otherwise be expected.

If the Deputy can give me evidence of any other form of unfair competition, I will of <Col N="1550" /> course do everything possible to protect Irish potato producers.  As far as the price of potatoes is concerned, I understand that the Prices Commission undertake a weekly survey of vegetable prices in an effort to ensure that supplies are available to consumers at reasonable prices.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mac-Sharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following representations from a number of the individuals involved I corresponded with 23 farmers in County Donegal in October last who had their crops of seed potatoes rejected for certification in 1979 under my Department's seed potato certification scheme.  The reason for rejection was the same in all cases &mdash; the crops contained a mixture of the two varieties Pentland Ivory and Pentland Dell.  The foliage of these varieties is very similar and varietal differences are only apparent for a short period during the flowering stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The likely source of the problem has been traced back to a consignment of Nucleus Stock seed potatoes which was distributed from my Department's Potato Research Centre, Raphoe, in 1974.  This particular consignment was multiplied by a small number of specialist seed growers from whom two local merchants purchased a quantity of certified seed potatoes &mdash; produce of the mixed Nucleus Stock &mdash; and subsequently disposed of it in 1979 to the growers with whom I corresponded.  The growers concerned <Col N="1551" /> suffered a considerable loss in having their crops rejected for certification and were forced to dispose of them on the ware market at substantially reduced prices.  While my Department have no legal liability for the losses suffered by the growers, the fact that the Nucleus Stock originated at the potato centre and the produce was subsequently certified by Department personnel, clearly placed a moral obligation on my Department to recompense the growers for loss of income.</P>
    <P>In March last my Department wrote to the two merchants from whom the mixed seed had been purchased and through them offered to replace the seed or, alternatively, to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of an amount equivalent to the cost of replacing it.  This offer was subsequently rejected by a substantial number of the growers involved.  Following a meeting I had in early September with representatives of these growers &mdash; at their request &mdash; I undertook to have the case reviewed. On further examination and following exhaustive inquiries at local level it was considered that the growers concerned had incurred an average loss of £295 per tonne of seed planted.</P>
    <P>No payments have yet been made pending the return of completed forms of indemnity by the growers concerned.  The total amount of the <i>ex gratia</i> payments will be £8,935.50.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not the practice to give details of individuals when replying to questions in the House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will consider granting an increase to the people who received annuities under the old Land Commission annuities scheme for retiring farmers, whose annuities have been fixed at the same amount since the scheme came into operation; and if he will arrange for these annuitants to qualify for free electricity and free television licences in the same way as other old people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mac-Sharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>An annuity payable under the scheme referred to is a fixed sum calculated by reference to actuarial tables based on life expectancy and on the value of the holding sold to the Land Commission. There was no provision in the scheme for the revision of annuities so fixed.  The granting of free electricity and television licences is not a matter for the Minister for Agriculture.  An annuitant under the scheme is of course entitled to have his eligibility for these benefits examined by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

    <P>Note 1: Deaths are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, which is compiled by the World Health Organisation.  The ICD is revised periodically.  Three revisions cover the period 1950 to 1979.  The following are the codes which have been used in the table and the ICD Hevision from which they were derived: 1950: code 204 of the 6th Revision; leukaemia and aleukaemia; 1960 and 1965: code 204 of the 7th revision; leukaemia and aleukaemia; 1970 to 1979: code 204 of the 8th revision; lymphatic leukaemia; code 205 of the 8th revision; myeloid leukaemia</P>
    <P>Note 2: The 6th and 7th ICD revisions did not contain separate codes for myelogenous and lymphatic leukaemia and it is not possible to provide separate figures for 1950, 1960 and 1965.</P>
    <P>Note 3: Because of the different ICD revisions which were used the figures for 1950 are not directly comparable with those for 1960 and 1965 which, in turn, are not directly comparable with the figures for 1970 to 1979.</P>

      <P>The provision of accommodation for the person referred to is primarily a matter for the North-Easten Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made from the board and the position is that the girl was discharged in June 1980, from St Mary's, Delvin which is a residential centre for mentally handicapped children, upon reaching the upper age limit of 17.  At that time a place was offered her in St Peter's Hospital, Castlepollard, which is a residential centre for adult mentally handicapped persons administered by the Midland Health Board.  I understand that her parents declined this offer.  This person's name has subsequently been put on waiting lists for two residential centres for the female mentally handicapped, one in Dublin and the other in Monasterevan. I understand, however, that it may be some considerable time before a vacancy arises for the girl in either of these centres.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>With a view to ensuring that candidates have attained a certain standard of education, the qualifications prescribed for the recruitment grade of clerical officer in the health board service require candidates to have obtained at least Grade D, or a Pass, in at least five subjects in the leaving certificate examination or have passed an examination of equivalent standard.  The qualifications directed for the assistant staff officer grade require honours leaving certificate standard.  The leaving certificate has not been prescribed for other posts under health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with directions given under section 14 of the Health Act, 1970, chief executive officers of health boards in arranging for the selection of a candidate <Col N="1567" /> or candidates to be appointed or of the candidates to be placed in order of merit on a panel shall do so by means of a selection procedure appropriate to the appointment being made.  In relation to the selection of candidates for clerical officer posts the selection procedure used by the North Western Health Board is that candidates who obtain a certain standard in the leaving certificate, or equivalent, examination are called for interview and a panel is formed based on the results of the interview board.  This selection procedure is similar to that used by the other health boards.  I understand that the North Western Health Board received a very large number of applications in a competition they are now holding for the appointment of clerical officers. Results obtained in examinations other than the leaving certificate, or equivalent, would of course be taken into account at the interview stage.  I have had inquiries made with the North Western Health Board regarding a competition currently in progress for the appointment of clerical officers under that board.  I am informed that the board did receive an application from a person holding the higher national diploma certificate in business studies awarded by the Ulster Polytechnic in Armagh and that this candidate has been called for interview.  I understand also that the health board received an application from a student pursuing a course in business studies but he was not called for interview based on his examination results.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the selection procedures used by the health boards in selecting candidates for posts such as clerical officer, which are aimed mainly at school-leavers are appropriate and I have no proposals to change the existing arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any increase in the rate of refusal of unemployment benefit from married women or any other category of claimants on grounds of unavailability for work.</P>
      <P>The question of whether a claimant satisfies the requirement of being available for but unable to obtain work is a matter for decision in each particular case.  The fact that employment is not available in an area does not necessarily mean that claimants in that area must be regarded as being available for work. Claimants can be unavailable for work for a number of reasons either because they are not genuinely interested in seeking employment or because they would not be free to take up employment if it were offered to them.</P>
      <P>Each case is decided by a statutorily appointed deciding officer in the light of its own particular merits.  A claimant who is dissatisfied with the decision in his or her case has the right of appeal to an appeals officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the person concerned was not entitled to unemployment assistance was that the value of his means, derived from his father's farm on which he is employed, exceeds the statutory limit for entitlement in his case.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals on hand for new regulations regarding unemployment assistance.  As indicated, however, in a reply of 19 November 1980 to a question from Deputy O'Keeffe, certain improvements in the making of assessments of board and lodging of persons claiming unemployment assistance were introduced on 2 April 1980 following a review of the operation of this aspect of the scheme.  As a result of these improvements the assessment of board and lodgings of a person living at home does not normally exceed 12½ per cent of the nett family income of the household and may often be considerably less.</P>
      <P>This limit is not appropriate, however, where the person concerned is participating in the working of a farm or business and consequently entitled as a right to a return for this participation and it did not apply in the case of the person referred to in the question.  This, however, made no difference to the claimant since the application of the new limit would still not have entitled him to assistance due to the substantial nature of his father's holding and the income derived from it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are areas of South Tipperary where the free travel scheme does not operate either because of the absence of public transport or the unwillingness of private bus operators in those areas to participate in the scheme. My Department has been in touch with <Col N="1576" /> all private operators in the State with a view to ensuring their participation in the scheme.  On a number of occasions in recent years my Department wrote to a private bus operator in South Tipperary inviting him to participate in the scheme but these invitations were not accepted. Nevertheless I have again instructed my Department to invite all such private bus operators who provide regular scheduled services on a year round basis to reconsider participation in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to operate the free travel scheme in areas not catered for by bus and rail services and I cannot, of course, compel any bus operator to provide a service under the free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>I should, however, mention that persons in such areas may, if their means are not sufficient to meet their travel needs, qualify for assistance with their special travel costs under the Health or Supplementary Welfare Allowances Acts as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The provision of an estimate of the number of people in South Tipperary who do not at present benefit from the free transport scheme is not, I regret to say, feasible in view of the fact that records are not kept on a geographical basis.</P>

      <P>The reasons that the person concerned is disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance is that his means were assessed at £17.70 weekly and as this amount exceeds the maximum rate of £16.45, unemployment assistance is not payable in his case.  The assessment of the claimant's means was based on the value which he derives from the farm on which he resides.

      <P>Social welfare schemes, in common with all other public schemes, are subject to a degree of abuse and exploitation which it will never be possible to eliminate entirely.  Control procedures have been reviewed and tightened where necessary and the cadre of the Department has been strengthened in those areas which are most vulnerable to abuse.

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 1 August 1974 to 31 May 1975.  He was not entitled to payment from 2 June 1975 to 5 June 1976 as he had less than the statutory minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year, 1974, which governed claims for disability benefit in the benefit year 1975-76.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the disallowance of benefit <Col N="1584" /> he ceased to submit medical certificates until 17 November 1977.  Payment of disability benefit was then made from 17 November 1977 to 18 January 1978, when this title to benefit was exhausted on the completion of the 52 weeks payment to which he was entitled as a person having less than the 156 paid employment contributions required to qualify for payment beyond that period.</P>
    <P>The contributions outstanding in respect of his employment from 1 September 1967 to 31 October 1972 were collected by my Department on 5 September 1978 and payment of disability benefit was resumed from that date. These contributions could only be treated as paid at the proper times for the purpose of any right to benefit prior to the date of collection if the failure to pay or the delay in payment was shown not to have been with the consent or connivance of or attributable to any negligence on the part of the insured person.</P>
    <P>It has been ascertained that the person in this case failed to give an insurance card to his employer during the period of his employment even though he was aware that employment contributions were not being paid on his behalf.  In the circumstances the contributions for which payment was received on 5 September 1978 could not be regarded as having been paid on any date prior to that date.

      <P>The fisheries research vessel which I referred to in my reply of 26 March 1980 is similar to the one named in the article specified.</P>
      <P>However, there are a number of inaccuracies in the description of the vessel, the most significant of which concerns the length of the vessel which will, in fact, be the same as the prototype, 157 feet approximately.  The article is misleading in other respects.  The vessel concerned is of a very successful Norwegian design and will differ from the six vessels of the class already in service only in that certain items of equipment and internal layout will be modified in accordance with specific Irish requirements.  Facilities on board will be made available to certain agencies such as the National Board of Science and Technology to the maximum extent possible having regard to departmental requirements.  The vessel will be equipped primarily for fishery related biological, environmental and oceanographic research.

The Government have decided that subject to satisfactory negotiation of contract terms and delivery dates, the building contract will be placed with Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited.  Negotiations have begun with a view to commencement of building in early 1981 and entry into service in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vessel will have an overall length <Col N="1588" /> of 47.5 m., will be approximately 500 gross registered tons and fitted with a 1,500 BHP engine.  The design provides for accommodation for 14 crew and up to eight scientific staff.  The vessel is capable of operations of up to 21 days duration.</P>
    <P>The vessel will be operated by a civilian crew under the control of my Department. No fishery protection role is envisaged and consequently its management by the Naval Service is not contemplated.</P>

      <P>I have directed the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department to undertake a review of arrangements for game shooting and particularly deer stalking at State forests.  I have, in the meantime, as a precautionary measure suspended all licences to hunt deer on State forest lands.</P>
      <P>Hunting arrangements on State forest lands are kept under review and many areas have already been declared no shooting areas.  In many other areas including the forest at which the accident occurred, the licence required that twenty four hours notice of the intention to shoot should be given by the licensees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Foresty (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated in reply to previous questions by the Deputy that the chemical 245-T in the formulation used by my Department poses no threat to man or his environment and conforms to the safety requirements of the FAO and WHO organisations.  I do not, therefore, accept the implications in his question regarding the danger of using the chemical for the control of woody weeds in the forest.  So far as the specific matters raised by the Deputy are concerned the following is the information sought.</P>
      <P> (a)  Approximately 3,000 litres of the chemical were used in State forests in the past year the value of which would be of the order of £7,000.</P>
      <P>(b)  About 6,400 litres costing £15,000 approximately are held by the Forest and Wildlife Service at present.</P>
      <P>(c)  There is no 245-T on order at present as stocks are adequate. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to state that forest workers are required to handle and discharge 245-T without protection.  Protective clothing is made available to forest workers using all non-hazardous chemicals, including 245-T.  Goggles are also provided for use when mixing the concentrate. I am not aware of any case where a forest worker was requested to handle the chemical without the provision of adequate protective clothing.  Neither am I aware of any instance of disciplinary action arising from a worker's refusal to handle 245-T or any other chemical.  If the Deputy has information to the contrary on either of these matters <Col N="1591" /> and makes it available to me I will arrange to have an investigation carried out.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing measures in operation in my Department for the safety and health of forest workers are adequate.  A copy of these instructions was forwarded to the Deputy on 9 May 1980.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the present cargo rates charged by Aer Lingus between Ireland and the United States.  Such rates are subject to my approval and in examining applications by the airlines for increases in rates, I take into account, among other things, the need for Ireland-U.S. rates to be set at levels which will make them economically viable while remaining attractive to the customer.  The market is in a very depressed state at present and the Aer Lingus transatlantic cargo services are not profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, Aer Lingus operated B-707 freighter services twice weekly between London, Shannon and New York.  Due to the fiercely competitive situation in the US-UK cargo market extremely low rates prevail on these routes.  One result of this <Col N="1606" /> has been that in the last year Aer Lingus have reduced their London-Shannon-New York freighter service from two flights per week to one.  For this service Aer Lingus must use the UK-US level of rates for consignments originating in or destined for London, which form the bulk of traffic.  Aer Lingus consider that, despite the low level of rates prevailing, the traffic contributes to the overall economics of their freighter service and is a factor in their ability to continue to offer the service.  It would be impossible to offer any transatlantic freight service if the Irish rates were to be reduced to the UK level.</P>

      <P>In June 1978 the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council made a special amenity area order for that part of Dublin Bay within their functional area.  The Order was submitted to me for confirmation in accordance with the provisions of sections 43 of the 1963 Planning Act.  As objections made to the order have not been withdrawn a public inquiry must be held before a decision on the confirmation of the order can be made.  The area to which the order relates adjoins the area of Dublin Bay for which Dublin <Col N="1609" /> Corporation have made a special amenity area order and which was the subject of a lengthy public inquiry.  I hope to finalise consideration of that order shortly.  As the action to be taken on the Dublin Corporation order will have implications for the entire area of Dublin Bay, it is not proposed to proceed with consideration of the Dún Laoghaire order until consideration of the Dublin Corporation order has been finalised.</P>

      <P>Details of the numbers of deaths and injuries resulting from road accidents, together with analyses of the contributory factors involved are published annually in the Foras Forbartha Report <i>Road Accident Facts, 1979.</i> Similar details regarding Northern Ireland are published in the Royal Ulster Constabulary's <i>Road Traffic Accident Report 1979.</i> Copies of these reports are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>Action is being taken here on a number of fronts to reduce the level of deaths and injuries on our roads.  The objectives of the Road Development Plan, to which the Government are committed, include the elimination of accident black spots, and the provision of adequate signs and markings.  The anti drunk-driving measures provided in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978, have enabled the Garda to take vigorous action to deal with the menace of the drinking driver. Regulations were introduced in 1979 making compulsory the wearing of safety belts in the front seats of cars and of crash helmets on motor cycles.</P>
      <P>Future action in relation to road safety will include:</P>
      <P> (1)  The introduction by 1 January 1983, of compulsory roadworthiness testing of heavy goods vehicles, large public service vehicles, buses and ambulances, and as soon as possible of private cars.</P>
      <P>(2)  Continuation of driver control measures which are aimed at or which contribute to road safety including the licensing of drivers, the driving test, which is well up to international standards, and the certificate of fitness which applies to persons over 70 years of age, to persons with serious disabilities seeking a driving licence and to persons seeking a licence to drive a bus.</P>
      <P>(3)  Continued support for the National Road Safety Association which has responsibility for road safety education and publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Continued support for roads research work which provides a valuable base for the formulation and implementation of policy in relation to road planning and construction, the improvement <Col N="1613" /> of traffic management and the promotion of road safety.</P>
    <P>The organisation and implementation of road safety campaigns is a function of the National Road Safety Association, which is representative of a wide range of interests, including the local authorities, the Garda, motoring bodies and youth organisations.  The association have organised a winter campaign, which will extend over Christmas and into the New Year, highlighting pedestrian and cyclist safety and the menace of drinking and driving.  At the association's request, and with the co-operation of Radio Telefís Éireann, I will be making a special appeal on television for extra care on the roads over the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>Group schemes in County Galway have been installing piped water in about 1,000 houses or more each year since 1977.  In 1979, 1,064 grants were paid for group schemes in County Galway &mdash; this was the second highest total for any county in the country.</P>
      <P>The level of group schemes activity in County Galway continues at a high level in the current year.  At 30 September 1980: 34 schemes were designed to serve 1,050 houses; work was in progress on 59 schemes to install water in over 3,400 houses and for which 2,700 grants approximately have been paid; 190 schemes had been fully completed which serve over 5,650 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC have adopted new measures for FEOGA aid to the western counties. If the programme submitted to the Commission by the Department of Agriculture is approved, I hope to be in a position early in 1981 to announce substantially increased grants for group <Col N="1614" /> water schemes in the western area.  This should give a further boost to group scheme activity in County Galway.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the importance of regional water schemes in facilitating further group water scheme development in the county.  These regional schemes must however, be considered in the context of the overall resources available for the sanitary services programme, the need to conserve available capital for schemes of the highest priority and the number of fully approved schemes in progress or getting to construction for which adequate finance must be provided.  In this connection, I would point out that six sanitary services schemes in County Galway, involving a total investment of more than £3 million, have been fully approved since 1977 and that the total capital allocation for major schemes in the county was £1.466 million in 1977 and has risen to £2.501 million in 1980.  Only two of the six schemes mentioned have yet reached construction stage and two are at tender stage.</P>

      <P>Survey sheets in respect of 20 householders willing to participate in this scheme were received in my Department in October, 1977.</P>
      <P>The Department's group scheme inspector for the area secured permission for the group to connect to the Leap Regional Water Scheme and this was confirmed by Cork County Council in February, 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group were advised to have a design prepared but no design has so far been submitted to my Department.  In February 1980 the group scheme inspector reported that only 13 out of the 20 houses in the area were participating in the scheme and that provisional costings indicated that the scheme would be uneconomic. In March 1980 Cork County Council proposed to make a special contribution of £14,500 to the group scheme. In July 1980 the Department informed the council that, in view of the small size of the scheme and having regard to the limited funds available, they could not approve the special contribution.  It was suggested to the council that the scheme be deferred pending the introduction of the proposed new grant structure under the regulation adopted by the EEC for a &ldquo;Common Measure&rdquo; of the improvement of public amenities, including rural water supplies, in 13 western counties. The parts of West Cork to which the regulation applies include the area in <Col N="1616" /> question.  I am hopeful that the programme submitted to the EEC Commission will be approved in the near future and that this will facilitate increased participation by householders in the area and make the economics of the scheme more attractive.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any delay in the issue of housing loan approvals due to the lack of finance by Cork County Council.  I am informed by the council that, in the period 1 January to 12 December 1980 887 loan approvals valued at £9.9 million were issued.  The council propose to approve a further 26 loans valued at £258,000 before the end of December to bring the total number of loans approved during the year to 913 with a value of £10.16 million.  This compares with 796 loans valued at £6.72 million approved in 1979.</P>

It is not yet possible to indicate the number who actually obtained employment up to December this year but the school leavers surveys carried out by the National Manpower Service and reports of the Association of Irish University Careers and Appointments' Services show that the vast majority of school leavers entering the labour market after any particular school year find employment early in the following calendar year.</P>

      <P>(a) and (c): Based on information available to the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, the best estimate for the number of firms engaged in manufacturing industries which closed since the beginning of 1977 to the end of November <Col N="1628" /> 1980 is 175 and the approximate number of jobs lost because of these closures is 11,255.  Reliable data is not available on the service sector.</P>
      <P>(b)  The number of persons on systematic short-time working registered at local employment offices at the end of November 1980 was 8,229.</P>
      <P>(d)  The estimate for job losses in manufacturing for the period from end 1980 to end 1981 is 16,000, a figure which covers job losses arising from closures and for other reasons.  From past experience, the major element will be temporary reductions in employment in firms experiencing short term difficulties.</P>
      <P>(e)  I do not accept the inference in the last part of the Deputy's question.  While the general world economic recession and its domestic repercussions are offsetting the number of new jobs created by exceptional high job losses, firm Government action is being taken.  For example, measures to assist firms to maintain their employment levels have been strengthened and are being co-ordinated by a group comprising representatives of the Departments of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Labour and Agriculture, the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Credit Company and CTT.  In addition, extra finance is being made available to Fóir Teoranta for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that there are a number of welcome developments indicating that the worst of the recession is over.  For example, the increase in the numbers unemployed between the end of October and end November was much lower than in previous months when seasonal factors are taken into account.  Again, new jobs created and job approvals are at a much higher level than in the period immediately following the first oil price shock in 1974.</P>
      <P>Existing Government investment and economic promotion policies, and their results, are directed towards the achievement of high levels of job creation.  The Government intend to publish shortly an Investment Plan for 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the Government has devised new measures, involving additional expenditure of £97 million this year, which should develop our future <Col N="1629" /> employment creation capacity.  A major element consists of additions to the provisions for infrastructure in the public capital programme.  Aside from the immediate contribution to employment, the strenghthening of the country's productive and infrastructural base should add significantly to our employment-creation capacity in future years.</P>
    <P>Additional measures to attract new industry here will include the purchase of sites and vacant factories, the construction of advance factories and intensified promotional activity by the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>I would again repeat the importance of buying Irish.  In this connection, a working party, which has been set up under the Chairmanship of Deputy Dennis Gallagher, Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, has drawn up an action programme and already initiated measures to intensify the use of domestic products and services.  New measures to promote export have also been drawn up by CTT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC-assisted schemes that exist for the <Col N="1630" /> promotion of employment mainly among young people are: &mdash; Environmental Improvement Schemes Programme &mdash; Temporary Grants Scheme for Youth Employment &mdash; Work Experience Programme &mdash; Employment Incentive Scheme.</P>
      <P>The schemes are financed initially by moneys voted by the Exchequer and all receive aid from the European Social Fund within agreed limits.  In addition the Temporary Grants Scheme for Youth Employment and the Environmental Improvements Scheme received contributions this year from the Employment Guarantee Fund.  The Environmental Improvements Scheme also received a contribution from the Inner City Fund.</P>
      <P>Level of employment achieved is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Environmental Improvements Schemes Programme &mdash; 2,130 (man-years' employment), 1978 to 1980 (to date).</P>
      <P>Temporary Grants Scheme for Youth Employment &mdash; 1,494 (man-years' employment), 1977 to 1980 (to date).</P>
      <P>Work Experience Programme &mdash; 3,456 (man-years' employment), 1977 to 1980 (to date).</P>
      <P>Employment Incentive Scheme &mdash; 12,000 (young persons involved), 1977 to 1980 (to date).</P>
      <P>The schemes are reviewed annually.  A decision regarding any possible extensions in 1981 will be made when the various Departments' budgetary proposals are being considered.  In addition, the European Social Fund provides assistance for vocational training programmes for young persons as follows:&mdash;Community Youth Training Programme; Career Training Programme; Apprenticeship Training Programme; Pre-Employment Courses; Courses for Middle-Level Technician and Secretarial Skills.</P>

      <P>Sponsors of projects approved for assistance under the AnCo Community Youth Training Programme are required to employ a foreman and receive a contribution from AnCo to cover the costs incurred in this regard.  The sponsors are advised by AnCo at the outset of their responsibilities as employers, in particular in so far as those relate to compliance with the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>In addition unemployed workers, including tradesmen and skilled labourers, are offered training opportunities with AnCo designed to expand or update their skills.  This may include a period of experience on an outside project run under the AnCO Community Youth Training Programme.  While in the AnCO system these trainees receive a weekly training allowance.  They are insured for occupational injuries under section 16 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1967 and are given &ldquo;credits&rdquo; to preserve whatever entitlement they may have accumulated to unemployment benefit as provided by the Social Welfare (Contributions) (Amendment) Regulations, 1968.  As trainees are not employed by AnCO the question of entitlement to redundancy payments does not arise.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1633" /> have been informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the burning of anthracite of the kind available from the coal mine at Rossmore, for the generation of electricity, is not possible in any of the existing ESB power stations, and that in any case, because this anthracite is high grade, such a use would not be the most economic use of fuels.</P>
      <P>More generally, in regard to any deposits of low grade coal and anthracite and, in particular, deposits in the Leinster coal fields, the ESB, in the coming year, will be constructing a test boiler in the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, to test such deposits as a fuel for generation of electricity.  The test boiler is being partly funded by the EEC and considerable development work will be needed to determine whether a plant can be designed that would successfully burn these coals.</P>
      <P>The ESB have also informed me that the total area of the Leinster coal fields will be analysed and tested and that any other sizeable deposits of coal will be investigated.  However, it could be some years before it is known whether a power station burning such fuels is possible.</P>

      <P>In the course of discussions with the Electricity Supply Board on future policy, I have indicated to the board that our electricity generation planning should be on the assumption of decreasing availability of primary energy from traditional external sources.  Among the alternative or supplementary energy sources under development by Government agencies, biomass is one with the most immediate potential.  The Electricity Supply Board have been active in promoting and participating in the national and international programmes to develop the use of renewable timber fuels.  Successful tests <Col N="1634" /> of the use of timber wastes have already been carried out in the Cahirciveen Power Station.  Further tests using thinnings from forests will shortly commence.</P>
      <P>I also propose to pursue the possibility of timber briquette production based on forest thinnings as the raw material but these products would be primarily aimed at the domestic market.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of a monopoly position in the importation of coal in the sense that there are not, to my knowledge, any regulations or import controls which would preclude interested persons from engaging in the coal trade.</P>
      <P>It is well known however that, largely as a result of developments in the trade over the past decade or so, some areas are served by a single importer.  This is a development outside my control but I should make it clear that interested parties, who have the necessary resources and facilities available to them, are at all times free to engage in the importation of coal.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a recent question by another Deputy, the statutory procedures for investigating the public interest aspects of the present importation and general trading arrangements are not within my area of responsibility. I should mention, however, that my Department's close monitoring of the coal trade has given me no reason to believe that any difficulties experienced in the past by consumers could be primarily attributed to abuse of a monopoly position.  In the circumstances which I have outlined there does not appear, at the present time, to be either scope or justification for formal, official intervention in the matter.  This is not to say that the position does not need to be considered in the broader context of energy supply policy.  While there are, for instance in the Dublin area, no formal constraints on new entrants to the coal importing business, there are practical difficulties of considerable proportions. I have a concern in these broader implications and the situation will continue to have my attention.</P>

      <P>The ESB have also informed me that, in the main, single to three phase convertors have little application to motor loads below three horse power.  The vast majority of electric motors used on farms are below three horse power.</P>
      <P>The conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing advice is that the allocation of funds for the purpose mentioned by the Deputy would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>When investigating low voltage complaints the board has frequently found that customers have installed additional electrical load without prior consultation with local ESB staff as to the adequacy of networks in the area to cater for such load.  It would be advisable that people should always consult the ESB about proposed additional electrical installations.</P>

      <P>I have no immediate plans to pipe Kinsale gas to the west of Ireland.  The economic <Col N="1637" /> rationale for extending the Cork system would be to capture premium gas markets of substantial size and I have, therefore, given priority to the detailed examination of the feasibility of piping Kinsale gas to the established premium market in the Dublin area.  Given the need to make the best use of available indigenous fuels, the target markets for Kinsale gas must, in the first instance, be the premium domestic, commercial and institutional cooking and heating loads.  The exploitation, in the initial stages, of large available markets such as these not only provide the optimum economic basis on which to finance the extension of the gas system but it is also the most efficient use of the gas in energy terms.</P>
      <P>I would not rule out the possibility of further expansion of the gas distribution system in the event of the Cork-Dublin pipeline proving economically viable. The development of a gas distribution system in the west of Ireland would be given full consideration in such a context, as indeed would all other areas.</P>

      <P>Whilst I am very conscious of the unemployment situation in County Donegal, I would not agree with the Deputy's claim that there is a lack of employment opportunities in the areas mentioned.  Industrial employment in Donegal rose by over 20 per cent in the the period January 1977 to January 1980.</P>

To date, the IDA has approved industrial projects with the potential to create 2,017 jobs for these town groups.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority, which is paying special attention to the Waterford area, that it has approved more than 6,600 new grant-aided jobs for the area since January 1978.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 321 and 322 together.</P>
      <P>Consumer complaints, in so far as they impinge on my Department's activities, come under three headings:</P>
      <P> (a)  The consumer protection section of my Department deals with complaints under the Sale of Goods legislation. These would be mainly disputes concerning allegedly defective goods and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The Director of Consumer Affairs, whose office was created by the Consumer Information Act, 1978, deals with complaints under that Act. These are concerned mainly with misleading <Col N="1642" /> advertisements and false and misleading trade descriptions.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards deals with complaints regarding the safety of products, and also gives technical advice on product standards and quality.  </P>
    <P>Each of these agencies is doing excellent work in helping the public with complaints about the supply of goods and services.  Nevertheless I have felt for some time that their various roles may need to be rationalised.  Proposals for a uniform system of helping consumers with complaints, with the Director of Consumer Affairs as its focal point are under consideration and I have already arranged that, with effect from 1 January 1981, the director will handle the type of consumer complaints currently being dealt with within my Department.</P>
    <P>The handling of consumer complaints within the Department has been only one of the many responsibilities of the consumer protection section.  For this reason, it is not possible to be specific as to the allocation of resources to that part of the section's work related to consumer complaints.</P>
    <P>From 1 July 1980 to date, a total of 2,386 complaints were received in my Department; a record was not kept of the number of complaints received in 1979 or in the first half of 1980.</P>
    <P>The institute is continuing to receive consumer complaints from the general public.  Only in a small number of cases does a complaint require the issue of an independent technical report.</P>

      <P>In reply to a previous question on 31 May 1978, my predecessor informed the Deputy that tests were being carried out to ascertain the nature and quality of sample rock phosphate material yielded by drilling and other field work in the north Clare area.  Following receipt of the results of these tests the Clare phosphate working group recommended the engagement of consultants to assess the economic viability of the phosphate deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report furnished by the consultants indicated that some four million tons of phosphate rock, spread over four separate locations, has been delineated in north Clare.  However, the deposits are of relatively low grade ore, and the consultants have advised that anticipation revenues from the sale of the material, relative to extraction costs, would not be such as to enable the deposits to be developed on a viable basis for industrial usage, such as in chemical or fertiliser <Col N="1649" /> manufacture.  The question of further exploration work in the area, aimed at possibly locating larger, high-grade deposits, is being examined at present.</P>

All the National Building Agency Houses were constructed during the decade 1960-1970 and the Office of Public Works accommodation was constructed during the following periods: (a) before 1920, 105; (b) 1920-1930, 153; (c) 1930-1940, 70; (d) 1940-1950, 37; (e) 1950-1960, 32; (f) 1960-1970, 98; (g) 1970-1980, 58; (h) 1980 to date, 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rent charged for the various types of married accommodation has been agreed with the Garda Representative Associations and depends on factors such as the rank of the member occupying the accommodation, the size of the dwelling, its structural condition, its amenities, and <Col N="1650" /> location whether or not it is attached to the garda station or detached.  The rent payable at present in respect of married accommodation ranges from £7.05 per week to £2.35 per week.</P>
    <P>Approximately 7,000 members of the Garda Síochána are married.</P>
    <P>As applications are usually made by members for a specified house, when it becomes available, it is not possible to state exactly how many married gardaí are awaiting official accommodation but the Garda authorities estimate that the number is in the region of 30.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of an allowance to gardaí who provide their own houses, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to Deputy Keating on 27 November which referred to means of facilitating the purchasing of homes by members of the Garda Síochána.  In addition, rent allowance of £741.43 per annum for married members and £556.07 per annum for single members is payable to all members of the Force up to and including the rank of Chief Superintendent, irrespective of whether they occupy official accommodation.</P>
    <P>At present, a total of 15 married quarters is occupied by people other than the Gardaí.  In eight of these cases the quarters are occupied by ex-members of the Force and in the remaining seven they are occupied by the families of deceased members.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the press release issued in relation to this matter on 25 September 1980, the text of which is given below.  A working group has been set up under the aegis of the Department of Transport to undertake the evaluation of all the relevant aspects mentioned in the press release and that work is proceeding.</P>
      <P>The following is the text of the press release:</P>
      <P>Approval for Co. Mayo Airport</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> Mr. Padraig Flynn, T. D., Minister of State at the Department of Transport, has announced approval in principle for the development of an airport in Co. Mayo to cater for current and future Western needs, including particularly pilgrimage traffic for Knock Shrine.  Mr. Flynn made this announcement after a meeting with a deputation led by Monsignor James P. Horan, Parish Priest of Knock, Co. Mayo, in connection with proposals for the development of airport facilities to serve Knock and the Connaught region generally.</P>
    <P>The deputation was accompanied by Mr. K. Holden of Transport Analysis International Ltd., Shannon, whose company had carried out an assessment of the feasibility of developing a Regional Airport to serve Connaught.</P>
    <P>As a result of earlier discussions between the Minister of State, Mr. Flynn, and Monsignor Horan, representatives from the Technical Services of the Department of Transport had visited Mayo and carried out preliminary inspections of a number of sites which had been identified locally as being suitable for airport development purposes.  The meeting reviewed the outcome of these technical inspections and went on to discuss broader issues affecting the cost and viability of the project.  Further detailed examination of these aspects is to be undertaken in order to establish the nature of the facilities to be provided and the scale of operations that would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Mr. Flynn said that he was extremely pleased to be in a position to convey this approval in principle and he congratulated Monsignor Horan and the other members of the deputation who had undertaken the preliminary work.  He was satisfied that the development of the proposed airport would confer significant benefits on the region in terms of industrial development, the growth of pilgrimage traffic to Knock and the facilitation of tourism in Mayo and the adjoining counties.  It would represent a major step in the improvement of accessibility to the West of Ireland which had been handicapped in the past by transport and communications difficulties.  He believed that <Col N="1665" /> with the continued increase in our population and the resumption and acceleration of economic growth and taking account also of the tremendous potential for mariculture development along the western seaboard, there would be an increased role in the future for air services to regional centres, with connections to the three existing international airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork.</P>

Allocations made to Meath County Council arising out of these extra provisions were set out in the reply to the Deputy's Question No. 430 of 9 December 1980.</P>

      <P>As a preliminary remark, I should point out that employers are not obliged to notify job losses.</P>
      <P>It will help to put the information in perspective if I indicate generally the position as regards the creation and maintenance of employment.  Job creation is running at an exceptionally high level but the full effects are being offset by job losses caused mainly by the general world economic recession.  Government action is being taken to maintain as many jobs as possible.  The measures being taken include the activities of Fóir Teoranta, for whom extra finance has been made available and the IDA rescue service.  A group comprising representatives of the Departments of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Labour and Agriculture, the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Credit Company and CTT has been set up to co-ordinate activities. Government programmes to stimulate new job creation include the purchase of sites and vacant factories, the construction of advance factories, intensified industrial promotional activities by the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta, the activities of Córas Tráchtála, AnCO and the National Manpower Service and additions to the provisions for infrastructure in the public capital programme.</P>
      <P>The best information on job losses in manufacturing industry is that available to the IDA.  The following table gives figures for gross job losses for manufacturing industry for the years since 1975, the earliest date for which information is available.</P>

    <P>Notified redundancies, as defined above, for the first 11 months of the year were 7,667 in manufacturing and 5,883 in non-manufacturing.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to give a reliable estimate of the net job situation in manufacturing industry by the end of 1980; Whatever gross figure emerges for job losses will fall to be offset by the IDA performance.  This includes some 35,000 job approvals in 1980 and the expected <Col N="1669" /> creation in the year of about 15,000 first-time grant-aided jobs.</P>
    <P>As regards a breakdown of job losses between those accounted for by redundnacy and other reasons, I would estimate that for manufacturing industry about a third are accounted for by redundancy. The other main reason is workers leaving their jobs and not being immediately replaced, which has always been a feature of business activity.</P>
