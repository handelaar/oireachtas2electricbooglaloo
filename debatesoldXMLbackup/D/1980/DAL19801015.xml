      <P>: Tairgim go dtoghfar láithreach an Teachta Pádraig Ó Fachtna chun bheith in a Cheann Comhairle de thuras na huaire de réir na Buan-Orduithe. Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl mar eolas don Dáil gur thairg an Teachta Ó Fachtna éirigh as oifig mar Chomhalta den Rialtas agus gur ghlac an tUachtarán, ag gníomhú dó ar mo chomhairle, an tairiscint sin le héifeacht ón 15ú lá de Dheireadh Fómhair, 1980.</P>
      <P>I move that Deputy Pádraig Faulkner be forthwith elected Ceann Comhairle for the time being pursuant to Standing Orders.  I might add, for the information of the Dáil, that Deputy Faulkner has tendered his resignation as a member of the Government and that on my advice the President has accepted the resignation with effect from today.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: Members of the Oireachtas learned with profound regret of the death on 13 July of the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Joe Brennan.  Deputy Joe Brennan brought to the high office of Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann a long practical experience of parliamentary and political work, together with a kind and genial personality, a ready wit and an unfailing sense of humour.  His wide circle of friends in both Houses of the Oireachtas is a tribute to his great humanity, his understanding and his generous spirit.</P>
      <P>The task of Ceann Comhairle is never an easy one.  It calls for patience and skill and for a thorough knowledge and understanding of parliamentary practice and procedures.  All of these qualities Deputy Joe Brennan had in the highest degree and his wish to uphold the dignity and traditions of the House and to be fair and courteous to every Member was appreciated by all.  A Member of this House for 29 years, he served with distinction in a number of different offices&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Defence, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Joe Brennan was a family man, a man of great kindness and deep compassion, a man whose first concern was to help his fellow man and to give guidance and assistance to those most in need. <Col N="4" /> While this House has suffered a grevious loss through the death of such a highly respected and greatly esteemed Ceann Comhairle, the loss suffered by his own people in County Donegal is greater still. No public representative has ever served his constituents with a greater sense of dedication or with a more selfless spirit of public service.  It is as such, I am sure, that Deputy Joe Brennan will always be remembered by the people of Donegal.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfaí omós a thabhairt do Seosamh Ó Braonáin gan an tsuim mhór a bhí aige i nithe Gaelacha a lua, go háirithe sa teanga féin.  Ba Ghael go smior é. Beidh sé inár gcuimhne.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to join with me in a tribute to a great Irishman and an eminent and distinguished Member of this House.  I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to the late Ceann Comhairle's widow and family whose loss is greatest of all the deepest sympathy of the Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Go dtuga Dia na glóire gach sólás dóibh in a mbrón agus in a mbris agus suaimhneas síorraí d'anam an uasail dílis atá imithe uainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I would like to join in the tribute which has been eloquently paid by the Taoiseach to the late Deputy Joseph Brennan and to express to his family and friends our very sincere sympathy in their loss.  In office as a Minister and in Opposition as his party's spokesman, Deputy Brennan was always most conscientious and invariably behaved towards his political opponents with a courtesy which did him great credit.  During his years in the difficult office of Ceann Comhairle while we on this side of the House sometimes incurred his displeasure&mdash;and sometimes, perhaps, deservedly so&mdash;he conducted the Chair with dignity and good humour and never allowed words spoken by others in moments of excitement to prejudice him against them.  We all valued and enjoyed the dry wit for which he will be long remembered and we respected the high conception of this House and its dignity <Col N="5" /> which he held.  In his death County Donegal has lost a most worthy and devoted representative, his party a formidable and tireless warrior and Members of this House a popular and esteemed colleague who will be greatly missed.</P>
      <P>I should like to add my personal appreciation of the many courtesies and kindnesses which I received from him, especially during the period when he was Ceann Comhairle and I was leader of the Opposition.  Guímid sólás na bhflaitheas agus síocháin shíorraí dá anam agus comhfhortachtcroí dá mhuintir.</P>

      <P>: On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to be associated with the tribute that is being paid to the late Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Joe Brennan, by the Taoiseach.  As the Taoiseach said, the role of Ceann Comhairle is at times a very difficult role.  We in this party on occasions have come in conflict with the Chair but Deputy Brennan at all times showed an understanding of the motivation behind any objection we may have raised and realised that there was nothing personal at all in that objection.  He served this House and this country with distinction in many offices and all sides of the House will remember Deputy Joe Brennan as a man of very deep compassion, personal kindness and a man of unfailing good humour.  I recall, having come in conflict with him in his office as Ceann Comhairle in the House, immediately outside the Chamber being able to exchange jokes and pleasantries with him.  He never on any occasion personalised any matter which he knew and recognised to be one that was being pursued by an individual Deputy or a party in the strong conviction that they were correct, while he may not have agreed with that and that their motivations were of the highest.  I join, on behalf of the Labour Party and my own behalf, in extending our sincere sympathy to Deputy Brennan's family.  He will be remembered with affection by Members on all sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have already strongly condemned on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government the cowardly and brutal murder of Garda Quaid.  The Members of the House will, I know, wish to join with me in condemning this foul <Col N="7" /> deed and also in extending deepest and heartfelt sympathy to Garda Quaid's widow and family in their tragic loss.</P>
      <P>As the Dáil has not met since the appalling killings of Gardaí Morley and Byrne of Ballaghadereen in July last, it is fitting that on this sad occasion we should also extend our most sincere sympathy to the widows and young families of both gardaí who have been so tragically bereaved.</P>
      <P>In the highest traditions of the Garda Síochána Gardaí Quaid, Morley and Byrne have sacrificed their lives to uphold the law.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamnacha inte.  I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to the widows and families of the late gardaí our sincere condolences.  We must never forget that in carrying out their duty the Garda are working for every individual in the community and for our democratic institutions.  The dangers they run in serving the people in this way and the measure of the debt we owe them are exemplified by the circumstances in which Gardaí Morley, Byrne and Quaid so tragically lost their lives.</P>
      <P>I wish to announce, for the information of the Dáil, that the House will not meet tomorrow until 4 p.m. to enable Members of the Government and other Deputies to attend the funeral of Garda Séamus Quaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: On behalf of my party and personally I wish to join with the Taoiseach in asking the Dáil to extend its sympathy to the family of Detective Garda Séamus Quaid as well as to the families of Detective Garda Seán Morley and Garda Henry Byrne who lost their lives in similar tragic circumstances since the Dáil was last in session.  Our sympathy should also go to their fellow officers, for each of these three men lost their lives on duty, a duty which they and their companions today have performed so well since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seven members of the Garda Síochána have lost their lives in the last decade at the hands of subversives who repudiate our State, our courts, our Parliament and Government and the forces of law and <Col N="8" /> order.  It goes without saying that we in Fine Gael will, as we have always done, do all in our power to educate public opinion.  If there is anyone in this country who may be inclined to provide refuge to those guilty of such murders they will realise that these crimes are crimes against themselves and against all the people of Ireland.  The sense of public outrage so evident since these murders took place shows how little tolerance there is amongst our people for such crimes.  The depth of feeling in the country is great.  The feeling is that this must not be allowed to happen again.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice can be sure that my party will support any legitimate measures they wish to introduce to ensure that this will not happen again.  Those who are engaged in a conspiracy against the peace of the whole island will be resisted, and resisted by the whole Irish people.  The parents, widows and children of the murdered gardaí have the consolation&mdash;small though it is, but it is a consolation&mdash;that these men died bravely for their country.  But the personal bravery of the members of our police force must not be expended again. Those guilty of such crimes must be exposed and we in Fine Gael and all the Members of this House will ensure that they are resisted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: On behalf of the Labour Party and on my own behalf I would like to convey our sincere sympathy to the families of the three gardaí who have been brutally murdered since the Houses last sat.  It is impossible to express in words feeling for the wives and children of gardaí who have been killed in the exercise of their duty.  One can only hope that every individual in this State realises that the Garda are now our primary defence against subversives and that over the long years since the foundation of the State they have been in the front line in defending the institutions of this State against gunmen who apparently have no compunction whatsoever about taking people's lives.  The murder of Garda Quaid was particularly brutal and savage, but one wonders just how effective words are now against these men <Col N="9" /> who unfortunately are prepared to take human life.  One can only hope that the public fully realise the service which the Garda Síochána are rendering to our State and our people.  My party would be anxious that effective legitimate measures would be taken to ensure that we do nor find ourselves once again in a position of having to get up in this House and express our sympathy to the widows and children of gardaí who have been so gallantly defending the institutions of this State.</P>

      <P>: I should like to raise with the Taoiseach a matter of which I have had no opportunity of forewarning him and which has come to my notice only in the last few minutes.  Perhaps he could clarify the situation in regard to what has happened in Wexford where it has been reported, I understand, that a charge of murder was preferred against someone in connection with the murder of a garda, which is of course a capital murder, and that that charge has been withdrawn and can he give us any information as to what has happened in regard to this matter.  I apologise to the Taoiseach for raising it without warning.  Of course he may not be able to help us very much in the circumstances.</P>

The Minister for Justice informed me&mdash;again before he left for Wexford&mdash;that the person who was originally charged is in custody.  In fact he may well be in hospital.

I should say that for my part, on behalf of this party, we have confidence in him discharging his duties in that office as we had in his predecessor.  That does not, of course, preclude us from criticising him in due course on the detailed carrying out of his duties.  I am making a general expression of confidence in that regard.</P>
      <P>I note that Deputy Ray Burke has been nominated to be a member of the Government. In courtesy he must be personally congratulated on this elevation.</P>
      <P>We note that Deputy Denis Gallagher is to be brought back into the Government.  I will not comment on the political implications of this which are internal to the party opposite.  I will say only that Deputy Gallagher was always a popular Member of this House.  His removal from office was greeted with concern by people of all parties and his return to office will provide great pleasure which again will not stop us from criticising him about carrying out his duties if it should be necessary.</P>

That should have been an example to some of his fellow Ministers of State who obviously did not follow it.</P>

    <P>I thank the Taoiseach for informing us of the transfer of Deputy Barrett to the Department of Defence.  No one in this country would underestimate the importance of defence.  The present Ceann Comhairle's sojourn there was one of distinction and one can only hope that his successor will behave as well.  Some measure of justice has been done to Deputy Gallagher.  Whether it could be more accurately described as political judgment rather than justice, I am not too <Col N="13" /> sure.  I doubted at the time that that plaque in Castlebar would be of benefit to anyone.  I have been proved wrong.  I congratulate Deputy Gallagher on the success of his articulate supporters in Mayo.</P>

      <P>: Irrespective of whom the Taoiseach appointed to fill the vacancy created by Deputy Faulkner's resignation from the Government, it would be immaterial because policies which are, and will continue to be, pursued by this Government are disastrous for the Irish people. They will lead to more unemployment. A conservative estimate now is 120,000 unemployed before the winter is out, but a more realistic figure would be 160,000 to 170,000.  Inflation will continue at last year's level&mdash;perhaps marginally lower. Industry is finding it extremely difficult to survive.  A change in personnel will bring no comfort to our people.  The same policies will be pursued.  In congratulating the new member of the Cabinet, Deputy Burke, one wonders should one be commiserating with him.  He is undoubtedly joining on the bridge of a sinking ship.  A PRO exercise is no substitute for effective economic and social policies and that is the only substitute we have had. There is, at present, a divided Cabinet. Everyone knows that, particularly the members of the Cabinet.  It is safe to say that tomorrow morning the gentlemen now sitting in the press gallery will be speculating more as to which camp Deputy Burke will now find himself in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There will be further speculation as to what effect Deputy Gallagher's elevation will have within the divided Cabinet and on the support for the two groups within it.  That could be amusing if the country were being run properly, if we had not, in real terms, between 160,000 and 170,000 unemployed, if we had not an inflation rate of 20 per cent, if our public finances were not in a state of complete and utter chaos. Such has been the performance of this Government and such has been the split within its Cabinet that that is the topic most likely to get prominence in the biased reporting of these appointments.</P>
      <P>I should like to wish the Government well but am more concerned about our people.  The only possibility open to us is for the Taoiseach to seek the endorsement of the electorate.  If he gets that endorsement, he can appoint his own Cabinet and not have, as happened, almost half of that Cabinet foisted on him by his political opponents within that same Cabinet.  Give Ireland a chance.  Go to the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> Section 4: In subsection (2), page 4, between lines 40 and 41, the following added:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  A deduction shall not be made under this subsection unless, after lodgment of the amount of the payment concerned in the District Court, that Court, upon application to it in that behalf by the recipient concerned, by order authorises the deduction.</P>
    <P>(c)  An application under paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be made within 21 days of the receipt by the recipient concerned of a notice in writing stating the intention of the participant concerned to return to the recipient the goods or article concerned.</P>
    <P>(d)  An order of the District Court in proceedings under this subsection shall make such provision as that Court thinks proper in relation to the payment to the parties concerned of the amount lodged in that Court under paragraph (b) of this subsection in the proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment was made by the Seanad in response to a concern expressed by Opposition Senators.  I expect that this House will have no problem in accepting it.  However, since it is concerned with a rather technical point, I feel that I should give some explanation about the background and content.  Both Houses were unanimous in their condemnation of pyramid selling schemes and it was agreed that not merely should the promotion of pyramid selling schemes be subjected to severe penalties on conviction for certain offences but that also they should be required to repay the price of any goods or articles they supplied to people who had been induced to participate in their schemes and who had returned the goods and requested subsequent repayment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: In section 4, the promoters or participants who receive payment for goods or articles are referred to as recipients and the persons who made the payments are referred to as participants. Subsection 1 of section 4 says, in effect, that a participant is entitled to repayment of the price of any goods or any article he bought from a recipient. However, subsection 2 says the amount of the payment may be reduced to the same extent as the goods or articles may have reduced in value, due to the neglect of the participant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us imagine that I am induced to make a payment to a promoter or participant in a scheme for goods or any articles. Subsection 1 says I am entitled to a refund of the price when I return the goods or article.  However, subsection 2 says that if I neglected the goods or article in some way&mdash;for example, by leaving them out in the rain&mdash;and they were reduced in value in consequence, then the promoter or participant from whom I am claiming a refund can make a reduction proportionate to the damage caused by my neglect.  The reason for this provision is that even though the promoters or participants from whom the refund is sought do not deserve sympathy, they are entitled to justice.  Substantial penalties are provided for whatever offence they are found guilty of in a court of law.  We consider it to be equitable that any reduction in the value of the goods returned which was caused by the neglect of the participants should be reflected by way of reduction in the refund.  The victim is entitled to his money back but, if he neglects the goods in some way so as to reduce their value then he forfeits part of the refund due to him.  It was urged in the Seanad and accepted&mdash;and this is what the amendment is about&mdash;that rather than leave it to the aggrieved party to prove his entitlement to a refund of payment for goods returned, he should simply have to give a written notice of his intention to return the goods or articles and claim a refund.  If the recipient of the payment wants to challenge the claim and make a deduction from the repayment, the amendment says that he has 21 days in which to go to the District Court to ask <Col N="17" /> it to approve a deduction.  He has to lodge the amount of the payment in court.  The amendment puts the onus on the recipient to justify the deduction.  The amendment improves the Bill and I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>: A Cheann Comhairle, I wish you every success in your appointment. I welcome the amendment.  It closes a loophole which was in the Bill after its passage through this House.  We owe a debt of gratitude both to Senator Molony and Senator FitzGerald for having spotted this loophole and also to the Minister for having accepted the amendment put down by Opposition Senators in the Upper House.  There are people outside this House who look at times with a jaundiced eye on the second house of the Oireachtas.  We, as practising politicians in this House, see the value of the second line of defence in the second House, where they scrutinise very closely the legislation going through.  It is a foolproof and watertight system that we can accept amendments made by Seanad Éireann.  As long as we have Senators like Senator Molony and Senator FitzGerald, and a receptive Minister who will accept logical, sensible amendments, the chances of legislation going through this House which would not stand up to the test of time and the test of the courts are very, very slim indeed.</P>
      <P>The amendment is acceptable, worth-while and sensible.  It precludes, in an extreme set of circumstances, a person who may be a criminal from having recourse to a court to recoup moneys to which he may or may not be entitled. This amendment prevents that from happening and I welcome it as a sensible and logical amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a good amendment.  It is necessary for the protection of people that a sum of money should be lodged in court. Cases could arise in which people would apply for a refund and, in some instances, they would not have a genuine claim.  In practice, this has been adopted in a number of courts and it will be to the benefit of all parties concerned.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us what the exact position will be?  The major portion of these cases will be taken in the District Court.  The district justice has jurisdiction in many of these cases, but a number of them may go before the Circuit Court under section 6.  If they go before the Circuit Court, will people be able to apply to have them heard in the District Court?</P>

The reference which the Deputy made to the Circuit Court under section 6 relates to certain other aspects, in particular the trial on indictment of certain offences under the Bill.  The question of deciding on the amount of the deductions for the refund will be exclusively a matter for the District Court.  I could not imagine very readily the value of any article concerned being greater than the new jurisdiction of the District Court.  Even if it were, jurisdiction is still conferred by this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by extending the limits contained in existing legislation.  Specifically, the Bill provides for:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an increase from £45 million to £80 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company; and</P>
      <P>(b)  an increase from £22 million to £40 million in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid voted annually which may be made to the company.</P>
      <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the Industrial Estate at Shannon and in the mid-west region.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of factories and ancillary works. A small proportion of share capital is also expended on tourism projects of a capital nature such as castle restoration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grant-in-aid moneys are used to meet <Col N="20" /> the company's running expenses and to provide financial assistance to industries on the Shannon Industrial Estate.  A substantial part of the company's running expenses relates to airport traffic development. Expenditure for this purpose is met by a special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Transport is accountable but which comes within the overall limit now being amended by section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by the company under the headings of share capital and grant-in-aid at 30 September 1980 stood as follows:</P>
    <P>Share Capital&mdash;£45 million.</P>
    <P>Grant-in-aid&mdash;£21.65 million.</P>
    <P>The existing limit for share capital has now been reached and the limit for grant-in-aid will be reached shortly.  It is, therefore, necessary that the statutory limits be now increased to enable the company to continue their operations.  On the basis of estimates of expenditure available, the peoposed new limits will be reached towards the end of 1982.</P>
    <P>During the Second Reading of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. (Amendment) Bill, 1978, I informed the House that I proposed giving SFADCo a special mandate for the intensive development of small indigenous industry in the mid-west region.  I will give an assessment of the results of the company's new role later, but first of all I intend to outline SFADCo's achievements over the last two-and-a-half years in their other major areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>ues to grow.  The total employment on the estate is now 4,800, an increase of 10 per cent on the 1978 level.  The company have managed through the conversion of previous job approvals into actual jobs to achieve a gradual growth in manufacturing employment on the estate.  This has occured despite over 300 workers having having been made redundant last year in one of the longer established firms.  This growth in employment resulted in an increased value of industrial exports over the period under review.  More importantly, perhaps, the favourable trade balance increased by 42 per cent from £49 <Col N="21" /> million in 1977 to £69.6 million in 1979.</P>
    <P>Shannon town has shown a steady increase in population, from just over 8,000 at the beginning of 1978 to 9,400 at present.  The policy to promote Private home ownership is becoming more successful. Currently over 50 per cent of housing in the town is in private ownership.</P>
    <P>Air traffic development has had somewhat mixed results.  Although total passenger traffic through the airport last year, at 1,168,000, was 2 per cent up on the 1978 figure, this overall increase consisted of both a 6 per cent growth in terminal passenger traffic and a 1 per cent drop in transit passenger traffic.  In fact, it merely represented a recovery to the 1977 traffic level.  The renewed industrial growth in the Shannon region contributed to a 6 per cent growth in terminal air freight in 1979.  This was a heartening result against the background of a decline in this activity in the previous three years. While terminal air freight continues to expand, with a 36 per cent increase recorded in the first eight months of this year, transit and terminal passenger traffic has declined considerably over the 1979 levels.  While this decline is in part attributable to world recessionary conditions and difficulties in the tourism industry, trends in world aviation also militate against growth at Shannon.  This situation gives cause for concern.</P>
    <P>On the industrial front, the mid-west experienced a significant increase in industrial activity over the past two years. Manufacturing employment in the region increased in this period by about 1,750, which reresented an overall gain of nearly 10 per cent.  The region has recovered well from the effects of the Ferenka closure and new dynamism and vitality are evident from the growing number of high technology industries locating there.  In 1979, over 8,000 new job commitments were secured through the combined efforts of SFADCo and the IDA.  I am confident that the region can look to the future with confidence.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest sources of confidence to the region must be the outcome of the SFADCo small indigenous pilot <Col N="22" /> project.  In giving this important responsibility to the company, I indicated that I would evaluate its results after a period of 18 months to two years to determine whether such an intensive drive should be extended to other areas of the country.</P>
    <P>I recognised that this mandate would require the company to reorient their entire thrust in the field of industrial development.  Great credit is due to the chairman, Mr. Frank McCabe, to the directors and to the staff of the company in quickly adjusting to the new challenge. It entailed the formulation and implementation of an extensive and innovative programme as well as the attainment and surpassing of ambitious job approval targets.</P>
    <P>The decision to ask the company to embark on this new role stemmed from two widely differing considerations. Firstly, the company had over the years proven themselves capable of both adapting themselves and their policies to changing industrial conditions and capable of coming to grips with the vicissitudes of the air traffic and tourist businesses. I was also confident that the necessary expertise and enthusiasm existed in the company to tackle this exciting venture.  Secondly, I was concerned at the composition of our industrial structure where reliance on foreign owned and controlled projects without a growing impetus from domestic industry could in the longer term have serious implications nationally.  In March of this year, SFADCo submitted to me a comprehensive report on their activities in the promotion and development of small indigenous industry in the mid-west. This report covered the period 1 May 1978 when the pilot project got under way to the end of December 1979. I can now tell the House that the experiment was successful.  The experience gained throughout the pilot role period by the company has and will continue to be of benefit in identifying and solving the problems of this very dynamic and resilient sector of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In going about their job, SFADCo adopted a two-pronged strategy which was based firstly on bringing out through <Col N="23" /> intensive action the full potential of small indigenous industry and, secondly, on the devising and testing of programmes and ideas to stimulate the establishment and growth of native small industry.</P>
    <P>As a result of the experiment, SFADCo concluded, correctly in my opinion, that a system for the successful development of small industries must be both comprehensive and simple.  Unless a system is geared in all important respects to the environment in which the small firm operates it will not bear fruit. The need for simplicity is related to the fact that small firms generally have just one or two persons on whom responsibility rests for the production, financial, marketing and sales functions.</P>
    <P>SFADCo had also to ensure that they did not duplicate the role of other State agencies concerned with small industry development.  Where necessary, the efforts of the company were combined with those of one or a number of these agencies in the testing of new initiatives. In all, 47 new, existing or adapted programmes were tried and tested by SFADCo.  Not all of the new ones were successful but even in these cases they give direction to possible further avenues of experimentation.</P>
    <P>Among the more imaginative and effective new programmes devised by the company were:</P>
    <P>the appointment of four field officers serving Limerick city and Counties Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary;</P>
    <P>the provision of a business advisory service which was tailored carefully towards the needs of the small industrialist particularly in the critical starting up or expansion phases of the business;</P>
    <P>the arrangement of training courses designed to equip the small entrepreneur with the necessary management disciplines and skills.</P>
    <P>The field officers played a crucial role in the experiment.  They were closely identified with their areas by being readily available.  Upon them fell the burden of tapping every source which might lead <Col N="24" /> to the creation of a new small industry or the expansion of an existing one.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the business advisory service meant that the small industrialist could quickly enlist professional help in the solution of operating problems which, if unchecked, could threaten the viability of the project.</P>
    <P>Two critical areas needing constant attention in Irish industry are management and technological standards.  If the people &ldquo;at the helm&rdquo; are not equal to the task, the survival of the enterprise is sooner rather than later placed in jeopardy. That is why practical and effective training courses for the small industrialist are so important.  In meeting this need in the mid-west, SFADCo joined forces with the IMI and the NIHE.</P>
    <P>The technological revolution and advent of the microprocessor can all seem a little daunting for the small industrialist. The establishment recently of innovation and microelectronics applications centres at the NIHE campus in Limerick are the most exciting and challenging programmes introduced by SFADCo.  If their potential can be realised, even in part, it will mark a most significant advance in our technological development.</P>
    <P>The innovation centre, with its laboratory, computer, work benches and nursery factory is aimed at systematically introducing higher technology to small industry by the introduction of new product opportunities and the up-grading of existing products.  The microelectronics applications centre provides industry with the opportunity of availing of expert advice on how to apply this new technology to its products and processes.  We simply cannot allow these bold initiatives to fail.</P>
    <P>As I have dealt in some detail with the principal focus of the Shannon small industry experiment, I now intend to give some information on the company's job approval and creation performance.</P>
    <P>SFADCo exceeded without difficulty the target of 500 manufacturing job approvals which I set for 1978.  In 1979, which was the first full year of the experiment, not only was the target of 1,000 <Col N="25" /> job approvals achieved but was exceeded by 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>The actual number and spread of jobs created from these approvals are the true test of SFADCo's endeavours.  In this respect, about 700 of the 2,500 small manufacturing industry jobs approved in 1978-79 were on the factory floor at the end of last year.  This is a most encouraging development.  What was also encouraging is that nearly 50 per cent of the small industries approved by SFADCo were outside the Limerick city, Ennis and Shannon triangle.  As the jobs approved come on stream, it will help to broaden considerably the geographic base of industry in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>My intention was to give the detailed analysis of the SFADCo experiment to the House during the closing weeks of the last session.  This, to my regret, was not realised.  On the other hand, I felt it necessary to announce last July that I had decided to extend SFADCo's mandate for small indigenous industry to the area of south-west and west Offaly.  This area which includes the towns of Banagher, Birr, Ferbane and Kilcormac, has had a number of industrial set-backs over the years.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have already begun the job of their extended role.  A field officer has been appointed.  While he will operate from the Nenagh office, he will have a regular presence in Birr.  This extension of the company's area of responsibility will require amendments to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. Act, 1970 and I propose to circulate a Bill incorporating these amendments in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome this Bill and the Minister's enthusiasm.  I appreciate that there are many national and other reasons for this Bill.  As somebody who, at the time of the change of emphasis in the functions of SFADCo two years ago, queried the sense of that change, I am delighted to hear this progress report on the work of SFADCo in the area of small indigenous industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister stated, the people directly involved under Mr. McCabe, the <Col N="26" /> Chairman, are to be complimented on the determination with which they undertook their new role.  They were not starting from scratch.  They had many years experience in industrial promotion, training and so on, but they did have a new direction.  It would seem from what the Minister said that they have succeeded in their objectives in, first, providing jobs in excess of the target set for them and, second, in decentralising the industrial base referred to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>One thing that can be said about this new emphasis on small indigenous industries is that it is a welcome reorientation of effort.  The Minister referred to the necessity for this and gave two reasons.  The second reason was that he was &ldquo;concerned that the composition of our industrial structure where reliance on foreign owned and controlled projects without a growing impetus from domestic industry could in the longer term have serious implications nationally&rdquo;.  I fully accept and agree with the Minister's concern in this respect.  This is something to which I and my colleagues have been giving some thought recently because we suffer as a result of international recessions.</P>
    <P>If some untoward incident takes place 5,000 miles from our shores up to recently it did not have very much direct effect on our economy or on our way of life, but that day has gone.  We are now adversely affected by incidents such as war, disagreements on boundaries, international recessions and so on, which occur miles away because of our open economy and because the size of the world is shrinking in terms of communication.</P>
    <P>The remit given to SFADCo two years ago came as a result of this realisation.  I am glad to note that the results of their activities in implementing it has been beyond the expectations of the Minister and the people involved, although I am sure they have such confidence in themselves they think the sky is the limit.  I fully agree with the Minister's proposal to increase the money being made available to them in the form of loans and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Air traffic development is dependent <Col N="27" /> on many outside agencies which in turn are subject to pressures from sources over which we have no control.  I am glad to note that the figure quoted by the Minister will bring the air traffic development sector into a strong position and, hopefully, a strengthening position, over the coming year.</P>
    <P>As a result of SFADCo's success and the Minister's obvious enthusiasm for this kind of development, I wonder how this could be applied on a broader scale without interfering with existing agencies, for example, in the case of the training of personnel by AnCO and the IMI and promotional activities by the county development teams in consultation with the IDA.  There has been a feeling abroad, rightly or wrongly, that in years gone by the support given to indigenous industries was less than that given to somebody coming from outside.  I know as a practicing politician that this has not been the case but there is the idea that we bent over backwards to get deutschemarks, yen and dollars and to encourage people who spoke English with an accent to set up business here.  As I said, this has not been the case but it is hard to convince people of that.</P>
    <P>We have welcomed, and hopefully always will welcome, the money those people can bring into this country in the form of investment, factory building, production and, at the end of the line, employment for Irish men and women. There is no government or party who will cast doubt on the welcome those people should receive but there is nothing wrong with the further development of the small indigenous industry.  To do that one does not need to have millions of pounds.  It can be done on a very small budget.  What is needed is entrepreneurial skills, training of personnel and so on.  The kind of activity carried out under the aegis of SFADCo could be broadened and could be applied on a national level.  In doing that we would be avoiding the reliance which at some time may be too great, on the vicissitudes of economies situated thousands of miles from our shores.</P>
    <P>We have had, and still have, difficulties <Col N="28" /> in relation to the larger type industry in that the IDA, in their enthusiasm to ensure that they attracted this type of industry with its foreign capital, were forced into the unenviable position of having to locate the industry in a place where, if they had a choice, they would not locate it.</P>
    <P>Large industries in rural areas are totally foreign to our social, environmental and economic background but their existence provides employment, keeps money in circulation in the local economies and results in the development and expansion of housing schemes and of shopping and recreational facilities. However, there is a price to be paid for all this either by way of change in the social fabric of the area or by way of change in the environmental aspect as a result of the disposal of effluent or of the usage of chemicals and so on.  The latter is the much more serious change.  We are very fortunate in having a very strict application of regulations relating to these matters.  Perhaps we are far ahead of other countries in this respect, even of countries within the EEC, but regardless of these various factors the existence of, say, ten 50-personnel units in a region as opposed to one 500-personnel unit would be by far the more preferable from each of the points of view I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a good example of the difficulties encountered by the larger industries in which transport is provided for the workers from over wide areas in rural Ireland.  I refer to the recent petrol supply problem which resulted in large factories not being able to provide the normal transport facilities for their workers. That situation could have had serious consequences had it continued for, say, another month.  It could have affected production, exports, competitiveness and so on.  Such problems would not arise in small indigenous units where that type of situation would be much more easily handled.  Also, these smaller units are not subject to the kind of problems and pressures to which the larger units are subject. Therefore, while at the end of the day the SFADCo operation must face up to the competitiveness and the norms which apply in the commercial <Col N="29" /> field&mdash;production costs, unit costs and so on&mdash;there are many problems to which the much larger industries are subject but from which SFADCo are free.</P>
    <P>Another matter is that of industrial relations.  Problems in this regard do not surface as often in the smaller units as a result of the intimate relationship that exists between the workers in these units whereas in the bigger concerns industrial relations problems are multiplied out of all proportion.</P>

      <P>: Again, I welcome the Bill and wish to compliment the people involved in the success of SFADCo and to wish them well in their work in the area of the development and progress of the smaller type of indigenous units.  In the light of the Minister's experience of this operation which is close to his own base, would he not consider broadening this development on the lines of what happened in Offaly, for very good economic reasons, at a time of difficulty?  I should like the Minister to give us his views on the prospects for such development in underdeveloped areas such as the west in general.  Might this kind of development be envisaged as a vehicle through which the smaller indigenous industries might be promoted more vigorously? Recently I attended functions of county development teams who are engaged in this very project of industrial promotion in conjunction with the IDA. These are existing agencies.  SFADCo was a special case but I am sure that the success of SFADCo could be achieved elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Labour Party welcome this Bill where we are being asked to increase the capital provisions for SFADCo.  My party have consistently argued that we will not create the basis for secure employment unless there is a positive involvement of the State sector. While I do not think that Damascus lies at the far end of the Ennis road, I welcome the apparent enthusiasm in this measure.  Damascus may well be in the Limerick constituency.  However, jokes aside, in the brief report on the small industry activities of SFADCo, which the Minister attached to this legislation, there is the recognition that there is a very positive role for the State sector working with private enterprise in getting our mixed economy to operate to the benefit of a particular region.  To that extent we welcome the proposal to increase the capital from £45 million to £80 million.  Will the Minister indicate, if he is in a position to do so, what kind of increased capital it is proposed to make available to SFADCo once this legislation is passed?</P>
      <P>We are talking about an entity the existence of which was hailed as a sort of a monument to post-war Irish development and which was centred around the creation of a new town in Shannon.  It was the only new town ever created as such in this republic.  There is a very definite change of emphasis in the activities of SFADCo with which I do not disagree.  However the emphasis is now very much away from Shannon town <i>per se</i> to the Shannon region and as far west as west Offaly and south-west Offaly. Shannon town has lost out in the process. The 1979 SFADCo report gives the growth of Shannon town as 6 per cent. That is way below the average growth for urban areas here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I do not have all the details to hand, but from my limited knowledge there are a number of internal difficulties which we should not gloss over when talking about this Bill.  Shannon town is still without any local government structure of its own and its attempts to get such structures were strangled at the outset when the industrial estate, which would be its obvious tax base, was <Col N="31" /> excluded from the proposed boundary of the town commissioners.  We welcome the activities of SFADCo in the Shannonside region generally, but we run the risk of not giving sufficient encouragement and support to the town that was created around the Shannon industrial estate and the airport after the end of the Second World War.  I know the Minister's functions in this are limited.  However, he might talk to the new Minister for the Environment, who might be less interested in the local politics involved and who might be more concerned with giving a healthy impetus to the legitimate urban requirements of Shannon town.  Shannon is very much a company town, with all the negative aspects of that, and there are a number of local administrative difficulties that could be remedied if there was a fairly viable local democracy.</P>
    <P>The success of the small indigenous industries programmes is quite evident. There are 700 jobs on the ground and 2,100 new jobs were approved in 1979 compared to 600 in 1978 and about 200 in 1977.  That is good progress.  The Labour Party fears that the Fianna Fáil Party and the private enterprise sector are very adamant about keeping the State out of profitable areas of enterprise on the grounds that that is where private enterprise can do the job more efficiently. If the State has to come in, it should come in without conditions.  I have never yet known a private enterprise to be shy about taking State grants in one way or another.  It is very much the classic &ldquo;Heads you win and tails I lose&rdquo; situation, where they have it both ways. SFADCo have been particularly good in conjunction with the IDA in attracting to the Shannonside area the micro-electronics industry, and the link-up with the NIHE is very positive.</P>
    <P>However, the amount of State capital coming from different Departments invested here is very extensive.  I would like to think that if an enterprise takes off successfully with the help of State money, assistance and advice, there would be, in addition to the normal return of corporation tax and employment, some form <Col N="32" /> of direct return whether by equity participation, royalties from certain inventions that may come from the laboratories to which the Minister referred, and so on.  The idea of a total open shed to private industry, provided it succeeds without any kind of clawback is, when one takes into account the sort of money we are voting on today, unacceptable to me and to the Labour Party.  We have consistently argued that we cannot create, with the personnel we have at the moment, a productive and viable State sector.  If the State sector is precluded from or not encouraged to reap its just reward from industries it has helped to promote, then the lie that is frequently put out by right wing economists, that the State's economic activity is non-profitable, will continue to flourish.  At some stage in the future the SFADCo people, having regard to the nuances on the ground and the nature of each enterprise, should reserve the option to participate in the future profits of a company if such profits emerge.  We would also like to see looked at the whole question of industrial democracy and worker participation in industries that grow from a small base. Deputy O'Toole was beginning to move in that direction when he talked about harmonious industrial relations.  I am concerned at the idea of extending the activities of SFADCo to the Offaly area. I do not have any antipathy towards Offaly.</P>

      <P>: Part of the success of the SFADCo operation has been their local loyalty to and identification with a particular region.  The more it is diluted, the greater the risk of interfering with that very delicate ingredient of success.  I have personal professional knowledge of some of the SFADCo personnel and I agree with what the Minister has had to say about their professionalism, their enthusiasm and their commitment to the area. They operate on two distinct levels now, as a result of the redirection they have had under the aegis of the Department both as the provider and supporter of the <Col N="33" /> small industries programmes in the Shannonside area as well as being the agent for the IDA in that region.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the understandable pressure that has come from the south Offaly area as a result of regrettable closures will not create a precedent for SFADCo to be pushed in another direction at another time by another set of political pressures to the extent that there will be no boundary to their operational area and that their cohesiveness as very much a Shannonside operation will begin to be dissolved.  I know we are a long way away from that and I am aware that it is not germane to the provisions of the Bill before the House.  However, if the Minister, as a Limerick man and Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, is recognising, perhaps a bit late in the day, the positive value of State enterprise&mdash;I am referring to it as dealt with in the report of the Shannonside company and not in the context of what is taking place at meetings of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on the failure of the NET operation&mdash;then we should be looking at similar type local development companies modelled on Shannon for other parts.</P>
      <P>I welcome, on behalf of the Labour Party, the recognition that the role of the State sector and the role of State capital is fundamental to the economic development of the country, that it can operate over a wide range of scales from small two and three person enterprises to large, highly technical and complex ones.  The Labour Party recognise, as no other party do, that without the active involvement of the State in productive enterprises and industries we will not obtain for ourselves the secure industrial base that will give us the productive wealth for all the service jobs we require.  Will the Minister indicate the kind of capital allocation that is envisaged for the company now that the ceiling has been lifted?  Have the Department any thoughts on the participation of the State, through SFADCo, in a part of the successful action which hopefully will ensue from the activities of this State sector?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to <Col N="34" /> thank Deputies for their reception of the Bill and for what they have said about it and SFADCo.  It was gratifying for me to hear Deputy O'Toole, one of my critics two years ago when I threw out some new ideas, being gracious enough to acknowledge that I was right and that what I tried had succeeded.  I should like to thank him for that.  Deputy O'Toole asked how the successful activity that has been carried out by SFADCo in relation to small industry over the past two years might be extended to the rest of the country in order that not just the mid-west region alone should benefit from it.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the very fact that the Shannon development company are doing this in the mid-west caused, I am happy to say, a considerable increase in interest and activity in relation to the development of small industry in both parts of the country paralleling to some extent, if not quite in percentage terms, the dramatic increase in job approvals in the mid-west region.  There was a general substantial increase in job approvals in small industry in other regions.</P>
      <P>For the IDA areas, which I would define as being the entire country excluding the mid-west and the Údarás na Gaeltachta areas, the following are the figures for the small industry job approvals from 1977 to date: 1977-2,832; 1978, when the Shannon experiment started-4,577; 1979-7,405 and the target this year in indigenous small industry outside the mid-west is 10,000.  Speaking as of the middle of October, which is quite near the end of the year, it appears that the target of 10,000, nearly all of which is indigenous, will be achieved.  Two things are significant about that.  The figure of 10,000 small industry job approvals in one year is very large and is nearly five times what is was three years ago.  Therefore, it is very important in itself.  Equally important is the fact that it is one-third of the IDA's whole target for the year. That is an enormously higher proportion of the total target than was the case some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the cost per job much lower also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="35" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, it is much lower but against that, in fairness, one must acknowledge that frequently the technology is much lower also.  We must acknowledge that the spin-off value to the economy generally in purely mathematical terms may sometimes not be as high but there are many other advantages. In particular, there is the advantage that one is able to locate them much more widely and give industrial development, to some extent at least, to small places that never had it before and never thought in their own hearts there was ever that possibility.</P>
      <P>What has happened in relation to it is very heartening.  We must acknowledge that because SFADCo were given this function two years ago and performed it well, and because the IDA greatly increased or intensified their efforts in relation to small industries at about the same time with considerable success, a lot of the figures in that time may have within them a certain amount of taking up of the slack.  There may have been a certain proportion of jobs approved which were relatively easy to approve in the sense that they did not need as much effort to promote as would be needed from now on to start new jobs and job approvals from the ground up.  For that reason I expect, and SFADCo have indicated, that their gross job approval figure for 1980 will decline from the spectacularly high figure achieved in 1979 because the element of taking up the slack has gone.  Each of the jobs or job approvals will have to be worked for much harder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having studied with some care the detailed report prepared by SFADCo on their activities over the last two years I can say that one of the most important aspects is the local availability of professionals. Without the field officers, as they call them, being constantly available in each county and locality and being professionally trained promoters and helpers of industry, nothing like the same success could have been achieved.  I am convinced&mdash;I am sure the IDA will agree with me&mdash;that this is one of the most important aspects of what was developed at Shannon and which will have to be <Col N="36" /> applied to the remainder of the country. I am most anxious that the fruits of this would not be confined to one region only. For that reason the present regional structure of the IDA may not be totally appropriate to the intensive promotion of small industry, particularly small indigenous industry.  As well as having a regional office covering several counties, the IDA must also have at least one full-time professional field officer in each county.  Big counties like Cork would, perhaps, need two or more such officers. I am sure the IDA recognise this and I would hope to see these changes coming about very soon.  In their case it may not be necessary to promote legislation to enable changes of this kind.</P>
    <P>The regional offices of the IDA as at present constituted do not by any means specialise in small industry promotion in regions other than the mid-west.  They have a wide range of duties including the arrangement of intineraries for industrialists, arranging the purchase of land for factories and sorting out many problems at local and regional level in consultation with the local authorities and others.  It will be helpful to the IDA to have specialists based at those regional offices but living in individual counties in order that they can do in other regions what SFADCo have done rather successfully in the mid-western region.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn expressed concern that the relative regional intimacy of SFADCo in relation to Shannon and the mid-west region might be diluted by further extension of their jurisdiction and he had some doubt for that reason about the wisdom of what I have decided in relation to Offaly lest it be taken as a precedent for other areas which might have special difficulties.  I fully acknowledge that and it is not my intention that there should be further extensions.  There was a particular problem in the southern part of County Offaly and, since it adjoins the mid-west region at the northern part of County Tipperary, the physical distance involved in the extension is very limited indeed.  It was because of a particular problem which it faced, that this stretch of County Tipperary had the mid-west <Col N="37" /> region on one side and the western region or County Galway, which is classified as an undeveloped region, running along on the other side of the Shannon, that it found itself by geographical accident in a somewhat unenviable position.  I could see that there were serious difficulties there and that some of them were caused because of this unique geographical situation.</P>
    <P>I took a step which I believe will be of help to that region.  I said at the time that I did not wish this to be seen as a precedent and I reiterate now that I do not see it as such.  I see the IDA as naturally the primary industrial development body and we are very fortunate that this is the case. The IDA have now achieved a situation where one-third of their job approvals are for small Irish industry and there is within that organisation a new enthusiasm for the possibilities which exist.  It is understandable that in the past some people in the IDA might have thought that the larger and more spectacular projects providing larger numbers of jobs, using spectacular technology and heavier investment, were more attractive.  I am happy to say that that perception is certainly wrong.  At all times the IDA have striven to ensure that at the very least Irish entrepreneurs got the same treatment&mdash;I am not allowed by the Treaty of Rome to say any more than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole made the case for the smaller type of industry, and undoubtedly the case is a valid one.  He said he would prefer to see ten factories each employing 50 people than one large factory employing 500 people.  Ideally we would all prefer such a situation, but the nature of modern industry is that it must be organised in larger units.  It is also worth remembering that a considerable amount of small industry which has been successfully promoted here during the past few years has been directly as a result of the existence of large modern factories here with up-to-date technology, usually of foreign ownership.  Certainly this is a factor which cannot be ignored.  These larger industries have been creating a demand for components.  Many successful indigenous industries started off by <Col N="38" /> meeting the demand for components from bigger firms and have now expanded to the extent that they are major industries in their own right.  One must acknowledge that quite a significant part of the growth of small industry is due to that factor.</P>
    <P>One should not see small industry as totally separate from industry at large because the development and promotion of the two interact very considerably and there will not be one without the other. It works the other way as well as to some extent because there will not be larger industries unless there is an infrastructure of smaller engineering companies, in particular, to keep them supplied with components and services of various kinds.  I never view with any enthusiasm the suggestion or demand which is sometimes made that there should be a separate Department for small industry or a separate Minister of State to deal with it.  An effort to compartmentalise it in that way would not be successful and there would be all kinds of jurisdictional disputes and much natural growth which otherwise take place would be inhibited.</P>

      <P>: Deputy Quinn inquired how much capital was likely to be expended by SFADCo or made available to them.  I cannot give the precise figure for each of the years because the figures have not yet been fixed and this will have to be done at estimates meetings.  However, I estimate that the additional amount of capital, which is £35 million, would be expended in two-and-a-quarter years and that gives a rough idea. Of course not all of this will be expended on industry and industrial development. This covers all their capital and would cover aviation and tourism related activities and probably some activities relating to the town.  It would also cover some of their other community-type activities <Col N="39" /> such as their involvement in the Rent an Irish Cottage scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn thought that Shannon town had lost out somewhat by the greater emphasis which we are now placing on the regional aspects of SFADCo. I do not think that is so.  There are many things one could say about Shannon town but one hesitates to talk too freely lest it give the wrong impression.  However, as someone who represents a constituency which is quite close to it I know that there is an inordinate demand for housing in Limerick city and the fairly ready availability of housing which existed in Shannon up to very recently has not done anything to relieve the extent of the demand in Limerick.</P>
      <P>It seems that the Irish character more than most is attracted to an established community where roots have already been put down.  The facility with which the British could build new towns in England and in Scotland has not been repeated here, perhaps because we are much smaller and also perhaps because the size of the development has not been such that would attract great numbers of people to it.  There may be other reasons but I believe that it is fundamentally because the Irish people tend to live where they have roots rather than live in new environments, where roots have not already been put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great efforts have been made in regard to Shannon.  I fully support the call for a more normal local democracy in the town.  One would like to see it develop in the same way as other places of comparable size in the country.  I believe that my colleague, the newly appointed Minister for Defence, who was formerly Minister for the Environment, was in favour of the establishment of town commissioners. There is apparently a requirement in the law that a town commission must be established before an urban district is established.  I believe this has had the support of the former Minister for the Environment and his Department.  I understand that this is likely to go through at a fairly early date.  From then on I believe there can be an evolution <Col N="40" /> into an urban district council.  Shannon in that respect will then become a local democracy in the same way as any other towns of comparable size in the country.</P>
    <P>I believe I have dealt with all the main points which were made in the course of the debate.  I would like once again to thank the Deputies for their positive contributions in the debate and their support of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Because this Bill and the National Film Studios of Ireland Limited Bill both relate to the development of the film industry in Ireland I propose, for the sake of convenience, to cover both Bills in my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may surprise many people to learn that, in Ireland, there is a long tradition of film-making going back to the early days of this art form.  The films of Sydney Olcott and the Film Company of Ireland in the early part of the century are notable examples.  In recent years interest in film-making here has centred on the shooting of many of the scenes for international feature films and the growth of Irish film-making in the documentary and short feature areas.  These activities, <Col N="41" /> however, have not resulted in the establishment of what might be regarded as an Irish film industry.  Many recommendations, proposals and suggestions have been made over the years for the establishment and development of such an industry.  For one reason or another none of these ideas has come to fruition.  Notwithstanding our present economic difficulties, the Government at my suggestion, have agreed that the time is now opportune to provide the framework within which a film industry in Ireland might develop.  Needless to say the Government themselves cannot create such an industry but hopefully can provide the necessary encouragement and incentives for those who can.</P>
    <P>By the establishment of an Irish film industry I mean not only the making of films in Ireland, but also the development of Irish entrepreneurs who will take a leading part in organising the financing and production of films, of producers, directors, script-writers, cameramen, lighting technicians, editors, sound recordists, designers, make-up artists, craftsmen, technicians and the various people who together make up a film industry.  Such an industry would produce not only short films but feature films for world distribution both for television and for cinema.</P>
    <P>In considering the need for an Irish film industry, account should be taken not only of the factors applicable to industrial development in general, such as creating employment and attracting foreign exchange, but also a number of major reasons, mainly non-economic, for having films made in Ireland: development of artistic and technological skills; promotion of tourism; promoting cultural values and public relations, and providing a potent means of presenting this country, its heritage and its people to the world and of keeping Irish people in touch with their distinctive environment. It is, I think, relevant to point out that Ireland is one of the few European countries which lacks a specific scheme of inducements of one kind or another to encourage the development of film-making.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> In 1968 the Film Industry Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Huston&mdash;the well known film director&mdash;submitted a report to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce making recommendations for promoting the development of a native film industry in Ireland.  The committee's main recommendations formed the basis of the principal provisions of the Film Industry Bill, 1970, which lapsed in early 1973.</P>
    <P>The object of that Bill was to set up a board which was to have the function of furthering and encouraging the development of an Irish film industry.  The board itself was not intended to engage in film production but was to have been empowered to make or guarantee loans for film-making subject, in certain cases, to prescribed financial limits.  Following the acquisition of the Ardmore Film Studios by the Government in July 1973, it was decided that the format of the Bill would have to be changed to take account of the new situation.  In any event certain sections of the 1970 Bill were contrary to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The Government in July 1973 authorised the purchase of the land, premises and equipment of the former Ardmore Film Studios International (1972) Limited, Bray, County Wicklow which were being sold at public auction by the Receiver.  These assets were purchased through Radio Telefís Éireann on behalf of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce for a total of approximately £450,000 (including fees).  RTE took over the studios in September 1973 and acted as caretaker-managers on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce pending the establishment of permanent structures to operate the studios.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Government believed at that time that the establishment and maintenance of well-equipped film studios, operating on commercial lines, was an essential prerequisite for the development of a film industry in Ireland in that if the studios were to be closed permanently the emergence of an indigenous film industry producing feature films would become less likely.</P>
    <P>On 4 June 1975 the Government <Col N="43" /> approved a proposal by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to establish a company, to be known as National Film Studios of Ireland Ltd., to take over and operate the studios.  The business of NFSI is that of renting studios and other premises&mdash;offices, dressing rooms and so on&mdash;and equipment to film producers who are making films in Ireland.  The company also make available sets, fittings and furnishings to theatrical producers. In both cases charges are designed to cover the costs of providing these facilities and to yield a profit.  Similar facilities are provided on a commercial basis to advertising agents and firms making short commercial films for television or cinema.  A major function of NFSI to date has been to persuade film makers, both foreign and Irish, to use their facilities.</P>
    <P>Employment on a full-time basis in NFSI is being provided at present for about 60 people.  Additional employment during periods of feature film activity has been provided by the company and directly by production companies filming in Ireland.  Overall, however, the level of what could be termed significant film making projects attracted to the studios has been disappointing and has fallen far short of what would be necessary to make the operation of the studios viable and capable of ensuring a reasonable continuity of employment for Irish personnel involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons why NFSI are unable to keep the studios operating at full capacity is the company's inability to offer any financial incentives to film makers. This places the studios at a marked disadvantage as almost all the other member states of the European Communities and a number of important third countries offer varied incentives and inducements in respect of film making. For example, in the United Kingdom the Eady levy, based on a tax on box office receipts, is designed to attract foreign investment, since the opportunity of obtaining an additional bonus from the levy makes it financially more attractive <Col N="44" /> to produce a film in Britain.  In the Federal Republic of Germany and in Denmark, national film institutes provide financial assistance to producers, exhibitors, scriptwriters and assistance in film promotion and distribution.  In Canada, the Canadian Film Development Corporation provide financial investments for feature films, loans to producers and training grants.</P>
    <P>Excluding the expenses incurred in the purchase of the studios, direct Exchequer grants totalling £1.3 million have been made available to NFSI up to the end of 1979 to cover principally the company's administrative expenses during periods of inactivity.  In addition, NFSI have, with ministerial approval, obtained a bank overdraft of £850,000 which has been used mainly for capital development. A significant level of capital expenditure had to be undertaken in order to bring the studios up to the highest international standards in the absence of which there would have been even greater difficulties in the procurement of business.  While the company have had some success in attracting film business since they commenced operations, overall the company's experience illustrates their inability to generate a satisfactory level of business without the availability of some form of financing incentives.  This is a point that NFSI made forcefully shortly after they were set up.  Again early in 1977 in a proposal to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, NFSI suggested that the proposed film industry legislation should provide for the establishment of a film financing and distribution company that would be a subsidiary of NFSI.</P>
    <P>On taking up office in July 1977 and following a re-appraisal of the overall position of film making in Ireland, including NFSI's failure to generate sufficient business to make their operations viable, I decided to seek independent advice on systems of finance for film making and on possible methods of making the studios viable.  I engaged Messrs. A.D. Little Ltd. of London, international consultants, to undertake this task and they reported to me in May 1978.  In addition <Col N="45" /> to the consultancy advice, officials of my Department&mdash;and indeed I myself &mdash;had numerous meetings during 1978, 1979 and 1980 with groups and individuals involved in the film industry here. These groups included the board and management of NFSI, representatives of the trade unions and the Irish Film and Television Guild, the Association of Independent Producers Ireland, the Arts Council, RTE and a number of independent Irish film makers.  These meetings were normally held at the specific request of those involved.  The views of all these groups and individuals were considered in formulating my legislative proposals in consultation with my colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>I have adopted a pragmatic approach to the legislation and to the level of financing involved and have tried to take account of the needs of all interests involved, the NFSI, the independent Irish film makers and the technicians and artists.  It is easy to be critical of such proposals depending on where one's own interests lie but I think the time is now opportune for all the people who wish to be involved in the film industry here to work together in order to make the legislation a success.  This is a unique opportunity and, because of the many calls on the Exchequer, is likely to be the only chance the industry is given.  I am sure there is a substantial body of opinion in this country who will feel that the money involved in these proposals could be put to much better use in the national interest. It will be up to those involved in the film industry to prove them wrong.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with the Irish Film Board Bill and then with the National Film Studios of Ireland Limited Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Irish Film Board Bill are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum which has already been circulated to Deputies.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a board which shall have overall responsibility for the promotion and development of film making in Ireland and for the operation of financial aid schemes designed to further these ends.  The board will have considerable flexibility in their operations and in relation <Col N="46" /> to the administration of the fund of £4.1 million.  This is a departure from the terms of the 1970 Bill which had the disadvantage of being too rigid and not allowing the board wide enough powers. Subject to such terms and conditions as they think fit, the board may invest in or make a loan, a guarantee or a grant towards the cost of the making of a film in the State.  In addition, the board may provide grants for training and provide moneys for general activities in keeping with their general functions.  I expect that the main preoccupation of the board will be to get films made here and that the bulk of the finance available to them will go in this way.  I will be looking to the board to adopt a businesslike approach to prospective projects and will expect that the potential viability of each project will be a major consideration for assistance being given.</P>
    <P>Some of the projects will be international feature or television films with good employment and training potential for Irish actors and technicians, while others will be projects by Irish film makers a number of whom have shown themselves in recent years to be capable of producing works of high technical and artistic merit.  I should stress, however, that the board will not be in the business of giving gratuitous handouts as this would not be of long-term benefit in an area which, the Government intend, will eventually have to be able to stand on its own feet without State support.</P>
    <P>I do not intend at this stage to indicate who might be on the film board. Obviously, particularly dedicated individuals will be required, a number of whom should be able to carry out an objective and critical assessment of both the commercial viability and artistic value of individual projects and be able to read and evaluate scripts.  It is my intention that the board would appoint a very small permanent staff, and would have available to it, in whatever may be the most appropriate capacity, persons with expert knowledge and experience of the many facets of film making and distribution.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should say that I have been somewhat disappointed with the <Col N="47" /> response to the publication of the Film Bills.  Since the Bills were presented to the House on 26 November 1979, I have received little in the way of concrete reaction, suggestions, proposed amendments and so on, apart from a joint submission from the Association of Independent Producers Ireland, the Irish Film and Television Guild and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  Perhaps on the other hand, I should interpret this as indicating general satisfaction with my proposals.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the main points which have been raised in relation to the Irish Film Board Bill: first, that the general functions of the board should be extended specifically to include such areas as film distribution and the establishment of a National Film Archive.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of the importance of distribution in the context of film making and I will deal with this in greater detail later.  Naturally, the board will have to devote considerable time and energy in considering this whole area. However, I do not think that it is appropriate specifically to spell this out under the proposed functions of the board as it would be rather unfair to commit the board to becoming involved on a statutory basis in this area in advance of giving them an opportunity to consider the matter in more detail.  But, perhaps more important, there might be a temptation for some film makers to subrogate entire responsibility for distribution to the board and to blame them for the possible subsequent commercial failure of the films concerned.</P>
    <P>Again while I recognise that the establishment of a film archive had merit and that this is another matter which the board will have to consider, I feel nevertheless that there should be no statutory obligation on the board to get involved in this area at the very start.  The establishment of an archive could be fairly expensive and could present certain technical/administrative difficulties and therefore I feel that it would be more prudent to await an in-depth study of this whole question.  In my opinion, the main <Col N="48" /> preoccupation of the film board should be to get films made and if they become too deeply involved at an early stage in ancillary matters, it could have a detrimental impact on their operations.</P>
    <P>A fundamental criticism that is contained in the joint submission from the AIPI/Irish Film and Television Guild/ ITGWU is that the Film Board Bill does not give expression to what I might refer to as an &ldquo;Irish dimension&rdquo; and linked to this is their view that not less than 80 per cent of the fund should be used to assist in the making of films by independent producers whose normal operation and residence is in Ireland.  I should say at this stage that the proposed film legislation has been very carefully drafted in order to avoid possible objections from the Commission of the European Communities on the grounds of discrimination against other member states.  As I said earlier, the 1970 Bill had been discriminatory in certain respects as it included restrictions on grounds of nationality.  In fact, my Department have successfully secured the Commission's approval of the texts of the two Bills, although the Commission has requested full details of the proposed method of operation of the board and the criteria for the provision of assistance as soon as the board is formally established.  To introduce a number of amendments as suggested, no matter how carefully drafted, would inevitably create difficulties and could unduly delay the passage of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to specify how the fund of £4.1 million over four years might be split between films predominantly using the facilities of the studios and film making activities by independent Irish producers.  Indeed, it would be dangerous to make such distinctions as the fund is experimental in nature and only experience will show how it may be effectively operated.  However, I think it is important to make two points in this regard: firstly, it seems clear to me that, at least in the short-term, the National Film Studios will require a limited number of international feature films to provide sufficient work for the studios; and, secondly, that notwithstanding their worth-while <Col N="49" /> efforts in recent years, the ability of the majority of independent Irish producers to properly put together, manage and control commercial films with substantially increased budgets is, as yet, unproven.</P>
    <P>I see no objection to an amendment on the lines that have been suggested to section 8(1).</P>
    <P>In relation to section 31 of the Film Board Bill, which has been the subject of some public comment, I have already said that the provisions in the Irish Film Board Bill are very broad and give the board very wide discretionary powers in relation to its general functions and the administration of the film financing fund. Indeed, this is deliberate in order to enable the board to operate in an effective and flexible manner.  I envisage that the provision enabling me to give directives to the board would only be used very infrequently and in relation to important policy issues.  I can confirm to the House that there is absolutely no intention that I would interfere in the day-to-day operations of the board or in the selection or rejection of individual film projects for assistance by the board. Furthermore, I feel that the members of the Film Board would welcome guidelines from the Minister on the general policy which might be adopted.</P>
    <P>It must not also be forgotten that the Minister of the day has an obligation to the Oireachtas to ensure that the film financing fund is spent in the best possible interests of the development of the film industry and that, given the very broad provisions in the Bill, the Minister should have the power to rectify any obvious areas where the board might be departing from a prudent overall policy.</P>
    <P>I believe that there has also been expression of disappointment in some quarters about the level of the fund, that is, roughly a million pounds a year over four years.  We are a small country and the calls on the Exchequer are many and varied.  Although the fund may be regarded as low in absolute terms and in relation to film production budgets, it is relevant to point out that in the UK, with a population nineteen times our own, the <Col N="50" /> National Film Finance Corporation has operated reasonably effectively since 1949 on a very small revolving fund.  As I said earlier, given the present difficult economic climate and the low priority which the film industry could be regarded as having, the available finance is well up to what can be expected.</P>
    <P>Of course, the fund, in addition to encouraging native film making, is also designed to attract international Film and TV projects, either to be made at NFSI or on location in Ireland.  A consistent level of international projects would, hopefully, result in a regular flow of business for the studios which should reduce the existing burden on the Exchequer of keeping NFSI in funds.  But perhaps more importantly such large-scale projects could provide regular and valuable employment for many people in Ireland, not only for actors and actresses in major or supporting roles, but for extras, technicians, carpenters, electricians, plasterers etc. involved in film making.  Such projects also have valuable spin-off benefits in the general servicing area&mdash;for example, hotels, restaurants and so on&mdash; and in the promotion of tourism.  They can also be important in training Irish personnel in the basic film techniques.  In the light of these benefits I am very often surprised at the apparent criticism against international projects as if they were almost a discouragement to the Irish film makers.  Surely two or three of this type of project a year, if carefully selected in order to ensure viability, are to be welcomed and could flourish in conjunction with the activities of Irish film makers.</P>
    <P>While the obvious ultimate goal would be for Irish directors, producers, script writers and so on of international calibre to emerge, I think it is unrealistic to expect that this can be accomplished overnight.  In any event certain international features will continue to be made in Ireland either because of our natural advantages&mdash;for example, unspoilt countryside, splendid scenery, and so on&mdash;or because of a particular Irish theme, but special financial incentives will be required in other cases.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, the board and <Col N="51" /> the film finance fund are also designed to further native film making talent.  I accept that it is only if this section of the industry blossoms that we can have a truly Irish film industry making films that reflect the Irish way of life and with Irish themes.</P>
    <P>We have seen the emergence of a number of Irish film makers in recent years without direct State support and these people are to be congratulated on their efforts.  I know that most of these low budget films would not have been possible, however, without the indirect support of the State through RTE, the Arts Council and other State bodies who have encouraged those involved.  I would encourage these bodies, and indeed the major Irish companies and banks in the private sector, to consider supporting by sponsorship native Irish film makers in the years to come.  As a result of the efforts of these few film makers, some commentators have suggested that an Irish film industry would develop without direct State support.  But, I for one am aware that a number of Irish film makers have put a great deal of personal savings and have gone into debt to have these films completed.  I am hopeful, therefore, that, once established, the Irish Film Board would look into this whole area and actively encourage those involved. However, a cautious approach is needed. There are limited funds and to expect overnight miracles is foolhardy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before the very important issue of film distribution and this was highlighted in the consultants' report to which I referred earlier.  For those involved in the industry, distribution is seen as the key to survival.  For no matter how good a film is, if it is not shown it can never hope to bring a return to the film maker.  Distribution is, of course, mainly controlled by the film majors who naturally give preference to their own product as part of their integrated operations. The Film Board will have to devote a lot of time and energy to this question.  From the point of view of assessing individual projects, either international or native, a project for which there are already guaranteed distribution <Col N="52" /> arrangements would have a better chance of receiving assistance from the board than one for which no arrangements had been made.  In the case of Irish film makers, who would be more likely to have distribution problems because of inexperience and lack of international standing, the board would try to assist in this area perhaps by setting up a distribution office or making the necessary contacts at home or abroad.  In addition, I understand that NFSI and RTE have acquired experience in this field and might also be able to provide assistance.  Notwithstanding these remarks, I feel I must stress a most important point: that there is no easy solution to the distribution problem and those in the industry should not assume that the Film Board will prove a panacea for all their ills.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis it is essentially up to the film maker to go as far as he can in relation to negotiating a distribution deal for his own project.  Film makers cannot expect the board to provide assistance for the making of a film which will simply be deposited on the board's doorstep for distribution and for which the film maker can blame the board for its possible failure. I feel that another area which needs attention is the distribution opportunities within Ireland for Irish films and I would appeal to Irish distribution companies to be helpful here.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the National Film Studios of Ireland Limited Bill.  This is a fairly standard piece of legislation and, as set out in the Explanatory Memorandum which has already been circulated, it is designed to give appropriate statutory backing to NFSI and regularise its position.  As I mentioned earlier, the company was set up in 1975 in advance of enabling legislation with a nominal share capital of £1 million which has not been issued to date.  This has meant that NFSI has had to borrow the bulk of the funds needed for capital development and the consequential financing charges have been a particularly heavy burden on the company.  This burden, together with the inability of the company to attract a regular flow of film making business, has meant that the studios have been a burden <Col N="53" /> on the Exchequer over the past few years.  Deputies will be aware of the criticism made in this regard by the Public Accounts Committee recently.</P>
    <P>Hopefully the two Bills, when enacted, will improve the situation considerably by eventually regularising the capital structure of the company and providing incentives for film makers more fully to utilise the excellent facilities at the studios.</P>
    <P>I believe that to get NFSI working on a fully profitable basis the studios must for a few years at least, depend heavily on work from international film producers, who will make films here because they can get the kind of facilities they want and are prepared to pay for these facilities on the normal commercial scale. A steady flow of work from such film makers will provide an income for the studios which should, hopefully, put the company in a profitable position.  It should also, and this is no less important, provide invaluable experience and training for Irish people working in the industry.</P>
    <P>Although NFSI have been severely criticised in the past, I feel I must pay tribute to the members of the board, and in particular the chairman, Mr. John Boorman, for their efforts over the past few difficult years.  Mr. Boorman has served the Irish film industry very well and through his personal efforts has influenced the making of a number of films here, some of them by himself.  In fact, a feature film with a budget of over $10 million was completed a few months ago at NFSI.  This film&mdash;&ldquo;Knights&rdquo;&mdash;was written, produced and directed by John Boorman and provided employment for a large number of Irish workers in the film industry for most of the first half of this year.</P>
    <P>Most of the post-production work was also carried out at the studios and it is of great significance that this film provided opportunities for young Irish trainees in all departments of the production.  Mr. Boorman's international reputation and position has contributed in no small measure to any success that has been accomplished to date by the studios and <Col N="54" /> this country owes him a considerable debt.  I only hope that, despite his many commitments in the future, he will continue to play a vital role at this important period in the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>While developments in the last decade in the film industry seemed to be showing a trend away from studios and concentrating more on location work, the situation seems to be turning in recent years with the trend for films with a higher studio content.  In fact, I believe that most studios around the world are quite busy at present because of the present buoyant situation in the film industry.  However, it is my personal opinion that the film industry is one that, because of its artistic and technical nature, is not particularly suited to the State sector.  The national film studios, nevertheless, do constitute a valuable major asset and I believe that they are regarded by people who have worked there as one of the finest of their size in the world.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to stress that the overall package of proposals contained in the legislation is experimental in nature and will be reviewed by the Government after an initial period of about three to four years to assess what further role, if any, the State will play in this area.  I know that it may be too early, even at that stage, realistically to assess the impact of the board's activities, but we could not continue to provide scare State funds without reviewing their effectiveness and value to the community.  As I said before, I regard the present proposals as a great challenge to the nascent film industry in Ireland and I hope they are regarded as a measure of anticipation by the Government of the future prospects of the industry and of its expectation that those who will be involved will justify this act of faith.  With that in mind, I would hope that some of the divisions that have existed in the past between the independent film makers and those involved in the studios will be overcome and that everybody will work together in the hope of ultimate success.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Irish Film Board Bill will commend itself to the Dáil <Col N="55" /> and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome both the Irish Film Board Bill and the National Film Studios of Ireland Limited Bill.  The Minister has made a very lengthy statement on the background to present difficulties and the reasons for the introduction of legislation at this time.  My over-riding reaction is that he would seem to be suggesting that this is the last chance which this industry has in so far as public sector involvement or Government involvement is concerned.  I agree with him that, in particular in the recent past&mdash;and I say this as chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;there has been severe criticism of the situation which obtained in the Ardmore Studios. While this criticism may be unfair in many respects, the studios possibly being expected to do too much too quickly, nevertheless as Members of the House and of that committee specifically charged with this scrutiny of expenditure on behalf of the House, must be seen to be critical and, hopefully, give constructive criticisms at all times.  The Bills are very welcome indeed.</P>
      <P>The setting up of a board with specific functions to organise the industry and, hopefully, give it emphasis in the right direction over the next few years is very welcome.  Up to now, the one physical indication of an industry was the Ardmore Studios which up to now have been working in a vacuum and but for the direct involvement, co-operation and enthusiasm shown by a few individuals, their limited success over the past couple of years would not have been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what the Minister said in relation to the lack of reaction to the publication of the Bill, I feel that there has been a very healthy reaction, if critical at times, in the industry itself and, after all, that is the source from which the Minister would expect informed comment and criticism to help him to draw up legislation which would be workable and acceptable to the people directly involved in the industry.  The Minister has had <Col N="56" /> representations made to him from three sources directly involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects in relation to the board which possibly are more appropriate to Committee Stage and concern the size of the board.  I am glad that the Minister has given reasons for not being too specific in the Bill about the functions of the board.  In other words, he has left the board a certain degree of discretionary power and, hopefully, they will use that flexibility for the benefit of the industry as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: I was commenting on the background outlined by the Minister in relation to the necessity for legislation at this stage to promote the film industry and regularise the existing facility available. The Minister in his statement established the need for a film industry under many headings.  He mentioned the development of artistic and technological skills, promotion of tourism, promoting cultural values, and public relations.  The film industry is a means of presenting this country, its heritage and its people to the world, and the way they live in their environment.  It is a very worthwhile objective to provide a facility that will do all these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a board with a sum in excess of £4 million over the next four years is a first step in the direction of the attainment of the objectives outlined. While the sum of £1 million per year approximately is not satisfactory, I suppose even if it were ten times that figure some people would find it unsatisfactory. It is a particularly small sum of money for an industry that needs and deals in large amounts of money.  While the Minister may compare the size of the allocation with that of its counterpart in England, I suggest to him that the two situations are not comparable in that in the United Kingdom there is and has been a well-established, well-rooted and, as far as I know, a very successful industry in the past number of years.  Here we are talking about starting from the foundation. Indeed, we are in the subterranean area if we take into account the amounts of money owed by the industry as of now. The establishment of the board, its formation and the question of the number of people involved are matters that could be discussed more appropriately on Committee <Col N="61" /> Stage and I shall refer to them later.</P>
    <P>The sum involved is quite small when we consider what has to be done.  It is there for the promotion and development of film-making.  I am sure that the representations made to the Minister referred to the questions of distribution and the provision of film archives.  While the Minister has said that he does not wish to tie down the board in cold print specifically to this area of activity, I think the industry would be more comfortable if at least some gesture were made in print to the distribution aspect.  The Minister has said quite rightly that there is the possibility of danger arising where a film maker could dump a completed film at the door of the board and simply say &ldquo;distribute it&rdquo;.  While that is an extreme case of something that might arise, I do not think that in practice it would arise because as the Minister and the House are aware, the costs of distribution are very high and the technicalities involved in breaking into the distribution sector, which is controlled by international, multi-national film makers, are very difficult.</P>
    <P>When the board are brought into existence and are operating, I am quite sure they will have to expend some portion of their allocation on trying to break into the distribution sector of film making because without distribution, without getting audiences to view films either in cinemas or on television, the whole thing will collapse around our ears.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá maidir le scannáin as Gaeilge.  Dúirt an tAire go raibh ceist cultúra anseo, go mbeadh sé mar cheann d'fheidhmeanna an bhoird agus ag an tionscal trí chéile muintir na hÉireann agus saol na hÉireann a thaispeáint don domhan.  Anois, mar atá a fhios againn sa Teach seo, dá mbeadh fear déanta scannán ag braith ar theacht isteach ar scannáin déanta as Gaeilge, dá mbeadh sé ag braith ar an méid teacht isteach a bheadh ar fáil taobh istigh den tír seo, ní dóigh liom go n-éireodh leis toisc go bhfuil an tír chomh beag, agus bheadh deacrachtaí eile ann chomh maith, deacrachtaí teangan.  Ach mar sin féin, má táimid i ndáiríre faoi chultúr <Col N="62" /> agus faoi shaol muintir na hÉireann a theaspáint don domhan trí scannáin nó trí scannáin thelefíse, caithfear é seo a dhéanamh.  Daoine go bhfuil suim acu i scannáin as Gaeilge, tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil an ceart acu go mbeadh airgead ar fáil le cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh cuid den £1 milliún seo, cé go bhfuil sé an bheag, ar fáil don obair seo.</P>
    <P>Seo ceist eachrannach, tá a fhios agam. Nuair a bhímid ag trácht ar scannánaíocht bímid ag caint ar rud idirnáisiúnta ach tá tíortha beaga eile ag déanamh scannán ar fud an domhain agus á ndíol ar fud an domhain.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil bac ar bith á chur orthu i ngeall ar deacrachtaí teangan.  Seachtain ó shin ins an Bheilg chonaic mé féin John Wayne ag labhairt Fraincíse agus job maith á dhéanamh aige.  Bhí an blas aige; níl fhios agam blas Paris, blas Marseilles nó cén blas.  Tá &ldquo;super technology&rdquo; againn agus táimid in ann &ldquo;dubbing&rdquo; agus mar sin de a dhéanamh. Ní dóigh liom gur bac é an teanga.</P>
    <P>Sin an méid atá le rá agam maidir le scannáin as Gaeilge, ach cheap mé go mba cheart tagairt a dhéanamh dó sa Teach seo.  Má táimid i ndáiríre faoin taobh seo den scannánaíocht, ba cheart go mbeadh airgead ar fáil chun an rud sin a dhéanamh, go háirithe chun freastal ar na daoine go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga labhartha acu.</P>
    <P>Mention of the employment that a film industry can give was made by the Minister. It would seem that in the past when outside film makers came here to make films at Ardmore Studios and on location they were very slow to employ key personnel&mdash;directors, producers, top cameramen and so on.  I understand that as yet they have not taken on Irish people in prestigious positions.  I am sure those people are available here but because of the international aspect of film making, and because of the big money and risks involved to promoters and sponsors, they are reluctant to take on new names.  They are happier with established, well-known names in the business where their money will be, as they see it, at a lesser risk.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on the expenditure of this money on Irish made films is legitimate <Col N="63" /> and is something the people involved in the Irish film industry are asking and are concerned about, and rightly so.  The Minister referred to difficulties with the EEC.  If we are seen to be discriminating against any member state we will find ourselves in serious trouble.  In my view there are other areas and departments which find themselves in a similar position, but they get around this problem.  I am not suggesting we should tell lies to the Commission, but there are legitimate ways around the kind of regulation which keeps a very close eye on discriminatory legislation.</P>
    <P>A strong case can be made here because of the infant state of our film industry.  In the normal course of events it should be given some preferential treatment. It has a long way to go.  It has the personnel, the enthusiasm and a fine studio. All it needs is a chance to put down roots, get its head above ground and hope for a little sunshine, but it needs time to do all these things.</P>
    <P>While I am in favour of preferential treatment for the Irish film industry in Irish hands, that does not preclude in any way foreign film makers coming here and using our facilities, let it be through the incentives which will be provided by the board or by using Ardmore Studios and all its ancillary services.  The two go hand in hand, but there may be a danger that when the board are established and it is known internationally that incentives are being provided by the Irish Government for the production of films, there might be an over-abundance of interest shown by outsiders to the possible exclusion of Irish interests.  This is the kind of thing that could happen, although I am not saying it will.  The board, when nominated, will keep a careful eye to ensure a balance in the allocation of funds. When a viable Irish project comes along, I hope the board will give it a nod in the affirmative.  I am sure that will be the Minister's aspiration too.  We do not want to upset the Commission in Brussels or cause them any soul-searching in relation to discrimination.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the board are an <Col N="64" /> experimental project.  They are not engaged in the gratuitous handing out of Exchequer moneys to every Tom, Dick or Harry who may come along.  They are involved in a very competitive, technical business.  I hope the members of the board will have the necessary technical and administrative skills and know-how to ensure that we get value for the money we are providing for this industry.</P>
    <P>The second Bill deals with the studio itself, and the provision of money for NFSI.  As I said at the outset, I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Purely as a watch-dog on public expenditure in recent years that committee criticised expenditure on this project. I do not think the finger was pointed at anybody involved in the studios.  This was looked upon as a global project which did not seem to be getting off the ground.  As has been said, the demands on Exchequer funds are such that we cannot be seen to justify expenditure which does not seem to be getting us anywhere.  The functions of the Committee of Public Accounts include that kind of careful scrutiny in all Departments through their accounting officers.  While no member of that committee could be regarded as a technical expert in the field of film production or in the type of facilities the studios might provide, these matters were not our concern.  We tried to ensure that the expenditure passed by this House would yield a satisfactory return but it did not seem to us that very much was coming back.</P>
    <P>It may be, as is the case in many of these projects, that it was under-capitalised from the start and that the people running the studios found themselves in an impossible position where they could not meet the demands made on them and lost business to better equipped studios. I had the privilege and pleasure of seeing Ardmore Studios while a film was being made.  It was gratifying to see the number of people employed there&mdash;carpenters, scenery painters, electricians, extras, canteen staff and so on.  The only problem is that this is not on a full-time, regular basis because the total dependence on foreign film makers leads to intermittent work for these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> I would hope that, with this new injection of capital and with the existence of a board to direct the industry, there may be a more even spread of activity in the studio which in turn would provide regular employment for people involved in the necessary services during filming.  Apart from the personnel employed at that level there would be provided also very worthwhile and necessary training for our young technologists, for those engaged in lighting, in camera work and so on.  There arises a problem in relation to total reliance on foreign film makers in that these people do not have a commitment to this kind of training programme whereas, presumably, Irish film makers involved in this work would have a commitment and would seek out people for training in the various aspects of the industry and train them to standards that would be acceptable for the production of short or feature films for international distribution.</P>
    <P>People in the film industry may have some reservations about the provisions of both these Bills.  We hope to expand on the details of the legislation on Committee Stage, but the fact that we are talking about this legislation now is a step in the right direction.  I trust that at the end of the period for which this financial allocation is being made, the Minister's threat of this step being a last chance will not have to be implemented and that there will be by then a well-established film industry that will be in a position to remind the Exchequer that they are in a healthy state but that they need so much money to create further improvements and that while they may be self-sufficient they will need involvement at Exchequer level.  A Government should not turn their back on an industry which we hope within the next few years will prove itself to be both vibrant and healthy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity of speaking on these two pieces of legislation but at the outset I wish to apologise on behalf of Deputy Desmond, our spokesman on Industry, Commerce and Tourism, for his absence.  He is engaged at a committee <Col N="66" /> in another part of the House.</P>
      <P>This party welcome this legislation but we would record our regret that we have had to wait until now for these Bills.  The House should be aware that almost 12 months have elapsed since the Bills were published.</P>
      <P>In 1968 the Huston Committee that was set up by the then Government outlined the benefits of an Irish film industry as the development and employment of Irish creative, artistic and technical skills, the opportunity for Irish cinema audiences to see themselves and their way of life reflected on the screen and the projection abroad of a true image of Ireland and of the Irish way of life.  The committee recommended that any Government legislation should have as its primary objective finance for Irish feature films, finance for investment in incoming feature films, distribution and promotion of Irish films, finance for Irish documentary and short films, finance for experimental films and the establishment of a comprehensive film archive.  It may be of help to the Minister to hear that on Committee Stage I propose to review the effectiveness of both these measures but of, essentially, the Irish Film Board Bill against those objectives outlined in the Huston Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that many people may be surprised to learn that there is a long tradition in Ireland of film making, a tradition going back to the early days of this art form.  Perhaps people would be far more surprised to learn that any kind of film industry has survived in a situation in which there has been virtually no encouragement but rather positive discouragement in many ways for the industry.  However, the corner has been turned somewhat in the past ten years in terms of financial assistance but we must distinguish at the outset between a native Irish film industry and the existence of film facilities out at Bray.  What I am saying is rather like saying that it is possible to have a native literature so long as one has a printing press.  The existence of a film making facility is not a guarantee of anything in the absence of native expertise and resources to take <Col N="67" /> advantage of that facility.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party view on this subject is clear and consistent.  We have witnessed once again in our economy the absolute failure of a private enterprise to provide an industry which this country wants and to which this House is now being asked to subscribe.  I am always amazed to hear cries from the far side of the House insisting that the world is flat while we make provision to go around the globe in true recognition of the realities of modern life.  It should be recognised that the ideology of what we are discussing is that there will not be any native Irish film industry if there is not positive State support in a variety of shapes and forms.  In so far as the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has seen fit to have a second Damascus this afternoon in the positive role of the State sector.  I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <P>Basically there is proposed the establishment of a film board which will be in a position to invest, to lend and to make grants available in a variety of ways in order to support the making of films in Ireland.  A limit of £4,100,000 has been put on this in section 10.  Essentially, what the Government are proposing in this Bill is to make available moneys amounting to no more than £4,100,000 for the encouragement of film making here.  That is a positive advance and we welcome it. However, if we wish to create a film industry here we must do more than simply put up the cash.  We need to define the sort of films we are talking about. Will the film industry comprise simply the physical resources in Ardmore Studios; or will it simply be the activities of the National Film Studios and the company which now owns Ardmore on behalf of the State promoting advertising and selling the physical resources of those studios abroad in the hope that they will attract a few major feature films here with the consequent employment of 200 or 300 technicians over a period of time?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party do not believe that that should constitute an Irish film industry. As far as we are concerned, we will <Col N="68" /> not have a native industry until such time as we have Irish producers and directors transforming Irish written material, with the help of Irish actors, actresses, technicians and technical staff, into a film that can be subsequently distributed at home and abroad in such a way as to make all that activity commercially viable and promote and develop our sense of ourselves and the international perception of Ireland today.  I accept that we are discussing what is little more than enabling legislation. However, from what the Minister has said to date, I am not so sure that the Government have the kind of commitment that I would like them to have and that the majority of the people who have successfully lobbied them to introduce this legislation would like them to have.  Mr. Tiernan McBride, a film producer/director, said that the key to what we are all saying is this: unless Irish film producers and directors get support there will never be an Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to representations made by a number of interested bodies and I presume that he was referring to what might be described as the &ldquo;yellow book&rdquo;.  This is a joint submission of amendments to this Bill, produced by the Association of Independent Producers (Ireland), the Irish Film and Television Guild and the Irish Transport and General Workers Union.  They represent important sectors in the film industry. There is also the Irish Actors Equity Group, which is now incorporated in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union.  These are a serious group of professionals and some of their amendments have not been fairly dealt with by the Minister in his opening speech.  When we come to the Committee Stage&mdash;these amendments in similar form will be tabled by me and by Deputy Barry Desmond&mdash;we can discuss them in detail. The proposed amendment to section 4 (1), for instance&mdash;to assist in the distribution and promotion of films made in the State&mdash;does not necessarily confer a statutory obligation on the film board. The idea of establishing a film archive does not create a statutory obligation on the board either.  I hope that the Minister will recognise that these amendments <Col N="69" /> have been carefully drafted by people who derive a livelihood from this fledgling industry and that we are discussing enabling legislation.  The terms and conditions of financial support have not been spelt out in this Bill, nor should they be. We are discussing enabling legislation and, given the reality of its prolonged and difficult birth, it is not unreasonable to ask that it should be as broad as possible and not hindered by fears and unnecessary constraints which the bureaucrats in Brussels or in Kildare Street may feel appropriate.</P>
    <P>There are three or four kinds of films which are likely to be made under the umbrella of this film board.  The first is the international type of production which is successfully attracted to this country.  I support the compliments that the Minister gave in his speech to Mr. John Boorman, the chairman of the NFSI, and indeed to the chief executive, Mr. Seamus Smith, on their successful efforts, over a difficult period and without financial inducements, in attracting a number of major productions to this country.  We recognise, without qualification, that these efforts have resulted in employment being created and that technicians and various skilled personnel in the film industry have derived employment, albeit of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the National Film Studios is reported in <i>The Evening Herald</i> of Wednesday, 1 November 1978, as having said at the annual general meeting some months previously that yet again he had to report that the Film Bill mooted ten years ago did not find its way into law, that as a result we would remain without the financial structures that would make us competitive as a film making country, that last year our facilities were seriously under-used and that there was severe unemployment amongst film workers and that losses were sustained by the company.</P>
    <P>Along with Luxembourg, we are the only states in the EEC without a financial structure for the promotion and the attraction of international-type films. The film board will enable the NFSI to attract in a suitable form productions that <Col N="70" /> would provide a continuous run of employment at the Ardmore Studios. This would have the combined effect of bringing down overheads per unit cost overall and of developing and expanding expertise at a wide technical level for many people in the film industry.  To that extent, just like the attraction of foreign industry in the industrial sector is to be welcomed, we welcome this Bill, but let us have no illusions about what it is.  It is not the foundation or the basis for an Irish film industry because we have seen all too often in the past&mdash;and there is no reason to suppose that it will be different in the future&mdash;that the level of Irish involvement in such film-making activity is very confined and limited with walk-on or walk-off parts for Irish actors and very little role for production, direction or the artistic side of film-making behind the camera or on the screen.</P>
    <P>While the provisions of the Bill will enable people like John Boorman and Seamus Smith to do the job more effectively, that on its own will not create the basis of a national film industry.  A second matter that should be dealt with under the Bill is the facilitation and positive encouragement of Irish produced and directed films.  I am referring to hourlong features that would have a budget of about £750,000 and be written, directed, organised and produced here and would have outlets through a State-assisted system of distribution to reach a market that would provide the backers, including the State, with a reasonable return on capital over a number of years.  To that extent I am concerned at the Minister's apparent indication of discouraging the film board away from the process of distribution.  If we do not crack the difficult nut of providing a marketing and distribution system we will not be helping in any way the creation of a native film industry.  We will not be helping that industry if, having produced good products, we are unable to have them distributed adequately in order to recoup the cost of making them. We have seen through RTE that major television features, technically and artistically well-produced here, can be successfully distributed in a real market for the film industry&mdash;the television market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I am referring to &ldquo;Strumpet City&rdquo; which, from the information I obtained from RTE, looks as if it will at least recoup the cost of producing it and, perhaps, in years to come may make a small profit.  In addition, it has extended the range of competence and skill of a host of film personnel.  A development of that kind of Irish film would be a co-production between an Irish producer and one from another part of the world.  The co-production between RTE and the French television company in the production of &ldquo;The Year of the French&rdquo; is an example of the kind of joint enterprise&mdash;undertaken by State enterprise in both instances&mdash;that will produce an end product which is based not just on the location of a studio in a country, the cheap availability of extras or the low cost of technicians but also on the product ranging from the subject matter through to the acting personnel.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to two other categories of films which fall more in the non-commercial and non-remunerative area but must get equal footing in terms of emphasis, if not in financial support, because their cost is lower.  I am referring to documentary and experimental film making.  There is already a small documentary film making industry here and, as industry and education expand, the need for such films will develop.  In the past we produced some fine documentaries which won reputations abroad. Experimental film making is the ideas house for the film industry and it needs support.  Ironically, it is true to say that that kind of film making got more financial support in the past from the Arts Council, from some local authorities or from industry than did the other types of films I referred to.  There must be a balance between our four forms of films, if one accepts that simple division of the film industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed a reservation as to whether the film industry was the sort of activity that the State can suitably get involved in.  It is only logical and rational for a member of the Irish Labour Party and a Socialist to point out that the <Col N="72" /> private enterprise system has dramatically failed to produce a native film industry. We must ask ourselves if we want such an industry.  If we want one, and the private enterprise system has manifestly failed, then the State must get directly involved in it.  I detect from the Minister's reluctant attitude an unwillingness to do the job properly, having been forced and dragged into doing it in the first place in a certain way.  If the State is prepared at last to pick up the responsibility of promoting this industry, then let us do it properly and professionally.  There are enough examples of successful State enterprises here.  Indeed, the Minister's own agency, the IDA, is the kind of aggressive marketing system of State enterprise I would use as a model to reassure his agnostic doubts as to the viability of an Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>There are other models if the Minister is not prepared to accept the one I have quoted.  Despite the ravages of the Fraser Government in Australia, the Australian industry, which did not exist up to the mid-fifties, was created almost entirely by State promotion.  Those who have had any contact, directly or indirectly, with the Australian film industry are aware of the number of mistakes they made and the lessons to be learned from them. However, the one lesson that cannot be avoided, even by a right wing political party, is that it is the product of State involvement, creation and fostering.  It has succeeded in providing the corps of film personnel required to provide the basics for a successful industry.  The other example, a much older one and one we are more familiar with, is the Film Board of Canada, which has largely dovetailed the activities of Hollywood and produced documentary films.  It is only in recent years that that board has promoted feature films.</P>
    <P>The amendment suggested by the organisations I have referred to are more appropriate to the Committee Stage.  The second Bill we are considering is an enabling piece of legislation which takes account of the existing reality that the State&mdash;properly, in my view&mdash;under a previous Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="73" /> moved in to buy Ardmore Studios through the aegis of RTE in July 1973. There have been criticisms of the financial activities of the NFSI and it is proper that such criticisms should be voiced if they are valid.  I have already quoted the chairman of the company, John Boorman, and I should now like to quote what the Minister said on 13 December 1979, as reported at column 1667 of the Official Report, in reference to Ardmore Studios. He stated:</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has commented very strongly, and unfavourably, on this company, so much so that I had some doubts as to whether I should proceed with the Bill. I decided to do so and to give the studios one final opportunity</P>
    <P>The film industry generally of its nature is not one for which a public type State board is necessarily the most suitable.  It is an imaginative, innovative type of business where artistes and people of originality get strokes of genius and tend to come to the top rather than people who want a steady 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job with a pension at 60 or 65 years of age.  I see the film board, however, being a long-term operation which will be of considerable importance to the whole question of the film industry here.  That industry is by no means confined to the NFSI at Bray.  One must look at it in much broader terms than simply the physical studios which are located at Bray.</P>
    <P>The Minister's view, particularly as expressed in the latter part of that quotation, is one which would be shared not only by me and by my party but certainly by the majority of people in the film industry.</P>
    <P>There may be an unfair criticism of some of the over-budget expenditure of the NFSI and one should have regard to the defence which has been put up by the chairman of the company.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate either on this Stage or on Committee Stage how he sees the financing structure.  I know this is purely enabling legislation but the Minister did go to the expense of hiring consultants <Col N="74" /> and presumably there are draft proposals for the financing structure, the format of which could be made available. In view of comments which have been made in this House by the Minister and others and also at the Committee of Public Accounts it would be useful to have this point clarified.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the matter of the composition of the board.  There is a proposal that the board be expanded from seven to nine and this may be acceptable to the Minister.  He has said that he is not in a position to indicate the possible membership of such a board except to say that the members would need to be very dedicated and enthusiastic people. In line with the Labour Party's consistent view on industrial democracy and worker participation, I would suggest that there should be adequate and reasonable representation of personnel from the film industry.  They should have a stake in the success of the industry both as workers in the field and as directors on a board dispensing public money.  The failure or success of the venture then becomes their joint responsibility and prospects for positive industrial relations are better than if large sections of the film industry work force are effectively excluded.  The scale of the work force is comparatively small; we are not talking about more than 1,000 people, taking into account the Irish Actors' Equity Group and the various sections who would be directly involved in the making of films.  There would obviously be a higher number involved in the distribution and cinema area.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the film archive.  A very reasonable request for encouragement for a film archive was made in one of the submissions to the Minister.  He should feel reasonably happy with the quality of the submissions he has received in view of their brevity and precision in terms of confining themselves to the proposed legislation.  Lawmaking might be a bit more constructive if every other piece of legislation were to get the same kind of response.  I would be happy to be corrected if I am wrong in my impression that the Minister does not <Col N="75" /> see the encouragement of a national film archive as germane or essential to the role of the Irish Film Board and that any proposal to make it possible might confer on the board a statutory obligation.  I would not accept such a view and I believe the opportunity should not be lost to make it possible for the film board at the outset or at some stage in the future to set up a national film archive.  They should not be statutorily barred from doing so because we have not seen fit to include provision for it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has introduced these two Bills and that the Government are prepared, however reluctantly, to recognise the role of the State in promoting and creating this industry.  No film maker in this country would state that we have an Irish film industry and they would all agree that we will not have one until the State steps in positively and productively.  There is widespread support in principle among potential film personnel for the enactment of this Bill with a number of amendments. I do not believe that any of the proposed amendments can be considered in any way dangerous.  The matter of potential conflict with the Commission in Brussels can be dealt with by negotiation. I am wary about our over-sensitivity in being so communitaire in these matters when there is chaos ranging from London to Sicily concerning EEC regulations.  I wonder if hiding behind that excuse or explanation there may be another one and if so it should be discussed openly. The promotion of an Irish film industry which would promote Irish culture must be found, with all the Arts degrees which abound in various Departments in Kildare Street, to hang in neatly and comfortably under one clause in the Treaty of Rome.  It should not tax too much the intelligentsia of the civil service to find a flag of convenience on which to hang that one.  We are not talking about something which will cripple the European film industry.  If there is an argument for not steering money on the 80-20 per cent split which the film industry has lost, let us have it fully argued and not thinly <Col N="76" /> opposed on the basis of the Brussels bureaucrats.  I look forward to dealing with this matter on Committee Stage and on behalf of my party I welcome this Bill which we will be supporting on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: These two Bills are welcome so far as this party are concerned and, while we do not quarrel with the Minister's method of saving time by dealing with the two Bills together on Second Stage, it is right to point out that they deal with very different subjects.  It is true that they both have relevance to film making but one of the Bills is intended to provide a statutory structure on which the tottering figure of the Ardmore Studios can be placed and which will sustain it, a figure into which a great deal of State money has already been poured.  The other Bill is intended at last to provide a launching pad for a native Irish film industry and this is, in my opinion, the more important of the two Bills.  The aims of the Bills have really very little to do with one another.  One could seek to be justified quite independently of the other and one does not depend in any way on the other.</P>
      <P>It would be a pity if the fact that we are debating the film studios Bill along with the film board Bill should lead us to deal with the latter Bill purely on the basis of what would produce the greatest economic advantage.  I am not sure if the Minister's Department have really grasped the fact that a film industry, although of course it gives employment and has other spin-offs, is essentially a scene in which people work at producing an artistic result.  I feel that is the only value it has.  I am not qualified to talk to the House with authority on this subject but I believe I can say&mdash;I hope humbly&mdash;that I do not see any special value in Ireland having a film industry as distinct from a forklift industry, a wrist watch industry or any other kind of industry if all that industry will do is turn out, essentially, commercials for the country in one shape or form.  I mean that in the broadest sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister has not overlooked the question of artistic skills he has, at <Col N="77" /> the outset of his speech, allowed them to disappear into the background compared with the promotion of tourism.  Tourism has a value to our economy in its own right and the tourist board presumably have statutory powers very adequate to support them in the production of film material if they feel they need that in order to generate extra tourist revenue. I cannot see that we should be going to great lengths to establish a film industry if one of its express purposes in the Minister's speech, even though it is not visible in the Bill, is the promotion of tourism.</P>
    <P>That is not a film industry as the word is understood in Sweden, Italy or Poland. That is not the purpose of a film industry. That is merely a by-product or an ancillary activity of the tourist industry.  The Minister is now responsible for the tourist industry and I wish him luck in this regard.  I am all for the tourist industry using every means it can, including the making of films, for which I am sure its statutory powers suffice, to attract people to come to the country; but it most certainly ought not to figure among the express objects of a Film Industry Bill.</P>
    <P>The next item mentioned in the Minister's speech is the promotion of cultural values.  I believe I know the Minister well enough to guess that he would rightly shy away from any effort by other people to make him give a lecture on cultural values. He would rightly shy away from any attempt to define cultural values or explain what they mean.  Any man who tries to explain that phrase is in a weak position which gets weaker as he goes along.  Public relations has nothing whatever to do with what a film industry should be there to achieve.  If the country needs public relations in the sense of explaining itself to its neighbours, making a good impression on its neighbours, I believe it already has adequate organs for doing that.  There is no reason why our Government <i>via</i> the Government Information Service should not make all the films they want by whatever means they want in order to deliver whatever public relations message they feel is appropriate and needed.  Most certainly it has nothing to do with the film industry <Col N="78" /> as that word is understood in the outside world.</P>
    <P>We find a great trumpet of rubbish in the Minister's speech when he says &ldquo;providing a potent means of presenting this country, its heritage and its people to the world and of keeping Irish people in touch with their distinctive environment&rdquo;. I am afraid there was a time when Irish people used to lament that wherever they went in Europe or anywhere else in the world nobody had ever heard of them.  They, with that awful little village sense of smallness of themselves, used to lament the fact that if they walked into a hotel in France, Greece or anywhere else and said they were from Ireland people thought they were saying they were from Holland.  They thought this was a sign of our great backwardness, that some unlettered or halflettered innkeeper in one of those places had never heard of Ireland. That situation has changed since about 1969.  Everybody has now heard of Ireland, but for the wrong reasons.  It is my experience that, if one goes into one of the most remote parts of Europe and one is foolish enough to say where one is from, one can immediately kiss goodbye to half an hour of one's holiday because, while people do not make noises imitating a machine gun or a bomb, they will sit down and ask one to explain what is going on in our country or why we are murdering each other.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is a busy and dedicated man and he cannot be expected to stand literally over every word in a Dáil speech but surely he is not asking the House to accept a Bill, to which otherwise we have no objection, on the basis that it will help us to present the country, its heritage and its people.  So far as that consists of murder and savagery, I would sooner keep it out of sight. So far as its people consist of those who sympathise with such things, they should also be kept out of sight and not presented to the world.  The notion is absolutely cracked that one can depict a heritage and a people and flatter oneself by putting it on film, that one can actually sell it to them as distinct from forcing it upon them by way of tourist advertising.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> I am glad that these objects have not been written into the Bill, because I do not subscribe to them.  I would not support the Bill if I thought this was what the whole thing was about.  The Bill should have nothing whatever to do with presenting ourselves to the neighbours, trying to show them our scenery, our priceless cultural heritage or anything of that kind.  The only respectable object of an Irish film industry, as distinct from casual films made by the tourist board, the Government Information Service, the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála or anybody else, is to provide assistance for artists&mdash;I mean by that directors in the first instance but also all the other people who make a film&mdash;to develop an art form which exists in many other places in the world and which, if it existed in Ireland, might develop a dimension in Ireland which would be unique.  If it is not that, it has no value; if it is not that, it is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>The £4 million which the Minister proposes to spend could be far better spent some other way, such as increasing a grant to Bord Fáilte, under the head of cinematic promotion, the Government Information service, the IDA or Córas Tráchtála.  Unless this money helps us to produce a Polanski, if such a person exists in the country, then I see no special value at all in this Bill.  I accept that that object, among others, is one which the Minister would wish to achieve, but I am sorry to see that it is so deeply buried in all this stuff about promotion of tourism, public relations and potent means of presenting the country and its heritage to the world. That ought to have nothing whatever to do with an Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>It is not simply the Minister's speech which is at issue here and it is not simply the words which he uses which are not in the Bill.  The Minister will in due course have the duty of appointing members to this board.  I am afraid I can see looming up on the horizon the members of that board.  I could very nearly name them myself or name a couple dozen people and be reasonably sure that, at least if the speech is anything to go by, the seven <Col N="80" /> members of the board the Minister picks will be from them.  If there are people whose view is being directed to the things mentioned in the Minister's speech they will be the wrong people to put on the board.</P>
    <P>It has often seemed to me a sign of the degree to which not so much the country but Irish society and a lot of Irish people&mdash;and I suppose that must include the Minister and myself because I am not going to make exceptions&mdash;have failed to become completely adult in the way that the world outside understands, that so much of our dramatic art is introspective and self-absorbed and really so childish in a way.  The people's idea of a play about Ireland is not just a play which is set in Ireland in which human beings, men and women, with the same feelings and troubles and preoccupations that men and women have everywhere else just happen to be present on this bit of land; it is a play in which the awful old agonies of the Irish historical heritage, or supposed historical heritage or myths about the Irish heritage are dragged out and are made the scene of individual anguish and are made the subject of individual anguish.  I know there has been plenty of anguish in the country but I just cannot believe that people have not got every other passion here as well.  I cannot believe that the passions, which the other film makers or writers or authors write about quite independently of their nationality and without dragging in France or Poland by the scruff of the neck, do not exist here and do not flourish here and proliferate exuberantly in this country as well as feelings which are tied up with mother Ireland.  I just do not believe it.  I am made to think it; a collective establishment effort has been made to make me suppose that ever since I was a school child, but I simply do not believe it and I am glad to see that in the theatre in recent years Irish playwrights have emerged who are capable of feeling strongly about a dramatic situation and putting it into a well-written, well-constructed and extremely fine play which is only accidentally sited in Ireland in which perhaps the only moment in which the green pillar box shows its head is when a <Col N="81" /> telephone call is made to the local exchange or when a policeman enters or something of that kind but in which otherwise the action is irrelevant to the nationality.  That is a sign of approaching adulthood, thanks be to God.  That is a sign that we are growing up at last.  It is a sign that we are growing up at last when a playwright like Brian Friel or Hugh Leonard is able to succeed not only here but across the Atlantic and anywhere else English is understood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Are not, say, O'Casey's plays applicable anywhere?  They happened to be set here and they happened to deal with the tragedies and anguish of Irish history but the conditions they deal with are surely very deeply appreciated and felt everywhere else in the world and that is, therefore, the reverse of the Deputy's argument and equally true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister is quite right to mention those plays of O'Casey.  I presume he is talking about the three famous plays.  I do not suppose he would stand over all of O'Caseys subsequent productions.  That is perfectly true and I do not deny that a national convulsion must, not legitimately at all but necessarily, find a place in art.  It must be so but I want to draw the Minister's attention to this.  O'Casey's play, &ldquo;The Shadow of a Gun Man&rdquo;, for example, was written when the Civil War was raging here and that was produced in 1923 and it was shown to an audience which, only the week before, had heard bombs and bullets and seen reports of executions and executions of people who had not even been tried.  It was red hot to them and they really felt it.  But 60 years have gone by.  I know there is a tragedy going on in the North of Ireland but surely we do not always have to be looking at that stuff; we do not always have to be preoccupied with our own exquisite anguish in the historical mystery of being an Irish man or an Irish woman.  Other people are not like that.  I do not have to tell the Minister that.  He is man of the world enough to know it.  Other people have problems far worse than we had.  There has been no war in this country that by outside standards <Col N="82" /> would be reckoned a war since 1691. That is the last time a pitched battle was fought on Irish soil between two professional armies.  What other European country can boast that degree of peace except for our neighbours on the next island?  And our neighbours on the next island had been continually involved in wars which required them to expend blood in enormous quantities compared with any casualties of the Irish race in those three centuries.  I am not trying to belittle people who suffered or are still suffering but I am saying that measured by the standard of the European Continent, let alone Combodia or anywhere else, what this country was put through in anguish through its nation, through its history, is negligible and it is a sign of childishness that we should be always harping on it and that we do not think a play is Irish unless it drags this thing in by the scruff of the neck, that we do not think a television play is Irish unless somehow the Irish tragedy is the centre of it.  Surely people are in love here; surely people are angry with each other and envious of each other; surely people are avaricious here and surely we have all the other themes which, since the world began, since Europe woke up, 3,000 years ago, have served as sufficient material for artists in every branch without the national tragedy being always dragged in or if it is not dragged in it is around the corner, visible in shape of somebody with a wound which will maim him for the rest of his life.</P>
      <P>I am afraid when I see this stuff written here in this speech that what the Minister has in mind by a board is a board of people who will not think a film is Irish unless in some way that national wound features heavily in it and that the film&mdash; and I do not mean to be blasphemous but if one can personify it&mdash;will, as it were, be pointing to this wound.  That is no way to start.</P>

But he did not say very much about the strictly artistic dimension of this enterprise which, though I am not qualified to lecture about it, I, in a humble way, perceive to exist and which for me would be the central part of the enterprise's value and all I find him mentioning here are various points with these characteristic little hyphens in front of them as though each had a value of its own which we might not be able to sort out for ourselves unless the type was indented and hyphenated. When I find that those are the things which he particularly picks out I become apprehensive of what this Bill is going to do.</P>

      <P>: As I was saying some few months ago.  I welcome any effort being made, including those incorporated in this Bill, to bring about some sense of awakening in regard to our national heritage.  Every country has its own rich heritage.  It would appear that most European countries take the necessary steps to preserve and enrich that heritage and to have it cultivated in so far as national Governments are concerned. In that regard we are very much behind the times.  I am afraid we are allowing our heritage and everything held near and dear by past generations to die painfully. Indeed I have often wondered if we were not making a deliberate effort to sell out completely our national heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to allow our very great past tradition to die because it is through our cultural heritage that we can be identified as a nation. Apart from monuments, stones, ancient raths and the like there is more attached to the preservation of our national heritage. Although they form a very important part there is something more important and vital, that is our language which is part of our culture and heritage.  I am quite satisfied that on all sides of the House sufficient has not been done to <Col N="85" /> date by way of cultivation of our language as part of that heritage.</P>
    <P>We have our songs, dances, customs, our arts, crafts and trades.  Most of the old Irish arts and crafts have been allowed die out, which is not at all in the interest of future generations.  Indeed, most of the good old Irish writings are seemingly now to perish.  Indeed, it is my opinion that most of the songs and dances, and particularly the plays we see nowadays, belittle past generations and are not in accordance with real Irish traditions and culture.  For example, in most of these writings and plays the Irish are portrayed as being either bastards or alcoholics, people completely beholden to drink.  Whilst it may provide some amusement for some people the true picture of the Irish nation, culture and traditions is not being portrayed.  Steps should be taken to preserve the old country publichouse which is dying out and is being replaced by modern, high-powered &ldquo;musical&rdquo; lounges.</P>
    <P>I feel also that our archaeological heritage is not being preserved as it should be.  Indeed, such archaeological heritage could be preserved in line with other conservation and with the provision of ample and suitable accommodation for those in need of housing.  In this connection perhaps the Minister of State might make a profitable visit to the town of Youghal to see the amount of useful and valuable work being undertaken there.</P>
    <P>Again very little is being done in relation to the preservation of our heritage which is to be found under water.  We are not examining, acting on and implementing the recommendations of the Council of Europe in relation to the whole of our national heritage.  Before the end of November I hope to call a meeting of Deputies of all parties for the purpose of getting a group together, Deputies who are dedicated to and interested in the preservation of our heritage so that we may examine the recommendations of the Council of Europe, ascertain where we fall short of them and what we can do to assist the relevant Minister, and indeed the Government, in their implemention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> I cannot say very much about metal detectors in the limited time available to me but a public hearing could well be held here in the city of Dublin under the auspices of the Council of Europe.  I will be engaged in a public hearing in the city of Paris during the month of December. People use metal detectors in the course of various hobbies and pastimes but they should not be allowed to use them on archaeological sites.  A public hearing in this city could be put to good use to ascertain the views of the many hundreds of people interested in these metal detectors.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister of State to endeavour to create a greater awareness of and interest in our national heritage by submitting more applications to Europa Nostra, an organisation doing very valuable work in this regard.  I am particularly interested in the preservation or renewal of our old crafts.  For example, the craft of thatchery has died out completely and we all know there is nothing nicer to look at than an old thatched house.  The blacksmith's forge has gone, as has the blacksmith himself.  The harness maker has gone, the country shoemaker, the whitesmith has gone also.  Yet we have in Venice the Council of Europe Crafts School at which very little Irish interest is being shown by way of sending Irish nationals there for the purpose of renewing those old crafts or in showing some enthusiastic approach.</P>
    <P>We have beautiful waterfalls and we have bridges with arches beneath them. Then there are the country pumps, landmarks in themselves, which are disappearing also.  This House should get down to some solid work in this respect.  If we cannot do it in the House then it should be done by way of a committee.  I am speaking now with the authority of the leader of the Irish Delegation to the Council of Europe.  I should say that we hope to arouse new interest amongst Irish parliamentarians in relation to our culture and heritage because we have much to contribute.  It is only when we go abroad and see the interest of other national parliaments in legislation such as this that our enthusiasm is aroused. <Col N="87" /> Invariably we find we lag behind in these matters, something which should not happen, because if we allow our arts and crafts, culture and traditions to die out we will not be thanked by future generations. There is the grave danger that our national traditions, outlook, pastimes and everything held dear by past generations will become foreign to us.  We are afforded an opportunity to do something about their preservation for future generations. That is why I feel that a group of parliamentarians assembling for at least one hour each month could contribute much along the lines I am speaking about.</P>
    <P>I compliment the drafters of this Bill. At least it goes some way towards focusing attention on the vital importance of everything that is near and dear to us as a nation.  We should not allow our traditions to die out.  We should not allow the modern, materialistic atmosphere to prevail completely, thus clouding all the things so dearly held by previous generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The preservation of our heritage means different things to different people.  Our educational system should lead each one of us to be very jealous indeed in preserving everything of our heritage.  Our own language is first on the list.  I do not suggest preserving it as one would preserve an antique, but to spread the use of the language to the greater possible extent. I pay tribute to all who try to preserve our heritage, whatever sphere is involved.  We must pay tribute to the mover of the Bill for going to the trouble of doing so.  However, with all due respect, our Minister of State has told us that a Bill is being prepared which I hope will be enacted by the House and will be an instrument to ensure that nothing worth preserving is lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years I was a member of the council of the city of Dublin, which is perhaps the most maligned body in the field of preservation.  We often intiated <Col N="88" /> a scheme to preserve certain areas and were set upon and accused of being vandals or philistines because our scheme did not accord with the more refined views of the preservationists.  Some of the people who have shouted most loudly for preservation have done a lot of harm in our city of Dublin.  If a project undertaken by a public authority is held up by objections, local authorities, through taxation or by money from the Government, can pay the cost.  However, any small builder who might find something worth preserving fears press publicity of that find.  The attitude then is &ldquo;Preserve the site&rdquo;.  That man cannot afford to do that because finances are not available to ensure that he will not be held back. There may well be a tendency for developers of sites to hide valuable finds and, far from helping in preservation, the people shouting about preserving sites force or tempt these people to hide their finds.</P>
    <P>We have a very rich heritage, whether coming from the Vikings, the Saxons or the Normans.  These contributed to our culture and we absorbed them all.  We must learn from abroad how properly to preserve.  Deputy Flanagan mentioned the city of York.  When I was on the Dublin City Council some members were sent to view the site.  The authorities there said &ldquo;You may have 18 months to excavate, after which you must leave the site.  We are going to build here.&rdquo;  What they built there was a museum, preserving all the artefacts found on the site.  If Dublin Corporation did the same, we would say very much more for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject which I am sure is very near all our hearts.  We must start with our educational system.  Teachers very often work under very difficult conditions. They must try to impart as much knowledge as they can and may no have much opportunity for the teaching of civics or, in its broader sense, the preservation of our heritage.  I am thinking now of finds like statues and relics of the past.  The State must ensure that where money is needed for this work it will be forthcoming. I read in a report from the Council <Col N="89" /> of Europe that a young Greek, while doing some underwater investigations, found a statue of Alexander the Great which is worth 3 million drachma.  I do not know the present rate of exchange for drachma but that does not matter. This recovery of a statue of one of the greatest people who ever lived makes me wonder how far we have got in underwater excavations or restoration.</P>
    <P>What constitutes a good find?  Many people think the <i>Lusitania</i>, which was sunk in the First World War, would be very interesting indeed, though not from an archaeological point of view.  How can we spend money correctly to ensure that people will be very jealous to guard our heritage in every sphere, perhaps literature or a physical feature of the country? We have had for some years a great cry to preserve our Georgian houses but it is difficult to make up one's mind what should be preserved and what should not be preserved.  In a couple of hundred years' time, if the world lasts that long, we will probably have a society for the preservation of some office block which went up this year and people will become quite hot under the collar about it.  They will praise the designs of the office blocks, saying that it shows how people lived in this century.  We need a correct set of values to put us on the right road to real preservation.</P>
    <P>I have faith in the Minister's promise that a Bill will come before the Oireachtas which will ensure that there is no vandalising of our heritage.  We must educate people generally, including after school.  It is good to know that people in our, or any, city wish to preserve Georgian or other buildings.  An interest in preserving the past will often impinge on the living conditions of the present generation. People often say that the view of a cathedral is being blocked.  I remember the time when the view of a cathedral was blocked out by tenement buildings in which many families lived.  I heard very little outcry about the living conditions of people in tenement buildings which blocked the view of the church.  There were those&mdash;I might take some credit for it&mdash;who were not terribly good on heritage <Col N="90" /> preservation, who thought that the most important thing was to preserve a decent standard of living for the people, that they should come first.  People on the council and the corporation decided they would knock down the buildings near the cathedral.  This had a two-fold effect. First, it proved we could have proper conditions for our people and, secondly, it revealed a good view of the cathedral.</P>
    <P>We should try to make our people aware of the richness of our heritage.  The more affluent section of our society should realise that people generally will preserve these things once we have shown them their value.  We have to get away from the notion that the preservation of our heritage belongs to any one section.  Unless we involve everybody, it will be a failure.  The good will of people who live in the city and are proud of it, or in very small towns, is very important in preserving anything worth preserving.</P>
    <P>Through the Council of Europe we can tell others what we have done in Ireland and we can learn from them.  There is a great amount of work being done.  It may well be said that we have higher priorities than archaeological excavations.  The Department of Education might examine how far we can go with an educational programme to teach people that the preservation of our heritage is just as valuable as the preservation of our finances.  We are a cultured people but we can learn a lot from the Scandinavians, the Germans, the French and the British. They are wealthier countries but they may not be as wealthy in historic buildings as we are.  I can recall professors of archaeology here who were second to none.  I did a course on archaeology under one of them and it was one of the most interesting experiences of my life to hear that man lecture and the love he had for his subject.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned getting together to see how interested we are in this House in preservation.  We are all very interested in it.  My own party have a series of committees, one of which deals, to some extent, with this subject. The Council of Europe has blazed a trail in this regard.  We have many institutions <Col N="91" /> in Ireland which are worthy of support, so I do not think there is any need to set up another body.  I am sure that the Hibernian Academy or the National Museum would be very willing to help in any way possible to instruct Members of the House on what they can do to help.  I hope the Minister's Bill will be a simple Bill which will show people what we can do.  I would like to list also a number of priorities for what we should preserve first of all.  It will be costly in many ways. Goodwill comes from all sides of the House.  We do not oppose Deputy Donnellan's Bill for the sake of opposing it. I ask him not to press the Bill until he sees the Government's Bill.  Then we can go through all the Stages here and produce a good Bill.</P>
    <P>I praise Fine Gael for producing this Bill.  I know they are not taking the full time on this Bill this week for understandable reasons.  I suggest that the mover should withdraw the Bill and let the Government bring in their Bill which will be a very good Bill.  When the Government Bill comes before the House Deputies will find that we are not opposed to their measure in principle.  We think we have a better Bill to put before Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>: We will do everything we can to expedite the introduction of the Bill.  We have given the Deputy's Whip a list of the legislation we will be introducing this session.  It is quite a long list. I am prepared to do everything I possibly can, however limited, to press for the introduction of this Bill.  With the goodwill of the House we could have a very good Bill.  I know it is dear to the hearts of Fine Gael Deputies that we have a proper Bill which will ensure that there will be no disruption of any national monuments or anything which reveals more of our past to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Opposition to let us present a united front on a Bill introduced <Col N="92" /> by the Government.  The Government have an advantage over the Fine Gael Party in that they have people to prepare Bills for them.  We all want to ensure that our national heritage is preserved. I know Fine Gael Deputies are sincere about this.  They went to a lot of trouble to prepare this Bill, but we will be repeating all our arguments in a short while when the Minister introduces his Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

Because of the structure of Parliament the Government have resources at their disposal to assist them in introducing Bills.  We do not deride the efforts of the Fine Gael Party.  Perhaps they had to rush their Bill because of certain criticisms.</P>

People are interested in this legislation but, as the Deputy knows.  Deputies from all parties are working hard in their rooms dealing with other matters and therefore they cannot be in the House.  I suggest that the Opposition should withdraw this Bill.  The Minister has prepared a Government Bill and I am <Col N="93" /> sure it is a fine Bill.  We are all interested in ensuring that we preserve our national heritage.</P>

Fine Gael deserve credit for having gone to the trouble of introducing a Bill, but I do not think it is the best Bill.

I trust that your occupancy of the Chair will be long and fruitful and that it will lead to the successful and quiet running of this House.  I have no doubt that it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to subtitle this Bill &ldquo;A <Col N="96" /> future for our past&rdquo; and to congratulate Deputies Donellan and Bruton on their initiative in producing the Bill.  There is an old proverb which states &ldquo;It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness&rdquo;. Perhaps it was in this vein that Fine Gael undertook to light a candle to throw some light on this area that has been in darkness throughout the years, to give a lead to the Government and to prick their conscience into taking some action.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has urged us to withdraw the Bill.  He told us that the Government will introduce their own Bill.  We have been waiting since 1954 for another Bill to update legislation on national monuments.  We were promised a Bill by the Minister of State and when the Minister himself was speaking he said that he would introduce his Bill after the summer recess.  Looking through the legislation listed for the period up to Christmas, I see no indication that such a Bill will be introduced.  I think it is a stalling tactic by the Government to forestall us and to delay the introduction of a Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not take up the offer made by our spokesman, Deputy Donellan, when he asked the Government to let the Bill go through to Committee Stage with the option on the part of the Government of introducing any amendments they saw fit so that in the final analysis we would have a well-rounded Bill dealing with our national heritage and which would meet some of the obvious voids in the present legislation. There is no doubt that new legislation is needed.  New technology and advancements in the agricultural and industrial sectors militate against the preservation of our priceless heritage. We hold our heritage in trust for future generations and there is a serious obligation on us to consider carefully that duty.  We are the custodians of our heritage for our children.  With the daily wrecking of national monuments, historic buildings, streetscapes and the interior of houses, I do not think we can wait any longer for legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moore, has been at pains to ask us to withdraw <Col N="97" /> this Bill.  We cannot.  We are putting it forward as a positive contribution towards our national heritage.  This Bill has been well researched and well documented. We admit there are aspects of it that could be improved and we asked the Government to join with us in bringing forward a Bill worthy of everybody in this House.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister's attitude makes this Dáil more irrelevant. We have heard a lot of talk recently about the irrelevancy of the Dáil and of the Opposition parties.  The Minister, by throwing out this Bill, is strengthening these accusations.  Is he discarding it purely because it comes from the Opposition? To me this was a perfect example of where the Government could accept a non-controversial, non-political Bill which was intended for the promotion and advancement of all Ireland, North and South.  I can see no valid reason why the Government should refuse to allow this Bill to go through this House and be amended.  We would facilitate and co-operate with the Government in every respect, but rather than accept this offer of goodwill the Minister callously cast us aside.</P>
    <P>He admitted there are parts of the Bill worth having.  When he said he could not accept it, I was disappointed because the whole trend of his speech led me to believe that a little light might have been seen in the Office of Public Works and that he would accept this Bill.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  Again we are playing politics with our national heritage. The Minister by rejecting this offer of goodwill and co-operation from the Opposition has given strength to the accusations that Opposition parties and the Dáil are irrelevant.  This House might itself become a national monument if the present procedures are continued.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of concern about the preservation of our national heritage.  An Taisce recently came out very strongly and pinpointed the areas where legislation is needed.  Some of these areas are covered in this Bill.  An Taisce mentioned streets in this capital city where historic buildings were destroyed and demolished <Col N="98" /> by juggernauts and JCB diggers.  They give a list of Dublin streets that have been destroyed forever.  In a plea from their hearts they have asked that some action be taken.  As a result, Fine Gael decided they would do something rather than sit back and see the destruction continued and perpetrated.  It was in that light that this Bill was born, but now unfortunately it is to be aborted by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>An Taisce listed a number of streets and, with the permission of the Chair, I will just mention a few.  A terrace of houses in Bolton Street dating back to 1722 was demolished in 1979.  Likewise, Molesworth Street has been marred by developers.  The ESB office development in Lower Fitzwilliam Street destroyed one of the finest vistas of an unbroken row of Georgian Houses in Dublin.  The south side of Mountjoy Square has become a wreck.  Harcourt Street is likely to be partially demolished and precious ceilings, stairways, interiors of houses and friezes have been wrecked.  This is an example of what is being done to our capital city.  I am concerned that the centre of this city is becoming like a blitzed site.  Anyone who loves this city must feel ashamed that we have allowed it to become such a wreck, especially when we visit other capital cities and see what has been done to preserve them and what could be done to save our city.</P>
    <P>Urgent legislation is needed. Obviously the Planning Acts of 1963 are totally inadequate.  They need updating. Financial assistance must be given to encourage people to preserve and conserve historic buildings and national monuments.  We have a plethora of legislation in EEC countries.  Every encouragement is given by those governments to individuals, local corporations or county councils to help them to preserve, conserve, develop and maintain their priceless national heritage and architecture.</P>
    <P>I am told that in France historical monuments and buildings have been strictly listed.  That government will give 60 per cent loans to anybody wishing to restore a historic building.  If we had adopted <Col N="99" /> such a plan I have no doubt that some of the Dublin streetscapes which have been destroyed forever would have been preserved.</P>
    <P>In Germany money spent maintaining historic buildings can be claimed against income tax and death duties and property tax mitigated for listed buildings.  In the legislation the Minister is thinking of introducing perhaps he will consider giving similar concessions to property developers or to people who are prepared to maintain historic buildings.</P>
    <P>In Denmark the State has a special building fund which allows threatened historic buildings to be purchased, restored and then resold on the open market.  In Italy there is provision for half the cost of restoration to be paid by the State in respect of listed buildings while in Holland the local authority not only give a grant towards the restoration of fine buildings but offer, free of charge, a specialised architectural and research service for owners of such buildings.  Also in Holland the owners of listed buildings can avail of aid for assembling historic brickwork, masonry, timber and ironwork for accurate restoration.  In England the statutory list includes the huge number of 260,000 buildings as a result of an ambitious attempt to preserve not only the finest historic buildings but also many ordinary homes of historic interest. These are some of the aids and concessions given by our neighbours in the EEC in this area.  These people value the contribution that they can make towards preserving their architectural heritage.  They give every facitity to developers in respect of this work.  In an effort to be helpful I would express the hope that in the legislation which the Minister of State says is forthcoming, the example of our counterparts in these other countries would be followed in order that every help and encouragement be given to developers here even at this late hour to preserve what remains of our heritage. However, even members of An Taisce are of the opinion that the legislation may be too late but I would urge the Minister even at this stage to take note of what is <Col N="100" /> happening in this field so far as the other EEC countries are concerned.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Council of Europe we are mandated to introduce such legislation. The Minister has quoted from a report of the Parliamentary Assembly in this regard.  In the report in question the assembly, recording the European Charter on architectural heritage promulgated in 1975 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, declared that Europe's unique architecture is the common heritage of all the people of Europe and that each of the countries must recognise a common duty to ensure the protection of their heritage. The observation was made that Europe's precious and irreplaceable architectural heritage continued to be threatened by neglect, decay, demolition and incongruous new construction.  The Assembly remarked that while increasing attention had been given in the previous years to this problem the action being taken was still inadequate and was proceeding much too slowly.  Unfortunately, that situation applies to Ireland.  While there is a general awareness of the need for action that action is not nearly adequate.  The members went on to say that since it was accepted that the protection of European architecture was a common responsibility, all European countries should endeavour in so far as possible to apply comparable criteria for the listing of buildings and of areas of architectural interest and should adopt effective legislative, administrative and financial measures for their conservation of our historic buildings. The Council said that they were anxious that steps be taken without delay to speed up the work of listing buildings of architectural interest in both town and country. They stressed the importance of identifying and designating buildings and places of architectural interest.</P>
    <P>It is in accordance with that mandate that Fine Gael have taken the positive step of introducing this Bill.  As Deputy Donnellan has said, the Bill may need amending or may need additional sections but at least it pinpoints some of the loopholes in our existing legislation particularly in regard to shipwrecks or <Col N="101" /> underwater heritage.  Section 3 of the Bill is an attempt to close that loophole.</P>
    <P>I am proud that the beautiful Derrynaflan Chalice was found in my constituency of South Tipperary.  The chalice and the paten discovered with it date back to the 8th or 9th centuries.  We should be very proud that 1,200 years ago there were craftsmen of the calibre who produced such magnificant work.  It is fitting that we compliment the person who found those objects for the manner in which he acted in reporting the find immediately and in ensuring that the treasures would be preserved forever for the nation.  However, not everyone might agree with the method by which the treasures were discovered.  The use of an electronic device in detecting metals has given rise to concern in regard to the possible damage or loss that may be caused in respect of non-metal objects of great historic value.  For example, irreparable damage can be caused to sites by the use of these detectors especially by persons inexperienced in this area.  This is one sphere in which the Dáil could introduce very worthwhile legislation. We appreciate that some people use these instruments in pursuit of a hobby or for recreation but such detectors should be used only under licence in the area of a national monument.  This would ensure that irreparable damage would not be caused to any of our national monuments.  Section 8 of the Bill deals with this question.</P>
    <P>I shall not involve myself in the Wood Quay debate except to say that the whole matter was a sad saga.  Dublin Corporation cannot be blamed totally for what happened because there was indecision on all sides so far as the area was concerned despite our having got definite instructions from the Council of Europe in regard to its preservation.  The whole episode was a sad chapter in our history and it is regrettable that there is not adequate legislation on the Statute Book to ensure that something similar would not happen in the future.  If we had the necessary legislation we would ensure that only with the consent of this House and after all the factors had been aired <Col N="102" /> could such major works be undertaken. What happened at Wood Quay amounted to the destruction of what was acknowledged to be one of the major Viking finds ever.  Perhaps the Government of the day were to blame in that they did not introduce legislation to ensure the preservation of Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>However, there is nothing that we can say that can protect Wood Quay now. Perhaps it was the destruction of that monument more than anything else that the framers of this Bill had in mind in including section 9&mdash;that they were endeavouring to ensure that something like that would never happen again.  If section 9 were accepted by the Government it would ensure that we would never again have a repeat of the waste of time and energy and of the international criticism from archaeologists that we had in relation to Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to be proud of here. Recently, there was an exhibition of early Irish art in New York which covered the period from 1500 BC to 1500 AD and it received high acclaim all over America. This exhibition can now be seen in the National Museum and here we have the Ardagh Chalice, the Book of Kells, the Tara Brooch and many other priceless relics.  To see this exhibition would make one proud of the past which has left such priceless relics.  This exhibition is presently confined to Dublin but I hope it can be brought to other parts of Ireland and even to Belfast because our heritage transcends the Border.  If we approach our common heritage properly people both North and South will know how much they have in common and that the differences are few.</P>
    <P>We were all proud of the &ldquo;Sense of Ireland&rdquo; exhibition in London which showed what is best in Irish culture.  This sort of thing will give Ireland the name we would like it to have rather than the name it presently has because of the troubles in the North.</P>
    <P>A lot could be said about the museum but I have not time to develop that aspect.  Our National Museum is in deplorable condition and it is not worthy <Col N="103" /> to be the receptacle of our priceless treasures. The year 1981 has been designated Urban Renaissance Year and this would be an opportune time for the Minister to introduce his Bill.</P>

      <P>: We should make an all-out effort in 1981 to ensure that our towns and cities are preserved and that people are made more aware of the priceless heritage on their doorsteps.  We will give the Minister every assistance to bring home to school children and to the people in general the importance of preserving our heritage.  It is gratifying to see school children on educational tours attending the National Museum to see these exhibitions of early Irish art.  Great strides have been made in the school curriculum in relation to teaching children the value of our national heritage.  With the Government and the Opposition working together we can ensure that it cannot be levied against our generation that we neglected to preserve the priceless heritage of which we are momentarily custodians.</P>
      <P>I regret that this Bill has not been accepted by the Government.  I look forward to the Minister's Bill.  We will be constructive and helpful in our amendments to his Bill when it eventually appears so that it will be worthy of both sides of the House and so that it will go a long way in the preservation of our national heritage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that 1975 was European Heritage Year and 1981 is Urban Renaissance Year.  There is a massive awareness of the treasures of our heritage and it is incumbent on this generation to ensure that the treasures we <Col N="104" /> have from the past will be handed in trust to the next generation.  Modern science and technology are playing a very big role in leisure activities.  Many people spend much of their time with metal detectors and modern scuba equipment.  These trends show the various pressures to preserve our heritage for the next generation. The Government must bring in adequate legislation and I am pleased that a Government Bill is almost ready. I can see the Fine Gael point of view in bringing in an National Heritage Bill. The title is all embracing and it would be difficult to analyse it.  I wonder if the Bill proposed here could go any way towards preserving all we wish to preserve and towards bringing about a situation where the next generation would praise us for our awareness and consideration.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to know that the Government legislation is before the Department of Finance at the moment and I would ask the Fine Gael Party to withdraw this Bill so that together we can bring in more adequate legislation.  One can say a lot about monuments, shipwrecks, booty and the ownership of it.  A lot can be said about the different aspects of such matters and about the ownership of treasures which must be preserved and kept in trust so that future generations can appreciate the lifestyle and commitment of this generation.  It is not my intention to delay the House further because I am aware that Deputy Hegarty is anxious to contribute and I am willing to share the time alloted to me with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish our new Ceann Comhairle well and I am grateful to Deputy Murphy.  As Fine Gael spokesman on Tourism I am disappointed that Deputy Donnellan's Bill has not been accepted, principally because of the time factor involved.  Daily one of our national monuments falls by the wayside.  One day it is Wood Quay, the next day it is a dolmen or a fairy fort.  From the point of view of tourism even the mainland of Europe cannot compete with us.  We may not have exotic buildings but when it comes to antiquity and monuments dating back to the pre-Christian era we can compete with the Egyptians.  I do not know <Col N="105" /> whether it was from fear of such monuments or the spiritual context but they survived for centuries until now.  It is our generation that has done the harm with bulldozers.  We seem to have lost our respect for and fear of the fairy fort but recall when I was young that people would not cut the furze off a fairy fort but now they are being blitzed out of the way. That is a pity because they are part of our heritage.  It is good to be able to tell the world that we have such a heritage.</P>
      <P>I am aware that American tourists are anxious to see Blarney Castle and such places but they should also be told about places like Cloyne Cathedral.  Those who have visited that cathedral are amazed that it is there since the year 900 and is still in good condition.  However, it will not remain in good condition much longer because of the cost involved in maintaining it.  Those buildings cost a lot of money to maintain.  There are wonderful castles in Castleisland and elsewhere but they are in a dangerous condition. If we are serious about them we should introduce legislation immediately to preserve them for ourselves and our children.  We should also preserve them so that visitors can see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Donnellan on the Bill.  As he admitted, it may not be perfect but it is possible to amend it.  I am afraid that because of the financial constraints being experienced by the Government, and the fact that they have many other problems to deal with at present, they will put the Bill they have mentioned into the background. There is no doubt that legislation to deal with this matter will cost a lot of money and if we are serious about preserving our national monuments we are talking about a substantial figure.  Some of our national monuments, even those under the care of the National Trust, are in a pitiable condition.  It is pathetic to see how some of them are let run down because of the lack of money.  It is pathetic to think that we are content to knock down part of Dublin and build it up again with bricks giving the impression that we have preserved something.  We have not.  We have made some places <Col N="106" /> look like what they were originally, but places like Kildare Street do not bear any resemblence to what they looked like some years ago.  Harcourt Street will never be the same again if it is tampered with further.  From a tourist point of view we should maintain old buildings.  Americans can only go back to Davy Crockett and the Alamo but they are trying to make something out of that.  We can go back to the pre-Christian era but we are not doing anything about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is the first Bill I have introduced and because of the way it has been received I am inclined to say to myself that it was a big waste of time. It was a waste of time.  A lot of work went into its preparation and I should like to thank those who were involved.  Some of those who contributed to the debate had a genuine interest in our proposals but others spoke solely for the purpose of saying a few words here.  Some criticised the Bill without being aware of its contents. The Minister of State made an excellent contribution and for that reason I cannot see why he does not accept the Bill.  We are prepared to discuss is provisions and amend them by agreement to suit the Government if necessary.  We are all aware that the Office of Public Works move slowly, without casting any reflections on those who have been in charge of that office.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that the first piece of legislation to cater for this area was introduced in 1930 and we had to wait until 1954 for the next piece.  The next attempt to update that legislation was made by me, but I will not succeed in doing so.  I doubt if the proposed legislation mentioned by the Minister will get off the ground this year.  It may be introduced next year.  We have prepared a Bill and the Government have not, even though they have the backing of the civil service to do so.  I am not blaming the Minister of State because he holds that office as a result of certain political decisions but I hope that during his term of office he will do something about legislation in this field.  I must say that I did not find much fault with Deputy Wyse, the previous holder of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> I received a letter from the Minister of State on 14 July last about the number of national monuments that have been destroyed or defaced.  He informed me that of those surveyed 1,806 monuments had been destroyed or defaced.  Surely that is sufficient evidence to prod the Government into action in this direction. National monuments are involved and the Government are aware of the damage that is being done to them.  We have been told of the number that have been destroyed or defaced but I wonder if the Minister is aware that many more have not come to his notice.  It is possible that twice the number he has quoted have been destroyed or defaced and that should force the Government to take action in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden of Roscommon spoke about the Bill as reported at column 885 of the official Report of 17 June 1980 and said:</P>
    <P>I suppose it was produced just to grab some headlines for Deputies Donnellan and Bruton because God knows they need them.  Perhaps they are cashing in on that because it is topical and the press might take note.</P>
    <P>Shortly before there had been a find in County Tipperary and he was saying&mdash;showing how ignorant he was of the situation&mdash;that we introduced the Bill as soon as there was a find down there. At least that is what he tried to indicate. In fairness, the Bill was not published at that time but was published very shortly afterwards&mdash;in May I think.  This was just to prove what he said was wrong, but what else could one expect from him?</P>
    <P>It is not encouraging for anybody to introduce any legislation because if it is introduced by anybody in Opposition the Government automatically reject it whether it is good or bad.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moore, made a plea to us to withdraw the Bill because it seems he does not want to vote against it.  Over the years Fianna Fáil as a party maintained certainly by word but not by action that they are the group that are the sole owners of our national heritage.  They try <Col N="108" /> to put this across to the public all the time&mdash;why, I do not know.  Many of them claim that the blood in their veins is more Gaelic than that of any other politician. Deputy Moore, Minister of State, said it depended on how one was educated as to what national heritage means to one. That is how I look at it personally.  Possibly all Deputies look at it in a different way.  Fianna Fáil are the people who try to project themselves as the protectors of everything belonging to our culture and heritage but they were not in government when the two pieces of legislation in this context were introduced.  They were not in government in 1930 nor in 1954 and in 1980 they are rejecting the Bill when it comes before the House on the promise that they will introduce a Bill themselves.</P>
    <P>I think I saw in the papers that the Bill will be the National Monuments Bill.  It struck me that it may be given that title for a particular purpose.  Recently a plaque was unveiled in Castlebar and possibly they are rejecting this Bill for the sole purpose of introducing a National Monuments Bill.  It is possible that the particular plaque recently unveiled in Castlebar will come into that category and that possibly the Bill is being introduced for that very reason.  I am sorry we did not get the support of the House for this Bill&mdash;the support of the Government.  I should like to thank Deputy Quinn for his very fine contribution on the Bill but I regret that we did not get Government support.  If the Government plan to introduce a Bill it should be done very soon because I am firmly convinced that as a result of a by-election that will take place on 6 November and the panic that will set in in the party after that, it will not be long after Christmas before they will have to go to the country and they will not have an opportunity to introduce a Bill.  I suggest that if they want to introduce a Bill they should do it before Christmas because they will not have an opportunity afterwards.</P>
