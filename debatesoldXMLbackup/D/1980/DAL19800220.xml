      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has under consideration an early meeting with the British Prime Minister to discuss Anglo-Irish relations; if not, if he has received any request for such a meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my press conference on 7 December 1979, in my statement in this House on 13 December 1979, and, most recently, in my address to the Fianna F·il <Col N="3" /> Ard-Fheis on 16 February 1980, copies of which are available in the Library, I set out the major principles of the policy on Northern Ireland which the Government will pursue.</P>
    <P>In my Fianna F·il Ard-Fheis address I suggested that the two sovereign Governments should work together to find a formula that will lift the situation on to a new plane, and bring permanent peace and stability to the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present for an early meeting with the British Prime Minister but I expect I shall be meeting with the Prime Minister in the normal way at the next European Council meeting in Brussels at the end of March.</P>
    <P>The Government will avail of every opportunity that may arise to promote our policy directly and through ministerial, diplomatic and political channels so that, in co-operation with the British Government and the people of the North, we can bring about a just, peaceful and lasting solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's intention in his proposed discussion with the British Government to seek a conference involving the parties elected by the people of Northern Ireland to represent them as well as the representatives of the two sovereign Governments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland would have to be involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach's intention at the first meeting with Mrs. Thatcher to ask her to declare Britain's commitment to withdrawal from her involvement in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no way deviating from the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My first meeting with Mrs. Thatcher will probably be at the next Summit Meeting in Brussels where I doubt if the opportunity will arise for a detailed discussion such as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that summit meetings do not lend themselves to detailed discussions on other matters, but in view of the Taoiseach's statement that the solution to the Northern Ireland question was at the heart of the political aspirations of the Government, was he not somewhat slow in seeking an urgent meeting with Mrs. Thatcher to put the view of what I understand to be his policy, seeking a declaration of withdrawal by the British from Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government are being made fully aware what our policy is, the aims of our policy and the fact that it is our first political priority.  Meetings will be taking place very soon between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Members of the British Government.  These meetings will be availed of to convey the urgency we feel about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could that be interpreted by the British Government as somewhat down-grading the priority <Col N="5" /> which the Taoiseach and the Government see if he does not see it appropriate at all times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, Deputy.  We are getting into the realm of argument now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While recognising the limits of the terms of reference of the conference at present under way in Northern Ireland, but nothing the separate discussions on a wider agenda which involve in particular the SDLP, does the Taoiseach not feel that it may have been unwise to allow himself in his Ard-Fheis speech to appear to be dismissive of the conference and to ignore these second-level discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I was very careful in my Ard-Fheis speech to be in no way dismissive of the conference at present taking place.  My statement in regard to it has, I understand, been appreciated by a large number of those involved.  I repeat that while any results of that conference which would help to ameliorate the situation in Northern Ireland will be very welcome, nevertheless it could not of itself provide the final answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach give any consideration, before making this speech and before subsequent correspondence, to the possible effect it might have on the future of that conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I considered it very carefully.  Indeed, I was anxious, to use Deputy FitzGerald's phrase, not to be dismissive of the conference but to award it the importance that I feel it deserves and to indicate quite clearly its worth and that if anything could emerge from it it would be welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A very different impression has been conveyed to many people and the Taoiseach is now seeking to put that right.  Would he agree that the absence of any reference to the second-level discussions which were achieved with such effort by the SDLP and to which they attach importance was an unfortunate omission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about that.  We are talking about a second-level discussion which the SDLP had to negotiate so hard to get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may be well versed in other matters, but he may not be aware that at the Ard-Fheis two years ago it was announced that Fianna F·il were preparing a policy document on Northern Ireland.  Will this be ready and agreed within the party <Col N="7" /> before substantive discussions take place with the British Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, arising from his television broadcast to the nation, he intends to introduce any legislative change in industrial relations, if he accepts that any such changes require the support of both the trade unions and employers sides in industry, and if he intends to continue his bilateral meetings with these organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Industrial relations legislation is presently under review and if this review indicates that changes in the law would effect improvements in this area, then amending legislation will be introduced.  Any such legislation would, of course, be the subject of consultation with both sides of industry.  The Deputy can take it that I regard the continuation of meetings with trade unions and employer organisations as desirable and important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that to ensure improved industrial relations we should not depend purely on legislative change alone but that it is better to work at this in bilateral meetings? Will the Taoiseach agree that the best input in relation to improving industrial relations this year and in future years <Col N="8" /> would be a fairer deal for PAYE workers?  I admit that that is next Wednesday's input.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to wait and see what next Wednesday brings forth.  I fully agree that the industrial relations situation is not entirely a matter for legislation and that the spirit of the social partners concerned is far more important than any legislation.</P>

      <P>Asking a senior member of the Defence Forces to represent the Taoiseach at the funeral of a distinguished citizen, no matter what his political views were, could not be regarded as a slight to the Army officer concerned. It was in accordance with practice and protocol in the Taoiseach's office that this sort of representation should take place.  The Army officer in question represented me at the Requiem Mass only.

      <P>I am aware that criticisms have been made in the recent past about (i) a marginal reduction in the octane rating of petrol and (ii) the lead content of petrol, but I am not aware of any other complaints.</P>
      <P>As regards (i) I would refer the Deputy to the answer given on 8 November 1979 to a question on this matter.</P>
      <P>An EEC Directive lays down the maximum lead content for petrol to be placed on the market in member states after 1 January 1981 at 0.40 grammes per litre.  The petrol produced at Whitegate has a lead content of 0.64 grammes per litre.  This country has been granted a derogation from the limit for a period of five years in recognition of the fact that the additional cost of compliance would put the continued operation of the refinery in danger.</P>
      <P>Tests are not carried out by my Department to ensure the continuing purity and quality of petrol but I am informed that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards arranged tests in the past which confirmed that the octane ratings here were very close to those applicable under the British specifications for similar grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> As matters stand, the prescribing of standards for petrol, or indeed for other products, is not a responsibility of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there has been criticism about the purity and quality of petrol being supplied to garages?  Is it the Minister's intention to take steps to ensure that there is a unified level of purity and quality of petrol?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice that energy conservation programmes and their funding, in common with many other areas of Government policy, are reviewed from year to year.  The Estimates for the current year were prepared prior to the setting up of my Department and provision for a sum of about £1 million for energy conservation will, in due course, be transferred to my Estimate.  I regard this sum as provisional in that it takes account only of programmes which were envisaged prior to the time the new Department of Energy was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice, this sum represents only a small proportion of total expenditure on energy conservation in the State sector as a whole.  There are already in operation a wide range of conservation programmes and incentives in respect of public offices and buildings, insulation and thermal performance standards for houses, energy efficiency and conservation in industry and pilot work in relation to the use of residual heat resulting from electricity generation.  There is in addition a very extensive programme being operated by the IIRS and funded by my Department which is aimed at conserving <Col N="30" /> energy in many of its applications in industrial and commercial use. Included in this is a national boiler testing service which envisages testing every non-domestic boiler for consumption efficiency and reporting to the owner on its performance.  The IIRS also provide a support service for the IDA to ensure that all new and existing grant-aided industries are energy efficient both in respect of the processes and buildings involved.</P>
    <P>An immediate task for my Department will be to review all these programmes, to endeavour to assess their effectiveness in energy-saving and cost terms, to secure a greater degree of co-ordination among the various interests involved and to see what new major steps should be taken which would have a significant potential for energy saving.  In this context I will be reviewing the effectiveness of previous general publicity campaigns on energy saving and considering the objectives and specific arrangements we should adopt for future measures of this kind.</P>

Does the Minister agree that by contrast with any other EEC state our budget for energy conservation appears to be very inadequate?  What assurance can the Minister give the House that this question of energy conservation which is taken seriously elsewhere will be considered in the same light here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two studies, the more recent in 1977, have been carried out by the Electricity Supply Board into the district heating of major urban areas utilising waste heat produced as a by-product of electricity generation in the Board's power stations. Although the results of these studies were not encouraging the question of introducing district heating into local authority housing schemes has been examined by the appropriate Government Departments and it has been concluded <Col N="33" /> that the very substantial funds required to provide district heating could be used to better advantage, for example, in providing additional houses.</P>
    <P>Although these studies were conclusive enough at the time they were completed, I feel it would be prudent to have them updated to take account of the marked changes in energy costs, particularly during the past year.  Since other costs, and indeed other factors, will not have remained static, it cannot be assumed that the economics will have been reversed in a dramatic way. However, I am asking the ESB to have this updating carried out.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present providing financial assistance for a project to use waste heat from Lanesboro generating station for horticultural purposes and I am sure that the ESB will be prepared to consider proposals from suitably located industrialists for the use of waste heat from other generating stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that perhaps his Department rather than the ESB would be the appropriate agency to undertake the updating of the study concerned since, presumably, the Department would be in a position to take into account other factors which might not be familiar to the ESB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the original studies were carried out by the ESB.  Consequently, it is reasonable that the updating be undertaken by them also.  Of course, the consequence of the updating will be submitted to my Department where it will be assessed independently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible to put any time scale on this review?  Is it expected back from the ESB within any specific period of time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any other power <Col N="34" /> station at which heat is being wasted, contrary to the manner in which waste heat is being used at Lanesboro and, if so, are there any proposals to use that waste heat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is yes. Regarding the utilisation of such waste heat, this question is being examined but in many cases there is required an initiative by people on the spot in relation to the particular generating station concerned. I do not know whether the Deputy is aware of the details of the Lanesboro scheme but if he is so aware he will know that in that case considerable assistance is being given by my Department regarding the operation of the scheme, which, incidentally, is at a relatively early stage.  There are only two groups allocated under the horticultural scheme but there are more to be allocated.  Such a scheme requires physical location close to the generating station concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that almost 20 years ago this type of scheme was suggested and that a certain amount of work was done then with a view to utilising such a scheme for horticultural purposes but that it was dropped mainly because of objections on the part of people engaged in horticultural production elsewhere on the basis that it would be unfair to them to have to compete with producers who could avail of free heat?</P>

      <P>The normal practice is that whatever capacity is decided on for cable and plant at either end must be duplicated to allow for breakdown.  In this case the estimates are based on two cables of 250 megawatts and that amounts, for technical reasons, to a net saving of installed capacity at 200 MW.</P>

The best available data suggests that the average price of yellow-cake (U 308) in the fifties was 11 US dollars per lb., that the price fell to significantly lower levels in the sixties when production exceeded demand, dropped to less than 5 US dollars per lb. in 1972 but began to increase with the advent of substantially higher oil prices late in 1973 and reached a figure of 38 US dollars per lb. in 1980.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of studies undertaken the following sources of possible alternative energies have been identified as being most relevant to the Irish situation: Biomass Conversion, Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Wave Energy, Heat Pumps&mdash;a conservation technique.</P>
      <P>Research and development activities in these areas are in train at a number of institutions, with the National Board for Science and Technology having an overall promotional and co-ordination role.  This research is complemented by the participation of Irish researchers in EEC and International Energy Agency projects.</P>
      <P>In most of the areas listed the research and development activities are at a very early stage.  Even if the work now in progress establishes that potential for economic operation exists it would be unrealistic to expect any worthwhile contribution to our energy supply for a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, from our point of view, the most promising with the stage of development available at present, is biomass conversion.  As regards the percentage contribution required from these various alternatives, I do not think it would be in the least wise to try to put <Col N="43" /> a figure on that.  Clearly, the kind of contribution overall that has been envisaged in previous official statements would not be sufficient for our purposes.  In other words, there would have to be a very substantial increase on what seemed to be available for the contribution from these kinds of sources to be regarded as approaching the level at which we could be satisfied with them.  That is not to say that even if such a level were attained we would dismiss them, but for them to make, for instance, such a significant contribution as to mean that we would not have to think in terms of a gap in requirements, and therefore of nuclear energy, the increase in contribution would have to be very substantial.</P>

      <P>We are all agreed and we are not holding up proceedings.  We are back now to where we were at 2.00 p.m. and I am glad of that and that this attempt has not succeeded.  The Taoiseach has wisely seen that it is better <Col N="148" /> to proceed according to Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>I have very little to say on this.  In fact it will take much less time than all this silly argument.  I merely wanted to comment on the concentration of certain activities in the Taoiseach's office.  I do not want to criticise this; there are arguments for it.</P>
      <P>I would like the Taoiseach to take the opportunity at some point&mdash;and this is not perhaps the appropriate point&mdash;to explain his thinking with regard to the evolution of the role of the Taoiseach's Office because traditionally in our system it has played a rather minimal role&mdash;I would think too minimal a role. The Taoiseach is evidently proposing to modify this by bringing within its competence a number of areas, including the National Economic and Social Council and other areas involving a very considerable increase in staff.  This moves it slightly from the prime ministerial system towards a slightly more presidential system.  It involves some shift in the interpretation of the constitutional role of the Taoiseach.  I would prefer to defer any comment on that&mdash;except to say it is an interesting development and one on which I have an open mind&mdash;until the Taoiseach takes an opportunity to develop his thinking on the question on the role of his Office in the future.  I would ask if he would, in the not too distant future, put his thoughts to us so we would have a chance to debate this.  That is all I wish to say.  I do not want to waste the time of the House on the issue but I hope the Taoiseach will give consideration to my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Taoiseach for making the statement.  Also I am glad that our right to reply was recognised eventually by the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the statement itself, it deals mainly with administrative changes and responsibilities for the various ministries.  One of the things that it has had to deal with&mdash;and it is mentioned in practically every paragraph&mdash;is the dismantling of the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  It <Col N="149" /> should be stated again in this House that that has been one of the most retrograde steps ever taken by an Irish Government. I would, even at this late stage, appeal to the Taoiseach to reconsider that decision.  When the announcement was made by the Taoiseach's predecessor that the Department of Economic Planning and Development was being created, we on these benches welcomed that development.  We were critical of the way in which the functions of that Department were being carried out; but at least the principle that is acknowledged in every progressive country in the world that a Department and Minister responsible for economic planning and development was necessary and indeed essential if we were to be enabled to monitor the progress which we have set ourselves to attain was accepted.  I do not want to be controversial in this but certain allegations have been made as to what precisely motivated that decision. It is of paramount importance for the future development of the country and in helping us to get out of the chronic economic and social difficulties in which this Government have landed us that we have that Department brought back into existence and a responsible Minister placed in charge of it.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Taoiseach to give some serious consideration to reviewing the ministerial posts that he has allocated and to see that at least one of them could be either amalgamated with another or abolished in order that we could have, at Cabinet level, a Minister responsible for the affairs of children. That would be a highly desirable development in this country.  It is universally recognised that the plight of many of the children in our society could well do with the attention of a Minister at Cabinet level.  I would ask the Taoiseach seriously to consider that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;(1)  Subject to sections 9 (1) (b) and 53 (6) of this Act and to subsection (5) of this section, the Minister may by order amend or revoke an order made under section 7 (3) (b), 9, 10, 14, 23 (6), 53, 54, 55 or 56 of this Act, this subsection or section 81 (3) or 159 (6) of the Principal Act (inserted by sections 67 and 68, respectively, of this Act).</P>

      <P> (i)  by order amend an order made under section 36, 37, 38 or 41 of this Act,</P>
      <P>(ii)  by order amend an order made under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.  </P>
      <P>(b)  In case the Minister proposes to amend an order under section 36, 37 or 38 of this Act or this subsection, the following provisions shall apply:</P>
      <P> (i)  the Minister shall as soon as may be give notice in writing of his intention to amend the order to the Arbitrator who shall cause to be published a notice of the Minister's said intention in such newspapers and in such manner as the Arbitrator shall determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  the Minister shall give notice in writing of his said intention to any person by whom an appeal relating to the order proposed to be amended was brought under this Act, or, in case the order is an order under subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of this subsection, to any person by whom an appeal relating <Col N="152" /> either to the original order under section 36, 37 or 38 of this Act or to any order under the said paragraph (a) which relates to such original order was so brought, or, if in either case any such person is deceased, to his personal representative,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the Minister shall not make the order unless a draft thereof has been submitted to and approved of under this paragraph by the Arbitrator,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the Arbitrator shall not determine an application under this paragraph by the Minister before the expiration of the period of thirty days begining on the day on which the relevant notice is published pursuant to this subparagraph, or in case such publication is made on different days the day of the first such publication,</P>
    <P>(v)  any one or more of the following may, within such period of thirty days or such longer period as the Arbitrator may determine, serve on the Minister a notice of his intention to make an application to the Arbitrator in relation to the proposed order, namely:</P>
    <P> (I)  any person by whom such an appeal was so brought, or, in case such person is deceased, his personal representative, or</P>
    <P>(II)  the person who, immediately before the making of the order proposed to be amended, was the owner of the fishery or land acquired by that order or the successor in title of such person, or, if any right has been acquired by such order, the person who immediately prior to the making of the said order was entitled to the enjoyment of such right or the successor in title of such person, or, if such order <Col N="153" /> was made under section 38 of this Act, the owner of the relevant servient tenement,  </P>
    <P>(vi)  in case a notice is served on the Minister pursuant to this paragraph the Arbitrator shall, before deciding whether or not to approve of the proposed order, give the person by whom the notice was served an opportunity of being heard (either in person or through counsel or a solicitor), and</P>
    <P>(vii)  the Arbitrator may in determining the matter approve of the draft of the order in the form proposed by the Minister, approve of such draft subject to such amendments as the Arbitrator shall specify or refuse to give his approval.  </P>
    <P>(3) (a)  The Commissioners may by order under their seal amend an order made by them under section 39 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Irish Land Commission may by order under their seal amend an order made by them under section 40 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  If in relation to an application under subsection (2) (b) of this section the Arbitrator is satisfied that after diligent inquiry a person to whom notice is required by subsection (2) (b) (ii) of this section to be given by the Minister cannot be found or ascertained, the Arbitrator may determine the application, notwithstanding the fact that such person cannot be found or ascertained.</P>
    <P>(5)  Subsection (7) of section 68 of the Principal Act (inserted by section 3 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1976) shall apply as regards an order under this section by which it is proposed to amend an order made under section 81 (3) or 159 (6) of the Principal Act (inserted by sections 67 and 68, respectively, of this Act), as it applies as regards an order made under section 68 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> As the Bill does not in all cases empower the Minister to amend or revoke orders, these amendments enable such amendment or revocation where necessary. This is a standard provision designed to confer the necessary flexibility for effective administration purposes.  The inclusion of such provisions in some cases was overlooked.  A consequential amendment arising out of appeals to the arbitrator in regard to the amendment of acquisition orders has also been provided for.</P>
    <P>Consequential amendments to sections 9 and 53 have also been made. Provision had been made in these two sections for amendment or revocation of orders and as this is now being provided for in the new section 5 covering all sections, it is necessary to remove the provision from the sections in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are not against an arbitrator being appointed but we should like to be told by the Minister whether he will be a full-time employee of the Central Board. If so, who has the Minister in mind for the job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments basically refer to sections 36, 37 and 38 which deal with the important matters of acquisition and transfer of fishery rights in rivers, lakes, rights of way and so forth.  To my mind, and this is the view of my colleagues, these sections and the amendments relating to them form the essence of the measure before us, and I should like the Minister to indicate if the amendments in any way strengthen his powers of acquisition of fisheries rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they do not, the Bill will remain an inadequate piece of legislation, far from being satisfactory from the point of view of thousands of anglers and angling clubs throughout the country who had been looking forward to this Bill because they had hoped it would enable the Minister to take as much as possible of our Irish fishing waters into State control. I particularly deplore the inadequacy of these sections to which the Minister has tabled amendments, and the failure of the Minister and the Government <Col N="155" /> to bring under State control all unclaimed waters throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand why the Minister has shied away from this important matter.  The Minister has at his disposal the backing of the legal powers of the State and I therefore cannot understand why hundreds of miles of unclaimed rivers, streams and lakes cannot be taken under the control of the State.  Unless something is done to vest in the Minister and the State all unclaimed waters, this Bill will have been a futile exercise from the point of view of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that the litigation procedures involved would be too difficult.  If it is too difficult for the Minister and his Department with their vast resources, what chance have the small angling clubs or even the Central Board to deal with this issue?  These amendments are all about legality of acquisition of fisheries and I appeal to the Minister not to allow this opportunity to pass without facing up to his responsibility to secure ownership of all unclaimed waters.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about preservation and renewal and the unclaimed rivers and fisheries rights that have been derelict could be made good by a provision in this Bill, and to ignore these waters and to abandon the State's claim to them is virtually to throw away an integral part of our fishery assets.  It is an inherent weakness in the Bill which I deplore and I am asking the Minister, who has taken over this portfolio&mdash;I extend a sincere welcome to him and wish him boundless success in his endeavour to give teeth to this measure&mdash;to grasp the nettle of the unclaimed waters and the legal entanglements involved.  He should not shirk it. Otherwise, he will let down thousands of people, especially those in the angling world, who have looked forward to the day when they could gain access to Irish waters that have been for so many centuries in the control of those whose predecessors had obtained them by conquest. I want the Minister to undo that conquest in respect of our fishery rights. <Col N="156" /> I look forward to hearing what he has to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy White raised the question of an arbitrator.  We have no particular arbitrator in mind but we have in mind someone, such as a barrister of seven years standing, to act in the capacity of arbitrator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I thank Deputy Treacy for his kind remarks.  I feel I am basking in the reflected glory of my predecessor who piloted this Bill through the House; in a landlubber's language I am only leading in the winner.  When action is not taken during the years over some matter and when somebody makes an effort to do something about it he is often open to criticism.  Deputy Lenihan grasped the nettle when he brought in this Bill.  I am not saying it is perfect&mdash;no Bill is&mdash;but it is a decent effort to deal with a long-standing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments do not in any way lessen the Minister's power of acquisition. With regard to unclaimed fisheries, they can be acquired individually. We have decided they should not be acquired globally.  Provision exists in the Bill to enable the Minister to authorise the Central Board to acquire by agreement or compulsorily any fishery for the purpose of managing, operating, protecting, conversing or developing that fishery in accordance with the board's overall development programme.  There is a further provision in the Bill enabling the compulsory acquisition of any fishery to be proceeded with where the owner cannot be found or ascertained. The case has been made that the Bill should contain powers enabling the Central Board by a single vesting order to acquire the fishery rights on substantial stretches of rivers where there is a large number of riparian owners involved, where the legal ownership of the fishing rights is not clear or where the rights are not being exercised.  Such a global action <Col N="157" /> would have far-reaching implications; indeed, its constitutionality would need to be examined very fully before we could insert it in this or any Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, it is felt it is too major a proposal to be introduced for the first time on Report Stage.  In the interest of getting the reorganisation of inland fisheries under-way as quickly as possible, it would be more appropriate to accept the powers of acquisition that we have as the basis of the solution to the problem.  We could examine the more far-reaching proposal later if it needs to be put forward.  Personally I do not think nationalisation is always the answer to everything.  Private rights of individuals must be recognised also.  When this measure is operating if it is found that the general good of the country requires the acquisition of any particular stretch of water, I can guarantee that the powers we have will enable us to acquire it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 50 and 51, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Subsection (1) of this section, except in so far as it amends section 163 of the Principal Act and repeals clause (b) of paragraph 2 (1) of the Fifth Schedule of that Act, shall come into force on the appointed day. </P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) stipulates that the Principal Act is repealed to the extent specified in column (2) of the First Schedule to the Bill.  As section 5 (1) stands at present, the date of effective repeal is the date of enactment of the Bill but this requires to be altered to the appointed day in order to continue the present arrangements until the new boards are established. However, there are two specific provisions in the First Schedule which require to be brought into effect on the date of enactment of the Bill and amendment No. 2 regularises the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in disagreement with what the Minister is proposing but I am rather worried on one point.  When we were discussing this Bill last November we were told that the regional boards and the Central Board would come into operation on 1 April.  I should like the Minister to tell us that he intends to have the boards in operation by that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned also about this matter.  I am fearful that there may be postponement of the establishment of the Central Board and the regional boards.  We have waited a long time for this measure and we want to facilitate the Minister with regard to passage of the Bill.  There are many good points in it which we wish to see implemented and it will come as a bombshell to all of us if there is any attempt to postpone such implementation.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy White, I should like the Minister to give a categorical assurance that the establishment of the regional boards will be carried out this year.  I do not know why this amendment was necessary unless it was to get the Minister off the hook again.  I am saying this in the knowledge that the Estimates for his Department and for all Departments are known to us.  Having regard to the serious cutbacks in the Estimate for the Department of Fisheries it might be a good excuse for the Minister to defer establishing the Central Board and the other agencies mentioned in this Bill.  I should like an assurance now from the Minister that on passage of the Bill it will be enacted into law with the least delay. In particular, the Central Board and the regional boards should be established before the year is over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope within two months, but the Deputy will realise that the first business that was ordered in the House today was this Bill, and that is an indication <Col N="159" /> of the interest we have in seeing that it becomes law.  There will be a certain amount of delay in setting up the new boards and getting them into existence. We have to appoint CEOs and certain other work will have to be done.  I assure Deputy Treacy that financial provision has been made and that these boards will function and function well, we hope in this year.  I am as anxious as the Deputies to see the boards come into existence straight away.  This amendment which we are discussing on Committee Stage has been brought in to deal with specific matters which we wish to see introduced immediately.  That is the reason they were written into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister elaborate on his last remarks?  What are the matters to which he is anxious to give effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The first exception referred to is the revocation of the provision of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 which lays down that salmon dealers cannot be required to enter the price paid to them for salmon in their registers.  Dealers' registers at present are used for monitoring the sale of salmon. When this Bill is passed we propose to devise a type of register which will cover all the information that we would like to have.  I am sure that Deputies opposite share my anxiety to see that this is done to enable us to get a proper picture of sales of salmon, where the salmon came from, the price paid and so on.  The second provision lays down, if the 1959 Act stands, that we would not be in a position to alter the close season for any species, salmon particularly, for three years.  It is desirable that we have a certain amount of flexibility in this regard so that it can be seen that if certain areas suffer as a result of restrictive measures which we might introduce we could allow an extension at either end of the season, or something like that.  They are the only two matters I have in mind. There is nothing at all insidious in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's last remark was in regard to the restriction of salmon.  We have read and studied the Bill.  I take it that if there is anything else that is not in the Bill new legislation will be brought before this House and we can discuss it regarding the restriction of salmon.</P>
      <P>When we were talking on Committee Stage of this Bill we all agreed that a hard and fast look would have to be taken at the declining stocks in most of the rivers.  I am not saying that I am against what the Minister intends to do.  I do not know enough of what he has in mind to comment, but he must take a hard, fast, determined look to see that stocks do not decline further.  I will have more to say about that when we come to the final Stages of the Bill.  Regarding this amendment, the Minister has stated, and I can understand why, that he hopes within two months to have the new boards set up.  He went on to say that it is going to take time, that, naturally enough, executive officers will have to be employed and other professional people also.  I agree with this, but I would like a date from the Minister.  I would like him to say that within two months, eight weeks, the Central Board and the regional boards will be in operation.  It should not be impossible for the Minister to state this.  We have dealt with this Bill at length from last October until now and we have been stressing the importance all the time of getting this Bill so that stocks can be conserved and, as the Minister said, we can have a licensing authority for salmon dealers and so on. It is imperative that the Minister give Deputy Treacy, myself and this House a definite assurance that these boards will be in operation not later than the beginning of April.  We are talking, for instance, about salmon licences.  Will the old boards be distributing the salmon licences?  Who will be distributing them? We should like to know now what body will be responsible.  Will the terrible blackguarding of our estuaries carry on as in the past unless this board is set up? Sincerely I ask the Minister to say &ldquo;Right, D-day is 1 April&rdquo; or 2 April, whatever day it is going to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons I cannot give a specific date to Deputy White is that we cannot anticipate when this is going to get through the Seanad.  It will have to go back to the Seanad again because of the amendments, but it should go through the Seanad in the next week or so, and I promise that if it is physically possible the boards will be set up and activated within two months of the date the Bill goes through the Seanad.  These are matters that we would like to see attended to immediately, such as the proper register taken for salmon, and we hope that we can do that within two months.  That is the idea of the amendment.  I share the Deputy's concern to see that salmon are conserved and I am aware of the activities that go on in estuaries.  I am confident that when we take certain measures we will get Deputy White's complete backing with regard to these.  I have read some of the reports of the debate on this Bill and I saw pleas from the Opposition to &ldquo;call off your gunboat&rdquo;.  I hope that those pleas will not be repeated when we make an effort to ensure that salmon stocks are conserved and that salmon get an opportunity of escapement to go up the river to spawn.</P>

We expressed ourselves as appalled at that kind of suggestion.  There are ways and means of getting our fishermen to conform without shooting directly at them with intent to kill.  The Minister has misconstructed <Col N="162" /> the attitude of the Opposition speakers in this regard.  We want to protect our fisheries.  This side of the House wanted a 50-mile limit and we insisted on that.  The Minister's party said likewise but welched on that before their backsides were hot in office here.  We have no proper protection.  If we had a 50-mile limit it might not be necessary to engage in gunboat war of the kind mentioned by the Minister.  We support that the provisions in this Bill are adequate for patrolling our waters and adequate protection for safeguarding our fish stocks, but we expressed concern, rightly, when the Minister wanted to take on himself the power to use Irish gunboats to shoot at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>These amendments make provision for the submission to the Minister by the central board and to the central board by the regional boards, of development programmes within two years of their establishment and for a review of these programmes at least once every five years.  Originally a yearly programme was envisaged but on consideration of the arguments in favour of longer term planning put forward on Committee <Col N="164" /> Stage particularly by Deputy Treacy, a more flexible arrangement is now proposed.</P>

      <P>We welcome this amendment and I congratulate the Minister for including this.  This legislation provides that the central boards will have to bring in a two-year plan and I agree with that but in line with that the regional boards should also have to submit a two-year plan to the central board.  The central board for example would not have local knowledge when it comes to restocking rivers, lakes and estuaries and when it comes to cleaning little streams and rivers or in regard to the taking over of lakes.  An order should go out from the central board to each regional board requesting a two-yearly plan at least, and if possible a yearly plan.  At the moment we are lacking, in that no directive is issued to a lot of these boards as to what they should be doing.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister and I am particularly grateful to his predecessor, Deputy Lenihan, for meeting my amendment in such a fulsome fashion.  The amendment initially asked that the central board should at intervals of five years prepare and submit to the Minister for his consideration a research and development plan under this section.  I now observe that the board would be obliged to report annually and to conform to a five-year plan.  That was the essence of my amendment, because I felt that it was neither feasible nor realistic for an important body of this kind to prepare, have ready and approved a meaningful programme of the kind envisaged in this Bill on a one-year basis.  I am pleased that the Minister has allowed them that extra leeway to plan ahead.  The one-year stipulation was all the more unrealistic having regard to the fact that the Inland Fisheries Trust are conforming not merely to a one-or five-year plan but to a ten-year plan.  Five years is fair and reasonable and I thank the previous Minister not merely for the manner in which he met us in respect of this amendment but for his sympathy, understanding <Col N="165" /> and co-operation all through the passage of this Bill, especially on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>We are all at one in this. Once the regional boards are established they will be obliged within two years to present their first plan to be submitted to the central board and then to me.  From then on they will be obliged to produce a plan every five years.  This, as Deputy Treacy said, will give long-term planning a chance to operate.  As well as that a certain amount of monitoring will have to be done because they will have to present their budget annually but that would be in line with their long-term plan.  It will enable us and the central board to compare how effective the different boards are and possibly what has been found to be effective in one might be copied in another.</P>

      <P>Maybe this is what the Minister meant when he referred to the official reports and to calling off the gunboats. The only reference to gunboats was made on this section, as far as speakers from this side of the House are concerned.  I am delighted that the Minister agrees that no boat will be fired on as far as this legislation is concerned. Since I became spokesman for fisheries I have never heard any reference being made to the gunboats being called off if they were doing their duty in the national interest.  Perhaps when replying the Minister will say that he made a slight error in what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the trouble off the south-east coast in relation to herring fishing there were calls from other spokesmen in relation to interference with Irish fishermen fishing off the headland.  We have no apologies to make <Col N="168" /> for that because we never thought that the EEC limits would stretch to within the shores of the south-east coast.  We adhere to that view and believe that there should be a 12-mile limit right around Ireland.  I am glad that this amendment has been agreed to.</P>

Until recently fyke nets were used primarily for experimental purposes but their use as a commercial fishing engine is becoming prominent and the number of applications in my Department for authorisation to use such nets for commercial purposes is on the increase. Consequently, the time has come to designate this type of net as a commercial engine and thereby entitle the Minister to fix the licence duty in the same way as in the case of the other scheduled engines.

I hope the Minister will invoke <Col N="173" /> the powers contained in the amendment to a great extent in order to gain access to the large tracts of unclaimed waters which I adverted to in the course of the debate.  It apears that the owners of hundreds of miles of such waters are not known or have been absent for many years.  When such matters come to the notice of the central or regional boards or the Department I hope the powers contained in the amendment are invoked. Where ownership is not claimed or the owner cannot be found I hope the matter is sent to the arbitrator.  The amendment represents an improvement on the existing situation but whether it will be availed of is another matter.  I want to encourage the Minister to avail of every opportunity to advise the boards that where important stretches of water or lakes are bereft of ownership and allowed become derelict they should be acquired in the formal manner.  If that does not happen important stretches of water and lakes will fall into a greater state of disrepair and neglect.  That would be tantamount to a national disgrace.

      <P>I should like to congratulate the new Minister on his appointment. He has asked me for complete backing and that I give him.  I will give him complete co-operation in the interest of our fishermen.  Naturally, if he introduces a Bill with which I disagree he can expect me to fight it in a dogged and determined manner.  This Bill is important for our inland and inshore fishermen because it deals with everything from the centre of Ireland to 12 miles out.  It is also a far-reaching Bill taking in lakes, rivers, estuaries, sea fishing, salmon fishing, aquaculture including scallop, mussel and factory farming of trout and salmon.  I do not wish to repeat the suggestions I put forward on Committee Stage, but I should like to thank the former Minister, Deputy Lenihan, for bringing in certain amendments.  He has shown that he listened to our contributions and appreciated the constructive approach of Deputy Treacy and myself. We do not criticise just for the sake of criticism but if we feel the Minister is doing anything wrong as far as Irish fishermen are concerned he will see the other side of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation represents a tremendous improvement for our fishermen.  I hope the Minister will now deal with the problems of the deep-sea fishermen who are not catered for in the Bill.  I am sure he agrees that legislation is needed in that area so that our fishermen will know exactly where they are going.  At present deep-sea fishermen do not know where they are going.  They have not received any directive from the Minister, or the EEC, setting out what they should catch. <Col N="175" /> The only thing that has come from Brussels is an announcement to the effect that there is a herring ban in operation in the Celtic Sea.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will take the 12-mile limit seriously and that when he goes to Brussels he will seek such an exclusive limit.  We have gone through all the provisions of the Bill with a fine comb and spent a lot of time discussing the 12-mile limit.  The Minister must be aware from what transpired in the debate that in his negotiations with the Dutch, the French and the British he must insist on the 12-mile limit.  There is something very wrong in a situation in which a person living 100 yards from the sea is not allowed to fish in that sea. That is the effect of the directive that has come from the big boys in Brussels in this regard.  Regardless of what other spokesmen for this party have said in the past, it is my intention to insist on a 12-mile limit in respect of all fishing around the coast.</P>
      <P>There is no encouragement for the fishing industry so far as the Estimates for the Department are concerned.  I was very disappointed on finding today that in 1980 there is an increase of only £75,000 for this important industry. Presumably, this increase takes account of wage increases of the order of 20 per cent.  In the context of a total estimate of more than £16 million it is ridiculous to talk in terms of an increase of merely £75,000.  Regarding this Bill alone, I had been hoping for an increase of about £5 million.  However, the Minister may be able to tell us that there will be a supplementary estimate to take care of the cost of this legislation.</P>

      <P>It would be most regrettable that the fishing industry would be deprived of the finance necessary to enable them to put into effect the provisions of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I note, also, that the amount of the estimate in respect of the acquisition of fisheries is merely £10.  Perhaps the Minister can explain the reason for this.  I share Deputy Treacy's hope in regard to the acquisition of fisheries.  That is why I urge the Minister to ensure that where possible this policy is implemented. There should be as much acquisition as possible in regard to rivers, lakes and estuaries. But I agree with the Minister in regard to those fisheries which are in professional hands and which are being operated efficiently and restocked.  There is no problem in regard to them but there are many miles of rivers and lakes that the State should be acquiring and I emphasise the word &ldquo;acquiring&rdquo;. Perhaps one of the areas in which we have fallen down most during the past 50 years has been our failure to utilise to the full our natural resources.  Commercial fisheries could prove very profitable if the right approach were adopted regarding their operation.  Fishing is a big tourist attraction.  Consequently, every effort should be made to encourage tourists to come here to fish in our rivers and lakes.  I am not blaming this Government particularly for the present situation.  Successive governments have failed to take advantage of what is one of our greatest natural resources but after the enacting of this legislation I shall blame the Government if the high hopes of the fishing industry, <i>vis-‡-vis</i> this Bill, are not fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amount of £175,000 to deal specifically with sea development is not adequate in terms of the research, the development and the restocking that many people in the industry are convinced are necessary.  It is ridiculous to talk <Col N="177" /> of a figure of £7,000 for an inland fishery development scheme.  During Committee Stage a good deal of time was spent talking about the task of cleaning up our rivers and lakes and of carrying our research projects in the interest of increasing fish numbers.  A sum of £7,000 or, approximately, the equivalent of the salary of any one of us here, is a drop in the ocean in so far as this very important work is concerned. Having regard to these various points, I trust that the Minister will be able to tell us that funds will be made available to enable this legislation to be enacted in the spirit in which it is being discussed here.</P>
    <P>We know that there is to be an overall central board under whose umbrella will be the various regional boards and that the chairman of each of these regional boards will be elected automatically to the central board.  I take it that each of the regional boards will have a chief executive officer who will not be on the central board.  However, these CEOs will have intimate knowledge of the operations of the boards and since they will not be on the central board, I suggest that they meet once a year in order to submit their findings for the entire country to the central board.  The chairman will need to be briefed by the CEOs.</P>
    <P>Neither this Minister nor his predecessor indicated at any stage what is to be the salary of one of these CEOs. I am not expecting the Minister to spell out a specific figure but I should like to hear what will be the grade at which these people will be appointed.  My reason for raising this point is to emphasise the difficulty that would be likely to arise in attracting the right people for these jobs if the salary were not considered adequate.</P>
    <P>Another point on which I should like clarification relates to the appointment of a chairman to a regional board.  Will such an appointment be made by the Minister or by the board?  I understand that the Minister will nominate a chairman to the regional boards.  If that is so I should like an undertaking from the Minister that the people so nominated <Col N="178" /> will not be Fianna F·il hatchet men.  I am not interested in what may be the political beliefs of any such person but I am anxious that the right person be nominated in respect of each board having regard to the importance of the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>What salary will the chairman be entitled to?  What travelling expenses will he or members of the board be entitled to?  Will the other members of the board also get a salary?  As far as the working of the regional board is concerned, this is the place to hammer out these points.  To some people these points are incidental but, as has happened in the past, people were appointed to boards regardless of their capabilities.  They were appointed for their political beliefs.  If that happens in this instance, there will be an uproar in this House because we spent too many days discussing this Bill and we want to see the best people appointed to these boards.</P>
    <P>Will it be laid down how often these regional boards will meet?  On Committee Stage the then Minister was not very specific on this point.  These boards will have a great deal of responsibility.  I would like to see them meeting very regularly, at least ten times a year.  It is very distressing to see young men with fishing boats being refused licences.  For example, in one area 20 licences may be granted but two of them may not be used.  The Minister should issue a directive through the central board that any body who does not fish a licence in every year automatically loses that licence.  In the past, because of political pull, people on these boards may have been afraid to say that they would not give somebody a licence the next year.</P>
    <P>As I explained earlier, the first structure is the regional boards, the next the Central Board and the third will be the Minister.  The first point I want to discuss is the formation of the Central Board which will be made up of the chairman of each regional board.  As regards voting in the regional boards, the Minister did not tell us exactly who would have a vote.  He said everyone <Col N="179" /> who had a licence was entitled to vote. He then went on to say there would be different panels drawn up, he would tell us on the Final Stage how these panels would be made up and how many people would sit on each regional board.  The Department have had three months to consider this point.</P>
    <P>It would not be wise to say that there would be ten or 14 people on each board because in some regions there are many varied interests.  The trout anglers, lake anglers, estuary fishermen, sea anglers, aquaculture people and salmon fishermen need representation.  It is not very important that the same number should sit on each board but it is very important that the Minister tell us how many members will sit on the regional board in the Ballyshannon area and what panels they will come from.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has finally made up his mind where the head offices for the regional boards will be situated.  I read recently that there had been a change in Limerick and I hope this is the last change we will see.  The members of these boards are entitled to know that the regional board for the Limerick area will be situated in Limerick.  I am very interested to note that the Central Board is situated in Galway and that regional boards are situated throughout the country. I hope the Minister will not go back on that.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the Minister's nominees on the Central Board.  My great fear is that political nominees will be appointed.  I want to stress that the Central Board is as important, if not more important, than the regional boards and I want to see the right people&mdash;people with knowledge, interests, and capabilities&mdash;carrying out this important work.  The Central Board will have control over every river, lake and, if we can manage it, the 12-mile limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister nominates three members. One must come from the Department of Fisheries.  We want a knowledgeable officer appointed from <Col N="180" /> that Department.  Another nominee will come from the trade unions, and whoever the third member may be does not interest me so long as he has the expertise and knowledge needed on this board.</P>
    <P>What salary will this executive officer get?  Will all members of the Central Board be paid a salary?  My understanding is that they will not, but they will be paid travelling expenses.  A person travelling from Tipperary to Galway is entitled to claim travelling expenses.  I suggest each member is also entitled to a salary.  The people we want on these boards may have had to leave their businesses to serve on these boards and therefore they should be entitled to a salary to compensate them for the time spent looking after our fishing industry. As I said, this will be the ruling body for our fishing industry.  I understand they will have to consult the Minister at certain times.  The Minister is given responsibility as Minister for Fisheries and he should have the overall authority over all fishery matters.  I welcome this as long as the Minister uses that authority correctly.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we had some discussion about the compensation to be paid to workers in Dublin who will be transferred to the head office in Galway. Have the union officials met the workers?  Has the Minister agreed that compensation will be paid to those workers who through no fault of their own but in the interests of fishery development are being transferred from Dublin to Galway?</P>
    <P>I would now like to say something about the acquisition of fisheries.  I agree with the Minister when he said recently that, if fisheries are being run properly and professionally and making money, he does not foresee having to take them over.  There are a great number of rivers, lakes and estuaries which have not been utilised to the full extent.  Much hot air is blown in this House about the fishing industry. If the Minister is serious about this industry he will have to give serious consideration to the lakes, rivers and estuaries which are not being utilised.  The <Col N="181" /> Minister is faced with one of the greatest challenges at the moment.  The revenue from the fishing industry could possibly be increased tenfold in the next five years if the Minister gets sufficient money and the expertise to advise him and the fishermen.</P>
    <P>I am still not satisfied with the way the ESB run their own hatcheries and fisheries.  The ESB said in the past that there was no point in their spending the vast sums of money which were needed in fishing because we did not have the right fishery protection for the salmon stocks outside their estuaries.  I hope that we have now drafted the legislation to ensure that as far as possible our salmon stocks will not be illegally fished in the future.  The ESB will no longer be able to say that they will see how the fishing goes for the next year and then they will decide to re-stock.  I blame them for the run down of the salmon in the rivers under their control.  The last ESB report was very dismal reading for anybody interested in our fishing industry.  If the ESB do not improve the re-stocking of the rivers under their control the Minister should consider taking them under his control.  I am prepared to wait and see what they will do this year.  I expect hatcheries which have been shut to reopen.  The ESB should now start a re-stocking programme in relation to salmon and eel on all the rivers under their control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will do something about restocking the rivers I have referred to.  A group of fishermen came to me recently about a lake in Donegal which was advertised in the Northern Ireland, English and Continental papers.  I have written to the Minister asking him to ensure that this river is bought by the Department of Fisheries. It is not in the interests of this nation to <Col N="182" /> have Continentals, English and Northern Ireland people being able to buy lakes and rivers.  We have now got power in this Bill to ensure that the rivers and lakes stay in the hands of the Department. I hope that next year the Minister will be able to tell us that he has taken over 20 or even 50 lakes and rivers during 1980.</P>
      <P>I was also delighted to hear from the Minister that compulsion will be used as far as the right of way to fishing in our lakes and rivers is concerned.  I want to see a fair system established where people get licences fairly and fishermen fish fairly and, if they do not fish fairly, that they will be dealt with.  I hope that this year we will see some solution to the herring problem, whereby we have not got an exclusive zone.  If the fishermen went to the European Court and were able to show that they could not fish 100 yards from their foreshore, would that be upheld in the court?  I want the Minister to do his best with regard to the 12-mile zone.  I asked the Department recently what they did with the nets that are confiscated. I understand they are burnt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>They are monofilament nets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not all monofiliment. There is such a thing as a net being confiscated for fishing in the Celtic Sea and the net may be completely legal. If the nets are legal, they should not be burned.  Auctions could be held once or twice a year and the Department could get revenue of perhaps £100,000 from these nets and the money put to some other use in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the 12-mile zone and the herring stocks off the headlands.  I emphasise again that, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned we are looking for a 12-mile exclusive zone from the EEC for the Irish fishermen. One cannot expect the small boats that fish in places like Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Waterford to throw away their livelihood because some directive comes from some 450 or 470 bureaucrats who have never seen the west coast of Mayo and who do not <Col N="183" /> know how hard it is to make a few bob fishing for herring.</P>
    <P>I want also to deal with aquaculture.  I mentioned it on Committee Stage.  One of the things proposed by the Minister is a salmon levy imposed on all salmon caught here.  He did not state whether this would also apply to caged salmon as well as wild salmon.  When we talk about wild salmon we are talking about the salmon that the dealers will be buying from the fishermen and we still do not know whether the levy will be on each salmon or on each pound of salmon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Au Ceann Comhairle Au Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>Au Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should confine himself to what is in the Bill.  He is discussing a lot of things that he thinks should be in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all in the Bill.  I am asking for clarification.  Aquaculture is referred to in the Bill and the salmon levy is referred to in the Bill.  That is the point I am making.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether the levy is going to be imposed on each pound of salmon or on each salmon.  I would also like to know the position in regard to farmed or caged salmon.  These people should pay a levy just the same as the ordinary small fisherman off the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to mussels, oysters, scallops and so on, I do not know whether there will be any levy attached to them.  I understand that every person who is now involved in aquaculture will have to get a proper licence from the Minister.  These people, in turn, will only be able to farm the area designated by the Minister as suitable for farming a particular species of seafood or salmon or trout.  I am afraid that here the entrepreneurs I mentioned on Committee Stage could apply for vast stretches of sea coast.  I suggested that these areas should be limited and I am disappointed that we have not got a commitment from the Minister yet.  Areas should be limited regardless of who applies.  If that is to be so&mdash;and I see the Minister nodding his head&mdash;I would like the Minister to state the maximum area that one company <Col N="184" /> can apply for, because one could have seven or ten people in a company applying for an area of sea for farming, and if they acquired a big enough area this area could be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds in a couple of year's time if farmed properly.</P>
    <P>I contacted the Minister regarding the information that was supplied to me.  I understand that farm salmon and trout have caused pollution in the past.  So far as scallop farming is concerned, the residue from the feeding in these intensive cages causes the shellfish to die in certain bays.  I notice the reply I got from the Department is that in some cases this residue could help particular scallops to exist in the bay.  I am not a technical man and I am sure the Minister did not sign his name to that letter without expert advice, but I have found that the scallops around a certain trout farm have died in the past couple of months for no other reason than from the residue from this farm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a clear commitment from the Minister that no licences will be granted to any salmon or trout farm that would interfere in any way with the shellfish industry here. Shellfish are scarce enough around our bays and coasts at present.  We have to look to the future.  As far as possible, our shellfish industry should be encouraged along with the trout and salmon farms. There will be no serious development in the shellfish industry here until a remedy is found for what is called the red tide.  A few people are now training to be marine biologists but most of these marine biologists would be very wary of investing the substantial sums that would be required for this type of farming until a remedy is found for the red tide.  I would encourage the Minister to spend money, get his people out there and try to find a solution&mdash;and a solution can be found for all these problems.  A solution can be got if the right experts are sent out to find the answers.  I would like to see the question marks in regard to the <Col N="185" /> red tide cleared up as soon as possible and then the people who have the money and even the co-operatives who have not got the money but who have the personnel will see to it that probably the most important angle of our fishing industry, the seafood industry, can be developed properly.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to thank the previous Minister and the present Minister for their co-operation in this Bill.  I would like to thank their staff for the co-operation they have always given both Deputy Treacy and myself.  There is no such thing as a completely satisfactory Bill, but this is certainly a good Bill.  It is trying to tie up a lot of the strands that have been left loose for too long.  I hope the Minister will accept the challenge of the fishing industry.  I hope he will prove to be a good Minister who will come up with the right solutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed to the important features of this Bill.  On Committee Stage I have criticised what I consider to be its defects.  It is not my intention, nor is it usual, to delay long on the Report Stage.  The Central Board and the regional boards established under this Bill have a great opportunity to make a break-through in respect of this rich asset which our country enjoys, our fisheries.  The abolition of the old boards of conservators was long over due.  However, they did the best they could in difficult circumstances.  They did not have the finances to do their job in respect of fishery protection, particularly the twin scourges of pollution and poaching.  We are grateful to them for having carried on under such great disadvantages.</P>
      <P>I welcome the main features of the Bill and hope they will be effective under the joint management of the Minister and the boards in the matter of conserving our inland fisheries.  All is not well with the industry.  There are rumblings of discontent. There are grievances and fears and expressions of genuine concern about mismanagement in this whole area.  Therefore, the new boards and the Minister will have an important role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> I am particularly concerned about the employment involved in the proper utilisation of our inland fisheries.  In this respect I share the anxiety of Deputy White about the advent of fish farming or aquaculture and the possibility of very large companies taking over large areas of our coastal waters to the detriment of small local communities.  Aquaculture has great employment potential among local fishing communities, but let us not tolerate a takeover by the big ones whether they be of the home breed or internationals. Any future development in regard to fish farming should be done in close liaison with local fishing communities&mdash;let the local people be involved to the maximum possible extent. From the point of view of commerce it might be advantageous to allow the big ones to take over but I submit it would be anti-social.  It should be watched carefully because it could provoke a very reactionary response along our coasts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan, who introduced the Bill, was right when he said that the main thrust of the legislation was the development of our inland fisheries as distinct from their protection, which heretofore had been the responsibility of the old boards.  He came to the nub of the thing when he said that all the grandiose schemes we had in regard to the new boards would come to nought unless backed up by the necessary finance. When he was introducing the Bill he said that implementation of its proposals would require substantially increased expenditure, and he added: &ldquo;Perhaps I should say increased outlay on investment rather than expenditure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to delay the enactment of the Bill but I should like to point out that the Book of Estimates which we have before us today shows a serious deficiency in regard to moneys required to implement any good provisions in this Bill.  The increase shown in the Estimate is hardly enough to meet the cost of inflation, which is estimated to be running at 16 per cent or 17 per cent and may reach 20 per cent.  Unless the Minister comes back to us by way of Supplementary Estimates to provide <Col N="187" /> more money, I am afraid all our endeavours will not be of any avail.  If he does that he will have the support of my colleagues and myself.  Otherwise he and the boards will be inhibited through lack of funds.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat my good wishes and to say that I congratulate the Minister's predecessor and thank him for the courteous, sympathetic way in which he met our suggestions in regard to the Bill.  I hope the Minister now in the House will take a personal interest in getting rid of the scourge of pollution through centralised effort.  At the moment pollution is being tackled by several Departments and I am afraid that what is everybody's business is nobody's business, and the situation is getting worse.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a river in my constituency, the River Suir, which is a sorry sight from time to time.  In recent years there have been massive fish kills of a very sad and distressing nature.  I know that local authorities are involved and also that the effluent from industry and farms is responsible to a large extent, but unless the scourge of pollution is tackled effectively much of what is good in this Bill will come to nothing.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the Minister's indication that within two months of this Bill being passed by the Seanad it will become law.  I look forward to that and I look forward in particular to the effective development, protection, conservation and management of our inland fisheries under the aegis of this Bill.  I wish the Minister well in that regard.</P>

      <P>I wish to welcome the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to the House.  I did not have the opportunity to do so previously and I wish him every success in his job.  It will not be an easy task.  He will have an uphill struggle when we consider the Book of Estimates which we received today.  There is an indication there that development of inland fisheries will be strangled by lack of finance.  However, the Minister with his ability and enthusiasm can make up for this to a large extent.  I found wanting in <Col N="188" /> his predecessor the will to eradicate illegal fishing, especially illegal drift net fishing and poaching up river.</P>
      <P>This Bill was formulated on the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission, which was published in 1976.  The commission was established in the early 1970s mainly to conserve salmon, which it was obvious was on the point of extermination because of illegal fishing.  The report was excellent and so is the Bill.  If it is implemented as we would like I shall have the greatest confidence in the future of inland fisheries.  Unfortunately, I am afraid the Bill will not be enacted into law in 1980 because of financial restrictions.  On page 52 of the report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great relevance attached to the Book of Estimates as it has been published today.  We are speaking about a Bill which will depend for its enactment on those Estimates.  There is no provision in the Bill for expansion of staff or the provision of other equipment for inland fisheries.  That must cause great public concern.  As the previous speaker stated, inflation is forecast at 17 per cent for this year.  Obviously there will be serious cutback in the development of inland fisheries, and this is quite alarming.  It is my view that the situation which has obtained during the past ten or 12 years will worsen steadily.  Deputy Treacy pointed out that we spoke here for days about the acquisition of fisheries that are presently in private hands which are not being operated properly and of fisheries where apparently there is no owner.  There is no provision for the acquisition of such fisheries. The figure provided last year was £53,000, but the figure presented to us today was £10&mdash;absolutely nothing.  My misgivings about this matter can be readily understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the primary <Col N="189" /> reason for the Bill is to protect salmon. The report of the Inland Fisheries Commission, on which this Bill is based, went to great lengths to decry the methods used by drift netters.  I agree with the report and with the Bill with regard to this matter.  Illegal drift netting should be eliminated at all costs, but I wish to stress that it should be illegal drift netting.  Restrictions should not be put on the legally licensed drift net fishermen&mdash;there are 3,000 such fishermen engaged on this work.  Employment is given to two or three times that number at sea and on land, those who are engaged in the transport and ancillary industries.  The industry employs about 10,000 people and it is endangered by the uncontrolled illegal drift netting off the west coast and particularly off the Shannon Estuary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Two years ago he actually offered to resign if he did not do something about the matter, but nothing was done.  I appeal to the Minister to give the matter his attention.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Treacy pointed out, pollution causes much damage to our inland fisheries but it has been grossly underestimated. Unfortunately, the legislation dealing with water pollution is not succeeding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Inland fisheries will not exist if there is not strict control over pollution.  When the legislation dealing with water pollution was being debated in the Seanad I said that the Department of the Environment was not the body to <Col N="190" /> enact that measure, that it would be much better if it were under the aegis of the Department of Fisheries.  The measure has failed singularly in its function to eradicate pollution which is exterminating fish stocks in major rivers and lakes.  It is hitting at the whole basis of our inland fisheries structure.  As late as last week one of the primary inland fisheries lakes, Lough Sheelin, was again heavily polluted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That degree of pollution should not be tolerated.  This Bill is based on the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  Unfortunately, one of the points which that commission came out most strongly in favour of is not dealt with in this Bill.  I would like the new Minister to be aware of that because members of the commission have been and are greatly perturbed that one of the strongest recommendations that they made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not attended to in this Bill to any degree whatsoever.  There are very fine points in this Bill.  As I said at the outset, it is an excellent Bill and we must welcome the democratic method of the election of conservators which up to now has been largely a landlord's prerogative.  People could obtain a seat on a board of conservators merely because they had such and such rateable valuation on a river.  That day is gone and the new system is to be lauded.  It is an excellent system and I hope it comes into effect.  I am afraid that finance may prohibit the formation of the seven <Col N="191" /> regional boards and the Central Board, which constitute the very basis and structure of this Bill.  Finance may be a prohibiting factor.  It may be also a prohibiting factor on the very desirable improvement in working conditions of the employees of the various boards of conservators.  Up to the present they have been working under dreadful conditions. This Bill gives them a sound footing and puts them on the same basis as any other State employee or civil servant. They will have good conditions of pay and work and a superannuation scheme, which previously did not exist. They will have permanent, pensionable employment.  That is excellent, and I hope that it will come about in 1980.  Unfortunately I have a dreadful fear that the lack of finance is going to strangle the legislation before us today.</P>
      <P>Finally, I make a plea to the Minister to see that, despite the fact that he has not the finance he needs, the legislation is worked to the utmost advantage of our inland fisheries.  I would like to see an improvement in the licensing system, which at the moment is being abused left, right and centre, and that every native Irish fisherman who earns the greater part of his income from fishing is given the opportunity to fish for salmon, as has not been the case up to the present. There has been selectivity and discrimination. These must be eliminated and it will not cost the Minister a penny to do so.  I would like him to show the will, which I think he has, and the courage, which I have no doubt he has, to see that we have a fair system and no longer a feudal system which has been ruling the inland fisheries in this country up to the present.</P>

      <P>Deputy White questioned the composition and formation of the Central Board and regional boards.  I am entitled to nominate not fewer than four and not more than six members of the Central Board.  One of these will be the chairman and he will be paid a fee.  Of the others one will represent the workers and the remaining nominees will be used by me to redress any imbalance in representation of the various interests on the board.  If one interest seems to be over-represented, I will endeavour to redress that imbalance.  Only the chairmen of the Central Board and the regional boards will receive any remuneration.  All the other members will get travel and subsistence allowances at civil service rates.  An order will be made as soon as the Bill is enacted which will specify the total number of members on each board&mdash;it will be either 14 or 16&mdash;and the classes of fishermen who will be represented on each board and the number of seats allocated to each category.  This will vary in the different regions in accordance with the various kinds of fishing that will be carried out in each region.  The regional boards will meet in accordance with the standing orders that they adopt as soon as they are set up, and the Central Board must meet at least four times a year.  In all probability they will meet more often than that.  Board members will receive civil service travelling and subsistence rates for their attendance at board meetings.  Chairmen will receive a fee but the members will not.</P>
      <P>The fact that the CEOs might not be present at the meetings of the boards was mentioned.  They can be present at the meetings of the boards and in all probability their various boards will request them to do that.  The members of the regional boards will elect their own chairmen.</P>
      <P>With regard to the acquisition of fisheries, the £10 has been raved about here quite a lot.  It is a token provision.  If the acquisition of private fisheries is required we will provide money for that.</P>

      <P>Deputy White made reference to our research facilities and he was doubtful whether we had made provision in the Bill for them.  I have read in the report of the debate on the Bill that some Opposition Members requested that they be allowed to visit Abbotstown.  I hope they have permission to do that.</P>

      <P>I got the opportunity recently and I think Deputies will be very pleasantly surprised with the facilities and the dedication of the staff there.  We have there a facility which is second to none.  If someone was visiting this country and wanted to see our facilities we should be very proud to show them what we have and what is going on there.</P>
      <P>Deputies indicated that the Estimates for 1980 will not be adequate to meet the demands we have.  We will get a substantial sum from the levy on first sale of salmon, from 5 to 10 per cent, and we will have subscriptions from trout anglers, coarse fishermen and sea anglers which will bring in additional revenue. We will see that the Bill will be enacted this year and put into operation, but the full effects of it financially will not be felt in 1980.  When the boards come into existence they will have to assess the services within their regions and draw up their programmes of work.  These programmes will be considered by the Central Board and submitted to me. Therefore, even with the best will in the world, I do not visualise that the boards will become fully operative or active as we would like until the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy and Deputy Treacy dealt with lack of finance.  I am confident that I have enough money available to <Col N="194" /> me to carry out a planned, progressive fishing programme.  We have spent the last two months preparing our Estimates and budget.  Perhaps it was coincidental that we happened to meet in my constituency in Barrettstown on some of those occasions.  Biblical fishermen are reputed to have laboured all night and caught nothing.  I would not like it to be thought that I have laboured for the last two months and caught nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Aquaculture was mentioned. I assure Deputy Treacy that licences for salmon fish farming will not be issued in any area where such activity would affect adversely the shell fisheries. With regard to mariculture, when an area is being designated or is hoped to be acquired an inquiry is always held and the shellfishing interests in any area can put forward their claims on an area at the time.  Areas that will be designated for mariculture can be very large but applicants will be given licences only in respect of the small areas which are necessary for their particular project.  In other words, they will be allocated only a portion of a particular area that may be designated.</P>
      <P>The salmon levy applies to all salmon. The rate of the levy cannot be decided until the Bill is passed, but it will be something in the region of between 5 and 10 per cent.  All salmon fishermen will have to pay the levy and it will vary in accordance with the amount of fish they catch.</P>
      <P>In relation to confiscated nets, illegal nets are destroyed and legal nets are usually resold by the board.  It is important to ensure that the culprits are not in a position to repurchase these nets for a song, as they are sometimes in a position to dissuade their colleagues from bidding for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB were criticised for their involvement in hatchery works.  Their involvement results in substantial investment in fishery development over and <Col N="195" /> above the funds provided by the Exchequer. The ESB have hatcheries on the Shannon and the Lee and the provision of a hatchery to restock the Erne is at present under consideration.  We hope that this scheme will merit cross-Border co-operation or EEC grants for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In relation to aquaculture, Deputy Treacy mentioned that we should ensure the involvement of small local people and I will co-operate in matters like that when asked.  However, aquaculture is at a very experimental stage and it is not the gilt edged investment that people might imagine.  If big firms show an interest and are willing to act as pioneers, to take the risk, and if they can afford the losses, the coast of Ireland is big enough to accommodate everybody both big and small.</P>
    <P>In relation to the salary of the CEO, we will be looking for somebody of very high calibre.  The regional board CEO could be compared with an assistant principal officer with a salary of £8,000 to £10,000 a year and the CEO for the Central Board could be classed as a principal officer.</P>
    <P>Deputy White wanted an assurance that the chairmen of boards would not be Fianna F·il hatchet men and I give him that assurance.  These will be fishermen with dedication, dependability and integrity.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned on the other side of the House that somebody had offered to resign if illegal drift netting were not wiped out.  During my term of office I hope that the only people forced to resign will be illegal fishermen and poachers.  I welcome the offer of co-operation in that regard.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Treacy's high regard for the old board of conservators.  Their replacement by a new board does not mean that we do not appreciate the work they did in difficult times.  I would not like them to be the unsung heroes of conservation today.</P>
    <P>For the information of Deputies the headquarters for the eastern region will <Col N="196" /> be in Dublin, for the southern region it will be in Clonmel, for the south-west it will be in Macroom, for the Shannon region it will be in Limerick with a suboffice in Athlone, for the western region it will be in Galway, for the northwestern region it will be in Ballina, for the north it will be Ballyshannon and the headquarters of the Central Fisheries Board will be located in Galway.  Compensation will be paid to people who have to transfer and suffer disturbance at rates that were acknowledged as being correct.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I have sufficient finance to enable me to proceed with the Bill and that no programme will be stifled or hindered by lack of finance. I thank Deputies for the constructive manner in which they debated the Bill. As Deputies will be aware, several important amendments were made to the Bill during its passage through the House.  These amendments have improved the Bill.  This legislation has been eagerly awaited by everybody involved in fishing.  It is an important step forward in re-organising existing structures in order to ensure the more effective control and development of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for the courtesy they have shown on my first visit as a Minister bringing a Bill to the House, and I intend to keep my promise of co-operation with the parties in the House. The future of fishing is far too fragile to deserve any division.  As Deputy Lenihan enjoyed the confidence of the House, I hope I will also have the confidence of the House and I look forward to the help of all parties.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, lines 33 and 34, to delete <Col N="197" />&ldquo;the public service&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any activity within the Public Service&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This Bill confers rights and obligations on landlords and tenants and the State will enjoy the same rights as any other tenant.  No distinction is being made between the rights conferred on the State as a tenant and the rights conferred on any other brand of tenant.  Section 3 is the interpretation and definition section. The word &ldquo;business&rdquo; is defined because various sections of the Bill will be affected very much as to whether a premises is being used for private purposes or for business purposes.  &ldquo;Business&rdquo; is stated in section 3 to mean &ldquo;any trade, profession or business whether or not it is carried on for gain or reward&rdquo; and so on. But it is also stated to include the public service and that is what this amendment is concerned with.  Persons with whom I have discussed the Bill believe that the definition of the public service as it is in the Bill is indefinite and might require to be elaborated on if there is not to be doubt and litigation in the future.  I have therefore put down an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo;.  Instead of using the words &ldquo;public service&rdquo; we should substitute &ldquo;any activity within the public service&rdquo;.  I am advised that this is clear and will make it easier to interpret the Bill.  I concede straightaway that I should have left the words &ldquo;the public service&rdquo; stand as they are and added to them &ldquo;and also any activity within the public service&rdquo;.  I struck out the words &ldquo;the public service&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;any activity within the public service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for long argument about this amendment.  I am advised that as it stands it will give rise to doubt in the future and may give rise to litigation.  We should do all we can to put the matter beyond doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for the amendment and appreciate very much the point he is making.  The amendment would appear to be designed to remove any doubt as to the meaning of &ldquo;business&rdquo; as applied to the public service.  I presume this <Col N="198" /> is the purpose of the amendment but I am assured that it would not succeed in so doing.  On the contrary, I am advised that it could make the meaning less certain than at present.  I understand that the words &ldquo;the public service&rdquo; have stood in this code of law as part of the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; since the enactment of the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  If we put in the words &ldquo;any activity within the public service&rdquo; it could denote something different from the public service itself.  An activity is not necessarily part of the public service simply because it is carried on within the public service. If any change were to be made, it should be to substitute &ldquo;any activity provided for within the public service&rdquo; but I am advised that such a change definitely would not be an improvement and is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate that the Deputy is endeavouring to make it more definite but, having given the amendment every consideration, I am advised that the words &ldquo;the public service&rdquo; have stood in this code of law as part of the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; since the enactment of the 1967 Ground Rents Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 4, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  In this section `the relevant date' means the date on which a State authority acquires the interest of the lessor or immediate lessor of any premises.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subject to the following subsections, this Act shall not bind a State authority in its capacity as lessor or immediate lessor of any premises.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a State authority acquires the interest of the lessor or immediate lessor of any premises after the commencement of this Act, section 13 shall apply as if the expressions `at any time' and `at that time' in subsection (1) thereof were references to the relevant date and Part II shall apply accordingly.</P>
      <P>(4)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, in a case to which subsection (3) applies, the tenant shall be entitled to a new tenancy in the tenement beginning on the termination of the tenancy under which he holds at the relevant date but shall not be entitled to a further renewal of his tenancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  In a case to which subsection (3) applies, subsection (2) shall not apply so as to disquality any person for payment of compensation for improvements in respect of such improvements <Col N="201" /> as may have been carried out before the relevant date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 4, as it stands, does not represent any change in the law on the basis that the State is not bound by statute unless the particular statute so provides, either expressly or by necessary implication. This view was not questioned until recently, but because a doubt has now been raised section 4 proposes to settle that doubt.  However, the proposal in section 4 was very keenly debated in Seanad …ireann and an Opposition amendment to delete section 4 was withdrawn on an undertaking being given by the Minister of State that the matter would be re-examined.  The amendment now proposed arises out of that re-examination.</P>
    <P>Before we discuss the amendment I should like to make a few remarks concerning the substance of section 4 which may be useful.  As mentioned, it has always been the accepted view until recently that the Landlord and Tenant Acts do not bind the State, but since a doubt has been raised the way would accordingly be open to substantial change in the law if that doubt were not now to be resolved in favour of the accepted view.  The purpose of the proposal in section 4 of the Bill as it stands is to resolve that doubt.  The proposal does not reflect any view on my part that the State should, in principle, have any exemption. It is simply the case that a change in the position of the State under this legislation has not been the subject of investigation and recommendation by the Landlord and Tenant Commission as have the main changes proposed in the Bill.  I do not propose to permit such a change in the law to be carried out by default, as it were, without that kind of investigation.  In the second place, there is no question of tenants of the State being worse off under the proposals contained in the Bill than they are under the law as it stands.  Existing tenants of the State are already dealing with a landlord who is not bound by the landlord and tenant code as that code has always been understood.</P>
    <P>The proposal in section 4, as it stands, <Col N="202" /> does not change the position.  It is, on the contrary, designed to ensure that the position does not change.  Against this background the amendment proposed represents a considerable concession and that amendment is designed to meet one valid objection that has been raised to the exemption of the State.  The objection relates to the case where an occupational tenant finds that he has become a tenant of the State, possibly without either his knowledge or his consent, having previously been a tenant of a private landlord. In such a situation the tenant would, apart from the amendment that is proposed, find that whereas he had rights against his landlord under the landlord and tenant code those rights would have disappeared where a State authority had taken over as landlord.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the tenant's existing rights should be preserved in that situation, that is, his right to a renewed occupational tenancy where that right has accrued and his right to compensation for any improvements he may have carried out.  The right to compensation for improvements means that if the tenant is renewing his tenancy his renewal rent will be fixed with due allowance for the value of these improvements. If, on the other hand, the tenant wishes to leave on the termination of his existing tenancy, he will be entitled to compensation for the residual value of those improvements.  The right to a new tenancy applies on one occasion only in the circumstances catered for in the amendment.  Following on the grant of that new tenancy the tenant will be in the same position as any other tenant of the State and he will not have the statutory right to further renewal of his tenancy. The statutory rights that are being given are restricted to persons who are occupational tenants and are not being extended to ground rent tenants, those, for example, with which Part III of the Bill is concerned.  The rights of ground rent tenants whose landlord is a State authority, or a harbour authority, or the Commissioners of Irish Lights are catered for separately in section 70 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 4, as drafted, states:</P>
      <P>This Act shall not bind a State authority in its capacity as lessor or immediate lessor of any premises. </P>
      <P>In simple language that means that the State is to be absolved from all the burdens which the Bill imposes on ordinary landlords.  On the other hand, under the Bill the State will enjoy all the rights and privileges which are being conferred on tenants.  The principal benefit which the Bill confers on tenants is the right to a new tenancy.  That is laid down in Part II, which states that in certain circumstances a tenant or lessee whose lease or tenancy expires is entitled to a new lease from his landlord or lessor.  If the landlord or lessor fails to give a tenant a new lease, that tenant has a right to go to court.  If he satisfies the conditions laid down in Part II of the Bill, he is entitled to a new tenancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the rights of the tenant are being improved considerably.  Up to now the occupier of a business premises which was not held under a lease from year to year was entitled to a new tenancy only if he had been in occupation of that business premises for seven years, but that period is being reduced now to three years so that a tenant of a business premises whose tenancy has been terminated is entitled to a new tenancy if he has been in occupation for three years.  This is a very considerable improvement in favour of the tenant, but for the first time in legislation there is the provision in section 4 which excludes the tenant from any of those rights as against his landlord while at the same time, if the State finds itself in the position of tenant or lessee, it will enjoy all the benefits, privileges and rights in favour of a tenant without having to be <Col N="204" /> burdened with any of the obligations of a lessor or landlord if it finds itself in the position of either.  This situation is entirely unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he is not changing the law, that the law has been always that the State was not bound by the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, that Act which we are updating and re-enacting here.  I do not accept that.  It has never been so decided or adjudicated on by the courts.  The State is not bound by the Rent Restrictions Acts, but that is a totally different matter.  The exclusion is written into the Rent Restrictions Acts.  I am speaking from memory, but I think I am right.  In addition there is a very different situation in the Rent Restrictions Acts regarding residential dwellings dwellings that were provided specifically by local authorities and by the State as residences for people who needed them. It would be only reasonable that the State should have control of such dwellings in order to ensure that they would continue to be used for the purpose for which they were built.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced in the Seanad and debated there.  Section 4, which excludes the landlord from the obligation imposed on landlords under this Bill, was debated at length in the Seanad but the absurdity of the provision became apparent when it was pointed out that a man could enter into a lease with a private individual for 50 years and that when that lease had another three years to run the landlord's interest could be bought by the State, thereby robbing the tenant of his right to a new tenancy. That proposition was outrageous and the Minister had to see the reason of the argument put forward in the other House.  Under that section as introduced in the Seanad a person would not only be robbed of his rights against the landlord where the landlord was the State and where the lease was granted in the first instance by the State, but he was robbed of those rights also where the State bought a landlord's interest with even only a short time to run.  That proposition was so outrageous that it could not stand up to investigation.  The <Col N="205" /> Minister makes some virtue out of the fact that he is putting that defect right. Under the amendment as introduced by him the position will be that where the State purchases a landlord's interest certain limited rights will still accrue to the tenant provided he brings himself within the section, but he will be entitled only to one renewal.</P>
    <P>It is my considered opinion that the Minister is changing the law by reason of section 4, unless he is relying on some old British dictum to the effect that the Crown is above and beyond everybody, that the Crown can do no wrong, that the Crown is all powerful and almighty and that he is substituting the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;Crown&rdquo;.  That is the only dictum on which the Minister could hang his argument, but I do not believe that our courts would hold accordingly. If what the Minister says is right, why was it considered necessary to write into the Rent Restrictions Act, as I believe has been written in, that these Acts do not apply to local authorities or to the State?  For the first time the Minister is putting in a privileged position a body well able to look after itself, that is, the State.  Usually the State is not short of cash if its finances are properly managed and, even if the State finds itself in difficulties, it has ways and means of getting money to run its services. However, what the Minister is doing in this legislation is putting the State in a privileged position.  If, for example, a young man leases a premises from a private individual and builds up a business there and after spending 30 years in that business, during which time he builds up a very valuable asset and goodwill, the position would be that he could then acquire a new lease thereby protecting his assets.  However, if the Minister has his way, a young man who would rent from a Department of State on a 31-year lease a building that had just been constructed could be thrown out without any compensation at the end of that time.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying that people who, shortly after the foundation of this State, took leases on valuable property <Col N="206" /> in the GPO in this city had no rights?  Is he saying that people, some of them from my native county, who took leases on portion of the GPO, one of the most valuable shopping centres in the city, did so in the knowledge that when their leases expired they could be thrown out without a penny compensation?  That is so absurd as not to stand up to any serious investigation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it was ever the law or that it was ever understood to be the law.  The first time it ever appeared in any Bill was in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978.  I believe that where the State as tenant or lessee reaps the benefits it would not otherwise enjoy were it not for this Act&mdash;it would not have the benefits of a a new tenancy were it not for this Act; it is doubtful whether it should have them at all, but they are in the Bill and I am not quarrelling with that&mdash;and where it shares the benefits conferred on tenants, it should shoulder the obligations imposed on landlords.  That is not an unreasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>The State is well able to look after itself. In most cases it does not have to have a building in a particular place.  If you want to go to the Inspector of Taxes you have to find him out.  If you do not find him, he will find you.  The State is not in competition with anybody.  The State is a monopoly.  It does not matter to the State if its offices have to move 100 yards or half a mile one way or the other.  Therefore, in my view, it is most unjust to seek to amend the law as the Minister is seeking to do.</P>
    <P>It is true that the amendment is an improvement on section 4 as first written into the Bill.  Section 4 simply says that the Act did not apply to the State in its capacity as a landlord or a lessor.  The amendment gives certain rights to a tenant who is bought over by the State.  It gives certain rights to a tenant who has had his remainder interest bought over by the State, but only a limited interest. It is quite wrong that that should be.  The reasonable thing for the Minister to do is to delete section 4 and let the State take the burden of this Bill as landlord and the privileges of this Bill as tenant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, section 4 simply writes into statute a provision which is intended to confirm what has been the position in law since the foundation of the State.  As a result of proceedings taken in 1976 by one of the tenants of the GPO building shops, this view was called into question.  The provision in section 4 simply resolves the doubt that arose in that case, although I should stress that this doubt was never given the authority of a court decision.</P>
      <P>Up to the middle of 1976 it was generally held in legal circles that the Landlord and Tenant Acts did not bind the State as lessor, a view based on a more general belief that the State would not be bound by a statute unless provision to the contrary was made in the statute either expressly or by necessary implication.  On this basis no express provision was made in the 1967 Ground Rents Act, although the matter was fully considered.  Because of the proceedings taken in 1976 by the tenant of the State a doubt was raised as to whether the State was not, in fact, bound by the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  As a result of this the then Minister for Justice decided, with the approval of the Government, to insert a positive provision in the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977&mdash;this Bill lapsed with the change of Government&mdash;to the effect that the State was not so bound.  The provision now appears in section 4 in the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1979.</P>
      <P>Section 4 proposes that a State authority shall not be bound by the Bill in its capacity as lessor, or immediate lessor of any premises.  &ldquo;State authority&rdquo; is defined in section 3 as a Minister of the Government, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, or the Irish Land Commission, these being the only authorities that hold land or buildings on behalf of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this discussion begs the question: why the exemption for the State?  The basis of the exemption of the State as landlord from the provisions of the Landlord and Tenants Act lies in the recognition that the role of the State as a landlord is not the same as that for a private individual or a corporation.  In the latter <Col N="208" /> case the ownership and leasing of land and property represents an entrepreneurial activity motivated by profit.  The State is normally involved in the ownership and leasing of lands and property only incidental to its administration of such lands and property, possession of which by the State is necessary in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The following examples illustrate this point.  The Minister for Transport owns tracts of land in the vicinity of the three State airports, ownership of which is necessary to ensure against development of the land in a manner that would inhibit airport operations.  The Minister for Defence holds lands adjacent to certain military installations for reasons similar to those of the Minister for Transport. Most leases of land made by or on behalf of the Minister for Defence include a proviso that possession of the lands may be recovered at any time if military exigencies so demand.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works hold land at such places as national monuments, the Phoenix Park extension, along the banks of the River Shannon, at State harbours, such as D˙n Laoghaire, Howth, Dunmore East.  In most cases the actual possession of the land is unnecessary, but it is essential that the commissioners retain control over the development and use of the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Tourism has vested in him by the Foreshore Act, 1933, the bulk of the foreshore around our coast.  Retention of control over the development and user of the foreshore is obviously necessary for the preservation of public rights of way, rights of navigation and rights of fishing over and from the foreshore.  Accordingly, land is held on behalf of the State in a wide variety of circumstances.  If the exemption of the State from landlord and tenant legislation generally were to be removed, a possible outcome of failure to include an expressed provision in the Bill would be that the public interest involved in the holding of such land would be at risk.  However, because of the variety of the circumstances, it would be extremely difficult to analyse the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> The Landlord and Tenant Commission have made no recommendation for a change in the position of the State.  All in all, the prudent course to adopt is to include a provision in the Bill which will leave the position of the State the same as by common consent up to the present it has been taken to be.  That is what is proposed in section 4 of the Bill.  Where lands held on behalf of the State have been disposed of by way of ground rent leases or tenancies of dwelling houses, however, a different situation arises.  In such cases the reasonable presumption is that the public interest is not involved. Section 70 of the Bill accordingly provides that the State shall, as landlord, be bound to a transfer of the fee simple except in a case where the State authority concerned certifies that such a transfer would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I have gone into detail in regard to this for the purpose of giving the background to the situation as we have it at the present time and also in an effort to try to outline some of the difficulties, which are so many that there is nobody able to give us even a guess at what these difficulties might be if we did as the Deputy suggested.  He knows that the Landlord and Tenant Commission have been sitting for some time.  As I said, they have not come forward with any proposal for change.  I accept that there was a very long and good discussion in the Seanad on this section.  The point made during the course of the debate in the Seanad with regard to the person who would at the end of his days find himself under the State and be denied his rights is something which is extremely important.  I believe I have come as far as I can.  I am not saying this in any way trying to score any political points.  On a technical Bill of this nature there is no question of anybody scoring anything over anybody else.  It is a question of trying to do what is right.  I am not saying that Deputy Fitzpatrick is not trying to do that.  I appreciate that he is, but I feel that we have come a good part of the way.  I am advised that I cannot go any further.</P>
    <P>The previous Government, of which <Col N="210" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick was a member, were not prepared to come as far as I have come now.  This section is quite a bone of contention and I do not mean that in any derogatory fashion.  This type of legislation will continue to be updated as long as the Landlord and Tenant Commission are sitting.  If after having further analysed it they recommend a change, I can safely say to Deputy Fitzpatrick and the other Members of the House that whichever Minister for Justice is here I am sure he will be quite prepared to go along with it.</P>
    <P>I have a lot of sympathy with what Deputy Fitzpatrick says, but I am afraid I cannot go any further than I have gone.  I also say, without trying to score any political points, that I have gone further than my predecessor might have been prepared to go, although there is nothing definite on that either because he did not get a chance to debate it on Committee Stage.  Perhaps he would have gone as far as I.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that there was a privileged position in 1976 where there was some doubt on this, even though the doubt did not have a judicial verdict.  One cannot reasonably use that argument.  It seems clear to me that the reason this is being introduced is because the State is far from sure that they have the right.  The privileged position of the State <i>vis-‡-vis</i> the private individual needs to be proved.  This has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter that is really at issue is the concept of equality before the law.  It is dangerous to embark too readily on a process of introducing legislation which is applicable to the general public but which the State, for apparently good reasons, decides not to apply to itself. The Minister said that the State has certain lands in its ownership and, in order to pursue the maximum use of those lands in the public interest, the State felt itself obliged to write this section into law.  We are not disputing the right of the State to own land, to use land or to exercise its full responsibility for the public security and welfare.  That is not what is <Col N="211" /> at issue.  The matter that is at issue is why we should embark on a precedent in law of giving to the State a privileged position with regard to the law.  Most people feel that the State is overbureaucratic sometimes and not quick enough to consider the small man. Despite the goodwill of the Minister and I am sure of every Member of the House, we cannot forever be guaranteed a benign Government or a benign Minister.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in regard to this and I believe he is being advised that it is useful to put it in.  If a situation ever arose where the alleged limitations on the State's readiness to utilise its ownership of land came about, the State would, as it has done in the past, introduce necessary legislation, perhaps with the co-operation of the full House, of an extraordinary nature to deal with that situation.  It is a little unwholesome to me to put on the Statute Book legislation which separates responsibilities as applying to the State and individuals.  It would be preferable to do without it if the only argument is the hypothetical one that the day may come when the State might have to utilise powers or exercise its responsibilities over its property in some way, as yet undefined, which would make the exercise of that extremely difficult or impossible under the law which exists for the private individual.</P>

      <P>That D·il …ireann notes the continued failure of the Government to take decisive action in the area of the control of prices after almost three years in office: aware of the promises of the Government contained in pages 10 and 11 of the Fianna F·il manifesto relating in particular to its undertaking to discourage increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control and influence; and to examine the accounting procedures of the ESB with a view to reducing the price of electricity; also notes that since the beginning of 1980 further price increases have been sanctioned by the Government, including increases of 10.5 per cent in coal, 20.5 per cent in ESB rates, 4 per cent in milk, 10 per cent in bread, 20 per cent in CIE fares, 29p in bottled gas&mdash;all of which have hit the weaker sections of the community hardest&mdash;and condemns this further abject failure of the Government to cushion the most disadvantaged sections of the community from the effects of price increases by their deliberate escalation of these price trends due to their own policies such as the abolition of food subsidies.</P>
      <P>The increases in the prices of essential commodities and services which have taken place since the return of Fianna F·il to Government in June 1977 not only places an intolerable burden on consumers but constitutes a cynical and unscrupulous breach of the election promises and undertakings made by that party in seeking support in that election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clouds of almost radio-active republican rhetoric which wafted out <Col N="213" /> from the RDS last week-end cannot obscure this serious situation.  Most politicians in relation to price control are long on analysis and short on solutions. However, listening to the Taoiseach last Saturday evening one felt that he was commenting on another world.  The real world of price rises and PAYE does not apparently relate to the nationalist rhetoric of the Taoiseach.  But then it is not every family in the country who can afford to pop out to the back garden, shoot a few pheasants, have them plucked, and served for dinner.  It is indicative of the economic and social priorities of the Taoiseach that in an Ard-Fheis speech of over one hour we had a curt two minute reference to prices and the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>I make these harsh comments because I feel that our country is once again drifting into the vicious spiral of prices&mdash;incomes escalation.  There is clear evidence that such inflation is a guaranteed means of making the rich relatively richer and the poor relatively poorer.  Campaigning against inflation and doing its utmost to reduce the worst effects of inflation should therefore be a high priority for any Government unless of course the Taoiseach wishes to see a continuation of a situation where the men of property gain all along the line and the pensioners are left at the bottom of the pile.  Arising out of this inflation large numbers of jobs can also be threatened.  It needs to be pointed out to every trade unionist in the country that, while some wage or salary groups may be able to get ahead in such an inflationary race for some of the time, all groups will not be able to get ahead all of the time and anybody in the trade union movement who thinks that this can be done is only indulging in economic fantasy. Such realism is evident from every single one of the reports of the National Prices Commission since 1971, which I had an opportunity to read over the prolonged Christmas Recess.</P>
    <P>Consumer prices rose by 16 per cent in the year to November 1979.  Since Fianna F·il took office&mdash;and I am using the base of August 1979&mdash;prices have <Col N="214" /> moved as follows: all consumer prices are up by 27.3 per cent; food prices are up by 26.3 per cent.  If one had the mid-February figure that would be substantially greater.  But essential food items which hit the housewife's purse and where subsidies have already been partially removed have increased as follows:</P>

    <P>During the election campaign Fianna F·il canvassers went from door to door with the famous gospel&mdash;not the manifesto, which was rather large for digestion&mdash;in the form of a handbook called the &ldquo;Fianna F·il Canvasser's Guide for 1977&rdquo;.  It is rather interesting to quote the section on prices and a couple of questions in that guide:</P>
    <P>Q.  Will Fianna F·il put VAT back on food?</P>
    <P>A.  No. On the contrary, Fianna F·il is in favour of food subsidies which reduce the price of everyday foods and we pressed the Coalition to introduce them for the best part of a year before they finally did so. </P>
    <P>In the field of price control I fully accept that miracles cannot be worked. Prices must bear some direct relation to costs of production.  If wages and salaries or the price of materials rise, price rises must inevitably follow.  If such price increases are to be prevented, then the increased costs would of course have to be met from either profits or from improvements in efficiency.  It is also clearly quite evident that, if the profits of any undertaking are pushed below the level required to maintain and up-date a firm's plant and equipment, higher efficiency is quite unlikely to occur and in the long run such a firm will not survive for long.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> However, having made this admission, I would strongly point out that price control and surveillance can be so operated as to limit price increases to the minimum and to prevent prices or charges being increased without full justification.  In my opinion, if the National Prices Commission and the sanctioning role of the Government can be seen by the public to be operating with reasonable effectiveness over the general range of goods and services, this can be a vital factor in reassuring consumers that their interests are in fact being protected and that there is no licence on a general basis throughout the country to raise prices at will.  I get the distinct impression that in recent months&mdash;and perhaps not unrelated to the fact that there is little sympathy between the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the present Taoiseach&mdash;the sanctioning of such increases has just been let rip.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious charges which can be made against the present Government is their obdurate refusal to consider any subsidy to reduce prices in critical areas of consumer expenditure.  For example, in the June 1975 Budget introduced by the then Coalition Government there was a CIE subsidy increase in order to reduce fares to their level before 12 May 1974.  Fares on Dublin city bus services, provincial bus services and Dublin and Cork commuter rail services accordingly were reduced at that time by no less than 25 per cent on average.  That was part of a deliberate policy to keep prices down.</P>
    <P>Also in the 1975 Budget the price of bread was subsidised by 5Ωp per loaf of 800 grammes and flour was subsidised by 4Ωp per kilo.  On that occasion the cost of a loaf of bread was reduced by a net 4p or 20 per cent.  In the same budget, at a time of exceeding stringency, the then existing subsidy of 2.4p per pound of butter was increased by 10p to 12.4p per pound and the price of milk for human consumption was subsidised by 2p per pint.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> As many consumers are also aware, town gas costs have substantially increased in recent years.  I would point out that, for example, in the 1975 budget a subsidy to producers of town gas was introduced to enable them to reduce the price to consumers by an average of 12Ω per cent.  Likewise in 1975, in relation to value-added tax this was removed from electricity and from all fuels except road fuels.  It was removed from clothing and from clothing materials and footwear. These categories had been subject to the 6.75 per cent tax rate.</P>
    <P>Thus, if one takes the 1975 Budget, in a period of relative stringency and recession, the net effect of the measures which we then introduced was at that time to reduce a rise in the consumer price index by no fewer than 4 percentage points. This was at a time of massive high inflation, and decisive action on our part succeeded in mitigating the worst effects on the middle and lower income group families in the country.  There is a pattern for the Government to follow.  But, regrettably, due to their profligate policy of recent years there is now no money in the national coffers to meet such subsidies and to follow a similar policy.  This is a matter of profound regret and it directly reflects the fact that the management of the State's finances in the past three years has been, to say the least, catastrophic.  The present Taoiseach was a member of that Cabinet since mid-1977 and he cannot now merely shrug off his share of collective responsibility for that debacle.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the effects of taxation policy on prices and price control. The Labour Party strongly oppose any proposal to introduce further broadly based VAT increases.  There is already a high level of indirect taxation in relation to total taxation.  Such further VAT increases would inevitably cover many of the necessities of life.  Price inflation would further accelerate.  It would be inherently inequitable in that its incidence would not be directly related to taxable capacity or to family circumstances.  It would result in a more inequitable distribution of the tax burden over the community. <Col N="217" /> In effect, such reliance on indirect taxation would mean an additional burden on all lower and middle income families.</P>
    <P>I would strongly stress that such prospective VAT increases would definitely raise the cost of living.  It would immediately give rise to quite justifiable income demands for increases in wages and salaries.  This policy could well have serious implications in relation to costs and our competitive position.  In our opinion, at a time when stability of prices is generally considered to be a primary aim of economic policy it would be folly for the Government to deliberately raise prices over a wide range of commodities by the further inposition of VAT increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party wish to express their appreciation of the work of the National Prices Commission in their serious efforts to limit price increases to what is absolutely necessary if employment and the viability of enterprises are to be maintained.  I suggest that the commission be provided with whatever resources they require in the future to extend their activities and to play an even more effective role in price control and surveillance.  Likewise, it is to be deplored that the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs does not seem to be able to cope with the many hundreds of complaints that could be dealt with if he had sufficient expert staff and if he was in a position to employ consultants for various contentious areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the speech of the Taoiseach it was suggested that the future role of the NPC should be reviewed.  I should like to point out harshly to the Taoiseach that this review was an integral part of that famous manifesto.  I do not think that a full review report has yet been published after almost three years in office.  It is important to stress that the NPC are a strictly advisory body to the Minister and that the Cabinet have the final <Col N="218" /> responsibility to accept or reject their recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough on a Friday evening after we have left D·il …ireann that news about price increases is surreptitiously released and banged out to the media and that on Saturday morning the coverage of weekend sports crowds out the news of price increases.  That kind of procedure is not good enough.  However, it is not the responsibility of the NPC when the Minister decided to release news of price increases.</P>
    <P>The positive aspects of the work of the NPC should be emphasised.  They have eliminated some blatant efforts at profiteering and they have moderated excessive applications.  In this regard I wish to pay tribute to the general work of the NPC and in so doing to pay tribute to the recently retired chairman, Mr. John Walsh, who gave dedicated public service to the commission since 1975.  During his years in the IDA and in the Restrictive Practices Commission his work was a continuing contribution to our economic and social development. I wish the new chairman well in his difficult work.  The NPC cannot be held responsible for failures of Government strategy.  It is quite evident that in many areas the Government have failed to consult the NPC on major aspects of economic strategy and the effect on prices.  For example, I do not believe there was any consultation with the NPC on the removal of food subsidies and I do not believe that at the moment any papers are being sought from the NPC on the question of indirect taxation. They might well have some views to express on these two policies that contain the ripe seeds of further inflation.  I think the answer of the NPC would be in the negative.</P>
    <P>Personally I have always welcomed the Price Line system of notification of complaints by consumers and I have encouraged constituents to avail of it.  That system should be extended and it should be publicised more effectively.  It is significant to note that two-thirds of all price complaints notified to Price Line have been found to be justified. <Col N="219" /> Therefore, it appears there is plenty of scope for expansion of that system.</P>
    <P>With regard to restrictive practices on prices, there must be a concerted effort on the part of the Government, employers and trade unions to ensure that such practices are eliminated.  Undoubtedly they increase costs and these, in turn, increase prices.  In many areas of Irish life there are expensive and unsatisfactory procedures that result in a lower level of productive efficiency. These practices exist at all levels&mdash;even in Leinster House; certainly they exist in the public service, the manufacturing sector and in the professions.  The NPC should have a special brief to seek out these detrimental practices and to refuse or only recommend partial price increases where obviously no effort has been made to remove the barriers to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>I have considered for some time the Restrictive Practices Commission and the National Prices Commission and I think the Minister should consider seriously their amalgamation.  I had great sympathy with the Minister recently in relation to some difficulties he had arising out of some aspects of personnel relating to the Restrictive Practices Commission.  On balance the two-tier system operating at present is not effective. The functions of the NPC and the RPC are in many ways complementary, particularly in the competition sectors. The RPC have a two-tier system of an examiner and a commission with prior reference to the examiner and dependence on his report to the commission. The whole business should be streamlined.  There are excessive delays in the examination of restrictive practices. For example, we have had an examination of petrol distributors since April 1979 which was recently extended. I was a trade union official involved in the embryonic role of the Prices Advisory Committee and I have always felt that the Prices Division of the Department of Industry and Commerce have been able to move with greater speed. They have always presented their reports <Col N="220" /> much more expeditiously and the practice could be followed by the Restrictive Practices Commission and the National Prices Commission in a joint role.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Labour Party it is absolutely necessary that the public should become involved in the general price surveillance machinery.  For this reason we have argued over the years that in the major centres of population it should be possible to establish local prices committees.  Such committees should be representative of the local chambers of commerce, trading organisations, the local trades councils and other appropriate voluntary organisations such as the Irish Housewives Association and they should have certain simple basic powers devolved on them.  For example, such local committees should have power to check if all local traders display price lists, and to inquire from such traders if these lists are, in fact, up to date.  They might well be given the power to hold informal hearings and local inquiries into particular prices or charges, and local consumers and consumer organisations would be entitled to attend and give evidence.  Findings could be reported to the NPC at national level.</P>
    <P>In this way these local prices committees would be in a position to act as local watchdogs for local consumers, to involve the local organisations in the machinery of price surveillance and provide some local opportunity for local action to keep prices down.  In many parts of the country there are particular local trading practices and there is, of course, throughout the country a total lack of consumer information.  These committees could act as the local information centres for the consumers and they could work also in close liaison with the national Consumer Affairs Director and his staff.  It is essential that there should be a follow-through from the legislation which this House has enacted on consumer affairs in the past two years.</P>
    <P>Of particular benefit in my opinion has been the coverage of consumer price issues and complaints by RTE particularly <Col N="221" /> in two main programmes, namely, the consumer affairs section of the Gay Byrne radio programme in the morning and also and equally the coverage of consumer affairs in the Rodney Rice programme later in the morning.</P>
    <P>These particular programmes are invaluable in bringing to public attention the issues surrounding consumer complaints about prices, and in ensuring that consumers get value for money.  A number of complaints have been directly resolved to the satisfaction of the parties concerned.  However, it would appear to me that the resources of RTE in this area are stretched to the limit and it may well be that there should be an indirect subsidy from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism to these media programmes in RTE either by way of making staff available from the Public Service to these programmes to enable them to expand or by providing a direct cash subsidy to enable them to employ a larger number of staff and to extend air time for these essential programmes. Also it is in my opinion most necessary that on the television programmes of RTE there should be specific consumer affairs programmes dealing with price issues.  I appreciate that in the history of RTE such programmes have been extremely controversial but there is no reason whatever why this vital area should not be revived and extended in the national interest.  Far too often in this country many consumers, particularly in relation to the personal services, are prepared to accept shoddy, inferior and poor quality service when with a greater degree of awareness and determination on the part of consumers much better value for money could be obtained from the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In my remaining ten minutes I want to refer to a number of aspects in a number of areas and one area to which I want to refer is that of land prices.  To some extent it may be outside the ambit of the Minister but there is total failure or neglect on the part of the Government to come to grips with the upsurge in building land prices which has been a notable feature of price inflation over the past decade.  As far back as 1969 the NIEC recommended to the Government that an urgent study should be made to assemble the facts about increased site values so as to establish precisely the magnitude of the increases which had then occurred.  Unless action is taken now&mdash;and, as the Minister well knows, in some areas it is far too late at this stage&mdash;it can be expected that the same factors which throughout the seventies led to massive increases in <Col N="223" /> building land prices will lead to further such increases in the future.  In the opinion of the Labour Party, it is imperative, both from the social and the economic standpoint, that effective statutory steps are taken to prevent this continued exploitation of the community and the appropriation by a small number of landowners and speculators of values created directly by community action.</P>
      <P>At the moment I am Vice-Chairman of Dublin County Council and next year I hope, if I am around, to be Chairman of the council.  It has been quite evident to me since I first became a member of that council in 1975 that this exploitation of pressing community needs has been a major factor in the rise in house prices which should be of serious concern in the light of the still acute shortage of housing accommodation affecting many thousands of young couples and single persons seeking their own homes.</P>
      <P>There has been more rigorous enforcement of the income tax provisions in relation to land speculation.  Unfortunately, successive Governments have accepted the very narrow legalistic definition of property rights in our Constitution. We should put on record that we intend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Time will not permit me to cope with it.  I will leave that aspect in relation to land prices and go on to another area which is close to my heart, and I am sure to the Minister's, that of banking charges and profits. There is at the moment massive public criticism about the profits, bank charges and services of the commercial banks, as the Minister is well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting into another field now. The motion deals with prices and the <Col N="224" /> House would understand that that means prices of consumer goods.  We are not going to talk about bank profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If you, Sir, had to pay 22 per cent on a bank bridging loan you would know what prices are all about.  It is entirely proper that we should refer to this impact on prices in our community and it is entirely wrong that the scale of those profits and charges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to keep within the script.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;should be outside the statutory investigative role of the NPC.  Therefore, they should be brought within its scope.  The commercial banks are getting away with the cream of the economy of this country with, generally speaking, very low productivity, relatively short hours of public service, high interest rates and massive profits as a result of the inflationary situation.  The NPC should be empowered to do something in this area even if it hurts the Central Bank's controlling and supervision in that regard.</P>
      <P>I refer to another area of massive price increases, namely CIE, which is referred to in our motion.  I submit strongly that the Government must make up their minds rather than blather on at ard-fheiseanna, about the issue of a national transport policy.  No policy whatsoever has been enunciated in regard to the increased costs relative to CIE.  When you read through the various reports of the NPC you sense time and again the feeling that there must and should be a coherent, clearly enunciated national transport policy.  We have a double failure here with a situation where not only is there no national transport policy, but CIE are starved of capital and as a result the quality of service in CIE rockets downwards and the cost to the consumer rockets upward. There is need for decisive action in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other areas into which I do not propose to go in any great detail. <Col N="225" /> The Government have done nothing regarding the NPC report in relation to the Dublin fruit and vegetable market. Any housewife in the country, particularly housewives who do the bulk of buying of fruit and vegetables, will point to the relatively high cost of purchasing these products.  We have low quality and high price in relation to these basic vegetables, yet no decisive action has been taken by the Government in relation to the quite strong reports which have been received from the NPC.</P>
    <P>I refer to the question of coal prices.  It is time to put the boot in in relation to the monopolistic situation in coal prices and the system of distribution of coal.  I am perturbed about the quality of the coal delivered throughout the greater Dublin area by this monopoly.  It appears to be a very low grade industrial coal not suitable for domestic use.  You would need a blow-lamp to burn some of it.  It is clear that a sub-standard mixture has been imported and distributed.  The Government should take action in this regard and I fault the Government in that respect.  I have three minutes left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On the price of drink there is abject failure again to take decisive action.  The prices of alcoholic and soft drinks are a national scandal. Consumers and tourists are expected to pay massively over the odds in the ordinary lounge bars.  I hesitate to imagine what the Welsh supporters will say when they come to Lansdowne Road shortly and in some of the lounge bars in that area will have to pay 60p or 65p for a pint of beer when they can get it at half the price in their local rugby clubs at home.  Unless we wish to ruin our tourist trade and cause our consumers to have heart failure, it is essential that the price of drink in that regard be dealt with effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, having spoken on three separate occasions in this House about prices in the past few years, I have tried to put some of my thoughts down <Col N="226" /> on paper.  I hope I have been as constructive as possible in relation to this matter.  I appreciate the difficulties facing the Government and any Government in relation to price control, price surveillance and prices machinery.  It is a complex and difficult area.  I do not suggest that any miracles can be worked on it, but the Government should devote far greater energy during this year to ensuring that the worst effects of inflation are mitigated.  This motion is not just a retrospective motion in relation to the deplorable promises made by the Government for a narrow electoral advantage in the last general election.  The electorate have seen through that and I need not stress it unduly.  The electorate now want to know about constructive proposals and for that reason I have tried to be as unabrasive as possible.  I hope that some of our suggestions and comments in relation to individual commodities will be considered by the Minister in the situation in which we find ourselves as we enter the eighties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of my regular six monthly appearance to speak in this ritual debate on this ritual motion.  God willing, we will be back again in six months' time when the next instalment comes up and possibly subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Desmond moved and spoke on the motion because I heard him at lunch time on the radio today complaining about the Book of Estimates published this morning, the cuts in public expenditure, the reductions in a number of areas and the very obvious successful efforts by the Government to control public expenditure. Public expenditure, as it gets higher and since a great element of it is based on borrowing, is an inflationary factor.  I would have thought that somebody complaining about inflation would welcome the successful efforts of the Government to control public expenditure.  However, Deputy Desmond was all for more expenditure irrespective of who would pay for it.  The Deputy now comes along here tonight, six hours later, and says the <Col N="227" /> direct opposite: that we must control inflation and that we must do all the things that would help to reduce inflation.  That sums up that Deputy's dilemma and it explains his obvious lack of enthusiasm for this debate as he read his not very original script.</P>
    <P>The principal target in the Fianna F·il manifesto, so far as it related to prices and inflation, at the time of the last general election, was to reduce inflation during 1978 to a figure of 7 per cent at a time when it was running at 15 per cent.  Inflation had been at 18 per cent, 21 per cent and 19 per cent in the previous three years and 7 per cent had not been achieved since the sixties.  The public were so inured to, not just double digit inflation but to inflation in the region of 20 per cent, that a lot of people, not least Deputy Desmond and some of his colleagues, thought that our pledge to reduce inflation to 7 per cent was nothing better than a joke.  That is one part of the manifesto that the framers of this motion conveniently and selectively decided to leave out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure of 7 per cent was achieved and it is a figure of which we can be extremely proud.  We got the inflation rate back to normal from the figures consistently in excess of 20 per cent which we had suffered during the term of the last Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond feels that we should devote more energy to dealing with this question.  It is a pity that the Deputy did not express that desire some years ago in the face of the over 20 per cent inflation figure.  During the four and a quarter years of Coalition Government there was a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce, a colleague of Deputy Desmond before he lost his seat.  I asked the Department to examine the number of <Col N="228" /> occasions on which he intervened in any way on a recommendation of the National Prices Commission during that term and I was informed that on no occasion, despite the thousands of recommendations made by the National Prices Commission and the fact that that time was by far historically the worst years for inflation here, did the then Minister intervene.  Not once did the Minister bestir himself to even cast doubt on any one of those recommendations.  That Minister and the Government of which he was a member saw themselves as rubber stamps and somebody else could worry about inflation and prices.  Proof of it was the kind of inflation levels which occurred in that time.</P>
    <P>A Minister for Industry and Commerce should concern himself with prices; and one of the reasons why things went out of control during the Coalition term of office was the total disinterest of that Minister.  If that Minister were seen to have had an interest in these matters it would have been helpful to the Prices Commission and it would have been helpful in trying to break the spiral which went out of control at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to him to do so in so far as he is allowed.  I asked the Department to do a survey as best they could in a short period of the price control systems in each of the nine EEC nations. It appears that ours is by far the most stringent and one of the most difficult with which to comply.  That worries me to some extent from the industrial point of view, because perhaps more pressures are put on firms here than in other countries.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that some months ago the British Government decided to abolish price controls altogether.  The result has been a major rise in their inflation level and it is now substantially above ours.  Apart from Britain and Italy, whose inflation rates are a good deal higher than ours, another interesting country which traditionally had a rate of inflation about one third of ours now has a rate approximately equal with ours.  Deputy Desmond knows very well that there are major external factors which are creating enormous inflationary pressures for all countries, not least for this country.  I am relieved that we have, as a result of hard work and careful scrutiny of all these applications, been able to hold things down to a reasonable level which is very considerably below that which operated some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual rate of inflation in 1975 was 20.9 per cent and last year it was 13.2 per cent.  This is in spite of the fact that the increase in the price of oil in 1974 was approximately six dollars a barrel&mdash;from three to nine dollars&mdash;whereas the increase in the price of oil up to January 1980 has been of the order of 14 dollars a barrel, from 12 dollars to 26 dollars for cheapest oil&mdash;light Arabian crude&mdash;and from 12 dollars to 34 dollars for average oil, including North Sea oil.  In 13 months the price of oil has almost trebled and in <Col N="231" /> cash terms has gone up enormously when compared with the six dollars a barrel increase which was seen in 1974 and 1975 and then came to an end.  In respect of most oil the increase is now 22 dollars a barrel, from 12 dollars to 34 dollars, and in respect of a not insignificant quantity of &ldquo;spot&rdquo; oil from 12 dollars up to 40 dollars or even 42 dollars a barrel.  These are absolutely crippling increases having a very serious effect on the economy of this country and its balance of payments.  All this money is going out of the country.  It seems remarkable that we have still been able to hold the rate of inflation well below what it was when the trivial increases of the mid-seventies were taking place.</P>
    <P>With no disrespect to him, it is a bit pathetic to listen to Deputy Desmond going through this ritual performance. The great bulk of what he said is for the gallery or the optics.  If his demand that the price of everything be stopped were complied with, he is well aware that every second factory would be closed down in no time.  Factories subject to price control who are manufacturing for the home market could not compete.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for anyone in my position to hold the balance between the competing needs, demands and pressures of the consumer and those of an industrialist who is trying to produce goods at a reasonable price, trying to keep his workers in employment and in many cases trying to expand employment at a time of considerable economic difficulty.  I receive a certain number of complaints about prices being too high or price control not being stringent enough, but the complaints I get in that respect are only a fraction of the complaints from aggrieved people subject to price control.  Hardly a week passes when two or three people do not come to the Department to talk to me or the Minister of State about the difficulties which price control is creating for them, about how unfair they regard it and how stringently it has been applied, particularly in the past two years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> I have to have the greatest of sympathy for those people.  The manufacturers of some of the goods mentioned by Deputy Desmond earlier were with me as recently as last Friday complaining bitterly that the price rises I allowed were restricted and unfair and that they would not be able to continue.  Tonight we listened to simplistic complaints because a particular commodity was increased in price.</P>
    <P>I should like to take coal as an example. Domestic coal is in very short supply in the world and the demand for it far exceeds the ability of producers to produce it.  Poland for many years was our traditional source of supply, but the Poles cannot increase their output to allow us have any more.  Their own domestic demand has had to go up enormously and they have to divert any additional production to the home market and to other Comicon countries because certain pressures are brought on them to honour their obligations.  We have been fortunate in being able to hold our level of imported Polish coal and I should like to thank the Polish authorities, whom I visited in Warsaw, for enabling us to retain that situation when in other circumstances our supply of Polish coal could have been cut off.</P>
    <P>The Americans are prepared to sell us a particular type of coal at a certain price.  They can fix their price.  The Australians, with whom certain Irish firms have had contact, are very choosey.  They point out that coal is a sellers' market and they would do business on their terms which includes long term contracts.  They will not sell spot coal.  What am I expected to do as Minister for Industry and Commerce facing a winter?  Am I expected to tell coal importers that they cannot buy any coal because Deputy Desmond or other people consider it too expensive?  Where is the coal supposed to come from?  We do not have any of our own.  We cannot fix the price; that is fixed by the sellers and that will be the situation for a number of years to come.  There is no doubt that domestic coal and, perhaps, in the <Col N="233" /> future steam coal, will be a sellers' market.  It is futile to make complaints here that have no bearing on the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase allowed in the price of coal this year was 9.2 per cent and not 10.5 per cent as mentioned in the motion.  The original application by the firm concerned was cut back considerably by the National Prices Commission and myself, so much so that the firm told me&mdash;it was legitimate for them to tell me&mdash;that they may have to pull out of certain markets.  If I am satisfied that they are in that danger I will have to relax further to the minimum extent necessary to enable them to ensure they get the supplies our consumers need.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting the position in relation to bottled gas.  We have had a number of increases in this commodity over the past nine months&mdash;if I am not mistaken there were four increases.  It should be remembered that this is an oil product, a by-product of the oil refining process.  It is subject to the same constraints as oil.  I recently cut back a recommendation of the National Prices Commission in relation to this commodity although I realised it was dangerous to cut it back seriously.  I cut that recommendation because I was not satisfied with the evidence put forward by the firm concerned in relation to its purchases on the spot market.  I told them I would reconsider that aspect of the application when they produced better and proper evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the careful way that bottled gas has been controlled and monitored by the National Prices Commission and me over the past year, in spite of the enormous increases in crude oil, approaching 200 per cent in some cases, is that the ordinary standard domestic cylinder costs in Britain £4.69 while the same cylinder, containing the same amount of gas coming from the British oil fields in the North Sea, costs in Ireland £3.56.  In other words, it is <Col N="234" /> £1.13 cheaper.  What is Deputy Desmond complaining about if bottled gas here is £1.13 per cylinder cheaper than it is in the country which produces it and has it on its own doorstep?  I cannot see any failure to exercise the most careful and stringent control over that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should ask Calor-Kosangas about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The result of this is that there is a danger of a run on bottled gas in Border counties by people from Northern Ireland.  That is a fact we cannot forget.  Deputy Desmond complained bitterly about the rise in CIE fares but I should like to point out that the National Prices Commission found that, based on CIE's recent application, the company would be justified in putting up their fares by 44 per cent.  The increase granted was 20 per cent.  The enormous unfortunate subsidy that has to be paid to CIE now stands at £56 million when it was £20 million two years ago.  What does the Deputy think the fares would be if that enormous subsidy was not paid. What is it but a subsidy of passengers and, to a lesser extent, a subsidy of freight.</P>
      <P>The recent increase in the price of bread was 4p and not 5p as reported in the newspapers.  The 5p increase was for a loaf that is not as popular as the ordinary loaf.  The need for that increase was brought about by an increase in the price of flour due to higher prices being paid for wheat and much higher labour costs.  There is no way either of those items can be controlled.  I do not fix the price Irish farmers get for their wheat.  I believe they get the highest price in Europe and, unfortunately, if they do consumers here must pay for that.  There is no way that situation can be avoided. There are a lot of such individual cases that one would like to go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to look at what the ESB's costs are now as a result of their heavy dependence on oil.  They got seriously out of line as a result of that situation.  It is interesting to note that their annual fuel costs for 1980-81 have <Col N="235" /> been estimated by them to be £211 million and their total actual revenue for 1978-79 was only £223 million.  In those circumstances, with the ESB so enormously dependent on oil, is it any wonder that they have to put up their prices by substantial amounts.  The Deputy forgot to mention that in the first two years of this Government, and before those enormous oil increases came on, the ESB reduced their prices twice, in one case by 5 per cent and in the other case by 7 per cent, but we did not hear much here about those decreases.</P>
    <P>The question of price control has been monitored vigorously and followed up by me.  Unlike my predecessor, I have taken a constant personal interest in this area.  In accordance with our undertaking in the manifesto, I have not acted as a rubber stamp at any time.  I have not pawned everything off to a junior Minister in the Department, which was what my predecessor did when he acquired a junior Minister and when he gave up all interest in the matter of price control.  Despite the undoubted problems we are experiencing, I am very glad to be able to finish as I began, that is, on a cheerful note.  I have been asked for the official estimate of the mid-February figure for the CPI, but I cannot give the figure because it will not be published for some weeks yet.  However, there is a decrease in the rate of inflation to mid-February from the mid-November figure and that is something I find very heartening.  It is indicative of the efforts that are made within the enormous limitations which constrain the Government and which constrain me to keep under the most effective management possible the monitoring and control of these prices.</P>

      <P>We in Fine Gael support fully this motion in the names of Members of the Labour Party.  Prices have been increasing rapidly and are getting seriously out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has quoted some interesting statistics in regard to the price of oil.  He quoted the various prices for crude oil, light oil and for oil purchased <Col N="236" /> on the spot market.  However, I have some figures which I should like to put before the House.  These relate to the market price for Ireland in respect of Saudi-Arabian light crude oil.  I shall outline the prices from January 1973 to January 1980.</P>
    <P>In January 1973 a barrel of SaudiArabian oil cost $2.60.  In January 1974 the price had increased to $10.55.  This was a quadrupling of the price during that year.  Never before had this country experienced an increase of that order in the price of oil.  In January 1975 the price stood at $11.10, while in January 1976 the price was $11.80.  In January 1977 the price had increased to $12.95 and about half way through that year had dropped to $12.70.  Early in January 1979 the price increased again to $13.34.  In April of that year the price stood at $14.55 while in the following July it had increased to $18.  In December 1979 the price stood at $24.00 and in January of this year we were paying approximately $26.00 for this product.  It will be seen, therefore, that after a fourfold increase in price in one of the years under consideration oil prices continued to spiral until January 1977 when they decreased and held until early 1979.  It will be noted from the figures I have given that the price has not quite doubled from early 1979 to date.  I am speaking of the product of one country but the figures give the picture for oil products generally.  It was while we were in Government that there was the fourfold increase.</P>

      <P>The Government have been quoting from the CPI.  From mid-November 1973 to mid-November 1974 the inflation rate was 20 per cent.  Up to 1976 inflation was running at 20.6 per cent.  Then it decreased to 10.8 per cent between 1976 and 1977.  The policies that were being adopted by the Coalition Government contributed significantly to the decrease in the inflation rate at that time.  From 1977 to 1978 inflation admittedly <Col N="237" /> decreased to 7.9 per cent, but we now have a figure of 16 per cent. Regarding the Minister's forecast that the figures this year will show a decrease in inflation, all I can say is that time will tell.</P>
      <P>At the time when we were experiencing what was perhaps the most savage inflation rate ever suffered by any country Fianna F·il, who were then in opposition, were calling for the introduction of food subsidies and such subsidies were introduced by the then Minister for Finance.  In this regard I shall quote from the Official Report for 14 November 1978, column 871.  The speaker was Deputy O'Donoghue and he said:</P>
      <P>A predominant part of that package was a package to introduce food subsidies.  Fianna F·il had already been campaigning for that.  I can quote speeches in the autumn of 1974 in the early days of the oil crisis and its aftermath.  I can point to speeches and statements made then by the present Taoiseach and T·naiste advocating the introduction of those subsidies.  They were welcomed by Fianna F·il at that time. </P>
      <P>At that time inflation was 20 per cent and now it is 16 per cent.  The Government have partly dismantled the food subsidies but I hope that they will have enough wisdom not to dismantle them further.  For the sake of all those who are hit most by inflation in terms of the prices of food, of heating and of transport&mdash;I refer particularly to old age pensioners, to those in receipt of social welfare payments generally and to children&mdash;I appeal to the Government to restore the food subsidies that they have dismantled.</P>
      <P>A man earning £60 or £70 a week finds it very difficult to feed and clothe a wife and family.  Therefore every effort should be made to cushion the price increases being introduced week after week.  With the abolition of the wealth tax, the car tax and so on, the Government have left themselves very little room to manoeuvre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will discuss that later. The working man has seen the wealthy man getting relief by the abolition of the wealth tax while he, the working man, is being taxed to the hilt.  This was one cause of the present unrest and was further aggravated by the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  The last national understanding granted very large pay increases because the trade unions realised they would have to fight hard to get a fair deal for their members.  If the Government had handled the economy properly those wage increases would not have been so high.</P>
      <P>Everybody is feeling the economic pinch.  The cost of every commodity is increasing&mdash;electricity, postal services, bread, butter and so on.  These are the items we hear about but there are countless other increases about which we never hear.  The price of drugs is rising rapidly.  I have been told that in the past few months these increases have been of the order of 20 or 30 per cent and I do not think I have heard anybody mention these increases.  Drugs are very essential for families who do not have medical cards.  These people have to pay their doctors and their chemists.  If they cannot afford the drugs their children may become seriously ill.  The National Prices Commission should look at these matters.</P>
      <P>I could criticise the Government's approach to price increases indefinitely but I want to say something positive about this.  I want to discuss our food markets. In <i>The Irish News,</i> Thursday, 14 February 1980 the headline read &ldquo;Shock figures show we import 90 p.c. of our foodstuffs&rdquo;.  The first paragraph read:</P>
      <P>Shock figures uncovered during an investigation at retail level into sales of foodstuffs in Northern Ireland show that a full 90 per cent is imported from Britain and elsewhere. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be an alarming increase in the importation of foodstuffs in the North and I am afraid this will happen <Col N="239" /> here.  If a chain of supermarkets were to get control of our grocery trade it could lead to a serious situation.  Our prices could be affected if the grocery trade were in the hands of too few people. Irrespective of the goodwill of any Minister, Coalition or Fianna F·il, if such a situation were to arise he may not be able to control it.</P>
    <P>I looked at our figures for imported preserved and processed foods.  In 1973 we imported approximately 150,000 metric tonnes and in 1978 we imported 400,000 metric tonnes.  The food processing industry is of considerable importance to the agricultural community and to the processing trade.  We <Col N="240" /> must maintain our food processing plants.  That is very important for our present and future price structure.  A responsible person should thoroughly investigate the food, home produced and imported, on sale in our supermarkets. Recently I went to a supermarket and I saw a very big container delivering goods imported from Britain.  People from the agricultural sector, the processing trade and the Department should look into this matter.</P>

      <P>Statistics of the population of individual townlands in the district electoral divisions concerned have been compiled, in so far as it is possible to do so, from the 1979 census records and are given in the following tables.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to point out in this regard that for many urban areas it is not possible to compile townland population figures as building development obliterates over time the physical features by which townland boundaries were originally defined on Ordnance Survey maps.  Thus it is not possible to show in the following tables separate population figures for townlands which are largely urban in character.</P>

This deadline was extended to 31 December 1979 to enable detailed feasability studies to be completed on a number of projects.</P>
      <P>Despite having taken what I would consider to be all reasonable steps, the licensees were unable to fulfil their job creation obligation by the relevant date.

      <P>The reference in the assignment agreement to the transfer of shares in Consolidated Gas Industries Limited was deemed to be inappropriate because of its implication that investment in this company would fulfil the obligations of the companies in question under Schedule 3 of the licence with regard to employment creation.</P>

      <P>Contacts established with developing countries through the Bilateral Aid Programme can result in certain commercial advantages and opportunities.

      <P>The existing arrangements whereby a special allowance, which is payable monthly in arrear, is awarded to a veteran of the War of Independence who has a duly awarded Service (1917-1921) Medal provide, among other things, for the application of a means test.  At present more than 6,000 such allowances are paid.  In addition some 3,000 military <Col N="66" /> service pensions are paid.  The pensioners concerned are entitled to the Service (1917-1921) Medal with Bar and some 1,000 of them are in receipt of the special allowance in addition to their pensions.  Apart from the 8,000 veterans who are thus in receipt of the special allowance or the service pension or both, it is estimated that there are a further 4,000 medal holders still alive.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the special allowance is to give a measure of support to veterans who on account of age or incapacity are not in a position to support themselves.  The means test has been relaxed progressively over the years and is now far from severe.  If it were further modified to permit of the grant of an allowance, irrespective of means, every military service pensioner and medal holder, no matter how well off he or she might be, would automatically be eligible for it in the same way as the most needy veteran who had no assessable means. Such a situation would tend to vitiate the whole purpose of the special allowance scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 445 and 446 together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on previous occasions, I believe that the problem of drinking by young persons is a social one related to the drinking habits of the community generally and that legislative changes or police action can at best have a marginal effect in dealing with the problem.  The co-operation of the community is essential in bringing to the notice of the Garda information concerning those who may be deliberately selling intoxicating liquor to underage persons.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, prohibits, in general, the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo; licensed premises to persons under the age of 18.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Act prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons under the age of 18 but subsection (4) allows the sale or delivery of intoxicating liquor to a person over the age of 15 in a corked and sealed vessel containing not less than one reputed pint.  If the exception were removed or modified, young people who may now avail themselves of the provision could find other ways of getting drink, for example, by getting companions who are over 18 to do the buying.  On the other hand, the provision seems to serve no good purpose and if the Intoxicating Liquor Acts were being amended serious consideration would be given to proposing its repeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various proposals for the amendment of the licensing laws, many of them relating to the problem of under-age drinking have been received by me and my predecessors over the years.  I am examining <Col N="72" /> amining all the proposals that have been made but, for a variety of reasons, I am not yet in a position to say what recommendations, if any, I will make.  In the meantime I would think it best to emphasise again that, at best, legislative change cannot do a great deal in this very difficult area.</P>
    <P>I have also dealt with the question of the introduction of identity cards on previous occasions and have pointed out that a licensee is not obliged to serve a person if there is a doubt as to the person's age.  Accordingly an identity card system would serve the purpose of permitting certain people to be served who otherwise might or might not be served. There are people who consider that it should be what is called an absolute offence for an under-age person to be served. That means that it would be an offence for a licensee or his servant to serve a person genuinely thought to be of age if it turned out that he was in fact under age.  Here again the main purpose served by an identity card would be to enable the holder to get drink then, in the absence of a card, he might be refused.  If an absolute offence on these lines was created a large number of people in the 18 to 21 age-group would no doubt provide themselves with identity cards, whether the law provides for their issue or not, in order to be able to buy drink.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a case for an identity card system has been established on the basis of its efficacy in the matter of ensuring that under-age persons do not get served with drink.  It is, however, possible that the creation of an absolute offence of the kind mentioned would have at least some effect, though I have no doubt that such a development would not be welcomed by what I am certain are the vast majority of licensees who would be unwilling to serve a person who is under age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of illegitimacy was discussed in this House&mdash;&mdash;and also in Seanad …ireann&mdash;&mdash;in the course of the debate on the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution (Adoption) Bill, 1978.  In my introductory speech on the Second Stage of the Bill (Official Report of 7 February 1979, Volume 311, No. 4, in particular columns 582 to 585 and 587) I referred to the matter in some detail and expressed the view that a full analysis of all the factors might very well lead to an acceptance&mdash;&mdash;meaning an acceptance by the community as a whole&mdash;&mdash;that there should be certain changes in the law that would accord greater rights to illegitimate children than is now the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, this is one of the matters being considered by the Law Reform Commission and I remain of the opinion, which was reflected in what I said in the speech I have mentioned, that it would be desirable that the Government and Parliament should have the benefit of a report from the commission before contemplating any changes in this important area.  I am strengthened in this <Col N="75" /> view by my experience in speaking to persons and groups with a special interest in these matters who may begin by advocating in principle the abolition of all distinctions between legitimacy and illegitimacy but who nevertheless, in discussion, make it clear that they would regard as quite unacceptable certain consequences that would inevitably follow from the application of such a principle.</P>

The delay in the publication of the bound volumes subsequent to 1975 is due to a number of factors, the main one being a shortage of staff in the Translation Section of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The printing of the 1976 volume, which is exceptionally bulky and will run to two volumes, is nearing completion.  Due to the delay in preparation of the 1976 volumes, the volumes for subsequent years will also be delayed.</P>

The local authority's proposals for this scheme must be considered in the context of the amount of capital available for water and sewerage schemes and the number of such schemes in progress or getting to construction at the present time.  Having regard to the priority of the scheme and the need to conserve capital available for the schemes of highest priority I cannot say at this stage when I <Col N="94" /> will be in a position to approve of Drinagh Sewerage Scheme which was estimated to cost £140,000 in July 1978.</P>

      <P>The mean concentrations of lead in the atmosphere measured at the Dame Street, Dublin air monitoring station for the four hour period 8.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. on 5, 12 and 19 November 1979 were 3.4, 6.3 and 7.7 micrograms per cubic metre respectively.  Separate readings are not available for the two-hour periods 8.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m..  When converted to a 24-hour basis the foregoing mean concentrations become 2.04, 3.78 and 4.62 micrograms per cubic metre respectively.  The annual mean concentrations at the Dame Street monitoring station in 1978-79 on a 24-hour basis was 1.86 micrograms per cubic metre which is below the 2 micrograms per cubic metre standard proposed in the EEC directive on air quality standards for lead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Electoral Act, 1963, the appropriate city or county sheriff or county registrar is the returning officer for any D·il constituency wholly situated within a county or county borough.  Where a constituency crosses a county boundary, the Minister for the Environment appoints one or other of the appropriate office-holders to be returning officer.  The last such appointments were made following the revision of constituencies in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the above provisions the returning officer for the Dublin city constituencies is the city sheriff, Mr. Michael Hayes, 37 Parliament Street, Dublin 2, the returning officer for the Dublin <Col N="96" /> county constituencies, except South County Dublin) is Mr. John Fitzpatrick, County Sheriff, 35/36 Arran Quay, Dublin 2, and the returning officer for South County Dublin, which includes a part of County Wicklow, is Mr. Philip O'Reilly, County Registrar, Circuit Court Office, Wicklow.</P>

      <P>Information in the form requested is not available in my Department. However, Table 19 of the Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics gives information on trends in house building costs and private new house prices.  The notes in the bulletin on new house prices show that the houses concerned are not necessarily comparable from one period to another.  Indeed, surveys carried out by An Foras Forbartha in 1976, and 1978, revealed a substantial improvement in the standards of privately built houses during this period.</P>

      <P>The receipt of applications in <Col N="98" /> my Department is recorded on a weekly basis.  The number of applications received for grants for solid fuel installations from the introduction of the scheme in July 1979, to the week ended 18 January 1980, was 17,981.

      <P>Samples of blood were taken during 1979 from approximately 240 persons in selected areas of Dublin city and county and in the Tynagh area of County Galway and were analysed for lead content. The surveys will be repeated after an interval of at least two years.  Results of the surveys are being processed by the Commission of the EEC as are the results of surveys carried out in other member states.</P>
      <P>Apart from those surveys, lead pollution is monitored in Waterford city and at Clondalkin, County Dublin, where there are local sources of lead.

      <P>I am not clear what situation the Deputy has in mind.  Persons in receipt of the allowances referred to are eligible for free travel.  If the question relates to persons in institutions, however, I should explain that the aim of these schemes of allowances is to provide an income for disabled persons who are living in the community and who are unable to provide for their own maintenance.  It is not, therefore, possible to make provision <Col N="129" /> under these schemes for a travel allowance for persons who do not have to meet the cost of their own maintenance.</P>
      <P>I would expect, however, that people resident in institutions who wish to go home for week-ends would receive all reasonable help from the health board.  I will have regard to this situation when reviewing the present arrangements for the care of disabled people in institutions.</P>

      <P>Payment on the dental claim of the insured person in question was authorised on 15 January 1980.</P>
      <P>The original delay in dealing with this matter arose from the employer's failure to surrender the insured person's 1977-78 social insurance card at the proper time. Subsquent delay was attributable to the postal strike, and the consequential accumulation of arrears in the Department.</P>
